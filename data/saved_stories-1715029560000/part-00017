Credit: Curiel et al., 2024.\n\nUsing the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), astronomers have explored a nearby\nbinary stellar system composed of two M dwarfs, known as LP 349\u221225AB. Results\nof the study, presented April 25 on the pre-print server arXiv, shed more\nlight on the properties of this system, suggesting that one of its components\nmay be a brown dwarf.\n\nAt a distance of only 47 light years LP 349\u221225 (also known as LSPM J0027+2219\nor 2MASS J0027559+221932) is a binary system consisting of two M dwarf of\nspectral type M8V and M9V, separated by 1.2 AU. The system has a combined mass\nof about 166 Jupiter masses, orbital period of approximately 7.7 years, and is\nestimated to be 140\u2013190 million years old.\n\nNow, a team of astronomers led by Salvador Curiel of the National Autonomous\nUniversity (UNAM) of Mexico, has performed very long baseline interferometry\n(VLBI) observations of LP 349\u221225, finding that the system is less massive and\nolder than previously thought. The observational campaign was carried out with\nVLBA between February 2020 and December 2021.\n\n\"Here, we report 5 GHz VLBA observations of the binary LP 349\u221225AB from 11\nepochs spanning 1.8 years. (...) Two epochs were observed at 4.85 GHz using\neight 32-MHz frequency bands, in dual polarization mode, with a data rate\nrecording of 2 Gbps. The remaining nine epochs were observed with four 128-MHz\nfrequency bands and the 4 Gbps recording rate,\" the researchers wrote in the\nresearch paper.\n\nThe collected VLBA data show that both components of LP 349\u221225AB are radio\nemitters, with the primary star LP 349\u221225A being the dominant radio emitter.\nIt turned out that the primary star presents a small temporal flux density\nvariation over a time span of months, while its companion does not show radio\nflux density variation. No circular polarization, nor outbursts have been\nobserved from both stars.\n\nBy combining the VLBA results with the existing optical/infrared relative\nastrometric data, Curiel's team was able to precisely determine the mass of LP\n349\u221225AB. They found that the primary component has a mass of 85.71 Jupiter\nmasses, while the mass of the secondary object is 67.11 Jupiter masses\u2014thus\nbelow the expected mass limit of hydrogen burning (about 78.5 Jupiter masses)\nand consistent with being a substellar object like a brown dwarf.\n\nFurthermore, using stellar evolutionary tracks the astronomers found that the\ncooling age of LP 349\u221225A is 262 million years, while the cooling age of LP\n349\u221225B is 198 million years. These results suggest that the primary star is\nan ultra compact dwarf (UCD) and its companion may be a brown dwarf. The\ndistance to the system was measured to be approximately 46 light years.\n\nGiven that the brown dwarf status is yet unconfirmed, the authors of the paper\nnoted that LP 349\u221225AB is currently the nearest pre-main-sequence binary\nsystem containing very low mass stars with direct mass measurements. According\nto the researchers, their study proves that precise stellar parameters of each\nstar can be obtained by using stellar evolutionary models.\n\nMore information: Salvador Curiel et al, Precise Mass, Orbital motion and\nStellar properties of the M-dwarf binary LP 349-25AB, arXiv (2024).
