This\noften-hyped technology has sometimes struggled to live up to expectations, but\nit is slowly looking more poised to revolutionize the semiconductor market.\n\nBut what makes RISC-V so exciting, and why does everyone from NVIDIA to\nMicrosoft seem to be investing in it?\n\n## What is RISC-V?\n\n### An alternative instruction set architecture\n\nRISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA). An ISA is a template for the\nset of instructions a CPU must be able to interpret and handle, as well as\nspecifications for how they should function. You can think of it as a\nprogramming language for CPUs. ISAs are important because the ISA is what\nmakes software portable from one CPU to the next - it provides guarantees that\nall the individual instructions of your software are supported and available\non the CPU, and that they function in a specific way. RISC-V (pronounced Risk-\nfive) was developed by academics at Berkeley's Parallel Computing Lab in 2010\nand is now managed by RISC-V International. The first RISC chips were in\nproduction in 2011, and since then they have received funding from everyone\nfrom Microsoft to nation states.\n\nRISC-V is not inherently faster or even better than Arm or Intel's offerings,\nbut as we'll see, that might not matter.\n\n## RISC-V is a free alternative ISA\n\n### This open standard requires no expensive licensing fees\n\nOne key commercial difference between RISC-V and other common ISAs is the fact\nthat RISC-V is an open-source license. This means that companies are free to\nuse it, and profit from it, without a need to pay licensing fees to the owners\nof the license. Those types of fees can often be significant, and get\nindirectly passed on to both consumers and businesses as part of the cost of\nmanufacturing products. It's common for Arm and Intel to also charge fees for\nmodifying their ISAs, making significant divergence even more expensive.\n\nRISC-V is helping to resolve a steep hurdle for hardware companies, since many\ncompanies may want to develop their own ISA to save on the licensing fees, but\nonly a few are operating on the scale required to have even a chance of being\nprofitable (if they can even succeed in matching standard performance and\nfeatures). This is why many big companies, including Google, Nvidia, Red Hat,\nSamsung, and even NVIDIA, are contributing significant engineering resources\nto the development and maturity of RISC-V.\n\nRelated\n\n##### RISC-V: How companies are pushing it into the future\n\nRISC-V has been everywhere recently, and for good reason\n\n### Easier hardware design is helping to fuel a custom hardware boom\n\nRISC-V is quietly enabling a divergence in custom hardware for domain-specific\napplications, by providing an easy (or at least easier) pathway for businesses\nand academics to build their own versions of hardware when off-the-shelf\noptions aren't suitable. This works in tandem with the wide range of full\nopen-source RISC-V implementations on the market. Businesses may be able to\ntake an existing open-source implementation of RISC-V (effectively a design\nfor a complete processor core, usually written in a dedicated language like\nVerilog/SystemVerilog) and make modifications to suit their specific use case.\nThis can involve dropping aspects that aren't needed, and adding pre-bundled\nsupporting elements to the core which may even be off-the-shelf elements. This\nmeans that where previously it wouldn't have been practical or affordable to\nbuild specific hardware for a feature, it's now more broadly possible.\n\nCompanies small and large are already utilizing this technology. It's\ndifficult to understand if companies are designing cores from the ground up or\nusing pre-constructed designs, but custom RISC-V silicon has already made its\nway into the market. For example, Google launched their Titan M2 security\nmodules with the Pixel 6, and we recently saw a groundbreaking RISC-V SOC\ncombining a GPU and CPU.\n\n## RISC-V is driving innovation\n\n### A lower barrier to entry makes innovation cheaper and faster\n\nGiven the licensing of RISC-V, there's nothing to stop companies from taking\nan existing open-source RISC-V design, iterating and improving on it, then\nselling it back to the market (often with a similar licensing model to Arm)\nfor a premium... and this is already happening. The accessibility of RISC-V\nallows these companies to both come in at a lower unit cost (without licensing\nfees due to Arm or Intel) focus on improving these open-source designs to\noptimize them for their specific use case. This is building a whole ecosystem\nof companies competing against each other for efficient RISC-V based chips.\nThis kind of market does exist for Arm/x86, but is crippled by the\nmodification fees and high barrier to entry imposed by licensing fees, which\nrestrict its access to the mainstream players (i.e. Qualcomm).\n\nSimilarly, as more hardware becomes available (both specialized and\ngeneralized), more developer support accrues, adding more software\navailability, support, and knowledge. This is what's known as a virtuous\ncircle, where interest, innovation, and investment amplify to create a\npositive feedback loop.\n\nThis has been achieved by lowering the barrier of entry to the market, making\nit cheaper to develop new products and ultimately usher in wider innovation.\nIf it continues, we could quickly see an accelerating pace of increasingly\ncommetetive RISC-V chips.\n\n## RISC-V is challenging monopolies\n\n### Could ARM and Intel's days at the top be numbered?\n\nSource: Intel\n\nDespite being barely a decade old, RISC-V is proving to be successful in\nchallenging the monopolies within chip manufacturing.\n\nCPU production is a complex market, with an extremely high barrier to entry\ndue to significant design, validation, and verification required before we\neven start talking about performance optimization. Engineering talent is\nexpensive and difficult to find, so many companies have been skipping custom\nhardware altogether in favor of a faster time to market and lower upfront\ncost. Fundamentally, it's this economic calculus that has driven the monopoly\nof x86 and ARM for so long; but RISC-V is changing that. By providing a\ncheaper option to bring either sold as-is custom chips to market, or products\ncontaining custom chips, companies are more likely to see economic benefits\nsooner with the lower upfront cost it enables. As more companies take up this\nopportunity, the more appealing it becomes.\n\nThis is how RISC-V is slowly and quietly changing the CPU market; not by being\nan intrinsically faster or more efficient standard than offered by ARM and\nIntel, but by driving innovation enough to allow it to compete.\n\n### RISC-V has the resources to catch up with the industry leaders\n\nThis is where the real excitement comes from with RISC-V. As the industry for\nRISC-V starts to reach that critical mass, and the research, investment, and\ninnovation continue to push it forward, the combined resources working to\ndevelop faster and more efficient RISC-V chips will far outpace that of the\nother major players in the CPU space. This is what might ultimately lead\nRISC-V to be a superior and even cheaper product, since companies won't be\ndoing all the work themselves. You might envisage a world where companies are\nable to take hyperefficient open-source designs, make small optimizations, and\nsell them back to the market at a significantly lower cost than what a private\ncompany would ever be able to achieve with a completely closed-source\nproprietary design. This is part of what makes RISC-V both important and\nexciting to the industry and our future.\n\nReaders like you help support XDA Developers.
