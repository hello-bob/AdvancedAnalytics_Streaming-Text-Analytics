It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nConduktor sponsored this post.\n\nApache Kafka is largely used in larger organizations to store and exchange\ndata, but it has a big problem: You can\u2019t easily query this data. Someone must\nalways duplicate the data to a regular database to query it. This slows data\ninnovation and forces enterprises to build pipelines where anything can\nhappen.\n\nEnabling every team member across an organization to access and utilize real-\ntime data using the solution they want is a transformative strategy that\ndrives widespread adoption and operational efficiency. This empowers not only\ndevelopers but also business analysts, data scientists and decision-makers\nbuilding a data-driven culture.\n\n## Is Kafka Just for Streaming ETL?\n\nKafka was open sourced in 2011 when massive databases and big data were king.\nSince then, we\u2019ve learned much about using this new way to move and transform\ndata while keeping it in motion.\n\nToday, Kafka is mostly used to move data reliably to a destination everyone\ncan work with. This might be a database, data warehouse or data lake users can\nquery (such as PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch or Snowflake) and the\nanalytics team can work with and that can be used to build dashboards and\nmachine learning models. Kafka is often used only for its real-time\ncapabilities and does not contain historical data \u2014 default data retention in\nKafka is just a few days, after which the data is automatically deleted.\n\nKafka is combined with stream processing technologies like Kafka Streams,\nApache Spark or Apache Flink to do transformations, filter the data, enrich it\nwith users\u2019 data and maybe do some joins between various sources. Kafka is\ngreat for building streaming extract, transform and load (ETL), which\ncaptures, transforms and loads data to another place in real-time, in contrast\nto traditional batch processing, which is defined on a scheduled basis (every\nX minutes).\n\nConduktor is on a mission to transform how businesses interact with real-time\ndata. Our software, built for organizations using Apache Kafka, equips\nplatform teams with tooling to enforce standards and rules, instrument Kafka\napplications, and give ownership and autonomy to developers.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe latest from Conduktor\n\nConduktor 2.0: The new standard for teams working with Kafka\n\n11 April 2024\n\nSharing Real-Time Data with Your Partners\n\n3 April 2024\n\nKafka Summit London 2024: Feedback from our booth\n\n29 March 2024\n\nAll looks good, but Kafka has a big drawback: It does not make data\naccessible.\n\n## Kafka Is Not Very Good for Querying\n\nApache Kafka is often the place where all the data in an organization is\ncreated before being moved into other applications. Then all the applications\ncommunicate and produce data through Kafka. But somehow, this data is barely\naccessible to non-developers including data scientists, analysts and product\nowners.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. Query Apache Kafka with SQL\n  2. Using SQL-Powered RAG to Better Analyze Database Data with GenAI\n  3. From Postgres to ScyllaDB NoSQL, with a 349x Speed Boost\n  4. How to Get Peak Performance without a Vast Amount of Memory\n  5. Top 5 Vector Database Solutions for Your AI Project\n\nExploring and working with data is not even straightforward for developers\nbecause there is no simple language like SQL for talking about data with\nKafka. You often need external tooling like Conduktor or advanced command line\ntooling in your terminal to look at and analyze the data \u2014 but that can only\ngo so far.\n\nNot everyone in an organization is tech-savvy, and organizations want to\nprovide a consistent experience for everyone to communicate equally. For\nexample, they want the entire team, no matter how comfortable they are with\ntech, to be able to work on a new project without having to learn complex new\ntools.\n\nIn the Kafka space, organizations depend upon data engineering teams to build\nthe necessary pipelines and ETL to make data accessible. These teams also use\nchange data capture (CDC) tools like Debezium to move the data outside of\nKafka, which dilutes data ownership, security and responsibilities.\n\n## But Apache Kafka Is Not a Database... Is It?\n\nAs Martin Kleppmann discussed in his talk \u201cIs Kafka a Database?\u201d at Kafka\nSummit SF 2018: Kafka can achieve all of the atomicity, consistency, isolation\nand durability (ACID) requirements of a database by building stream\nprocessors. Kafka also has full support for exactly-once transactions, and\nApache\u2019s KIP-939 proposal is emerging to support the two-phase commit (2PC)\nprotocol to do distributed transactions with other databases.\n\nInterestingly enough, Kleppman concluded that there are \u201cno ad-hoc queries,\nfor sure,\u201d and you must move your data to a real database for such matters.\nSix years later, this is the one caveat still present and slowing down\neveryone who wants to work with Kafka.\n\n## Dealing with the Data Mess\n\nOrganizations have tons of data in Kafka and databases. The quality of the\ndata varies. The rules are not the same everywhere. Nobody has the same view\nof everything. It\u2019s difficult to know what data is where or where the source\nof truth is. It\u2019s what we call a data mess.\n\nThe duplication of data from Kafka to databases adds a thick layer of\ncomplexity. Because of fundamentally different security models, the ownership\nand security of the data become brittle and possibly inconsistent. Kafka has\nits way of protecting data, and databases have another way. This security\nmismatch is hard to fix, and if you add requirements such as data masking or\nfield-level encryption, it\u2019s almost impossible.\n\nThis is how data leaks happen. For example, in March a breach of the French\ngovernment exposed up to 43 million people\u2019s data. These incidents underpin a\nclear deficiency in skills, consistency and maturity in the ecosystem.\n\nThe rapid multiplication of data products aggravates the fragmentation of the\ndata landscape within organizations. This proliferation creates data silos,\neach operating in isolation, diluting the potential for a unified data\nstrategy. The ad-hoc development of data pipelines, built outside of a\ncohesive governance framework, leaves organizations vulnerable to inaccuracies\nand inconsistencies.\n\n## Is SQL the End Game?\n\nSQL is a very well-known and popular programming language, ranking 6th on the\nTIOBE Index and used by 40% of developers globally \u2014 with a notable 78% of\nthem frequently utilizing SQL in their work.\n\nWhen we talk about SQL, we have to talk about PostgreSQL. It has emerged as\nthe leading database protocol, and every vendor involved in data wants to be\ncompatible with it. Tools like Grafana, Metabase, Tableau, DBeaver and Apache\nSuperset can all connect to services offering a PostgreSQL-compatible\nendpoint. Having a Kafka platform providing such an endpoint for any topic\nenables using these tools for data visualization and straightforward\nintrospection.\n\nSQL offers a solid foundation for building a unified data ecosystem, with\nKafka serving as the single source of truth at its core. PostgreSQL stands out\nfor its broad compatibility and ease of getting started thanks to many\naccessible vendors. Its open source nature, seamless integration with\ndevelopment environments and straightforward setup and management make it a\npreferred database choice for scalability, versatility, flexibility and\nrobustness.\n\nBy modernizing Kafka to incorporate SQL capabilities, we can significantly\nreduce the need for data pipelines and replication. It will also lead to\noverall efficiency, cost efficiency, simpler governance and fewer security\nfailures.\n\nThis would also integrate data engineers directly into product teams, rather\nthan keeping them isolated in their own silos with their own data road maps,\nstrengthening collaboration between developers and analytics teams.\n\n## Going Further with AI and Machine Learning (ML)\n\nSQL is perfect for ad-hoc analysis, dashboarding or building data pipelines.\nBut it\u2019s not the best at handling the massive volumes of data required for\ndata science and AI/ML. This is where technologies like Apache Parquet and\nApache Iceberg shine.\n\nThey provide columnar-based systems and pushdown filter optimizations that\nefficiently query large quantities of data. Many data scientists love them\nbecause they can be queried with their tools, such as Apache Spark, Pandas,\nDask and Trino. This improves data accessibility and simplifies how to build\nAI/ML applications.\n\nAs we shared in our review of Kafka Summit London 2024, Kafka\u2019s ability to\nserve as the single source of truth \u2014 as organizations seek to expose data in\nKafka across multiple formats \u2014 is becoming a reality. Confluent has announced\nTableFlow, which seamlessly materializes Apache Kafka topics as Apache Iceberg\ntables without having to build and maintain data pipelines.\n\n## Paving the Way to Liberate Data\n\nConduktor and Kafka, with capabilities to support real-time data needs, cater\nto online analytical processing (OLAP) and business requirements using SQL.\nThey also fulfill AI/ML demands with file formats such as Parquet and Iceberg.\nIn these ways, they are paving the way for a future where data is truly\naccessible and optimized for various consumption preferences. Building true\ndata products and eliminating the need for technical duplication across\ndifferent data stores will lead to a more efficient and secure data ecosystem.\n\nIf you want to liberate your data and make it more accessible in your\norganization while removing governance and security frictions, book a\nConduktor demo.\n\nStephane Derosiaux is the co-founder and CTO of Conduktor.
