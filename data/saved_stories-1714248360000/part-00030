First, my\niPhone wanted me to enter the password again, which I thought was the \u201cnormal\u201d\nthing it has done every few months, almost since I got it. But after doing so\nit said that my account was locked.\n\nUnlocking the account would require a 1-hour Security Delay, it said, because\nI had Stolen Device Protection enabled, and I was not at one of my familiar\nlocations. I was at home. But I went to Settings \u2023 Privacy & Security \u2023\nLocation Services \u2023 System Services \u2023 Significant Locations to check, and for\nsome reason the only location in the list was the grocery store that I go to\nonce every two weeks. It didn\u2019t figure out the location of the home/office\nwhere the phone spends nearly all its time and which is identified as Home in\nApple Maps, Contacts, and Find My.\n\nSo I went to my Mac, where there was no delay to unlock the account. However,\nunlocking didn\u2019t work. It had me enter the password, texted a code to my\nphone, and then wanted me to enter the password again, but the sheet was\nbroken. I typed the password and clicked Sign In, and the button stayed grayed\nout, showed a spinner, and then stopped, but it neither accepted the password\nnor showed an error. It just got stuck with Sign In disabled. Isn\u2019t the new\nSystem Settings great?\n\n(Several of the other Apple ID\u2013related sheets have odd layouts and non-\nstandard behavior. If I were not already familiar with this being the\nunfortunate status quo, I might worry whether they were fake UI trying to\nphish me.)\n\n(The iPhone version of System Settings also got stuck in a weird state, where\nthe Apple ID Suggestions screen was showing a spinner and a Continue button\nthat didn\u2019t work. And the whole app was inset with a black border around it. I\nhad to force-quit it. And then it got stuck again the same way.)\n\nThe only thing to do was to click Cancel to get out of the sheet. Both of my\ndevices kept popping up alerts about signing in to my Apple ID, and I still\ndidn\u2019t want to wait an hour, so I quit System Settings and relaunched it. I\nfollowed the exact same procedure as before to unlock my account, but this\ntime it let me do so using my Mac\u2019s password instead of sending a code to the\niPhone. And this time the final sheet asking for my Apple ID password worked.\n\nThe good news is that the phone automatically unlocked and made the Apple ID\nservices available again. I didn\u2019t have to enter the new password there.\n\nThe bad news is that I had to choose another new password for this account.\nAnd everything about this process made me feel less secure. If Stolen Device\nProtection doesn\u2019t work properly, is it going to cause me real trouble\nsometime? Maybe I should just turn it off. Is there any way I can run my\ndevices without them relying on my Apple ID? Alas, I don\u2019t think so.\n\n(I have another Apple ID that I use on my test Macs, and for some reason it\nneeds to be unlocked every time I use it to sign in to a new installation.\nI\u2019ve never been asked to reset its password, though.)\n\nPreviously:\n\n  * Stolen Device Protection in iOS 17.3\n  * Secondary Apple ID Mess and Inadvertent Password Reset\n  * System Settings\n\nUpdate (2024-04-26): Dave Wood:\n\n> WTF #Apple.

That process is\npretty sketchy feeling, and I'm at home, with all my devices at hand.\n\nVerticalBlank\n\nApril 26, 2024 9:52 PM\n\nThis is why I have my AppleID protected by a YubiKey (well three of them\nactually).\n\nG\n\nApril 26, 2024 9:53 PM\n\nSame thing happened to me tonight. Just a terrible and confusing experience.\n\nJJ\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:18 PM\n\nSame thing for me. I\u2019m turning off Stolen Device Protection. What a disaster\nif this happens while traveling or anywhere but home\n\nMarc\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:25 PM\n\nSame things here, and it also wiped out my application specific passwords\nwhich caused problems with several apps.\n\nHad to create new passwords for each of them.\n\nTook a while to get everything reconfigured and synched on my MacBook Pro and\niPhone.\n\nNeil\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:42 PM\n\nI have been plagued with this for months. My iCloud account locks every 1-2\ndays and I have to unlock it. Sometimes I can unlock it without a password,\nother times I need to change it. I\u2019ve phone Apple support and they\u2019ve been\nmostly unhelpful.\n\nAndrew\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:44 PM\n\nThe EXACT same thing just happened to me. Was convinced someone was trying to\nhack me, and it didn't seem like I was going to be able to get back into my\naccount.\n\nApple seriously needs to get this sorted - It's discouraging me from ever\ntrusting them again.\n\nAnonymous\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:48 PM\n\nI have the security delay set for \"always\" instead of at familiar locations.\nIs there a reason an hour delay is infeasible? Its not like your data is gone\nfor an hour, it just cant sync, right? That seems better than a stolen phone\nand account...\n\nMichael Tsai\n\nApril 26, 2024 10:57 PM\n\n@Anonymous In theory, it should be usable, though semi-offline, for that hour,\nbut it\u2019s really annoying to have it keep popping up alerts asking me to log\nin, and I have low confidence that the system and apps are well tested in that\nstate. Also, the brokenness makes me worried that there are other problems\nwith this feature. Like maybe it will escalate to a longer delay than what\nit\u2019s supposed to or require another device to unlock. The feature sounds good,\nbut I no longer trust it and would prefer something simpler and more reliable.\nI\u2019m careful about entering my passcode in public.\n\nKevin Schumacher\n\nApril 26, 2024 11:13 PM\n\nEarlier tonight it popped up on all three devices I was actively using (Watch,\nTV, iPhone) and demanded my Apple ID password be reentered in Settings. I just\ntapped Not Now until it went away, which took 5 or 6 taps, then it would go\naway for 5 or 10 minutes and come back. It did that for three or four cycles\nand then stopped entirely. I just assume that something failed to renew a\ntoken due to a server being down or glitching. I\u2019ve seen it do this a few\ntimes in the past and it usually clears itself up.\n\nI don\u2019t have the security delay enabled, FWIW.\n\nDavid J. Whelan\n\nApril 26, 2024 11:25 PM\n\nSo happy (and unhappy) that I read this today, a couple of hours after the\nsame thing happened to me. I did a Messages chat with Apple Support to resolve\nthis, which eventually involved resetting my iCloud password and now\nreconnecting on all of my personal devices. And our Apple TVs. And probably\nsomething else. So annoying. But sort of glad I am not alone.\n\nAnonymous\n\nApril 26, 2024 11:29 PM\n\nI had the same thing happen on April 4th with an account only used with one\ncomputer. I was able to unlock it without any problems and changed the\npassword. A couple days later I kept getting a dialog telling me that it\ncouldn't log into iMessage because of a problem with the account, which was\nweird since I've never used iMessage with this account/computer. A Google\nsearch suggested an error, and restarting the computer made it stop.\n\nConcerned, I tried to look for account activity, but couldn't find it\nanywhere. (This might be because I've turned off most analytics and logging\nthough.) A search suggests that there isn't one beyond a list of devices\nassociated with the account. I requested a download of my Apple ID data, but\nit didn't show anything useful. Both Google and Microsoft will show account\nactivity, and Microsoft will even show unsuccessful login attempts.\n\nI'm a bit relieved that I'm not the only one this has happened to, but now I'm\nwondering if something is happening at Apple. A failure or intrusion?\n\nMarc\n\nApril 26, 2024 11:32 PM\n\nMore reports:\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-\npassword/\n\nKim\n\nApril 26, 2024 11:49 PM\n\nThis is driving me crazy, can you please layout how to do it without having to\nuse your phone number? It\u2019s not recognizing it, my Mac.com account stopped\ngetting emails at 4:10pm this afternoon. I get to the part about having to\nunlock my account by verifying and changing my password, but here comes the\nphone number option and it\u2019s not working. This includes doing it on the web.\nMy devices aren\u2019t recognizing each other- ugh this sucks\n\nSebby\n\nApril 27, 2024 12:05 AM\n\nOh thank goodness it wasn't just me, was drifting to sleep when I got the\nnotification, thought I'd been hacked. Essentially the same symptoms as\nMichael except I was also asked to find another device (iMac, in other room)\nto unlock, which was showing both a system dialog saying that FaceTime needed\nme to sign in again and the notification for my account being locked, which\njust took me to the iCloud pane, security section, to change my password,\nwhich I had no choice but to do, after backing out of that broken password\nverification sheet, but at least I'd bypassed the stupid stolen device\nprotection delay, which I will probably still not turn off. All very shitty,\nand I'm now very, very, very glad that my passwords are all locally stored in\nStrongbox, the vault on my NAS, accessible through a VPN under my control with\nno Apple bits involved. I checked my iCloud Drive for any text files, made\nsure none of them were absolutely critical to authentication, also discovering\nthat my app-specific passwords no longer worked (FFS!) and that my AirPods\npairing keys had been zapped, even when I restarted everything, and even\nthough they showed up fine in Bluetooth settings and could still be manually\nconnected. Took the opportunity to look through and correct all my passwords\nto ensure everything was accounted for including my new Apple ID password,\nwhich in fairness benefited from a change after many years and probably woke\nme up to do a task that I would have otherwise put off, found during this\nprocess that Strongbox, though not perfect, really is the right choice for me;\nhighly recommend. So all in all just a really great way to be woken back up,\nnot. Now having some tea, listening to an audiobook, and ranting on the\nInternet. Thank you Apple, your momumental incompetence is truly unmatched.\nHave one of these Apple stickers.\n\nSebby\n\nApril 27, 2024 1:52 AM\n\nPro tip: most of the app-specific passwords were actually former SMTP\ncredentials, now obsoleted by having a single OpenSMTPD relay set up on the\nnetwork. So set up a relay, tell all your apps to use that, make sure the one\npassword is correct in the relay configuration. Bonus: errors are even\nreported when you are offline (you won't get them till you're back online and\nyour SMTP server has relayed them to their final destination where you'll pick\nthem up and read them, unless of course you are running a local mail server).\n\nKirk\n\nApril 27, 2024 3:17 AM\n\nThis just happened to me when I got up Saturday morning in the UK. After\nresetting my Apple ID password on my phone, I have to do it on my watch, my\niPad mini, my iPad Pro, my iMac, my MacBook Air, my Mac mini, my Apple TV...\ni\u2019m not sure if I also have to do it individually on my five HomePods \u2013 four\nof them in two stereo pairs, which might mean just one password reset per\npair. Not to mention apps specific passwords for a couple of apps I use. Thank\nyou Apple for making me waste an hour or two on Saturday morning.\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\n\u2190\n\nBlog Archives Tag Cloud Top Posts\n\nRecently Updated RSS Feed \u00b7 Comments Mastodon \u00b7 Twitter Apple News\n\nSupport this site via Patreon.\n\nTry my Mac apps:\n\nDropDMG EagleFiler SpamSieve ToothFairy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000\u20132024 Michael Tsai.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
