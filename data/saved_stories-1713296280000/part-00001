But the James Webb Telescope's\nsearch for its origins has only thrown up more questions.\n\nAn artist's illustration of a gamma ray burst. (Image credit: NASA/Swift/Cruz\ndeWilde)\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has discovered the cause of the most powerful\ncosmic explosion since the Big Bang.\n\nThe explosion (nicknamed the BOAT or \"brightest of all time\") is a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) that spat photons at Earth with more energy than those found\ninside the Large Hadron Collider. This light was detected by telescopes in\norbit and on the ground on October 9, 2022, and came from 2.4 billion light-\nyears away in the constellation Sagitta.\n\nNow, a team of scientists have tracked down BOAT's likely origins to a\ngigantic supernova that came after the collapse of a giant star.\n\nYet their research reveals a new mystery \u2014 supernovas such as the one behind\nthe BOAT are supposed to be cosmic factories for heavy elements such as\nplatinum and gold, but when the researchers looked, they found no evidence for\nthem. The scientists published their findings April 12 in the journal Nature\nAstronomy.\n\n\"When we confirmed that the GRB was generated by the collapse of a massive\nstar, that gave us the opportunity to test a hypothesis for how some of the\nheaviest elements in the universe are formed,\" lead study author Peter\nBlanchard, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, said in a statement.\n\"We did not see signatures of these heavy elements, suggesting that extremely\nenergetic GRBs like the BOAT do not produce these elements.\n\n\u201cThat doesn't mean that all GRBs do not produce them,\u201d Blanchard added, \u201cbut\nit's a key piece of information as we continue to understand where these heavy\nelements come from.\"\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope confirms there is something seriously wrong with\nour understanding of the universe\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nWhen a massive star runs out of fuel, it collapses before exploding outward in\na gigantic supernova explosion, leaving behind an ultra-dense neutron star or\na black hole. It is these stellar explosions \u2014 and occasionally even\ncollisions between two neutron stars \u2014 that produce powerful bursts of gamma\nrays that can be picked up by observatories in space and even on Earth.\n\nHow the Swift observatory saw the gamma-ray burst GRB221009A, which may be the\nmost energetic emission of this kind ever seen by astronomers. (Image credit:\nNASA/Swift/A. Beardmore (University of Leicester))\n\nThe first gamma-ray bursts were detected accidentally by US military\nsatellites in the 1960s. Since then, they have continued to ping up on\nequipment that is able to detect their high-energy light. But when the BOAT\nappeared, it was at least 10 times brighter than any other cosmic explosion\never witnessed.\n\n\"The event produced some of the highest-energy photons ever recorded by\nsatellites designed to detect gamma rays,\" Blanchard said. \"This was an event\nthat Earth sees only once every 10,000 years.\u201d\n\nThe burst was so bright, in fact, that the astronomers had to wait six months\nfor it to die down before they could use the James Webb Space Telescope to\nlook at it directly.\n\n\"The GRB was so bright that it obscured any potential supernova signature in\nthe first weeks and months after the burst,\" Blanchard said. \"At these times,\nthe so-called afterglow of the GRB was like the headlights of a car coming\nstraight at you, preventing you from seeing the car itself. So, we had to wait\nfor it to fade significantly to give us a chance of seeing the supernova.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014'It could be profound': How astronomer Wendy Freedman is trying to fix the\nuniverse\n\n\u2014James Webb telescope discovers oldest black hole in the universe\n\n\u20148 stunning James Webb Space Telescope discoveries made in 2023\n\nAfter pointing the JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument\ntowards the source of the explosion, the researchers found signatures of\nelements such as oxygen and calcium, which are commonly found within\nsupernovas. But they didn't find any elements heavier than iron among the\ndebris, potentially ruling out bright explosions such as the BOAT as heavy\nmetal producers.\n\nAnd surprisingly, despite the extreme brightness of the gamma-ray burst, the\nsupernova it came from was of fairly average brightness. It's possible,\naccording to the researchers, that the BOAT acquired its extraordinary\nintensity from the exploding star's material being funneled along an unusually\nnarrow relativistic jet \u2014 a near-light-speed stream of charged matter.\n\n\"It's like focusing a flashlight's beam into a narrow column, as opposed to a\nbroad beam that washes across a whole wall,\" co-author Tanmoy Laskar, an\nassistant professor of physics at the University of Utah, said in the\nstatement. \"In fact, this was one of the narrowest jets seen for a gamma-ray\nburst so far, which gives us a hint as to why the afterglow appeared as bright\nas it did. There may be other factors responsible as well, a question that\nresearchers will be studying for years to come.\"\n\nThe researchers say their next steps will be to use the JWST to look at other\nsupernovas. Contrasting their different brightnesses, jets, chemical elements\nand host galaxy characteristics could help them figure out just how unusual\nthe BOAT was, and the conditions under which the universe's heavy elements are\nmade.\n\nBen Turner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.

My understanding thus far is that the heavier metals are\nproduced from the collision of two heavy objects with high energy, such as the\nimpact of two neuron stars. I recall that was witnessed as producing gold in\nat least one observation.\n\nUnless the supernova occurs in a star with so much mass that when it\ncollapses, the energy of the collapse is commensurate to the high velocity\nimpact of two neutron stars, then I could see it being limited to only\nreleasing the elements up to iron that were already contained within the star.\n\nPerhaps the reason it was so bright is that the energy required to produce\nthose heavier elements instead was released as EM spectra. You can't have\nboth, so to speak, because the finite energy can only do work (produce heavier\nelements) or be released (shine brightly).\n\nReply\n\n  * Hickory\n\nNASA should be moved to the Department of Defense and only projects of direct\nbenefit to the military should be funded. Any other \u201cexploration\u201d or science\nprojects should be pursued by companies funded solely by the private donations\nof hobbyists or other interested parties.\n\nReply\n\n  * TGor26\n\nOmitting the word \"theory\" after Big Bang, does not negate the reality that it\nis still, in fact, just a theory and NOT fact. I know science exists, but so\ndoes God and He created all these things humans call science. And if people\nchoose not to believe that fact, that's o.k. too, but at least remember not to\npush the \"theory\" as fact also, since it can't be proven, nor has it been\nproven in all these years either.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nSpace photo of the week: NASA spots enormous pink 'flames' during total solar\neclipse.
