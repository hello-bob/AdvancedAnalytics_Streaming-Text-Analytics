The sit-in, organized by the\nactivist group No Tech for Apartheid, is happening at Google Cloud CEO Thomas\nKurian's office in Sunnyvale and the 10th floor commons of Google's New York\noffice. The sit-in will be accompanied by outdoor protests at Google offices\nin New York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and Seattle beginning at 2 pm ET and 11\nam PT. Tuesday's actions mark an escalation in a series of recent protests\norganized by tech workers who oppose their employer's relationship with the\nIsraeli government, especially in light of Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza.\nSince Hamas killed about 1,100 Israelis on October 7, the IDF has killed more\nthan 34,000 Palestinians.\n\nJust over a dozen people gathered outside Google's offices in New York and\nSunnyvale on Tuesday. Among those in New York was Google cloud software\nengineer Eddie Hatfield, who was fired days after disrupting Google Israel's\nmanaging director at March's Mind The Tech, a company-sponsored conference\nfocused on the Israeli tech industry, in early March. Several hours into the\nsit-ins on Tuesday, Google security began to accuse the workers of\n\"trespassing\" and disrupting work, prompting several people to leave while\nothers vowed to remain until they were forced out. The 2021 contract, known as\nProject Nimbus, involves Google and Amazon jointly providing cloud computing\ninfrastructure and services across branches of the Israeli government. Last\nweek, Time reported that Google's work on Project Nimbus involves providing\ndirect services to the Israel Defense Forces. [...]\n\nOn March 4, more than600 other Googlers signed a petition opposing the\ncompany's sponsorship of the conference. After Hatfield was fired three days\nlater, Google trust-and-safety-policy employee Vidana Abdel Khalek resigned\nfrom her position in opposition to Project Nimbus. Then, in late March, more\nthan 300 Apple workers signed an open letter that alleged retaliation against\nworkers who have expressed support for Palestinians, and urged company\nleadership to show public support for Palestinians. Hasan Ibraheem, a Google\nsoftware engineer, is participating in the sit-in at his local Google office\nin New York. \"This has really been a culmination of our efforts,\" he tells\nWIRED. Since joining No Tech for Apartheid in December, Ibraheem says, he has\nbeen participating in weekly \"tabling\" actions being held at Google office\ncafes in New York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California. It\ninvolves holding a sign that says \"Ask me about Project Nimbus\" during lunch\nbreak, passing out flyers, and answering questions from coworkers. \"It's\nactually shocking how many people at Google don't even know that this contract\nexists,\" Ibraheem says. \"A lot of people who don't know about it, who then\nlearn about it through us, are reasonably upset that this contract exists.\nThey just didn't know that it existed beforehand.\"\n\n### \u2190\n\n### You may like to read:\n\n### \u2192\n\nState Tax Officials Are Using AI To Go After Wealthy Payers\n\n## Men Overran a Job Fair For Women In Tech\n\n## How Electric Cars are Already Upending America\n\n## Internet Access in Gaza is Collapsing as ISPs Fall Offline\n\n## Conservatives Bombarded With Facebook Misinformation Far More Than Liberals\nIn 2020 Election, Study Suggests\n\n## Reactions Continue to Viral Video that Led to Calls for College Presidents\nto Resign\n\n### Submission: Google Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government\n\nNASA Confirms That Debris From ISS Crashed Into Florida Home\n\n#### Google Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government 61 More | Reply Login\n\n## Google Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government\n\nComments Filter:\n\n  * All\n  * Insightful\n  * Informative\n  * Interesting\n  * Funny\n\nThe Fine Print: The following comments are owned by whoever posted them.
