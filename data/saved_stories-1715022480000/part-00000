By training the immune\nsystem to attack these regions, it gives protection against other\ncoronaviruses not represented in the vaccine \u2013 including ones that haven\u2019t\neven been identified yet.\n\nFor example, the new vaccine does not include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus,\nwhich caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, yet it still induces an immune response\nto that virus.\n\n\u201cOur focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next\ncoronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\u201d\nsaid Rory Hills, a graduate researcher in the University of Cambridge\u2019s\nDepartment of Pharmacology and first author of the report.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a vaccine that provides protection against a broad\nrange of different coronaviruses \u2013 including ones we don\u2019t even know about\nyet.\u201d\n\nThe results are published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about\ncoronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going\nwith building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\u201d said\nProfessor Mark Howarth in the University of Cambridge\u2019s Department of\nPharmacology, senior author of the report.\n\nHe added: \u201cScientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely\neffective COVID vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a\nmassive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do\neven better than that in the future, and a powerful component of that is\nstarting to build the vaccines in advance.\u201d\n\nThe new \u2018Quartet Nanocage\u2019 vaccine is based on a structure called a\nnanoparticle \u2013 a ball of proteins held together by incredibly strong\ninteractions. Chains of different viral antigens are attached to this\nnanoparticle using a novel \u2018protein superglue\u2019. Multiple antigens are included\nin these chains, which trains the immune system to target specific regions\nshared across a broad range of coronaviruses.\n\nThis study demonstrated that the new vaccine raises a broad immune response,\neven in mice that were pre-immunised with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe new vaccine is much simpler in design than other broadly protective\nvaccines currently in development, which the researchers say should accelerate\nits route into clinical trials.\n\nThe underlying technology they have developed also has potential for use in\nvaccine development to protect against many other health challenges.\n\nThe work involved a collaboration between scientists at the University of\nCambridge, the University of Oxford, and Caltech. It improves on previous\nwork, by the Oxford and Caltech groups, to develop a novel all-in-one vaccine\nagainst coronavirus threats. The vaccine developed by Oxford and Caltech\nshould enter Phase 1 clinical trials in early 2025, but its complex nature\nmakes it challenging to manufacture which could limit large-scale production.\n\nConventional vaccines include a single antigen to train the immune system to\ntarget a single specific virus. This may not protect against a diverse range\nof existing coronaviruses, or against pathogens that are newly emerging.\n\nThe research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research\nCouncil.\n\nReference: Hills, R.A. et al: \u2018Proactive vaccination using multiviral Quartet\nNanocages to elicit broad anti-coronavirus responses.\u2019 Nature Nanotechnology,\nMay 2024.
