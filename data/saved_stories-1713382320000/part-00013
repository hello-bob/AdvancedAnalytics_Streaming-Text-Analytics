Just a few years ago, as the state spent tens of\nmillions of dollars on a planned network of fueling stations dubbed \"the\nhydrogen highway,\u201d Nichols was extolling the 480-kilometer range and quick\nrefueling time of her own hydrogen ride, a futuristic Toyota Mirai.\n\nToday, though, Nichols drives a battery-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. It too\noffers 480 km of range. \"I would have no problem driving a hydrogen car again\nbut I don\u2019t know that I would feel like I had to,\u201d says Nichols, who served\nmultiple terms as chair of the California Air Resources Board before stepping\ndown in 2020. \"Right now, I don\u2019t think it would be a good bet to assume that\nthere\u2019s going to be a big shift to hydrogen vehicles except for heavy-duty\ntrucks, where being able to move a lot of weight is important.\u201d\n\nDespite billions of dollars of investment, fuel cell cars in the U.S. are\ndisappearing in the rearview mirror, overtaken by battery-electric models and\nstalled by hydrogen shortages and soaring fuel prices. Last year, drivers\nbought just 3,143 hydrogen cars in California \u2014 the only state that sells them\n\u2014 compared with 380,000 BEVs.\n\nHydrogen\u2019s proponents aren\u2019t throwing in the towel. Toyota and Hyundai are\npushing fuel cell models, albeit at heavy discounts, and Honda just announced\na hydrogen hybrid version of its best-selling CR-V. California continues to\nbuild new infrastructure. But for drivers and would-be car buyers, the\npractical experience of going hydrogen-electric is bad and getting worse.\n\n\"It\u2019s clear what technology has won in the marketplace,\u201d says David Reichmuth,\na senior engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 clean transportation\nprogram. \"If we want to go as fast as possible to decarbonize, then the plug-\nin electric vehicle is clearly the technology with the infrastructure\navailable to do that now.\u201d\n\nFuel cells work by converting compressed hydrogen gas in an onboard tank into\nelectricity that powers the vehicle\u2019s motor. Carmakers started developing them\nin the 1990s after California passed a zero-emissions vehicle mandate to fight\nsmog. Those efforts accelerated in the wake of the state\u2019s landmark 2006\nclimate law, which ordered a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle. Sky-high fuel prices are discouraging even hardcore hydrogen enthusiasts from driving such vehicles. | Bloomberg\n\nThe first hydrogen car efforts were bespoke \u2014 in 2006, this writer drove a\nprototype of a hand-built Mercedes fuel cell car that cost $1 million. Then in\n2013, California enacted legislation allocating $20 million a year to finance\n100 hydrogen stations. Soon Honda, Hyundai and Toyota started selling or\nleasing hydrogen cars in the only state that offered the ability to fuel them.\n\nIn 2018, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown set a target of 200 hydrogen\nstations by 2025, a goal to which the state has committed nearly $257 million.\nBut last year Shell quietly declined a $41 million state grant to build 50\nstations, and California scaled back its target to 130 stations by 2027. In\nFebruary, Shell shuttered six of its seven retail hydrogen stations in the\nstate. A total of 66 stations remain, but 12 have been offline for more than\n30 days and others sporadically shut down due to supply shortages or equipment\nproblems.\n\nBy contrast, California boasts just over 105,000 charging stations for plug-in\nvehicles. Battery-electric models accounted for 21% of new car sales in the\nstate last year and Tesla\u2019s Model Y and Model 3 were California\u2019s top two\nbest-selling vehicles.\n\nEven for functional hydrogen fuel stations, downtime is routine. On April 2,\nfor instance, 16 of the state\u2019s 54 stations in operation were closed,\naccording to real-time data from the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Partnership. Southern\nCalifornia, hit particularly hard by the Shell closures, sees about half of\nits stations go offline on any given day.\n\nIn Northern California, drivers in affluent Marin County rely on a single fuel\nstation, which on one afternoon in late March had only enough hydrogen to fill\nup a few cars. (Three days later, it went offline due to \"mechanical issues.\u201d)\nOn the other side of San Francisco Bay, Shell\u2019s exit cost Berkeley, where fuel\ncell car sightings aren\u2019t uncommon, its sole open station.\n\nAcross the state, the closures and downtime are leaving drivers scrambling to\nfind fuel. On Reddit, one Mirai owner posted that their car had been towed\ntwice recently after running out of fuel, as every hydrogen station within 40\nkm had gone offline. A Sacramento-area tow truck driver chimed in that they\ntow several marooned hydrogen cars a month to the only fueling station still\nopen in the state capital region.\n\nComplaints about fuel prices are just as common. Filling up a Mirai, a Hyundai\nNexo or a Honda FCX Clarity runs a California driver about $200 \u2014 the\nequivalent of paying $14.60 for a gallon of gas.\n\n\"The car is AMAZING but the fueling infrastructure and cost of hydrogen per\nmile is TERRIBLE,\u201d wrote one Mirai owner on Facebook. On Reddit, a hydrogen\nfuel cell car owner in Southern California vented that, \"The cost is the\nequivalent of driving a monster truck that gets 9 mpg.\u201d\n\nThe engine of a Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. Fuel cells work by converting compressed hydrogen gas in an onboard tank into electricity that powers the vehicle\u2019s motor. | Bloomberg\n\nThe sky-high fuel prices are discouraging even hardcore hydrogen enthusiasts\nlike Tina Imahara. A documentary film editor in Southern California, Imahara\nbought her first fuel cell car, a 2017 Mirai, after working on environment-\nthemed movies. \"The car itself is incredible,\u201d she says. \"I lived 84 miles\n(134 km) from my closest station when I first got my first one, so I really\nhad to plan. There were some close calls when I was running on fumes.\u201d\n\nBy the time Imahara upgraded to a 2021 Mirai \u2014 which came with a $15,000 fuel\ncard \u2014 the number of stations had grown and she now lives close to one. But as\nhydrogen fuel prices soared last year, she reluctantly traded the Mirai for a\nbattery-electric Toyota bZ4X SUV.\n\n\"We went right through our card,\u201d she says. \"Hydrogen was double the price of\ngas and we weren\u2019t going to go back to gas.\u201d\n\nJust a decade ago, hydrogen cars\u2019 future looked brighter. In 2014, this writer\nvisited Honda\u2019s North America headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb of\nTorrance to drive the carmaker\u2019s 2013 FCX Clarity. The sedan could travel 384\nkm on a tank of H2, an impressive distance for an EV at a time when most\nbattery-electric models had 128 km of range. This writer stopped by a Shell\nhydrogen station near Honda\u2019s corporate campus, where it took only a few\nminutes to fill the Clarity\u2019s tank. It seemed like a game-changer.\n\nWhen this writer returned to Torrance last month, the game had indeed changed:\nHonda discontinued the Clarity in 2021. This writer was there for a preview of\nthe 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV, a battery-electric hydrogen hybrid version of the\ncompany\u2019s CR-V compact SUV. The e:FCEV has a range of 432 km and can run on\nbattery power, mitigating the volatility of the hydrogen market and the\nunreliability of fueling stations. Honda\u2019s pitch is essentially: Do most of\nyour daily driving on battery power, charge at home, and save trips to a\nhydrogen station for longer journeys.\n\nHonda has sold nearly 6 million internal-combustion CR-Vs in the U.S., and the\ne:FCEV this writer drove around LA wouldn\u2019t look out of place in any suburban\ndriveway. The ride is as quiet and smooth as EV drivers have come to expect.\nBut the specs are nothing special: The Uber this writer took from the airport,\na Tesla Model 3, had more than 480 km of range. Honda anticipates leasing just\n300 hydrogen CR-V\u2019s a year to start, only in California and for a price to be\nannounced later.\n\nOther carmakers are also hedging their bets with hydrogen. Hyundai sells the\nNexo SUV, which debuted in the U.S. in late 2018 and now boasts up to 608 km\nof range. But the carmaker moved only a few hundred of them in California last\nyear. Hyundai declined to make an executive available to discuss its hydrogen\nstrategy.\n\nIn February, Shell closed its seven retail hydrogen stations in California \u2014 including the only station serving the Berkeley area. | Bloomberg\n\nToyota, which has placed a major bet on hybrid cars, also remains committed to\nhydrogen. Since introducing the Mirai in 2015, the carmaker has sold more than\n14,000 of them in California; the most recent models get up to 640 km per\ntank.\n\n\"We not only see fuel cells as great for the light vehicle, but we also see it\nas an option for heavy-duty vehicles and we also see it as a great option for\nelectrical generation,\u201d says Tim Bliss, general manager of Toyota vehicle\nmarketing in North America.\n\nHonda, too, says its fuel cell car is about creating demand for hydrogen, as a\nsource of backup power and for difficult-to-electrify transportation such as\ntrains, planes and heavy-duty trucks. \"For us it\u2019s a long-term play to not\njust grow light vehicles, but to grow the overall hydrogen economy, and light\nvehicles are an essential part of that,\u201d says Jay Joseph, vice president for\nsustainability and business development at American Honda Motor Co.\n\nBut deep discounts on fuel cell cars tell a different demand story. In March,\nToyota offered up to $40,000 cash back on a new $49,500 2023 Mirai Limited, a\nlower-range model, plus 0% financing. (Bliss says this inventory adjustment\napplied to a small number of cars.) Over at a Hyundai dealership, you could\npick up a new $63,585 Nexo for $28,585 and pay no interest. At one San\nFrancisco Toyota dealership, a used 2020 Mirai could be had for about $12,000.\n\nCalifornia has no plans to walk away from hydrogen. The state is still\nspending tens of millions of dollars a year on infrastructure and hydrogen\nproduction, which can also be used to electrify heavy-duty trucks. Because a\nfuel cell powertrain weighs less than a battery, hydrogen-powered trucks can\ndrive longer distances with greater loads. Trucks also disproportionately\ncontribute to the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and adverse health effects,\nparticularly on low-income communities of color.\n\n\"A big priority for us right now with regard to hydrogen fuel cell electric\nvehicles is to improve the reliability and performance of the existing\nrefueling network, so that those who purchased or leased hydrogen vehicles can\nbe confident they will be able to refuel when needed,\u201d says Hannon Rasool,\ndirector of the California Energy Commission\u2019s fuels and transportation\ndivision.\n\nThe state is also trying to green the hydrogen itself. Most of the hydrogen\ndispensed in California is gray, meaning it\u2019s produced from natural gas,\naccording to a state report released in December. Rasool says California has\nawarded $22 million for green hydrogen projects, including three plants that\nwill tap renewable electricity to power electrolyzers, which produce hydrogen\nfrom water. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden also awarded the\nstate $1.2 billion to create its own hydrogen hub, which Rasool says will\nboost supplies of green hydrogen over the next eight years.\n\nWhether that means fuel cell rides can ever catch up with battery-electrics in\nthe race to decarbonize cars remains to be seen. But some superfans are\nwatching closely. If fuel prices do drop, Imahara plans to jump back on the\nhydrogen highway. She likes that hydrogen is produced in the U.S. and that\nfuel cell cars don\u2019t rely on metals controlled by other countries. \"The future\nneeds to be hydrogen and not completely battery,\u201d she says.\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nU.S.(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/us),\ncars(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/cars), electric\nvehicles(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/electric-vehicles),\nhydrogen(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/hydrogen),\nenvironment(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/environment),\ntech(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/tech),\nToyota(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/toyota),\nHonda(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/honda),\nHyundai(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/hyundai),\nCARMAKERS(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/carmakers)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
