Is it a watershed moment\nfor Sora?\n\nA scene from the music video for \u201cThe Hardest Part.\u201d\n\n(Paul Trillo)\n\nBy Wendy LeeStaff Writer\n\nMay 2, 2024 3 AM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\n\u201cThe Hardest Part,\u201d a new song from indie pop artist Washed Out, is all about\nlove lost, among the most human of themes.\n\nBut ironically, to illustrate the tune\u2019s sense of longing, the musician turned\nto something far less flesh-and-blood: artificial intelligence.\n\nWith Thursday\u2019s release of \u201cThe Hardest Part,\u201d Macon, Ga.-based Washed Out,\nwhose real name is Ernest Greene, has the first collaboration between a major\nmusic artist and filmmaker on a music video using OpenAI\u2019s Sora text-to-video\ntechnology, according to the singer-songwriter\u2019s record label Sub Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe roughly four-minute video, directed by Paul Trillo, speedily zooms the\nviewer through key elements of a couple\u2019s life. The audience sees the\ncharacters \u2014 a red-haired woman and a dark-haired man \u2014 go from making out and\nsmoking in a 1980s high school to getting married and having a child. \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou cry, it\u2019s all right now,\u201d Greene croons. \u201cThe hardest part is that you\ncan\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nThe couple aren\u2019t played by real actors. They\u2019re created entirely digitally\nthrough Sora\u2019s AI.\n\nThe video could mark the beginning of a potentially groundbreaking trend of\nusing AI in video production.\n\n\u201cI think where we are now \u2014 that\u2019s about to explode, and so I look forward to\nbeing able to incorporate some of this brand-new technology and seeing how\nthat informs what I can come up with,\u201d Greene said in an interview. \u201cSo, if\nthat\u2019s pioneering, I would love to be part of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hardest Part\u201d \u2014 the lead single from Greene\u2019s new self-produced album,\n\u201cNotes From a Quiet Life,\u201d set for release on June 28 \u2014 is the longest music\nvideo made through Sora technology so far. The program creates short clips\nbased on written text prompts. This enabled Trillo to build scenes in a way\nthat would\u2019ve been many times more expensive with actual actors, sets and\nlocations.\n\n\u201cNot having the limitations of budget and having to travel to different\nlocations, I was able to explore all these different, alternate outcomes of\nthis couple\u2019s life,\u201d Trillo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00d7\n\nCompany Town\n\n### AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace?\n\nHollywood talent agencies and producers have met with AI companies, including\nChatGPT maker OpenAI, to learn about how their technologies could be used in\nentertainment.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nTrillo is one of the creatives who has early access to Sora, which is not yet\npublicly available. OpenAI unveiled Sora in February and has been testing the\nsystem with directors and meeting with Hollywood executives and producers.\nIt\u2019s working out kinks and trying to address intellectual property concerns.\n\nThe innovations in AI have been hugely controversial in many corners,\nincluding in the music industry, which has been plagued by the use of\n\u201cdeepfakes,\u201d or video and audio that falsely uses an artist\u2019s image or voice.\nMusicians and others have pushed for legislation to combat such misleading\ncreations, and talent agencies are working with tech startups to clamp down on\nunauthorized digital mimicry.\n\nThe introduction of Sora \u2014 coming from the same company that created the text-\nbased AI model ChatGPT \u2014 raised concerns within Hollywood and elsewhere about\nits potentially devastating impact on jobs and production. Still, it inspired\nexcitement among some creatives for the ways it could help them achieve their\nvision onscreen without being constrained by special effects budgets and\ntravel limitations.\n\nBoth Greene and Trillo said they were able to do more with Sora than they\nwould have with real-life sets on their budget. Sub Pop did not disclose the\ncosts for the video. The music artist did not pay OpenAI to use the tech for\nthe music video.\n\nThe two men had explored other ideas, including hiring dancers, and filming in\na location that resembled the green hills in the art for Greene\u2019s new album,\nbut that proved difficult because of time and financial constraints. So Trillo\nsuggested experimenting with Sora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### Dead Beatles, Fake Drake and robot songwriters: Inside the panic over AI\nmusic\n\nAI won\u2019t replace your favorite artist. But it will render obsolete some\nworking musicians and songwriters. A nervous industry steels itself for more\nupheaval.\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nGreene, whose music TV audiences may recognize from the theme song of the\nsatirical sketch comedy show \u201cPortlandia,\u201d was hesitant at first.\n\n\u201cI feel like with my music and most of the videos I\u2019ve made over the years, it\nalways starts from like a real emotional, sincere place,\u201d Greene said, noting\nthat many of the examples of AI video he\u2019d seen existed in the dreaded\n\u201cuncanny valley,\u201d human-like but eerily artificial.\n\nCompany Town\n\n### After the launch of OpenAI\u2019s Sora, can Hollywood adapt to the artificial\nintelligence \u2018matrix\u2019?\n\nFran Drescher, Tyler Perry and others are warning about the advances in text-\nto-video artificial intelligence technology. Producers, executives and artists\nall need to take proactive steps to protect themselves.\n\nFeb. 27, 2024\n\nNonetheless, Greene was willing to experiment. So Trillo tried out different\nconcepts to see what would work in the video. Using the technology, he could\nexplore all the various outcomes of the couple\u2019s life across multiple\nlocations by creating elaborate text-based prompts. He completed the video in\nabout six weeks, editing together about 55 clips in the video from the roughly\n700 that he generated using Sora.\n\n\u201cWith this, there was no editing myself,\u201d Trillo said. \u201cI was really able to\njust try things and so that organically creates a different kind of story\nbecause of that, being able to throw so much at the wall and see what sticks.\u201d\n\nTo generate usable clips, Greene needed to write prompts with enough specific\ndetails about not just the image itself but the shot angles and movements of\nthe characters. \u201cWe zoom through the bubble it pops and we zoom through the\nbubblegum and enter an open football field,\u201d Trillo wrote as part of his\nprompt for one brief snippet of video. \u201cThe scene is moving rapidly, showing a\nfront perspective, showing the students getting bigger and faster.\u201d\n\nThe final music video for \u201cThe Hardest Part\u201d shows several locations,\nincluding a high school, a grocery store, rolling hills, a hallway with\nbillowing white sheets and fire burning through the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErnest Greene, known as music artist \u201cWashed Out,\u201d will have a new album\ncoming out at June 28.\n\n(Ernest Greene)\n\nThere were some limitations. Sometimes Trillo would have an idea and Sora\nwould nail it. Other times, it would create something chaotic and unusable.\nThe videos would come out with inconsistencies, which Trillo would sometimes\nchoose to just overlook. The characters look a little different from clip to\nclip, as does the couple\u2019s child.\n\nPart of the video\u2019s artsy charm is its dreamlike state \u2014 recollections of a\ncouple\u2019s life that illustrate the murkiness of human memory.\n\n\u201cYou have to know where to pick your battles with it,\u201d Trillo said of Sora.\n\u201cYou kind of have to relinquish a bit of your free will in working with this\nthing and you kind of have to accept the nature of how chaotic it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was certainly blown away with just how far he could take it in piecing a\nstory together,\u201d Greene said.\n\nCompany Town\n\n### AI is here, and it\u2019s making movies. Is Hollywood ready?\n\nDirector Scott Mann had an issue: too many swear words in his thriller movie.\nCould artificial intelligence help him get a PG-13 rating?\n\nDec. 19, 2022\n\nBoth Greene and Trillo said they see AI as potentially opening more\nopportunities for people to push the music video art form forward. Music\nvideos are a logical medium in which to play around with AI, because they\u2019re\nusually short and cost much less to make than feature films and television\nepisodes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trillo said, it\u2019s important to him that this is not used as a new\nmain method for creation but rather another tool in the tool belt.\n\n\u201cA lot of music videos just don\u2019t have the budgets to really dream big,\u201d\nTrillo said. \u201cI think AI can help the music industry in terms of creating\nthings that even Ernest could dream of that maybe he wouldn\u2019t have dared to\ndream before.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Universal Music Group artists dancing back to TikTok after licensing dispute resolved\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Push Ups\u2019 \u2014 by Drake? \u2014 sparks AI speculation as more players join diss-track drama\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n  * ### Hatsune Miku is playing Coachella, but she\u2019s not human.
