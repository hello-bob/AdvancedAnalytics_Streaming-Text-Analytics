Researchers at the University of\nFlorida and Link\u00f6ping University have identified biomarkers present at birth\nthat are indicative of future diagnoses of these disorders, offering a new\napproach to early detection and intervention.\n\nNeurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD\naffect millions worldwide, influencing brain development and impairing social,\ncommunicative, and cognitive functions. Prior research has suggested various\ngenetic and environmental factors contribute to these disorders, but early\ndetection remains challenging due to the absence of clear biomarkers at the\ninitial stages of life.\n\nAutism is characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive\nbehaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. About 1-2% of people worldwide\nare affected by autism. ADHD is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention\nand/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or\ndevelopment. It is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue\nthrough adolescence and adulthood, affecting about 5-7% of children globally.\n\nThe gut-brain axis, the two-way communication pathway between the central\nnervous system and the gut microbiota, has been increasingly recognized as\ncrucial in understanding these conditions. The gut microbiota refers to the\ncomplex community of microorganisms living in the digestive tracts of humans\nand other animals.\n\nThis axis includes the vagus nerve, which extends from the brainstem to the\nabdomen, and is a critical route through which the gut bacteria communicate\nwith the brain. Gut microbiota can produce and respond to neurotransmitters\nand other chemicals, such as short-chain fatty acids and inflammatory\ncytokines, that affect brain function. Thus, the state of the gut microbiota\ncan potentially influence, and be influenced by, a range of complex behaviors\nand emotional states inherent in disorders like autism and ADHD.\n\nThe research, part of the All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) study,\nfollowed over 16,000 children born in southeast Sweden from October 1997 to\nOctober 1999 from birth into their early twenties. Comprehensive data\ncollection began at birth and continued into the children\u2019s early twenties.\nBiological samples, including cord serum and stool samples at one year of age,\nwere collected along with extensive questionnaire data detailing family\nmedical history, dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and other environmental\nexposures.\n\nThe researchers found distinct differences in the gut microbiota of infants\nwho later developed neurodevelopmental disorders compared to those who did\nnot. Specific bacterial species, such as Citrobacter, were more prevalent in\nchildren who developed neurodevelopmental disorders, while the presence of\nCoprococcus was associated with a decreased risk of such outcomes. This\nsuggests that certain bacteria in the gut may either contribute to or protect\nagainst the development of conditions like ASD and ADHD.\n\nThe researchers analyzed cord blood from newborns to compare the metabolic and\ntoxicological profiles of children later diagnosed with autism to those\nwithout such diagnoses. They focused on the concentrations of various\nmetabolic byproducts, including essential fatty acids and amino acids, as well\nas external contaminants like nicotine and environmental.\n\nChildren who were later diagnosed with autism showed notably lower levels of\nlinolenic acid, a crucial fatty acid necessary for producing omega-3 fatty\nacids, which have anti-inflammatory properties and play various roles in brain\nfunction.\n\nConversely, these children had higher levels of PFAS, chemicals commonly used\nas flame retardants and known to negatively impact the immune system. PFAS are\npervasive environmental contaminants that can be ingested through water, food,\nand air. These findings suggest that both metabolic imbalances and exposure to\nharmful environmental substances might be linked to the development of\nneurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n\u201cThe remarkable aspect of the work is that these biomarkers are found at birth\nin cord blood or in the child\u2019s stool at one year of age over a decade prior\nto the diagnosis,\u201d explained Eric W. Triplett, a professor at the University\nof Florida, and one of the researchers who led the study.\n\nIn addition, certain bacterial strains, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and\nBifidobacterium, were consistently found in lower abundances in children\ndiagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders. These bacteria are known for\ntheir roles in maintaining gut integrity and modulating immune responses.\n\n\u201cCoprococcus and Akkermansia muciniphila have potential protective effects.\nThese bacteria were correlated with important substances in the stool, such as\nvitamin B and precursors to neurotransmitters which play vital roles\norchestrating signalling in the brain. Overall, we saw deficits in these\nbacteria in children who later received a developmental neurological\ndiagnosis,\u201d said Angelica Ahrens, an assistant scientist in Eric Triplett\u2019s\nresearch group and the first author of this study.\n\nInfants who were treated with antibiotics, especially penicillin, in the first\nyears of life showed altered microbiota compositions that were linked to\nhigher risks of neurodevelopmental disorders. Frequent ear infections, which\noften lead to repeated antibiotic treatments, were also correlated with\nchanges in the gut microbiota and increased neurodevelopmental disorder risks.\nThis suggests that disruptions to the gut microbiota caused by antibiotics or\ninfections might play a role in the development of neurodevelopmental\nconditions.\n\n\u201cWe can see in the study that there are clear differences in the intestinal\nflora already during the first year of life between those who develop autism\nor ADHD and those who don\u2019t. We\u2019ve found associations with some factors that\naffect gut bacteria, such as antibiotic treatment during the child\u2019s first\nyear, which is linked to an increased risk of these diseases,\u201d said Johnny\nLudvigsson, senior professor at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical\nSciences at Link\u00f6ping University.\n\nDespite its insights, the study has limitations. Its findings are based on a\ncohort from Sweden, which may limit the generalizability of the results to\nother populations. The study also did not incorporate neuropsychological\ntesting, relying instead on medical records for diagnosis, which could affect\nthe accuracy of the associations made.\n\nFuture research should aim to replicate these findings in diverse populations\nand explore whether interventions in gut microbiota could mitigate the risk of\ndeveloping these disorders. Additionally, researchers noted the need for more\ndetailed tracking of dietary and environmental exposures throughout childhood\nto better understand their impact on gut microbiota and neurodevelopment.\n\nThe study, \u201cInfant microbes and metabolites point to childhood\nneurodevelopmental disorders,\u201d was authored by Angelica P. Ahrens, Tuulia\nHy\u00f6tyl\u00e4inen, Joseph R. Petrone, Kajsa Igelstr\u00f6m, Christian D. George, Timothy\nJ. Garrett, Matej Ore\u0161i\u010d, Eric W.
