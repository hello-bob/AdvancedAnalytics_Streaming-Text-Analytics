In those years, a recurring joke in scientific circles imagined that\ninvaders from Mars had arrived in Hungary in the late 19th century and left\nafter a few years, having decided that our planet was not suitable for them to\nsettle on; but during their brief stay they had had time to mate with some\nEarthlings and leave behind a few offspring, who eventually became exceptional\nscientists, with intellectual capacities that seemed out of this world. \u201cThey\nare already here among us; they just call themselves Hungarians,\u201d jokingly\ndeclared one of them, Leo Szilard, who was one of the inventors of nuclear\nenergy and who wrote the most important letter Albert Einstein ever sent.\n\nIn addition to Leo Szilard (1898-1964), the nucleus of the Martians (a sort of\nscientific Rat Pack) included Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (1881-1963), whose ideas\npropelled the history of aviation, paving the way for jet aircraft and\nsupersonic flight; Edward Teller (1908-2003), designer of the hydrogen bomb;\nEugene Wigner (1902-1995), who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his theories\nto understand the atomic nucleus and who predicted the existence of today\u2019s\n\u201cunicorn\u201d of physics; and finally, the most unique Martian of them all, John\nvon Neumann (28 December 1903 \u2013 8 February 1957).\n\nThe von Neumann crater, on the far side of the Moon.

There, in the Los Alamos\nlaboratory, they attracted attention both for their extraordinary intellectual\nabilities and for their animated chats, whether in their incomprehensible\nmother tongue or in English with that accent made popular in Hollywood by the\nHungarian actor Bela Lugosi as Dracula (1931).\n\n## The teenager who solved a great mathematical crisis\n\nAs a child, von Neumann had been brought up to speak and write fluent German,\nFrench and English, and to be able to get by in Italian, Yiddish, Latin and\nAncient Greek. It was also then that his passion for history, especially that\nof the ancient world, was born. He could have been a historian or a linguist,\nbut what he excelled at above all else was mathematics. He was a child prodigy\nwhose mental calculation skills were such that by the age of six he was\nalready credited with feats such as quickly dividing two eight-digit numbers\nin his head. At school, his mathematical level was several years ahead of his\npeers, so his father hired eminent mathematicians such as G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 to\ninstruct him. As a result, in 1921, at the age of just 17, he had already made\nhis first major contribution to science: in one of his first research papers\nhe provided the modern definition of ordinal numbers, still used today, which\nimproved on Georg Cantor\u2019s definition. To the surprise of the scientific world\nand to the delight of David Hilbert, a teenager was showing the way out of a\nserious identity crisis that the greatest theoretical mathematicians had got\nthemselves into, triggered by Russell\u2019s paradox, discovered by the philosopher\nand mathematician who won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nSuch an achievement did not impress J\u00e1nos\u2019 father enough to allow him to focus\nonly on mathematics. He agreed to permit him to study mathematics in Budapest\nonly if, at the same time, he pursued studies at the University of Berlin to\nbecome a chemical engineer, a profession that Max von Neumann saw as much more\nlucrative and which would guarantee his son a well-paid position. He fulfilled\nhis father\u2019s requirements and at the same time, in 1926, completed his\ndoctorate in mathematics, which enabled him to pursue his own dream: to enrol\nat the University of G\u00f6ttingen as a pupil of David Hilbert.\n\n## A driving force of the major scientific revolutions\n\nThere he began a period of vertiginous scientific production (1927-1929), at a\nrate of nearly one major paper a month with crucial contributions to\nmathematics. He covered innumerable fields of research, earning himself the\nreputation of being the \u201clast representative of the great mathematicians who\nwere equally at home in both pure and applied mathematics.\u201d When asked to\nhighlight one single accomplishment from those years, John von Neumann, now a\nmature scientist, chose the rigorous mathematical framework he brought to\nquantum mechanics, solidifying the revolution of this young discipline, which\nhad taken its first steps at the same time as little J\u00e1nos. That alone would\nhave been enough to earn him a place in the history of contemporary science,\nbut he accomplished so much more.\n\nJohn von Neumann in 1952 in front of the IAS computer, which had a total\nmemory capacity of 5 KB (40,960 bits). Credit: Archives of the Institute of\nAdvanced Study (IAS).\n\nThe fingerprints of John von Neumann are all over the major scientific\nrevolutions of the 20th century, as he left his mark of genius on a wide range\nof fields. Looking back over many of these stories reveals a foundational\narticle by him, a visionary prediction or an inspirational connection of\ndisciplines that opened the minds of the great innovators in those fields.\nOnce settled at Princeton University and renamed John, he worked on the\nphilosophy of artificial intelligence with Alan Turing. He was involved in the\ndevelopment of ENIAC, the first complete computer, which in 1945 finally had\nthe four basic features of our current computers. He laid the theoretical\nfoundations for computer viruses, developing in 1949 the concept of automata\ncapable of reproducing themselves, following processes like those later seen\nin living organisms when the structure of DNA was discovered. He sowed ideas\nof quantum information theory that were later taken up by Claude Shannon, the\nforgotten inventor of the digital age. He led the team that produced the first\ncomputerised weather report in 1950, with a 24-hour forecast, and in 1955\nwarned of global warming caused by human activity and proposed possible geo-\nengineering technologies to control the climate. He founded game theory, which\nwas later developed by several Nobel laureates such as John Nash. And he is\nalso credited with the equilibrium strategy, based on mutually assured\ndestruction, which governed geopolitics during the Cold War.\n\n## Unmatchable speed, boundless curiosity\n\nHis knowledge of history and warfare, in addition to his political\nconvictions, also led him to anticipate some key factors in the outbreak of\nthe Second World War and to place his trust in the United States as the power\nto stop the Nazis. His mental agility and astonishing memory\u2014he was able to\nrecite verbatim from texts he had read years before\u2014made him stand out even in\nan environment where some of the most brilliant minds of his time were\nworking. Even among the other Martians\u2014those masters of connecting seemingly\nunrelated scientific disciplines\u2014von Neumann\u2019s creativity and speed were\nunmatchable. Edward Teller acknowledged that he \u201cnever could keep up with him\u201d\nand added: \u201cVon Neumann would carry on a conversation with my three-year-old\nson, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he\nused the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.\u201d Eugene Wigner also\nclaimed that he did not know anyone as quick and sharp as von Neumann, despite\nhis close dealings with science icons such as Albert Einstein, Paul Dirac,\nWerner Heisenberg and Max Planck.\n\nBust of John von Neumann at Budapest\u2019s Infopark. Source: Wikimedia Commons.\n\nFor Claude Shannon he was, without a doubt, \u201cthe smartest person I\u2019ve ever\nmet.\u201d The recent biography The Man from the Future, by Ananyo Bhattacharya,\ndelves into the figure of John von Neumann: both into the genius of the great\nmathematician admired by his colleagues and into the experiences of the\ncharacter who went out partying all night several times a week, who annoyed\nother distinguished Princeton professors\u2014including Einstein by playing loud\nGerman marching music in his office\u2014and who was a fan of smutty jokes and\ngossip even on his deathbed. Von Neumann died at the age of 53, losing a\nbattle with cancer that prevented him from winning one or more Nobel Prizes,\nfor which he would surely have been a candidate despite being a mathematician.\nUnfortunately, he did not live to witness the rest of the 20th century unfold,\na period that saw the fruition of many of his theories, practical ideas and\npredictions that sprang from his prodigious mind and boundless curiosity.\n\nFrancisco Dom\u00e9nech @fucolin\n\n#### Related publications\n\n  * The 8 most Brilliant Fictional Scientist we Love (6/8)\n  * Hodgkin, Promoter of Preventive Medicine for Everyone\n  * Geiger, the Man Who Learned How to Count Radioactivity\n  * Guy Callendar, the Forgotten Pioneer of Climate Change\n\n#### More about Science\n\n  * ##### Bioscience\n\n  * ##### Environment\n\n  * ##### Leading Figures\n\n  * ##### Mathematics\n\n  * ##### Physics\n\n  * ##### Research\n\n  * ##### Scientific Insights\n\n#### More publications about Ventana al Conocimiento (Knowledge Window)\n\nEnvironment\n\nDoes a Lack of Copper Threaten Our Green Future?\n\nEnvironment\n\nClimate Tipping Points: A Journey of No Return?\n\nResearch\n\nMicroplastics Are Already Inside Us\n\n#### Comments on this publication\n\nLogin to comment Log in Subscribe\n\nThank you for collaborating with the OpenMind community!
