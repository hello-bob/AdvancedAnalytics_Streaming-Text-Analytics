With audio (e.g. recording of phone conversations),\nsousveillance is sometimes referred to as \"one party consent\".^[24]\n\nUndersight (inverse oversight) is sousveillance at high-level, e.g. \"citizen\nundersight\" being reciprocal to a congressional oversight committee or the\nlike.^[25]^[26]^[27]\n\nInverse surveillance is a subset of sousveillance with an emphasis on\n\"watchful vigilance from underneath\" and a form of surveillance inquiry or\nlegal protection involving the recording, monitoring, study, or analysis of\nsurveillance systems, proponents of surveillance, and possibly also recordings\nof authority figures. Inverse surveillance is typically undertaken by those\nwho are subjected to surveillance, so it can be thought of as a form of\nethnography or ethnomethodology (i.e. an analysis of the surveilled from the\nperspective of a participant in a society under surveillance).^[28]\nSousveillance typically involves community-based recording from first person\nperspectives, without necessarily involving any specific political agenda,\nwhereas inverse surveillance is a form of sousveillance that is typically\ndirected at, or used to collect data to analyze or study, surveillance or its\nproponents (e.g., the actions of police or protestors at a protest\nrally).^[29]^[30]^[31]\n\nSousveillance is not necessarily countersurveillance. Sousveillance can be\nused to \"counter\" surveillance or it can be used with surveillance to create a\nmore complete \"veillance\" (\"Surveillance is a half-truth without\nsousveillance\"^[32]). The question of \"Who watches the watchers\" is dealt with\nmore properly under the topic of metaveillance^[33] (the veillance of\nveillance) than sousveillance.\n\n## Inverse surveillance[edit]\n\nInverse surveillance is a type of sousveillance. The more general concept of\nsousveillance goes beyond just inverse surveillance and the associated\ntwentieth-century political \"us versus them\" framework for citizens to\nphotograph police, shoppers to photograph shopkeepers, or passengers to\nphotograph taxicab drivers. Howard Rheingold commented in his book Smart Mobs\nthat this is similar to the pedestrian\u2212driver concept, i.e. these are roles\nthat many of us take both sides on, from time to time. Many aspects of\nsousveillance were examined in the general category of \"reciprocal\naccountability\" in David Brin's 1997 non-fiction book The Transparent Society,\nand also in Brin's novels. The first International Workshop on Inverse\nSurveillance, IWIS, took place in 2004,^[34] chaired by Dr. Jim Gemmell,\n(MyLifeBits), Joi Ito, Anastasios Venetsanopoulos, and Steve Mann, among\nothers.\n\nOne of the things that brought inverse surveillance to light was the reactions\nof security guards to electric seeing aids and similar sousveillance\npractices. It seemed, early on, that the more cameras that were in an\nestablishment, the more the guards disliked the use of an electric seeing aid,\nsuch as the EyeTap eyeglasses. It was through simply wearing electric seeing\naids, as a passive observer, that it was discovered that surveillance and\nsousveillance can cause conflict and sometimes confrontation. This led some\nresearchers to explore why the perpetrators of surveillance are suspicious of\nsousveillance, and thus defined the notion of inverse surveillance as a new\nand interesting facet of studies in sousveillance.^[28]\n\nSince the year 2001, December 24 has been World Sousveillance Day with groups\nof participants in New York City, Toronto, Boston, Florida, Vancouver, Japan,\nSpain and the United Kingdom. However, this designated day focuses only on\nhierarchical sousveillance, whereas there are a number of groups around the\nworld working on combining the two forms of sousveillance.\n\nAn essay from Wired magazine predicts that sousveillance is an important\ndevelopment that will be on the rise in 2014.^[35]\n\nSousveillance of a state by its citizens has been credited with addressing\nmany problems such as election fraud or electoral misdeeds, as well as\nproviding good governance. For example, mobile phones were used in Sierra\nLeone and Ghana in 2007 for checking malpractices and intimidation during\nelections.^[36]\n\nA recent area of research further developed at IWIS was the equilibrium\nbetween surveillance and sousveillance. Current \"equiveillance theory\" holds\nthat sousveillance, to some extent, often reduces or eliminates the need for\nsurveillance. In this sense it is possible to replace the Panoptic God's eye\nview of surveillance with a more community-building ubiquitous personal\nexperience capture. Crimes, for example, might then be solved by way of\ncollaboration among the citizenry rather than through the watching over the\ncitizenry from above. But it is not so black-and-white as this dichotomy\nsuggests. In particular, citizens watching over their neighbors is not\nnecessarily \"better\" than the alternative: an increase in community self-\nreliance might be offset by an uncomfortable \"nosy neighbor\" effect. \"Personal\nsousveillance\" has been referred to as \"coveillance\" by Mann, Nolan and\nWellman.\n\nCopwatch is a network of American and Canadian volunteer organizations that\n\"police the police.\" Copwatch groups usually engage in monitoring of the\npolice, videotaping police activity, and educating the public about police\nmisconduct. Fitwatch is a group that photograph Forward Intelligence Teams\n(police photographers) in the United Kingdom.^[37]\n\nIn 2008, Cambridge researchers (in the MESSAGE project) teamed with bicycle\ncouriers to measure and transmit air pollution indicators as they travel the\ncity.^[38]\n\nIn 2012 the Danish daily newspaper and online title Dagbladet Information\ncrowdmapped the positions of surveillance cameras by encouraging readers to\nuse a free Android and iOS app to photograph and geolocate CCTV\ncameras.^[39]^[better source needed]\n\n## Personal sousveillance[edit]\n\nSteve Mann's Visual Filter for continuous live webcast as well as viewing\n(i.e. visual reality modification in realtime).Sousveillance devices for ACM's\nCFP2005 conference attendees.One of the 250 \"LANYARDome\" name badge neck\nwallets manufactured for each attendee of the IEEE ISTAS 2013 conference,\nhttp://veillance.me\n\nPersonal sousveillance is the art, science, and technology of personal\nexperience capture, processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission, such as\nlifelong audiovisual recording by way of cybernetic prosthetics, such as\nseeing-aids, visual memory aids, and the like. Even today's personal\nsousveillance technologies like camera phones and weblogs tend to build a\nsense of community, in contrast to surveillance that some have said is\ncorrosive to community.^[40]\n\nThe legal, ethical, and policy issues surrounding personal sousveillance are\nlargely yet to be explored, but there are close parallels to the social and\nlegal norms surrounding recording of telephone conversations. When one or more\nparties to the conversation record it, it is called \"sousveillance\", whereas\nwhen the conversation is recorded by a person who is not a party to the\nconversation (such as a prison guard violating a client-lawyer relationship),\nthe recording is called \"surveillance\".\n\n\"Targeted sousveillance\" refers to sousveillance of a specific individual by\none or more other individuals.^[41] Usually, the targeted individual is a\nrepresentative or proponent of surveillance, so targeted sousveillance is\noften inverse surveillance or hierarchical sousveillance. \"Hierarchical\nsousveillance\" refers, for example, to citizens photographing the police,\nshoppers photographing shopkeepers, or taxicab passengers photographing cab\ndrivers.^[42] So, for example, targeting former White House security official\nAdmiral John Poindexter with sousveillance follows this more political\nnarrative.\n\nClassy's Kitchen describes sousveillance as \"another way to add further\nintrospection to the commons that keeps society open but still makes the world\nsmaller and safer\".^[43] In this way sousveillance may be regarded as a\npossible replacement for surveillance. In this sur/sousveillance replacement,\none can consider an operative social norm that would require cameras to be\nattached to a human operator. Under such a scenario, any objections to the\ncamera could be raised by another human more easily than it would be to\ninteract with a lamp post upon which is mounted a surveillance camera. Thus,\nthe argument is that cameras attached to people ought to be less offensive\nthan cameras attached to inanimate objects, because there is at least one\nresponsible party present to operate the camera. This responsible-party\nargument is analogous to that used for the operation of a motor vehicle, where\na responsible driver is present, in contrast to the remote or automated\noperation of a motor vehicle.\n\nBeyond the political or breaching of hierarchical structure explored in\nacademia, the more rapidly emerging discourse on sousveillance within the\nindustry is \"personal sousveillance\", namely the recording of an activity by a\nparticipant in the activity.\n\nAs the technologies get smaller and easier to use, the capture, recording, and\nplayback of everyday life get that much easier to initiate spontaneously in\nunexpected situations. For example, David Ollila, a manufacturer of video\ncamera equipment, was trapped for four hours aboard a Comair plane at JFK\nAirport in New York City. When he recorded an interview with the pilot about\nthe situation, the pilot called the police who then removed Ollila for\nquestioning and removed everyone from the plane.^[44]\n\nRecording a situation is only part of the sousveillance process. Communicating\nis also important. Video-sharing sites such as YouTube and photo-sharing sites\nsuch as Flickr play a vital role. For example, police agents provocateur were\nquickly revealed on YouTube when they infiltrated a demonstration in\nMontebello, Quebec, against the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United\nStates (August 2007). When the head of the Quebec police publicly stated that\nthere was no police presence, a sousveillance video showed him to be wrong.\nWhen he revised his statement to say that the police provocateurs were\npeaceful observers, the same video showed them to be masked, wearing police\nboots, and in one case holding a rock.^[45]\n\nThere are many similar examples, such as the widely viewed YouTube video of\nUCLA campus policemen tasering a student. In Russia, as well as in some other\ncountries where road users trust neither each other nor police, onboard\ncameras are so ubiquitous that thousands of videos of automobile accidents and\nnear-miss incidents have been uploaded. The unanticipated 2013 Russian meteor\nevent was well documented from a dozen angles via the use of these\ndevices.^[46] Similarly, in February 2015, dashcams caught valuable footage of\nthe crash of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235.^[47]\n\n## Alibi sousveillance[edit]\n\nCameras can easily be mounted on bicycles, to record sports activities\u2014or\nrecord acts of road rage.\n\nAlibi sousveillance is a form of sousveillance activity aimed at generating an\nalibi as evidence to defend against allegations of wrongdoing.^[48]\n\nHasan Elahi, a University of Maryland professor, has produced a sousveillance\nfor his entire life, after being detained at an airport because he was\nerroneously placed on the US terrorist watchlist. Some of his sousveillance\nactivities include using his cell phone as a tracking device, and publicly\nposting debit card and other transactions that document his actions.^[49]\n\nOne specific use of alibi sousveillance is the growing trend of police\nofficers wearing body cameras while on patrol. Well-publicized events\ninvolving police-citizen altercations (such as the case of Michael Brown in\nFerguson, Missouri) have increased calls for police to wear body cameras and\nso capture evidence of the incidents, for their benefit and the criminal\njustice system as a whole.^[50] By having officers use sousveillance, police\nforces can generate hours of video evidence to be used in cases like that of\nMichael Brown, and the video evidence can act as an important alibi in the\njudicial proceedings in regards to who is truly at fault.^[50] Regardless of\nthe outcome of such events, contemporaneous audio-video evidence can be\nextremely valuable in respect of compliance- and enforcement-related events.\n\n## Police use[edit]\n\nUse of wearable cameras by police officers combined with video streaming and\nrecording in an archive produces a record of the interactions of the officer\nwith civilians and criminals. Experiments with police use in Rialto,\nCalifornia from 2012 to 2013 resulted in a reduction of both complaints\nagainst officers and a reduction in the use of violence by officers. The\npublic is shielded from police misconduct and the police officer from bogus\ncomplaints.^[51]\n\nBecause these body cameras are turned on for every encounter with the public,\nprivacy issues have been brought up with specific emphasis on special victim\ncases such as rape or domestic violence. Police worry that with a camera right\nin front of the victim, they will not feel comfortable revealing all the\ninformation that they know.^[52] There have been two case studies done in the\nUnited States that have revealed that police officers who have cameras have\nfewer encounters with citizens than officers who do not have cameras, due to\nfear of being reprimanded for committing a mistake.^[50]\n\n## Sousveillance cultures[edit]\n\nPrior to contemporary sousveillance cultures, Simone Browne (2015) used \"dark\nsousveillance\" to refer to the ways that enslaved Black Americans refashioned\ntechniques and technologies to facilitate survival and escape. Browne (2015)\nnotes how pranks and other performative practices and creative acts were used\nto resist enslavement from experiential insight.\n\nIn the era of web-based participatory media and convergence cultures, non-\ngovernmental and non-state actors, with their own virtual communities and\nnetworks that cut across national borders, use what Bakir (2010)^[53] calls\nthe sousveillant assemblage to wield discursive power. The sousveillant\nassemblage comprises Haggerty & Ericson's (2000)^[54] surveillant assemblage\n(or loosely linked, unstable, systems of data flows of people's activities,\ntracked by computers, and data-mined so that we are each reconfigured as\n(security) risks or (commercial) opportunities, but data-fattened by the\nproliferation of web-based participatory media and personal sousveillance that\nwe willingly provide online). Verde Garrido (2015) has also explored Mann's\nconcept of sousveillance and reinterpreted Michel Foucault's notion of\nparrhesia (i.e., confronting authority and power with the truth) to explain\nthat in contemporary societies, which are global and digital, 'parrhesiastic\nsousveillance' allows to resist and contest social, economic, and political\nrelations of power by means of technology. These acts of resistance and\ncontestation, in turn, enable civil societies to change old meanings and offer\nnew ones, using a newborn digital agency to create new and contemporary\npolitics of truth.^[55]\n\nFeatures of sousveillance cultures:\n\n  * Dissent, and holding power-holders to account, is easier\n\nUndoubtedly, the urge and practice of dissent have been common, and people\nexploit the participatory media technologies at hand to mark and spread their\ndissent.^[citation needed] However, the rise of web-based participatory media\nand sousveillance cultures have made it easier for many more to record and\nspread this dissent globally, unimpeded by traditional media's commercial\ndistribution restrictions such as pre-defined circulation runs or paid-for\nairtime, or the need for expert knowledge in media production. Mann has long\nmaintained that the 'informal nature of sousveillance, with its tendency to\ndistribute recordings widely, will often expose inappropriate use to scrutiny,\nwhereas the secret nature of surveillance will tend to prevent misuse from\ncoming to light' (Mann, 2005, p. 641).^[56] Just as Foucault's Panopticon\noperates through potential or implied surveillance, sousveillance might also\noperate through the credible threat of its existence. As the ubiquity and\nawareness of sousveillance widen, it is this that may most empower citizens \u2013\nby making officials realise that their actions may, themselves, be monitored\nand exposed at any time. The permanent potential for sousveillance from so\nmany (as opposed to more formalised expos\u00e9s at the hands of investigative\nreporters, a small media elite) raises the likelihood that power abuses will\nbe captured on record which can then be used to hold power-abusers and\nmanipulators to account, providing of course, that there is a functioning\nlegal system and/or public sphere (with mechanisms in place to translate\npopular demands and moral outrage into real-world change).\n\n  * Emancipation, resistance and social change are unpredictable.\n\nIn the case of police body camera implementation in the US, there are multiple\nresponses and social implications to this form of sousveillance. The case\nagainst police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement has garnered an\nimmense and impassioned following in a very short amount of time. There are\ntwo different social movements that have arisen in response to police body\ncameras. One school of thought that has manifested support is that police body\ncameras are necessary in fighting and ending police brutality. The other is\nthe opposing stance to this one that raises the issue of privacy that police\nbody cameras may violate. There have not been many case studies that have\ntaken place in implementing police body cameras.^[57] This means that police\nworn body cameras have not been proven as a definite method to solve the\nproblem of police brutality.^[58] Studies have also shown that people, both\npolicemen and civilians, act differently when they are aware that they are\nbeing surveilled on camera.^[58] This leaves a lot of room for\nunpredictability surrounding the consequences of the use of this form of\nsousveillance.\n\nIn Mann's original conception, sousveillance had an emancipatory political\nthrust, with hierarchical sousveillance a conscious act of resistance to\nsurveillance. Yet, the nature of the social change generated is unpredictable\nand dependent on the sousveillant content, the context of its subsequent\nsharing, and, of course, the strength of the traditions of deliberation for\ndemocratic purposes. ISIS' use of sousveillance, then, may result in social\nchange, but not in a progressive fashion.^[citation needed]\n\n  * Sousveillers' anonymity is crucial.\n\nGiven the lack of secrecy inherent in placing sousveillant content online, the\nanonymity of the sousveillers is of prime importance if hierarchical\n(politically or legally motivated) sousveillance is to proliferate. There is a\nreal need for spaces online that are willing to protect users' anonymity and\nkeep their subversive content online despite political or corporate pressure.\nWith this sort of situation in mind, whistle-blowing websites have been set up\nthat guarantee anonymity, such as Wiki-leaks, launched in December 2006. More\nsuch sites are needed.\n\n  * Agenda-building power comes from the searchable and recirculated, semi-permanent, eyewitness archive.\n\nSocial media provide what could be described as a semi-permanent, and easily\naccessible database of eyewitness accounts. Given that the web can be used and\nsearched in the manner of a database to find examples of sousveillance; and\ngiven the recirculation of sousveillant footage in memes and in mainstream\nmedia, ever-hungry for new content in a media environment of convergence and\nexpanding capacity, the longevity of sousveillant footage is perhaps what\ngives sousveillance its agenda-building power. It allows journalists,\ncitizens, activists, insurgents, strategic communicators and researchers the\nopportunity to discover and partially relive both the eye-witnessed,\nsousveillant account, and the discourse surrounding specific moments of\nsousveillance, as well as reflecting on, and marshalling, their significance.\n\n## In art[edit]\n\nHeartCam, wearable interactive art to reverse the male gaze, inventor: S.\nMann, July 2001.^[59]\n\nReferred to as an early proponent of lifelogging^[60] and perhaps the most\nextreme example of self-tracking^[61] since 2003, conceptual media artist\nAlberto Frigo has embarked on an ambitious project, 2004\u20132040, to understand\nhimself.^[62] Starting with tracking everything his right (dominant) hand has\nused, he's slowly added on different tracking and documentation projects.\nKeeping the focus on himself and his surrounding has helped him connect to\nhimself and the world around him.^[63]\n\nArtist, scientist, and inventor S. Mann also created a wearable interactive\nart piece, the HeartCam, July 2001^[64] in order to reverse the male gaze.\nOthers, including Nestle, have built upon this concept of reversing the \"male\ngaze\" by using a bra as a point-of-view for a camera.^[65]\n\n### Invisibility/Aposematic Suit[edit]\n\nInvisibility + Aposematic Suit, front view.\n\nBack view, Aug. 17, 2001.\n\nInvisibility/Aposematic Suit, S. Mann, 2001, is a wearable art piece that has\ntwo modes of operation: it either (1) becomes \"transparent\", suggestive of a\nchameleon's invisibility cloak (to hide from predators).^[1] In this mode of\noperation the video displays show what is behind the wearer as if we can see\nthrough the wearer from both front and back; or (2) reflective like a mirror,\nthus aposematic, to deter predators (i.e., to let them know they're being\nwatched by the many hidden wearable cameras). In this mode, the wearer becomes\nlike a two-sided video mirror. A potential attacker, whether approaching the\nwearer from the front or sneaking up behind the wearer, sees themselves\ndisplayed on the aposematic suit, in a manner similar to the way that\ndepartment stores often place large video displays of their surveillance\ncamera feed at the entrance to let potential shoplifters know they are being\nwatched.^[1]\n\nOther similar projects include the work of Shinseungback Kimyonghun: \"[the]\nAposematic Jacket is a wearable computer for self-defense. The lenses on the\njacket give off the warning signal, \" ... I can record you\"..., to prevent\npossible attack. When the wearer pushes a button under threat, the jacket\nrecords the scene in 360 degrees and sends the images to the Web.\"\n\n## In fiction[edit]\n\nDavid Brin's 1989 novel Earth portrays citizens equipped with both augmented\nreality gear (\"Tru-Vu Goggles\") and cameras exercising reciprocal\naccountability, with each other and with authority figures, discussing effects\non crime and presaging today's \"cop cam\" developments. Elites are allowed only\ntemporary, cached secrecy. In Robert Sawyer's Neanderthal Parallax trilogy,\nthe Homo neanderthalensis occupying a parallel universe have what are called\ncompanion implants. These are comprehensive recording and transmission\ndevices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is\nconstantly monitored and sent to their alibi archive, a repository of\nrecordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper\nauthorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in\ncircumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after\ndeath; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what\ncircumstances and or by whom a deceased person's archive can be accessed.\n\nThe plot of the 1995 movie Strange Days is based on a future where\nsousveillance recordings are made and sold as entertainment. The plot of the\nmovie revolves around the murder of a celebrity by police officers that is\nrecorded by a person secretly wearing one of the devices. In the movie, the\nrecordings are made by a flat array of sensors that pick up signals from the\nbrain stem. The sensors are usually hidden under a wig, and they record\neverything the person wearing them sees and hears. Recordings made while the\nperson making them dies are called \"blackjack\" tapes.\n\nThe plot of the 1985 John Crowley short story Snow revolves around a suspended\ncamera recording the whole of a subject's life being sold as a consumer\nproduct.\n\nThe 2007 novel Halting State by Charles Stross and its sequel Rule 34 depict a\n2020s Scotland in which wearable computing has a level of ubiquity similar to\nthat of 2013's cell phones. The implications of a society in which anyone\nmight be recording anything at any time are explored at length, particularly\nwith respect to policing.\n\nThe open source science fiction role-playing game Eclipse Phase has\nsousveillance as a common part of life in the setting, as a result of data\nstorage technology and high-definition digital cameras becoming commonplace\nand often integrated into any and all objects.\n\nOrson Scott Card's novel, the Worthing Chronicle also investigates the effect\nof (apparently) omnipotent watchers, and how it can degrade human\nexperience\u2014the moral dilemma leading the watchers to cease. Vernor Vinge's\ncharacter, Pham Nuwen presciently recognizes the stage of \"ubiquitous\nsurveillance\" in the collapse-and-rebuild cycle that plagues human planetary\ncivilization in a Deepness in the Sky.\n\n## Sousveillance efficiency or efficacy[edit]\n\nThere is a need for efficacy, efficiency or effectiveness of sousveillance,\nwhich can be met by social media, such as through widespread dissemination on\nsocial media, and when used as an output modality in conjunction with\nsousveillance as an input modality, is called \"swollag\", or gallows spelled\nbackwards.^[66]^[67]^[68] For example, filming or streaming an abusive\nsituation, like police abuse, doesn't always lead to justice and punishment of\nthe abuser without some means (i.e. swollag) for sousveillance to take effect.\nFor example, in 2014, a man named Eric Garner was choked to death by a police\nofficer in Staten Island after being arrested on suspicion of selling loose\ncigarettes.\n\n> \"Garner's death was documented by his friend Ramsey Orta, and the video was\n> widely disseminated. Despite the video evidence, a grand jury declined to\n> indict Garner's killer, leading to widespread outrage and protest. (In an\n> ironic twist, the only person indicted in connection with Garner's death was\n> Orta, who came under police scrutiny and was arrested on an \"unrelated\"\n> weapons possession charge. Orta is now in prison in New York. Sousveillance\n> is not without its costs.)\"^[69]\n\nHowever, it appeared that a filmed abusive behavior is more likely to be\npunished if the video is widely spread. This makes sousveillance more\nefficient and politically meaningful, insofar it shows to a significant\nproportion of the population the abuses of the authority. Thus, the\ndevelopment of video platforms, like YouTube and Snapchat, and streaming\nplatforms like Periscope and Twitch, are key components to sousveillance's\nefficiency. This was shown during French demonstrations against the \"Loi\nTravail\" in 2016, during which a Periscope stream showing authority forces,\ncalled abusive by one part of the demonstrators, was watched by 93,362\npeople.^[70] This video was posted on Twitter.^[71] Nevertheless, it can be\nconsidered whether this creates a dangerous dependence on private platforms,\noften ruled by Internet giants (like Google, for YouTube) which have common\ninterests with governments, and who adapt their content through algorithms\nusers don't have control on.\n\nIn addition, some argue that sousveillance may aid in state surveillance,\ndespite being conducted by the people. Examples include mobile apps used to\nhelp people signal public threats, such as the Israeli app c-Now (previously\nknown as Reporty). In January 2018, c-Now was tested in Nice by the mayor\nChristian Estrosi, sparking virulent public debates, with security advocates\nreporting spyware associated with the app^[72] Furthermore, the director of\nc-Now is Ehud Barack, former prime minister of Israel, who is suspected to\nhave kept close links with Israeli and American governments.^[73] For these\nreasons, security advocates consider the app to serve America's global\nsurveillance program (revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013), and raise the\nquestion of whether sousveillance really serves as \"inverse surveillance\".\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Body camera\n  * Eyetap\n  * Helmet camera\n  * Lifelogging\n  * Memoto\n  * Quantified self\n  * Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\n  * Surveillance capitalism\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c \"Sousveillance: Inventing and Using Wearable Computing Devices...
