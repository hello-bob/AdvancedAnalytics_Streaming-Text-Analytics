These are technical ways for\napplications to authenticate users with the OSM website or API. OAuth 1.0a and\nHTTP Basic Auth have been deprecated since 2023, as OAuth 2.0 is now the\nstandard authorization method for most systems.\n\nThere are three key dates in the transition process:\n\n  * March 1st, 2024: New OAuth 1.0a application registrations were disabled. Existing applications were not impacted. HTTP Basic Auth was not impacted.\n  * May 1st, 2024: System administrators will start brownouts to find applications that are still using OAuth 1.0a or HTTP Basic Auth.\n  * June 1st, 2024: OAuth 1.0a and HTTP Basic Auth will be shut down.\n\nRetiring these authentication methods is necessary because of security\nconcerns, and the complexity of maintaining so many authorization\nimplementations, including ones that rely on unmaintained components.\n\n## How does this impact me as a developer?\n\nIf you are a developer of an application using OAuth 1.0a or HTTP Basic Auth\nto log in to the OpenStreetMap.org website, you might need to make some\nchanges to switch to OAuth 2.0. Fortunately, this is a well-supported industry\nstandard.\n\nIf your application only makes read calls to the API, authorization is\noptional. For rate-limiting purposes, it is still a good idea to add\nauthorization to your requests, but it is not required. If your application is\na website using OSM for logins, making use of OAuth 2.0 is much easier as it\nis much better supported because so many other sites use it. It also avoids\nproblems like users ending up with many tokens in their list on the website.\n\nIf you are developing software that edits using the API and is run locally,\nyou may need to make code changes. All common languages have libraries that\ndeal with OAuth 2, and libraries are the preferred choice for any\nauthorization. You can also use Zverik\u2019s library for command-line tools, or\nwrite your own shell script of about a dozen lines.\n\nYou should be able to find lots of examples online of OAuth 2 client\nimplementations in your language. If you want to get more detailed information\nor ask technical questions, please use the GitHub ticket. Here, the OWG also\ntracks the applications requiring modification to use OAuth 2.0.\n\n## How does this impact me as a mapper?\n\nMost mappers will notice no change. The transition will not affect how you log\nin to your OSM account or use the website. iD and JOSM have supported OAuth\n2.0 as the default authentication method for some time. If you use your OSM\naccount to log in to a third-party site like the HOT Tasking Manager,\nMapRoulette, or HDYC, you will not be impacted as those sites have already\nmoved to OAuth 2.0. Read-only API access does not require authorization at\nall.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation, formed to\nsupport the OpenStreetMap Project.
