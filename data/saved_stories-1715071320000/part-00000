In the same interview, Altman referred to\nChatGPT as \"incredibly dumb,\" and in a separate interview with The Harvard\nCrimson, promised that GPT-5, his firm's highly-anticipated update to its\nlarge language model (LLM), would not be.\n\n\"The most important thing to say about GPT-5 versus GPT-4 is just that it\u2019ll\nbe smarter,\" the Stanford dropout told the Harvard student paper. \"It\u2019s not\nthat it\u2019s better in this way or that way.\"\n\n\"The fact that we can make progress across all model behavior and capabilities\nat once \u2014 I think that\u2019s the miracle,\" he continued.\n\n## Expectations vs. Reality\n\nAs has been evident for a while now, talking a big game about the future of AI\nis very much a part of Altman's job description.\n\nIn the roughly 18 months since OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT upon the world, he's\nrepeatedly discussed his fears of how badly things could go awry with the\ntechnology while insisting his company is creating the lesser of AI evils.\n\nWithin a few months of the release of GPT-4 in March 2023, however,\nexpectations had begun bucking up against reality \u2014 which Altman, to his\ncredit, now jokes about.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s awesome that for two weeks, everybody was freaking out about\nChatGPT-4, and then by the third week, everyone was like, 'Come on, where\u2019s\nGPT-5?'\" Altman quipped during a discussion with MIT president Sally Kornbluth\nsoon after his Harvard talks. \"I think that says something legitimately great\nabout human expectation and striving and why we all have to make things\nbetter.\"\n\nAs always, the CEO remained cryptic about when exactly GPT-5 might be\ndropping, refusing to provide a timeline.\n\nAs MIT Tech notes, he responded to a reporter's question about when GPT-5\nwould be released during his Cambridge press tour by simply saying \"yes.\"\n\nMore on Altman: Sam Altman Is Running Out of Orbs\n\nShare This Article\n\nAI Police\n\nCops Using AI That Automatically Generates Police Reports From Body Cam\nFootage\n\nApr 23, 4:30 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nEmad and Satya Sitting in a Tree\n\nOusted Founder of Stability AI Seen Meeting With Microsoft CEO\n\nMar 26, 2:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nTry a Little Harder\n\nIn Cringe Video, OpenAI CTO Says She Doesn\u2019t Know Where Sora\u2019s Training Data\nCame From\n\nMar 15, 9:01 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nButthurt\n\nOpenAI Ridicules Elon Musk's \"Incoherent\" Lawsuit\n\nMar 12, 10:12 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
