Whether it\nis based on the market, internet or random street surveys, the answer from the\nmajority is overwhelming: In-N-Out is their favorite burger joint. A far cry\nfrom the household names and numbers of global companies like McDonald\u2019s, Five\nGuys or Burger King, this chain operates only 400 restaurants in eight of the\ncountry\u2019s 50 states, mostly in the West, and only serves a dozen or so regular\nproducts. In its 75 years of existence, its success has been slow but steady\nand, without leaving family hands, it has never closed any restaurants (with\none curious exception: the first, the original one, was demolished for the\nconstruction of a highway, but was relocated very close by). However, now\nneither its burgers and shakes nor the handsome profits they generate have\nmanaged to stall the closure of one of its establishments for the first time.\nCrime in Northern California\u2019s Bay Area has forced Oakland\u2019s only restaurant\nto call it a day.\n\nIn-N-Out is so popular in California (also in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and it\nsoon will be in New Mexico and Tennessee) that reports of this first shutdown\nhave made headlines in the local news. Rumors surfaced in late January, but\nwere not confirmed until late March, when their Oakland location bid farewell\non the 25th at 1 a.m., after a non-stop day of serving their famous double\nburgers and Animal Fries, French fries with fried onions, melted cheese and\ntheir secret and delicious Animal Sauce. By March 31, the famous yellow sign\nand decorative elements were gone. Only a white building remained.\n\nThe famous hamburger restaurant has been forced to close following a surge in\nrobberies, especially violent ones. Despite its tremendous success, it has not\nbeen able to endure the rampant crime in the area. With more than 27,000\nemployees nationwide \u2014 it is believed to be one of the best companies to work\nfor \u2014 and around 20% margin on its products (at highly affordable prices,\nespecially as California is one of the most expensive places on the planet),\nthe company had an estimated revenue of $575 million last year. Its stores are\nnot franchised: since being founded by Harry and Esther Snyder in 1948, they\nhave been owned by the Snyder family, whose sole heiress, granddaughter Lynsi\nSnyder, has amassed a fortune of nearly $7 billion, according to Forbes. The\nincrease in the minimum wage in the restaurant industry in California, which\nwas raised to $20 an hour on April 1, has also not affected the chain\u2019s\nrevenues for the time being.\n\nThe Oakland establishment, near San Francisco, was still making a profit and\nwas therefore the first to close (in these 75 years many of them have been\nrelocated, but have never closed). \u201cWe feel the frequency and severity of the\ncrimes being encountered by our customers and associates leave us no\nalternative,\u201d regretted the chain\u2019s chief operating officer, Denny Warnick, in\na statement published by Associated Press. \u201cDespite taking repeated steps to\ncreate safer conditions, our customers and associates are regularly victimized\nby car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies,\u201d bemoaned\nWarnick, who said they could no longer ask anyone to come to the\nestablishment, not even \u201cto visit or work in an unsafe environment.\u201d Employees\nhave been relocated to nearby establishments or, for those who preferred, have\nhad the opportunity to depart with a severance payment.\n\nDespite the fact that the U.S. has seen violent crime rates falling for more\nthan two years (down more than 8.3% in 2023, according to CNN data, which\ncites the FBI), Oakland has experienced an uptick in violent crime, up as much\nas 21% last year over 2022. In addition, fentanyl is on the loose in the area.\nThe terrible opiate, 50 times more powerful than heroin, whose use has now\nbeen declared an epidemic, is rampant in the city. The drug is fast acting and\ncheap, and it is estimated that one person in the country dies every five\nminutes from its use. It has already killed more Americans than the Vietnam\nWar and Afghanistan combined. In Oakland, news of seizures and overdoses is\ncontinuous, and muggings and robberies have been linked to the drug.\n\nThis has prompted businesses such as Starbucks and the supermarket Target to\nclose in the area; another fast-food chain, Denny\u2019s, has announced that it\nwill be the next to leave. The mayor of Oakland, Sheng Thao, said on local\ntelevision that they have placed more police on patrol, but they understand\nthat more needs to be done. In addition to being the only one in the city,\nthis shut-down In-N-Out site was very close to Oakland Airport, a key Bay Area\nhub, as it is just 20 minutes from downtown San Francisco and has a throughput\nof about 11 million passengers annually. When landing, visitors will no longer\nbe grabbing burgers on their way in.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Nitazenes, the powerful street drug up to 40 times stronger than fentanyl\n\nChristopher P.
