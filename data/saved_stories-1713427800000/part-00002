expected to grow 3.2% in 2024, the IMF said in its latest World\nEconomic Outlook published Tuesday, exceeding the forecast growth rates for\nthe U.S. (2.7%), the U.K. (0.5%), Germany (0.2%) and France (0.7%).\n\nThe prediction will be galling for Western nations which have sought to\neconomically isolate and punish Russia for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia says Western sanctions on its critical industries have made it more\nself-sufficient and that private consumption and domestic investment remain\nresilient. Meanwhile, continuing oil and commodity exports to the likes of\nIndia and China, as well as alleged sanctions evasion and high oil prices,\nhave allowed it to maintain robust oil export revenues.\n\nIn this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia\u2019s\nPresident Vladimir Putin visits Uralvagonzavod, the country\u2019s main tank\nfactory in the Urals, in Nizhny Tagil, on Feb. 15, 2024.\n\nRamil Sitdikov | Afp | Getty Images\n\nRussia\u2019s military-industrial complex has also expanded significantly during\nthe war as defense spending and production have rocketed. In short, Russia has\nadapted to a \u201cnew normal\u201d as its economy has been put on a war footing.\n\nThe IMF predicted that Russia\u2019s economic growth would moderate in 2025,\nhowever, declining to 1.8% \u201cas the effects of high investment and robust\nprivate consumption, supported by wage growth in a tight labor market, fade.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based IMF includes the U.S., U.K., the euro area\u2019s largest\neconomies, Canada and Japan as advanced economies. Russia, China and India\nremain in its \u201cemerging and developing\u201d Europe and Asia categories,\nrespectively.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin observes a Tupolev TU-160 strategic jet\nbomber while visiting an aviation plant on Feb. 21, 2024, in Kazan, Russia.\n\nContributor | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe head of the IMF told CNBC in February that the Russian economy was still\nfacing significant headwinds despite the Fund\u2019s rosy forecasts for the country\nof roughly 145 million people.\n\n\u201cWhat it [the growth data] tells us is that this is a war economy in which the\nstate \u2014 which let\u2019s remember, had a very sizeable buffer, built over many\nyears of fiscal discipline \u2014 is investing in this war economy,\u201d IMF Managing\nDirector Kristalina Georgieva told CNBC\u2019s Dan Murphy at the World Governments\nSummit in Dubai in February.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Russia, today, production goes up, [for the] military, [and]\nconsumption goes down. And that is pretty much what the Soviet Union used to\nlook like. High level of production, low level of consumption.\u201d\n\n## Read more\n\nRussia\u2019s economy \u2018in for very tough times\u2019 despite improved growth outlook,\nIMF managing director says\n\nGeorgieva said she believed the Russian economy also faced challenges related\nto an exodus of skilled workers and \u201cbecause of the reduced access to\ntechnology that comes with ... sanctions.\u201d\n\nBank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina told lawmakers in Russia\u2019s State\nDuma on April 8 that production in the country is being constrained by worker\nshortages, according to Reuters, although she noted that Russia\u2019s economy was\ncontinuing to grow at an impressive rate.\n\nAndrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLast week, Nabiullina also sounded a note of optimism over Russia\u2019s inflation\nrate (at 7.7% in March), saying she believed the peak had passed, although it\nwas too early to start cutting rates.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank is expected to hold its key rate at 16% at its next\nrate-setting meeting on April 26, a Reuters poll showed last month. Analysts\npolled by Reuters expect rates to stand at 12.5% by the end of 2024, Reuters\nreported last week, far above the central bank\u2019s inflation target of 4%.\n\nHaving begun his fifth term in office, Russian President Vladimir Putin has\nvowed to raise living standards in Russia, with increased spending on\neducation, health care and public infrastructure. He also signaled that taxes\non larger companies and wealthier individuals will rise.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Natasha Turak contributed to this report.\n\nTV\n\nFast MoneyWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Mad Money 06:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
