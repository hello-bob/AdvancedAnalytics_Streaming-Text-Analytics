Clarke\n\nTry to imagine the you of twenty years ago holding a Rabbit R1, or using a\ncell phone or being able to listen to every song, ever recorded, for just a\nfew dollars a month.\n\nWe don\u2019t just take these once magic items for granted, now we express\nfrustration that they\u2019re not better or cheaper or faster. The fade is real and\nthe half-life continues to get shorter.\n\nIt\u2019s a sort of hedonic treadmill of tech, where we not only take a\nbreakthrough for granted in just a short time, but we also raise the bar for\nwhat counts as magic next time.\n\nIf we depend on outside forces to find wonder and awe, we\u2019re going to end up\ndisappointed.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to wait for a new technology to feel the magic. Instead, we have\nthe chance to erase our expectations and simply notice it wherever we look.\n\nMay 7, 2024\n\nShare This\n\nFacebook\n\n### Share on Mastodon\n\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
