The place has a good\nreputation. Some folks are in awe at the temples and the gardens, others at\nthe nature or the food. The extreme tidiness and civility of the local culture\nare the target of universal admiration. But many of those same people see the\nlocal language as an almost impenetrable barrier, a world of pain that one\nmust go through in order to be allowed to live here. I must be so patient and\nsmart, they think. But I (begrudgingly) have to tell them that it's not\nentirely true.\n\nThe thing is (I tell those people) the language is part of the wonders of the\nplace. It was the biggest charm for me in the first place. It's complex, yes,\nbut it's rich and quirky and different. In particular, a whole realm of\nconsciousness exists in the sphere of Japanese speakers that's perhaps truly\nunique in the world, more so than the sushi and the nature and decorum. It\neven allows for new literary techniques that are unimaginable in any other\nlanguage.\n\nUsually this is the point when I lose my interlocutor. I might as well be\nspeaking Japanese to them.\n\nI've always wanted to explain that realm, to show what a strange and mind-\nbending world is accessed by learning Japanese. It feels almost impossible. In\nthis rather long and winding post, I'll try anyway. I'll do my best to convey\nsomething that's damn near untranslatable. Whether this is a rabbit hole you\nwant to tumble down with me, that's up to you.\n\n## The Things I'm Not Talking About\n\nUnless you've studied the language for a good while, you might only be aware\nof one or more of the following strange-sounding facets of Japanese:\n\n  1. It uses kanji characters for writing (more on this later), and it uses a whole lot of them. Depending on who you ask, there are four, five or more thousand characters in use, and you can't read a newspaper if you don't know at least 2,000 of the more common ones.\n  2. There are also two syllabic scripts (syllable-based alphabets) in use, called hiragana and katakana. These two, plus kanji, are used all together, sometimes but not always interchangeably.\n  3. There are lots of \"untranslatable\" words in Japanese, like the salutation \u304a\u75b2\u308c\u69d8 (otsukare-sama), roughly meaning \"I appreciate the hard work you've been doing\", and \u3082\u3063\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3044 (mottainai) for \"it would be a pity not to enjoy that to its fullest value\".\n  4. Exotic-sounding grammar features like the subject-object-verb sentence structure (i.e. \"anteater ant eat\") and the lack of important-sounding grammatical elements like articles (\"the\", \"a\"), any singular-plural distinction, and most verb tenses familiar to English/Romance language speakers.\n  5. It's very vague and context dependent.\n\nThese aspects give the language an arcane and difficult-sounding aura, but\nnone of them is truly unique to Japanese. Chinese, for instance, uses way more\ncharacters and has an even more bare-bones grammar. All languages have\nuntranslatable terms. And several other cultures routinely employ multiple\nwriting systems. These aren't the things I mean by \"a truly unique realm\", and\nthey're not the topic of this post.\n\nWhat's usually not known are the subtle effects of the strange history of the\nJapanese tongue. These effects are, I believe, absolutely unique to this\nlanguage, with no parallel anywhere else in the world. On top of that, native\nJapanese speakers are usually so accustomed to these quirks that they never\ngive them a second thought. So no one\u2014except, I guess, some linguists\u2014ever\ntalks or thinks about these fascinating aspects of Japanese. I write about\nthem here because, well, that's mottainai.\n\nIt took me a while to put my finger on it, but now I know what the source of\nthat uniqueness is: it's the unstoppable, wonderful dissociation between\nwhat's written and what is spoken in Japanese. To see how that could have\nhappened, we need to take a step back.\n\n## Dissociated from Birth: a History\n\nThe Japanese language existed in purely oral form for centuries, until\nmainland scholars brought Chinese characters to the Japanese islands. That\nhappened in the 5th century C.E. These characters are, unlike the western\nalphabets, \"logograms\", that is, each character is associated with a specific\nmeaning.\n\nChinese and Japanese are enormously different spoken languages. Except for a\nlarge number of words imported directly into Japanese (but evolved to sound\nquite unlike the originals), the two languages have essentially nothing in\ncommon. The pronunciation, the grammar, everything is 180\u00b0 different. A\nconsequence of this is that those Chinese characters, evolved over millennia\nto fit the Chinese language like a glove, were a bad match for the way the\nislanders spoke.\n\nImagine those poor scholars of the Yamato court in Western Japan in the 7th\ncentury. They must have been intrigued by this revolutionary technology called\n\"writing\", where you could freeze your words onto a stone or the blade of a\nsword so that others may understand it later. Why leave it to the Chinese\nimmigrants? Why not master it for their own native language?\n\nExcept it must have been excruciatingly difficult. The characters were meant\nto be used as modular building blocks\u2014a kind of modularity that Japanese just\ndidn't have.\n\nNot many depictions of scholars from the Kofun period survive (they must have\nbeen too busy wrangling the kanji), but warrior statues abound. So here is a\nwarrior.\n\nWhile Chinese uses fixed \"plug-and-play\" markers to indicate tenses and and\ngrammatical functions, on this front Japanese is more similar to English,\nbecause it modifies the very shape of words for those things. So in Chinese\nyou say \"ch\u012b\" for \"eat\" and \"ch\u012ble\" for \"ate\". The \"le\" part indicates an\naction that has completed, and it can be strapped onto any verb to turn it\ninto a past tense. So those two spoken words can be neatly segregated into\nwritten logograms: \u5403 (\"ch\u012b\") for the present tense, and \u5403\u4e86 (\"ch\u012b\" + \"le\") for\nthe past.\n\nCompare that to English where we transform \"eat\" into \"ate\", and the\nequivalent Japanese modification of \"taberu\" into \"tabeta\". In both cases\nwe're not adding or removing blocks but changing part of the word to convey\nthe difference. In techie terms, the Chinese script doesn't support the\nstructure of languages like English and Japanese. It doesn't have what it\ntakes.\n\nThe only solution for those early Japanese scribes, then, was to do a lot of\nshoehorning. And boy, did they shoehorn.\n\nThe Japanese scholars-aristocrats began repurposing the Chinese characters,\nwhich they called kanji (for, well, \"Chinese characters\"). Sometimes, instead\nof using them for their meaning, they used them for (gasp!) their\npronunciation. By ignoring the original content of a kanji, they could string\nthem together to form almost any sound.\n\nTo a Chinese reader, such words would have looked utterly random, devoid of\nany coherence or structure. But to a trained Japanese, they translated into\nfamiliar words.\n\nOver the centuries those \"sound-only\" kanji, called man'yougana, evolved into\nsomething else entirely. They became simpler, more streamlined, and more\nstandardized. Where the symbols were originally composed of many short\nstrokes, they gradually lost detail and complexity. Where the scribes could\nchoose between a slew of different kanji for any given sound (for instance,\nthe sound pa could be represented by any of 20 characters), later the number\nof options dwindled and eventually settled to two.\n\nThat's how the two syllable-based alphabets in use today, hiragana and\nkatakana, came about (collectively kana). For example, this is how the sound\nfor \"i\" (pronounced \"ee\") evolved from two separate kanji into respective kana\npronounced exactly the same.\n\nWith this new sound-based tool invented by the islanders, finally the Japanese\nlanguage had a suitably flexible way to write anything one could pronounce.\nToday full-blown kanji are used for their meaning, while hiragana and katakana\nare used for sound-based writing and grammar stuff.\n\n(By the way, the application of Chinese characters to other languages happened\nin several other places, like Korea and Vietnam, but only Japanese still\nretains the writing system today, making it a unique case among contemporary\nlanguages.)\n\nAnd so, thanks to this grafting of one language's way of writing into a vastly\ndifferent tongue, a dissociation was born. Japanese is a language where the\nspoken and the written co-evolved in directions never seen elsewhere. The\ndifferences in grammatical structure are only part of the story. Let's start\nwith the basics.\n\n## Anomaly 1: One Way to Write It, Many Ways to Read It\n\nLike most language pairs, there was rarely a one-to-one correspondence between\nChinese and Japanese words. Often a single Chinese word or character could\nmerely approximate the meaning of several spoken Japanese words. Each of those\nlocal words might have been related to the others, but it carried a different\nnuance. Even so, for lack of a better solution, often the same kanji was used\nfor all the various meanings.\n\nThis had two major effects. First, while in any Chinese language each\ncharacter is associated with a single way to speak it, in Japanese every kanji\ncan be pronounced in multiple, very different ways. This part is perhaps the\nbiggest bane of Japanese students.\n\nExtreme cases have 15+ different pronunciations (readings) for a single kanji!\nFor example, the kanji for \"life\":\n\nSome of these pronunciations are common, others quite rare, but you need to\nknow and be able to discriminate most of them in order to correctly read and\nwrite modern Japanese.\n\nThe second effect of the imperfect match between the written word and the\nmeanings it is associated with is a kind of \"chronic looseness\" in the\nconversion of language to and from writing. A Japanese reader isn't expected\nto correctly pronounce everything. New, unfamiliar words will be opaque to\nthem. In a sense, this is similar to English, only much worse.\n\nIn English, the question is usually about the right way to pronounce a vowel\nor two. As is clear from the example just above, in Japanese, sometimes you\ndon't know if the kanji for life has to be read as \"nasu\" or \"shou\". Add to\nthat the huge number of kanji in circulation, and in many cases you have\nabsolutely nothing to work with. If you haven't seen the kanji before, you\nhave zero hints about the right sounds to make.\n\nJapanese has a trick up her sleeve to solve this problem, called furigana.\nThese are tiny kana characters showing you how to pronounce a difficult kanji.\n\nA sign in a train station. It's often impossible to guess the pronunciation of\nplace names, hence the furigana above the official kanji name. Source:\nWikipedia.\n\nKids keep on learning new fundamental kanji until the end of high school, so\nthey wouldn't be able to read without extensive application of furigana.\nAdults are able to survive with less furigana, but you'll still find them on\nthe rarer words that people might not have encountered before (or for which\nthey might have forgotten the reading). For example, this is a page I opened\nat random from a Haruki Murakami non-fiction book.\n\nIn the whole page, only one kanji word (a somewhat rare way to say \"mock\") has\nthe pronunciation spelled out with furigana (those two tiny squiggles between\nthe lines).\n\nRemember this part about furigana, because they'll come up again in the\nfollowing sections.\n\nNow for a practical consequence: people need to get creative just to teach\nothers how to write their names.\n\n## Anomaly 2: Spelling Bee, but Creative\n\nThere is one problem that arises because of how kanji work: how do you explain\nwhich character you're talking about without writing it down?\n\nThis happens all the time with people's names. The Japanese like to choose\nnice and distinctive kanji for their names, even when using common name\npronunciations (another instance of dissociation: common name readings on\nunheard-of kanji choices are all the rage this century). This means that, just\nby hearing what someone is called, you're usually unable to write it down.\n\nSo people have to explain the kanji to you, and they do it by telling you\nwhich other well-known words each kanji appears in, or how it is built from\nsimpler components.\n\nPerhaps the most famous scene showing the hoops you have to jump through just\nto explain your name's spelling. It's from the manga \"Death Note\". Here the\nwoman is giving a fake name, but soon afterwards Raito finds out her real name\nand uses it to kill her real quick.\n\n## Anomaly 3: Breaking Out of the Box\n\nReading is made more difficult by the frequent use of jukujikun, words where\nthe pronunciation is not the combination of the normal readings of the\nindividual kanji contained. In these cases there isn't any correspondence\nbetween parts of the spoken word and the kanji that represent it.\n\nJapanese has a lot of compound words of Chinese origin, where two or more\nkanji appear as a set. These compounds are usually very straightforward\nsequences of kanji readings. So \u7f8e\u8853 (bijutsu), meaning art, is the combination\nof \u7f8e (\"bi\", beauty) and \u8853 (jutsu, skill). If you're confident about the\nindividual sounds, you just have to say them one after the other. Finally\nsomething simple!\n\nBut no, you can't let your guard down. The shoehorning work of the ancients\nhas left deformations that survive in the modern language.\n\nTake, for example, the word for \"adult\". It's pronounced otona and written \u5927\u4eba,\nthe kanji for \"big\" and \"person\" respectively. Following the usual method, you\nmight wonder, is oto a pronunciation of the first kanji, and na of the second?\nOr is it o and tona?\n\nWell, neither. There is no way to split them. The two-kanji word exists as a\nsingle block, and looking up each kanji separately won't yield even a bit of\nthis word's true reading. There are many examples like that.\n\nA bull-headed shrike. Source: Alpsdake, Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nIn some cases, the number of kanji is longer than the number of syllables in\nthe word! Try splitting that up.\n\n## Anomaly 4: Two Words in a Trench Coat\n\nBut, despite all of its difficulties, this dissociation of writing and\nspeaking opens up some interesting opportunities.\n\nFor example, there is a category of verbs that I find fascinating. As far as I\nknow, it has no official academic name, and I've never heard anyone else even\nmention this. I would describe them as \"two words in a trench coat\". In each\ncase, you can see how two simpler verbs were chained and wrapped with a single\nkanji.\n\nFor example, the verb \u53f8\u308b (tsukasadoru), meaning \"to be in charge\" seems pretty\ninnocent at first. It's one kanji plus its hiragana ending indicating the\ntense, like all other verbs. But look up the etymology, and you'll find that\nit used to be two words: \u5b98 (tsukasa) for \"position of authority\" and \u53d6\u308b (toru)\nfor \"take\". Each of these two words has its own kanji and independent meaning.\nBut over the years, their combined form became so routine that someone decided\nto give it its own different kanji, probably for no other reason than\nconvenience. Here are a couple more cases:\n\nThese fusions are like language fossils. It shows that kanji are only an\nafter-the-fact addition to a pre-existing vocabulary. But at a practical\nlevel, they're a way to exploit the looseness of Japanese writing to make\nwriting more convenient (notice how short the final written words are compared\nto the original).\n\n## Anomaly 5: Make the kanji Work for You\n\nIn Anomaly 1 I said that one kanji can be ambiguous in terms of its\npronunciation. But the flip side of the same phenomenon is that kanji can help\nreduce ambiguity in meaning, increasing the precision of the written word.\n\nSpoken Japanese is actually rather poor in vocabulary. A lot of its verbs are\nreused in very different contexts with different meanings that are only\nrelated in a very abstract way. Thanks to the unique slap-it-on-and-you're-\nready-to-go mindset of Japanese writing, however, the vagueness can be pared\ndown a lot.\n\nThere is a surprising number of verbs that have exactly the same\npronunciation, but are written with different kanji in different contexts. For\nexample:\n\nThe cool thing here is that these are all different meanings, but if you\nsquint you can see how they must have originated from the same primordial\nword. They started with a generic, blunt verb (e.g. toru, to take), and later\napplied to it different kanji to distinguish its nuances. Handy!\n\nThere are also non-verbs examples of this trick. My favorite are all the\nversions of the word \"cousins\" meant in a reciprocal sense, as in \"she and I\nare cousins (of each other)\". In spoken language, you just say itoko in all\ncases, and that's it. In written language, you use the appropriate\ncombinations of the kanji \u5144 (ani, older brother), \u5f1f (otouto, younger brother),\n\u59c9 (ane, older sister), and \u59b9 (imouto, younger sister), preceded by the kanji \u5f93\n(shitagau, accompany), to specify the exact genders in the relationship.\n(These are also jukujikun, come to think of it.)\n\nYou can use kanji, then, to add a layer of meaning that doesn't exist in the\nspoken language. Which brings us to the last and, in my opinion, most\ninteresting point.\n\n## Anomaly 6: Dissociation as Canvas\n\nFinally we come to gikun, the most exquisite (ab)use of the rift between\nwritten and spoken Japanese. It's based on the clever use of furigana, the\nlittle pronunciation marks explained above. Ninety-nine percent of the time,\npeople use furigana as you would expect\u2014plainly indicating the correct\ndictionary reading of each word. But once you have a tool, who can resist\nplaying with it?\n\nGikun is the replacement of a kanji's or word's normal pronunciation with\nsomething else through furigana. Novelists and manga-ka use it to inject an\nalmost subliminal layer of meaning beyond what is afforded by the words and\nkanji. It achieves an effect similar to a textual voice over, at the same time\nas the actual text you're reading.\n\nYou see it a lot in manga: the actual kanji say something, but the furigana,\ninstead of giving you the true pronunciation of the word, give you something\nelse entirely. Sometimes it's a synonym of the word with a more pungent\nnuance. For example:\n\nSource: Boku no Hero Academia, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThe author of the excellent gikun explanaton on japanesewithanime.com\nclarifies the context:\n\n> Todoroki Shouto \u8f5f\u7126\u51cd has both cold and heat abilities, which come from the\n> sides of his body: from the right comes cold, from the left comes heat.\n\nHere Shouto, the protagonist, is telling the flame-y man \"during combat, I\nwon't use my heat power for any reason at all.\" Being a kids' comic, all kanji\nhave furigana. But the kanji for \"heat\" (highlighted in red) comes with an\nunexpected reading. Instead of the official netsu, the furigana reads hidari,\nwhich means \"left\".\n\nSo the reader gets two messages at the same time: the character says \"I won't\nuse the left\", but the text is saying \"I won't use heat\".\n\nSometimes, authors use gikun for the luxury of introducing cool foreign-\nsounding words while simultaneously providing the meaning for it through\nkanji.\n\nSource: Full-Metal Alchemist, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nAnd the context from japanesewithanime.com:\n\n> Good guy with mechanical arm fights bad guy with mechanical arm.\n\nThe blond guy says, \"Oh, an automail colleague?\" to say that they both have\nmechanical arms. But \"automail\" isn't a real word, and the Japanese reader may\nnot guess the etymology of \"automatic\" + \"mail (armor)\". So the meaning is\nprovided by the kanji (literally \"mechanical armor\"), and the word \"automail\"\ncomes as furigana above that. Again, you get two things in one swoop: a\nneologism and its meaning.\n\nOther times it's simply a clarification of the word in that specific context.\n\nSource: Noragami, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThe context:\n\n> Yato \u591c\u30c8, who is a God fighting spiritual beings related to human's negative\n> feelings, goes to the hospital make [sic] a visit to someone...\n\nThe off-screen speaker is saying, \"Tonight will be rough too. This place is\ntheir nest. Now that the regalia aren't with us, we shouldn't stay long.\" (I\nassume the \"regalia\" are some kind of warrior.) In this case the words \"this\nplace\" appear as furigana for the word \"hospital\". The kanji say \"hospital\",\nthe reading says \"here/this place\". Through gikun, the author is avoiding\nconfusion on the current location of the characters.\n\nSome novelists use this dissociation for artistic effect, too. Horror-mystery\nwriter Natsuhiko Kyogoku, who loves to create the Japanese version of a Gothic\natmosphere, constantly uses archaic, long-forgotten kanji in his brick-sized\nnovels. You, as the average Japanese reader, probably have never seen most of\nthose kanji before, but you're able to follow without problems thanks to his\ngikun. The furigana expose the modern, recognizable readings that you can\nrecognize, even though they are not the real readings of those obsolete kanji.\n\nKyogoku's gikun shenanigans are a bit too much at times. Someone who uses them\nmore sparingly and subtly is Haruki Murakami.\n\nThis is a page from his novel Norwegian Wood. Jay Rubin, the novel's English\ntranslator, worded the highlighted sentence like this:\n\n> What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly\n> important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?\n\nBut the word \"limbo\" (pointed by the arrow) in the original is actually a\ngikun. The Japanese reader sees two things at once: the kanji with the meaning\nof \"a remote region\"\u2014normally pronounced hendo\u2014and the katakana pronunciation\nof the foreign word \"limbo\" as furigana next to it.\n\nThe Japanese language does have more accurate words for \"limbo\", words with a\nstronger link to the original catholic meaning of the word, but Murakami\ndecided not to use them.\n\nThis little choice, seen by the reader in a fleeting instant as they devour\nthe pages, and likely not even noticed consciously, is doing a lot of work.\nIt's indulging in the mystical-sounding foreign word \"limbo\", but it's also\nclarifying the general meaning of liminal space for the readers unfamiliar\nwith it. It's making the metaphor of an actual hidden place within oneself\nstronger, while avoiding overly religious undertones. In short, this gikun\nalters the flavor of the word a tiny bit, just enough to achieve the thematic\nand stylistic goals of the sentence. Like a pinch of nutmeg in your butter\ncake.\n\nHow is one to translate that?\n\nIt's difficult to convey what it feels like to read in this way. For me, back\nwhen I started reading in Japanese some 16 years ago, it was a totally new\nexperience, something that I never thought would be possible with text. It's\nlike reading in stereo, where sometimes the same message is conveyed to you in\ntwo different formats on separate channels, and sometimes two messages blend\ntogether as something new.\n\nBecause of the unique dissociation between the written word and the way it is\npronounced, Japanese is not only harder to learn, but it's also more malleable\nand richer in a way that cannot be imitated. It's an extra dimension of\nlanguage and a happy historical accident. \u25cf\n\nAll content is licensed under\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": true}
