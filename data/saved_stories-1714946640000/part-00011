It\u2019s a sad story that reveals much about Bezos\u2019 ruthless\ncorporate ways, so let\u2019s dig into the tale of Ted Jorgensen and see what\nhappened to him and the spawn he created.\n\nBezos\u2019 father died back in 2015, long after giving young Jeffrey up for\nadoption. He died with a net worth of about a half million dollars without\never reuniting with his son.\n\n### Early Days\n\nBezos was born to Ted Jorgensen and Jackie Gise, when the couple were both\nteenagers. A year later, Gise filed for divorce, where she met and married\nMiguel Bezos. In 1968, she moved to Houston with Miguel, who adopted Jeff, and\nshe asked Jorgensen not to interfere with their lives. Jorgensen complied with\nher request, and as result he never learned about the success of his\nbiological son.\n\n### A Fork in the Road\n\nHis involvement with Jeff basically ended in 1974, when he moved to Phoenix\nand then Glendale, Arizona and bought a bike shop called the Road Runner Bike\nCentre. There he earned a reputation for good customer service and excellent\nprices, something Jeff inherited.\n\nBezos\u2019 reaction to all this has fascinated his biographers, the paparazzi, and\nfans. He considers Miguel his \u201creal\u201d father, basically, and even though Jeff\nknew where Jorgensen was, he never wanted to meet him.\n\nJorgensen freely acknowledges that he wasn\u2019t a good husband or father, largely\ndue to the drinking he was doing at the time. When he was tracked down by one\nof Bezos\u2019 biographers, he was shocked to learn what had become of his son.\n\nHe said he never wanted anything from him, and Jorgensen continued to abide by\nthe agreement he\u2019d made with Gise. Ted did want to see him, but that meeting\nnever happened, largely because of Jeff\u2019s unwillingness to go there,\napparently.\n\nJorgensen did have a happy ending of sorts when it comes to parenting,\nhowever. He remarried and became a devoted stepfather to four children. He\nalso became a grandparent, doting on ten grandchildren during his final years.\n\nAs for Jeffrey, he apparently met the love of his life at the bottom of a\nbalance sheet. He\u2019s divorced now, but he remains greatly devoted to his\nenormous fortune and his occasional forays into outer space.\n\n### Dying Wishes\n\nPerhaps the saddest part of this story is the ending. Jorgensen\u2019s final wish\nbefore dying was to meet Jeff again, but Bezos still refused. Jeff Bezos did\nsend him a letter, and perhaps it even contained an Amazon gift card as a\nparting gesture of reconciliation.\n\nShare.

The best part was that\nhe did get to meet his child after she changed the last name to her other\nhusband\u2019s name. In weakness we are strong.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave A Reply Cancel Reply\n\n##### Editors' Picks\n\n##### The 20 Richest YouTubers Updated for 2024\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n##### 10 Most Successful Shark Tank Products\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n##### What Happened to Erik Per Sullivan?
