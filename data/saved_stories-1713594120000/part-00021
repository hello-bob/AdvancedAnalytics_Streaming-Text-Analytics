Apple also\nremoved Telegram and Signal from China.\n\n\"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even\nwhen we disagree,\" Apple said in a statement quoted by several news outlets.\n\"The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from\nthe China storefront based on their national security concerns. These apps\nremain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal paraphrased a person familiar with the matter as\nsaying that the Chinese cyberspace agency \"asked Apple to remove WhatsApp and\nThreads from the App Store because both contain political content that\nincludes problematic mentions of the Chinese president [Xi Jinping].\"\n\nThe New York Times similarly wrote that \"a person briefed on the situation\nsaid the Chinese government had found content on WhatsApp and Threads about\nChina's president, Xi Jinping, that was inflammatory and violated the\ncountry's cybersecurity laws. The specifics of what was in the content was\nunclear, the person said.\"\n\nMeta apps Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger were still available for iOS in\nChina today, according to Reuters. As Reuters noted, the four apps removed\nfrom Apple's China store were not widely used in the country, where WeChat is\nthe dominant service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"These apps and many foreign apps are normally blocked on Chinese networks by\nthe 'Great Firewall'\u2014the country's extensive cybersystem of censorship\u2014and can\nonly be used with a virtual private network or other proxy tools,\" Reuters\nwrote. WhatsApp, Threads, Telegram, and Signal were reportedly still available\non Apple devices in Hong Kong and Macau, China's special administrative\nregions.\n\n## US House moves on forcing TikTok sale or ban\n\nChina's crackdown on foreign messaging apps comes amid US debate over whether\nto ban or force a sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok. The House Commerce\nCommittee last month voted 50\u20130 to approve a bill that would force TikTok\nowner ByteDance to sell the company or lose access to the US market.\n\nUS lawmakers argue that TikTok poses national security risks, saying that\nChina can use the app to obtain sensitive personal data and manipulate US\npublic opinion. House leaders are reportedly planning a floor vote on the\nTikTok bill on Saturday.\n\nUS lawmakers raised concerns about Apple's China ties after the recent\ncancellation of Apple TV+ show The Problem with Jon Stewart. Stewart\nreportedly told members of his staff that Apple executives were concerned\nabout potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence.\n\nApple pulled The New York Times app from its store in China in December 2016,\nsaying that Apple was informed by China \"that the app is in violation of local\nregulations.\" The New York Times news app is still unavailable on Apple's App\nStore in China, the Reuters article said.\n\n\"For years, Apple has bowed to Beijing's demands that it block an array of\napps, including newspapers, VPNs, and encrypted messaging services,\" The New\nYork Times noted yesterday. \"It also built a data center in the country to\nhouse Chinese citizens' iCloud information, which includes personal contacts,\nphotos and email.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n108\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
