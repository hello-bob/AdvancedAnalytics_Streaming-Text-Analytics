Everybody\u2019s doing it. But with Broadcom embodying the platonic ideal of\n\u2018things that haven\u2019t aged well\u2019 with their promise to not increase prices, and\nthen increasing those prices up to five to ten times what organizations paid\npreviously within a few months of acquisition, I thought it was worth\nhighlighting that there is a viable escape route for businesses that can\u2019t\naccept these corporate takeover shenanigans any longer.\n\n## 1\\. Licensing that doesn\u2019t require an 18 page whitepaper to understand\n\nYes, really. At this time of writing, explaining vSphere licensing alone takes\nVMware 18 pages.\n\nFor VM Squared, it takes only one. And, spoiler warning: it\u2019s a short page.\n\n## 2\\. Software features that weren\u2019t tacked on as an afterthought\n\nVMware has the kind of ecosystem that is an interesting study in evolution,\nbut not exactly a fun place to hang out. The company\u2019s 20 year acquisition\nstrategy has led to a hodgepodge of software that tries to be everything to\neveryone, resulting in unnecessarily complexity, resource usage and\ninteroperability challenges.\n\nVM Squared is built from components that cover the most common virtualization\nrequirements for organizations. It won\u2019t water your plants or walk your dog.\nIt does what it says on the tin, and it does it well.\n\n## 3\\. Multi-tenancy out of the box, no extra licenses needed\n\nSure, you can manage multi-tenancy (to an extent) with VMware. Just be sure\nyou can afford the extra costs involved. And all the extra resources\nvCloudDirector (which you won\u2019t be able to buy without joining the partner\nprogram) needs to run.\n\nWith VM Squared, you get multi-tenancy at no additional cost.\n\n## 4\\. An included marketplace for cloud apps and images\n\nMuch like the multi-tenancy situation, you\u2019ll need to buy additional software\nfor a marketplace, which will set you back $350 per core a year. Plus, storage\ncosts will rise above the included minimum; $210K per TiB a year for vSAN.\nThat\u2019s painful. Want a firewall with that? Add another $120 a year per core!\n\nAmplifier, our image and app marketplace, is, on the other hand, included in\nVM Squared by default. We include a firewall too; we think that every solution\nshould have a firewall in 2024.\n\n## 5\\. A management stack that doesn\u2019t consume resources like a paper towel\ndropped into the deep fryer\n\nA complete VMware management stack is a beast when it comes to infrastructure\ndemands. The mandated VMware Validated Design for vRealize, NSX and vCenter in\nvCloud Foundation alone has grown to 170 CPU cores, more than 512GB of RAM and\nin excess of 10TB disk space.\n\nVM Squared has the advantage of not being built on cobbled-together legacy\nsoftware, and requires far, far fewer resources to run.\n\n## 6\\. Manage everything from a single dashboard, not a horde of disparate\ninterfaces\n\nYou need multiple specialists within your organization if you want to keep the\nvirtual lights on with VMware. And every extra feature you add requires their\nown user interfaces, upgrade schedules and compatibility requirements. With\nthis kind of complexity, time is a resource your team definitely won\u2019t have.\n\nCompare this with VM Squared, where everything is managed through a single,\nclean, intuitive dashboard. Take a look at it in action to see what I mean.\n\n## 7\\. Greater security through a small attack surface and one-click updates\n\nWith a proprietary tangle of 20+ year old code, VMware is subject to a slew of\nCVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) every year including a recent VM\nsandbox escape and 9.9/10 severity unauthenticated access to Aria (formerly\nvRealize). VMware\u2019s complex stew of ancient code creates more room for human\nerror, which isn\u2019t helped by an increasingly small number of staff who have to\nmaintain the sprawling code base. Then there\u2019s the complexity-induced\nconfiguration slip-ups from the customers on the other end.\n\nAt SoftIron, security is at the foundation of everything we do. It\u2019s why we\ndesign and manufacture our own hardware for our private cloud platform,\nHyperCloud. VM Squared is no different, and with a small attack surface and\none-click software updates included as part of your license, staying up to\ndate with security patches is easy. A single, clean dashboard to manage your\nsolution is not only easy to use, it reduces your attack surface and keeps\nyour data safe.\n\nJason Van der Schyff is Chief Operating Officer of SoftIron. With a background\nin advanced manufacturing, national security and defence industry, Jason\noversees the company\u2019s global operations.\n\n## Related articles\n\n  1.
