As our group checked into\nthe hotel, I was last to present my passport to the concierge, whose face\nimmediately broadened into a smile. I was to be given a special double room\nwith a wide view of the bay, he told me warmly. The reason \u2013 I had an Irish\npassport. \u2018We love James Joyce here\u2019, he said, and something to the effect\nthat all Irish people are special to them.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the city loves Joyce, and there are signs everywhere to remind\nvisitors of the incomprehensible novelist\u2019s time here. I imagine that the\nhotel receptionist, being Italian, couldn\u2019t tell from my accent that I am not\nexactly an Irishman, certainly not in the same way that Joyce was \u2013 although\nperhaps he was also unaware that Joyce, funnily enough, refused to have an\nIrish passport.\n\nWrong Side of History is a reader-supported publication.

The clerk told me he had orders to\nsend people like me to the Irish delegation. But I insisted instead and got a\nBritish one.\u2019 A decade later the writer again turned down the offer of an\nIrish passport, even though it would have made it easier to leave Nazi-\noccupied France, and stuck to his British document.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of this at the time of my visit and, had I known, I obviously\nwouldn\u2019t have mentioned it: I like showing off how clever I am, but I like\nlarge hotel rooms more, and the view really was fantastic.\n\nAny aspiring Irish writer today hoping to hang around Trieste or Paris living\nin bohemian poverty would feel rather differently, now that an Irish passport\nguarantees free movement around most of continental Europe. Unsurprising then,\nthat since Brexit huge numbers of British people have applied for the\ndocument, alongside similar increases for the passports of other EU states. I\nhave so far not joined them, despite various people telling me that I should.\n\nThe reason I had an Irish passport in the first place is mainly down to my\nmother\u2019s neurosis, one of her concerns being that we might be on board a\nhijacked plane. If this sounds odd, then hijacking was big in the 1970s, and\nin the (admittedly unlikely) event of Palestinian militants taking over the\nplane she figured that an Irish passport would make them more amenable to\nsetting us free. This, at least, was her rather colourful and bizarre\nexplanation, but she did generally feel that being registered as Irish made\nyou more welcome, as the British had rather alienated one or two countries\ndown the years.\n\nAs it is, my switch came about because of that part of the world. On another\npress trip to Israel, the woman at Ben Gurion took one glance at me, looked at\nmy passport, and stuck her country\u2019s stamp on it. I don\u2019t know why, since I\nseem to remember that the other members of my party, as is the custom, were\ngiven a little slip which they could then detach. (I don\u2019t think this was\nHibernophobia on her part, since another member of the party had an Irish\npassport and I think he got a slip, but my memory is vague). A few years later\nI was visiting an Arab country hostile to Israel, so had to get another\npassport, and I have stuck with the British one ever since.\n\nOne obvious reason for my refusal so far is that I supported Leave, although\nregretted it almost instantly, and while my opinion on that referendum tends\nto change every few weeks, I\u2019m still of the view that it was a bad move. In\nwhich case, it seems galling for a member of the White Star Line Iceberg Look-\nout Committee to join the throngs for a lifeboat while everyone else has to\ntake their chances.\n\nI\u2019ve also been rather put off by the many people, among the six million\nBritons with an Irish grandparent, who have rushed to get a passport and make\na song and dance about it on social media.\n\nMany quite openly care nothing about their new \u2018homeland\u2019 and are quite naked\nin stating that they do it out of convenience. If they have any feelings about\nthe country\u2019s heritage, it seems to be the contempt routinely felt by British\n(and even more so Irish) liberals towards a place that until recently lived in\nreligious darkness.\n\nAll of which just seems wrong, but worse still is that we have effectively\nallowed a system of two-tier citizenship to develop almost without opposition.\nA while back, Christopher Caldwell wrote about the corrosive effects of dual\ncitizenship, arguing that:\n\n\u2018Dual citizenship undermines equal citizenship, producing a regime of\nconstitutional haves and have-nots. The dual citizen has, at certain important\nmoments and in certain important contexts, the right to choose the regime\nunder which he lives. He can avoid military conscription, duck taxes, and flee\nprosecution. When Spain, as coronavirus cases spiked in mid-March, banned all\nmovement outside the home except for designated purposes, one of those\npurposes was to \u201creturn to your habitual place of residence.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Spaniard with citizenship in a second country thus had the constitutional\nprivilege of exempting himself from a nationwide lockdown in a way that his\nfellow Spaniard did not. Such special privileges do not often matter - but\nwhen they do, they matter in a life-or-death way.\u2019\n\nOne of the many negative outcomes of Britain\u2019s exit from the block is that it\nhas created two types of citizens in Britain: those who are able to access the\nbenefits of the EU, and those who aren\u2019t. Indeed, by its very nature the\nEuropean Union enables this situation, since an EU passport is more than just\na regular document.\n\nI have to admit that I find it a great annoyance waiting in long passport\nqueues while EU citizens whizz past besides us, although I\u2019m not going to\ntweet that because, duh, you voted for it, you moron. On one occasion last\nyear, I was bored and eavesdropping on a group of young British men travelling\nand talking about their passports. One had a Dutch grandparent so he was going\nto get one, while his friends were entirely of British descent; and just like\nthat, there are two separate classes of citizen, except like the reverse of\nmany past systems, it\u2019s foreign heritage that makes you of higher status.\n\nDespite this obvious unfairness, the world is moving towards dual citizenship\nas the norm, and most recently Germany changed its law on the matter. The\nreasons for this unstoppable drive towards citizenship inequality are due to\nthat most powerful combination of forces, progressive taboos and elite\ninterests. The system of dual nationality is convenient to the wealthiest\nmembers of society, who are the most international and most likely to have two\npassports, but there are also social prohibitions on questioning the idea of\ndual loyalties.\n\nThis charge has historically been most targeted against Jews, the vast\nmajority of whom support the state of Israel even if they don\u2019t feel it\ndiminishes their sense of Britishness. I can understand why it\u2019s offensive to\nsuggest someone\u2019s religion or ancestry makes them somehow of suspect loyalty,\nbut in the case of people who actually do take out a second passport, of\nwhatever nationality, they clearly do have dual loyalties, by definition.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that dual loyalties are such a bad thing, unless this loyalty is\nto a regime or political movement which is hostile to Britain, which neither\nIsrael nor Ireland are. As more modern states have increasingly moved to an\nenvironment in which war between them is not just unlikely but inconceivable,\nthat question of loyalty matters far less, but it still entails extra benefits\nnot enjoyed by fellow citizens.\n\nI suppose I have dual loyalties, to some extent; if I worked for the Foreign\nOffice, they\u2019d probably be foolish to put me in Dublin, because I take an\ninterest in Ireland\u2019s wellbeing, and would be uncomfortable doing anything\ndetrimental to its interests.\n\nBut I don\u2019t plan to move to Ireland, and I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s fair that some\npeople are merely British Citizens, while others get to be British Citizens\nPlus. Even if the ship doesn\u2019t seem to be in the greatest shape, I\u2019m sticking\nwith it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say never, and I would encourage my children to get Irish\npassports, if they wanted to work or study in the EU (although I\u2019m fairly\nconfident some sort of reciprocal agreement will be made by the time that\nbecomes an issue). And, if I\u2019m totally honest, were I ever able to afford a\nhouse in the south of France, then the sweet call of dear old \u00c9ireann might\nprove too emotionally powerful to resist.\n\nWrong Side of History is a reader-supported publication.

I agree it's mostly a great convenience but there's more to it. I\nfeel more connected to the land of my parents, more belonging and sense of\nplace in the world. There's always background talk of my parents going \"home\"\neven though they have lived in the UK 50+ years and it's not going to happen.I\nsee your point though that for most people recently it's just about ease of\ntravel.It doesn't really apply in the UK/Ireland case but I think dual\ncitizenship is important to connect people to their wider family. I will\nensure my future kids get registered as citizens of my wife's country for at\nleast being able to visit their grandparents without a complex visa process\nevery year, but also the ability to live and work their should they wish in\nthe future.A final aside, I used my Irish passport when I solo travelled to\nIran 10 years back. A particular case where it was definitely better not to\n\"be\" British. A young solider checking my documents on a bridge at the Iranian\nborder saw my passport and launched 5 minute discussion about his admiration\nfor Bobby Sands. The film on the hotel room TV that night was\nBraveheart.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies by Ed West and others\n\nArianna Capuani16 hrs agoLiked by Ed WestI keep forgetting about getting\nItalian passports for my boys...Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n31 more comments...\n\n'Children of Men' is really happening\n\nWhy Russia can\u2019t afford to spare its young soldiers anymore\n\nMar 10, 2022 \u2022\n\nEd West\n\n122\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 'Children of Men' is really happening\n\nwww.edwest.co.uk\n\n18\n\nIreland\u2019s rebellion problem\n\nThe country\u2019s crisis stems from conformity\n\nDec 2, 2023 \u2022\n\nEd West\n\n163\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ireland\u2019s rebellion problem\n\nwww.edwest.co.uk\n\n66\n\nThe Reverse Floyd moment\n\nThe psychological toll of the October 7 pogrom\n\nOct 16, 2023 \u2022\n\nEd West\n\n133\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Reverse Floyd moment\n\nwww.edwest.co.uk\n\n50\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ed West\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
