Credit: Guo\nCheng/Xinhua via AP\n\nChina on Friday launched a lunar probe to land on the far side of the moon and\nreturn with samples that could provide insights into differences between the\nless-explored region and the better-known near side.\n\nIt is the latest advance in China's increasingly sophisticated space\nexploration program, which is now competing with the U.S., still the leader in\nspace.\n\nChina also has a three-member crew on its own orbiting space station and aims\nto put astronauts on the moon by 2030. Three Chinese lunar probe missions are\nplanned over the next four years.\n\nFree from exposure to Earth and other interference, the moon's somewhat\nmysterious far side is ideal for radio astronomy and other scientific work.\nBecause the far side never faces Earth, a relay satellite is needed to\nmaintain communications.\n\nThe rocket carrying the Chang'e-6 lunar probe\u2014named after the Chinese mythical\nmoon goddess\u2014lifted off Friday at 5:27 p.m. as planned from the Wenchang\nlaunch center on the island province of Hainan. About 35 minutes later it\nseparated entirely from the massive Long March-5 rocket\u2014China's largest\u2014that\nhad slung it into space, as technicians monitoring the launch from ground\ncontrol smiled and applauded.\n\nShortly afterward, launch mission commander Zhang Zuosheng took to a podium at\nthe front of the room and said the launch had gone off exactly as planned and\nthe spacecraft was on its set trajectory. \"I declare this launch mission a\ncomplete success,\" Zhang said to further applause.\n\nThe Philippine Space Agency issued a statement saying expected debris from the\nrocket launch was \"projected to have fallen within the identified drop zones.\"\n\nChina in 2021 was forced to defend its handling of a rocket booster that\nburned up over the Indian Ocean after the administrator of the American space\nagency and others accused Beijing of acting recklessly by allowing its rocket\nto fall to Earth seemingly uncontrolled after the mission.\n\nHuge numbers of people crowded Hainan's beaches to view the launch, which\ncomes in the middle of China's five-day May Day holiday. As with previous\nrecent launches, the event was televised live by state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nAfter orbiting the moon to reduce speed, the lander will separate from the\nspacecraft and within 48 hours of setting down it will begin drilling into the\nlunar surface and scooping up samples with its robotic arm. With the samples\nsealed in a container, it will then reconnect with the returner for the trip\nback to Earth. The entire mission is set to last 53 days.\n\nChina in 2020 returned samples from the moon's near side, the first time\nanyone had done so since the former Soviet Union in 1976. Analysis of the\nsamples found they contained water in tiny beads embedded in lunar dirt.\n\nAlso in the past week, three Chinese astronauts returned home from a six-month\nmission on the country's orbiting space station after the arrival of its\nreplacement crew.\n\nThis photo provided on Jan. 12, 2019, by the China National Space\nAdministration via Xinhua News Agency shows the lunar lander of the Chang'e-4\nprobe in a photo taken by the rover Yutu-2 on Jan. 11. China is preparing to\nlaunch a lunar probe Friday, May 3, 2024, that would land on the far side of\nthe moon and return with samples that could provide insights into geological\nand other differences between the less-explored region and the better-known\nnear side. Credit: China National Space Administration/Xinhua News Agency via\nAP, File\n\nChina built its own space station after being excluded from the International\nSpace Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese military's\ntotal control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology\nbetween the two geopolitical rivals. U.S. law bars almost all cooperation\nbetween the U.S. and Chinese space programs without explicit congressional\napproval.\n\nFaced with such limitations, China has expanded cooperation with other\ncountries and agencies. The latest mission carries scientific instruments from\nFrance, Italy and the European Space Agency in cooperation with Sweden. A\nsmall Pakistani satellite is also on board.\n\nChina's ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as\nwell as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three\nlunar probe missions over the next four years. The next is schedule for 2027.\n\nLonger-term plans call for a permanent crewed base on the lunar surface,\nalthough those appear to remain in the conceptual phase.\n\nChina conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming the third\ncountry after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space\nusing its own resources.\n\nThe three-module Tiangong, much smaller than the ISS, was launched in 2021 and\ncompleted 18 months later. It can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time\nand is mainly dedicated to scientific research. The crew will also install\nspace debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam\nscience classes to students on Earth.\n\nChina has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space\nstation to foreign astronauts and space tourists. With the ISS nearing the end\nof its useful life, China could eventually be the only country or corporation\nto maintain a crewed station in orbit.\n\nThe U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over\nChina's due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by 2026 at the\nearliest. This time, though, NASA is partnering with private companies such as\nSpaceX and Blue Origin, which will provide the landers for the astronauts.\n\nThey plan to land on the moon's south pole where permanently shadowed craters\nare believed to be packed with frozen water.\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.
