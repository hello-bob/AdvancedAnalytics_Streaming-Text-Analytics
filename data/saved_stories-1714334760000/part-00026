The deterioration started with the U.S.-China trade war under\nPresident Donald Trump, continued during the coronavirus pandemic that\noriginated in China and has recently taken on yet another dimension among\nconcerns about widespread Chinese tech and industrial espionage and subversion\nas well as continued human rights abuses and tension surrounding Taiwan. Among\nAmerican adults in 2024, unfavorable views of China were voiced by 77 percent\nof respondents after having reached a high of 84 percent in early 2023. In\n2005, that figure had stood at just 47 percent.\n\nIn 2023, 77 percent of Americans said the viewed Taiwan very or mostly\nfavorable. At the same time, 66 percent saw the military power of China as a\ncritical threat, up from 41 percent in 2016. 64 percent said the same about\nthe economic power of China.\n\nRepublicans voters saw China more critical with just 6 percent who had a\nfavorable view in 2023, compared to 18 percent of Democrtas and 17 percent of\nIndependents. That year, favorable views of China in the U.S. reached an all-\ntime low of just 15 percent overall. Again, Republicans were more critical of\nChina's military and economic prowess, with 80-81 percent seeing it as a major\nthreat.\n\nKatharina Buchholz\n\nData Journalist\n\nkatharina.buchholz@statista.com\n\nDescription\n\nThis chart shows the share of the U.S. public with a favorable/unfavorable\nview of China.\n\nReport\n\nDownload Chart\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 1985-2029\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nCross-border e-commerce from China in Europe 2023, by country\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGDP value added of construction industry in China 2011-2023\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 2023, by region\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nRevenue of KFC restaurants in China 2016-2023\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China 1985-2029\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 1985-2029\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nCross-border e-commerce from China in Europe 2023, by country\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGDP value added of construction industry in China 2011-2023\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 2023, by region\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nRevenue of KFC restaurants in China 2016-2023\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China 1985-2029\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 1985-2029\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nCross-border e-commerce from China in Europe 2023, by country\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGDP value added of construction industry in China 2011-2023\n\n\\+ Premium statistics\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) of China 2023, by region\n\n## Infographic Newsletter\n\nStatista offers daily infographics about trending topics, covering: Economy &\nFinance, Politics & Society, Tech & Media, Health & Environment, Consumer,\nSports and many more.\n\n## Related Infographics\n\n### Fentanyl\n\n#### Who's to Blame for the U.S. Fentanyl Crisis?\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n### higher education\n\n#### Geopolitical Tensions Impact University Research Unevenly\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n### World Art Day\n\n#### U.S. & China Dominate the Art Market\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n### World Art Day\n\n#### Art Exhibitions & Museums Garner Little Interest?\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n### Artificial intelligence\n\n#### Which AI Companies Have Acquired the Most Funding?\n\nApr 9, 2024\n\n### Southeast Asia\n\n#### Southeast Asia's Preferred Ally Switches in Favor of China\n\nApr 8, 2024\n\n### Hydro power\n\n#### The World\u2019s Biggest Hydro Powers\n\nApr 5, 2024\n\n### Hydropower\n\n#### Droughts Lead to Drop in Hydro Generation in 2023\n\nApr 4, 2024\n\n### Alcoholic Beverages\n\n#### Beer Beats Wine in Regular Consumption\n\nApr 3, 2024\n\n### Chinese Car Exports\n\n#### Chinese Car Exports Continue to Soar as EV Share Grows\n\nApr 3, 2024\n\n### Batteries\n\n#### China Is the World Leader in Battery Recycling\n\nApr 2, 2024\n\n### Stock market\n\n#### Apple and Tesla: Dreadful Two Instead of Magnificent Seven\n\nApr 2, 2024\n\n### FAQ\n\n  * The Statista \"Chart of the Day\", made available under the Creative Commons License CC BY-ND 3.0, may be used and displayed without charge by all commercial and non-commercial websites.
