Smith @dukeresearch\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- When you think about what separates humans from chimpanzees\nand other apes, you might think of our big brains, or the fact that we get\naround on two legs rather than four. But we have another distinguishing\nfeature: water efficiency.\n\nThat\u2019s the take-home of a new study that, for the first time, measures\nprecisely how much water humans lose and replace each day compared with our\nclosest living animal relatives.\n\nOur bodies are constantly losing water: when we sweat, go to the bathroom,\neven when we breathe. That water needs to be replenished to keep blood volume\nand other body fluids within normal ranges.\n\nAnd yet, research published March 5 in the journal Current Biology shows that\nthe human body uses 30% to 50% less water per day than our closest animal\ncousins. In other words, among primates, humans evolved to be the low-flow\nmodel.\n\nAn ancient shift in our body\u2019s ability to conserve water may have enabled our\nhunter-gatherer ancestors to venture farther from streams and watering holes\nin search of food, said lead author Herman Pontzer, associate professor of\nevolutionary anthropology at Duke University.\n\n\u201cEven just being able to go a little bit longer without water would have been\na big advantage as early humans started making a living in dry, savannah\nlandscapes,\u201d Pontzer said.\n\nThe study compared the water turnover of 309 people with a range of\nlifestyles, from farmers and hunter-gatherers to office workers, with that of\n72 apes living in zoos and sanctuaries.\n\nTo maintain fluid balance within a healthy range, the body of a human or any\nother animal is a bit like a bathtub: \u201cwater coming in has to equal water\ncoming out,\u201d Pontzer said.\n\nLose water by sweating, for example, and the body\u2019s thirst signals kick in,\ntelling us to drink. Chug more water than your body needs, and the kidneys get\nrid of the extra fluid.\n\nFor each individual in the study, the researchers calculated water intake via\nfood and drink on the one hand, and water lost via sweat, urine and the GI\ntract, on the other hand.\n\nWhen they added up all the inputs and outputs, they found that the average\nperson processes some three liters, or 12 cups, of water each day. A\nchimpanzee or gorilla living in a zoo goes through twice that much.\n\nA chimpanzee in a zoo manages to stay well-hydrated without chugging from a\nwater bottle like we do, thanks to the high water content of its plant-based\ndiet. Courtesy of Lincoln Park Zoo.\n\nPontzer says the researchers were surprised by the results because, among\nprimates, humans have an amazing ability to sweat. Per square inch of skin,\n\u201chumans have 10 times as many sweat glands as chimpanzees do,\u201d Pontzer said.\nThat makes it possible for a person to sweat more than half a gallon during an\nhour-long workout -- equivalent to two Big Gulps from a 7-Eleven.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the great apes -- chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and\norangutans -- live lazy lives. \u201cMost apes spend 10 to 12 hours a day resting\nor feeding, and then they sleep for 10 hours. They really only move a couple\nhours a day,\u201d Pontzer said.\n\nBut the researchers controlled for differences in climate, body size, and\nfactors like activity level and calories burned per day. So they concluded the\nwater-savings for humans were real, and not just a function of where\nindividuals lived or how physically active they were.\n\nThe findings suggest that something changed over the course of human evolution\nthat reduced the amount of water our body uses each day to stay healthy.\n\nThen as now, we could likely still only survive a few days without drinking,\nPontzer said. \u201cYou probably don't break that ecological leash, but at least\nyou get a longer one if you can go longer without water.\u201d\n\nThe next step, Pontzer says, is to pinpoint how this physiological change\nhappened.\n\nOne hypothesis, suggested by the data, is that our body\u2019s thirst response was\nre-tuned so that, overall, we crave less water per calorie compared with our\nape relatives. Even as babies, long before our first solid food, the water-to-\ncalories ratio of human breast milk is 25% less than the milks of other great\napes.\n\nAnother possibility lies in front of our face: Fossil evidence suggests that,\nabout 1.6 million years ago, with the inception of Homo erectus, humans\nstarted developing a more prominent nose. Our cousins gorillas and chimpanzees\nhave much flatter noses.\n\nOur nasal passages help conserve water by cooling and condensing the water\nvapor from exhaled air, turning it back into liquid on the inside of our nose\nwhere it can be reabsorbed.\n\nHaving a nose that sticks out more may have helped early humans retain more\nmoisture with each breath.\n\n\u201cThere's still a mystery to solve, but clearly humans are saving water,\u201d\nPontzer said. \u201cFiguring out exactly how we do that is where we go next, and\nthat's going to be really fun.\u201d\n\nThis research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation\n(BCS-0643122, BCS-1317170, BCS-1440867, BCS-1440841, BCS-1440671), the United\nStates Agency for International Development (APS-497-11-000001), the National\nInstitutes of Health (R01DK080763), the John Templeton Foundation, L.S.B.\nLeakey Foundation, Wenner-Gren Foundation (Gr. 8670), the University of\nArizona, Duke University, and Hunter College.\n\nCITATION: \u201cEvolution of Water Conservation in Humans,\u201d Herman Pontzer, Mary H.\nBrown, Brian M.
