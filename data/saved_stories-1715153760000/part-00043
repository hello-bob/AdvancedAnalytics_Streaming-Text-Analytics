He captioned this\none \u201cEventful finals week.\u201d Photo: Matthew Bergwall/Instagram\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading\nrecommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIt was the summer of 2023, and Matt Bergwall, a skinny 21-year-old University\nof Miami student, was lounging in an infinity pool in Dubai. Beside him was\nhis girlfriend, a blonde Zeta Tau Alpha. The silver Cuban link chain on his\nwrist glistened as he held his phone high to snap a selfie, the city\u2019s\nartificial palm-shaped islands splayed out along the horizon beneath them.\nOver the next few days, they swam in the pool and posed on their hotel\nbalcony, posting a steady stream of pictures to Instagram. In one, he leans\nback on the edge of the pool, finger to the sky. \u201cEventful finals week,\u201d he\ncaptioned it.\n\nNone of Bergwall\u2019s friends at school had a firm grasp of how the sophomore \u2014 a\nself-styled fintech whiz, Marc Andreessen with a zoomer perm \u2014 had money for\nthe Tesla he drove or the Gucci he wore or, for that matter, the room in\nDubai. But who could care when Bergwall was ordering everyone Ubers and paying\nfor tables at nightclubs and pitching in for yachts on Biscayne Bay? When he\nhad the ear of venture capitalists at networking events in Brickell, Miami\u2019s\nfinance district? Okay, yes, his life had seemingly been enhanced\nexponentially, improbably, over the past year and a half \u2014 but wasn\u2019t\neverything sort of improbable at UMiami? Wasn\u2019t this the very place where Alix\nEarle had, by the end of her junior year, gained millions of followers for her\n\u201cGet Ready With Me\u201d videos? Where fraternity parking lots were filled with\nLamborghinis and pledge classes with the children of billionaires who drove\nthem?\n\nOne day several months later, Bergwall\u2019s friends were hanging out on campus\nwhen the question they weren\u2019t asking was accidentally answered via a text\nfrom a young woman\u2019s father. A UMiami student had been charged with\norchestrating a cyberscam that allegedly cost retailers millions of dollars,\nhe wrote her, and was facing up to 45 years in prison. \u201cWe looked at each\nother and were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what if it\u2019s Matt?\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd then\nwe opened the article and it actually was.\u201d\n\nIt takes a lot to keep up at UMiami, where students often spend their weekends\nbuying tables at clubs and partying on yachts. Photo: Matthew\nBergwall/Instagram\n\nBergwall grew up in Darien, Connecticut, in a house not far from the leafy\nWoodland Park Nature Preserve. His father was a successful real-estate\nexecutive and his mother a VP of training and development at Chase. He was a\nquiet, smart child who was constantly on his computer. In middle school, that\nmeant hours and hours sucked into the freewheeling virtual world of Minecraft.\n\nLike any kid born after 2000, and especially a kid who enjoyed building custom\ngaming servers for his friends in his spare time, Bergwall spent his teen\nyears observing the rise of a specific kind of demigod \u2014 from Satoshi Nakamoto\nto the market-moving mobs of r/WallStreetBets to Sam Bankman-Fried, the world\nseemed to belong to whoever could articulate the most absurd vision of how to\nfinance it. Low interest rates fueled precipitous valuations, minting fortunes\non laughable balance sheets. Crypto alchemy transmuted monkey NFTs into\nmansions. Bergwall\u2019s own entrepreneurial streak first manifested in the\nhallways of Darien High, where former classmates say he sold vapes, an easy\nhustle at a time when school bathrooms were overflowing with kids hitting\ntheir mango-flavored Juuls between classes. On Instagram, he carved out a\nsideline buying accounts, growing their followings artificially, and selling\nthem online. He soon moved on to freelance software engineering, building a\nwebsite for an online community of Grand Theft Auto players. Bergwall\u2019s\nfriends were impressed but a little unnerved by how he used his skill for\nsoftware engineering. Former classmates said he would install files on school\ncomputers that would crash them, that he\u2019d hack into security cameras; there\nwere rumors that he had changed his friends\u2019 grades. When it started to seem\nlike he might get in trouble for selling his peers access to discounted\nSpotify Premium accounts, his friends said, they \u201cwere able to convince him,\nlike, \u2018Hey, man, this probably isn\u2019t the hill to die on,\u2019\u201d one told me. That\nfriend said that when Bergwall boasted about his exploits, he tended to focus\nless on the money and more on \u201chow cool it was that he was doing something\nvigilante.\u201d Of course, the money was cool too. When Bergwall hosted a party,\nhe would often buy alcohol for everyone. Per the friend, \u201cIt was clearly all\ncoming from his own pocket.\u201d\n\nHis senior year, he got a 40-hour-a-week job at Mirador, a financial-services\ncompany in town, at which he\u2019d interned the summer before. This meant that in\naddition to his regular high-school course load, saxophone practice, and\nrunning sound for the school auditorium, he was spending his nights and\nweekends consulting on genuinely professional software projects. He described\nthe role on LinkedIn as \u201ctruly a full stack project, managing design,\ndevelopment, and project management.\u201d\n\nGiven his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, some of his friends expected him to go to an Ivy. Instead,\nhe enrolled at UMiami, where he planned to double major in computer science\nand management. But in December 2019, halfway through Bergwall\u2019s senior year,\nhis father died of cancer. Devastated \u2014 \u201cI do not know how I will move on from\nthis. Right now I feel like I will never move on,\u201d he wrote on Instagram \u2014\nBergwall decided to take a gap year and focus on making more money. He stayed\non at Mirador and added a second job at a Boston-based crypto start-up called\nFlipside. In October 2020, he went on a podcast called Dharma Unfiltered,\nhosted by UMiami student Reed Kastner-Lang. Bergwall had yet to matriculate;\nhe and Kastner-Lang found each other in a Snapchat group for incoming freshmen\nwith an interest in entrepreneurship. \u201cYou\u2019ve tasted a lot of different things\nwithin the computer-science industry,\u201d Kastner-Lang said to Bergwall. \u201cDown\nthe road, what do you see yourself doing?\u201d Bergwall explained that, actually,\nhis thinking had shifted lately. He once dreamed of working as a software\nengineer at Google. Now, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a slave for Google,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nwant to build something. I want to run something.\u201d When his gap year ended, he\nquit Mirador, reduced his hours at Flipside, and moved to Miami to begin in-\nperson classes in the spring of 2021.\n\nNo one really knew how he had the money for the matte-gray Tesla, either.\nPhoto: Matthew Bergwall/Instagram\n\nBy the time he arrived, Miami had already taken its place as a haven for a\nparticular flavor of techno-optimist capitalist: libertarians, crypto bulls,\nand OnlyFans agencies. The city promised a launching pad for a gifted young\nsoftware engineer to step off the traditional career track \u2014 the kind of thing\nexpected in stuffy, old-money Darien \u2014 into a lifestyle on the bleeding edge\nof the new-money grind-set. Bergwall was not alone among his classmates in\nidealizing this. The campus is overrun with wannabe digital players, several\nstudents told me. Everyone is an influencer; everyone is launching a brand.\nOnly months after she graduated in 2023, Earle established the Alix Earle\nScholarship for any other \u201caspiring entrepreneur\u201d with the \u201cambition to be a\nchangemaker in the world of business.\u201d (The application asks for a two-minute\nvideo answering the questions \u201cWhat impact would this scholarship have on your\neducational and career goals?\u201d and \u201cWhy is it important to you to be a student\nat the University of Miami?\u201d)\n\n\u201cA lot of kids come to Miami and try to emulate the lifestyle,\u201d said Jesse\nFromer, a recent graduate who grew up in South Florida. He said he sees the\nschool\u2019s culture as downstream from the ostentatious flexing of the city\u2019s\nmost visible residents \u2014 club promoters, influencers, VC bros. The cars are\nmore than likely rented, the jewelry fake. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not from here, it\u2019s\nhard to tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fugazi,\u201d said Fromer. Adding to the\npressure are the expenses of the social life and keeping up appearances: While\nyoung women typically don\u2019t pay covers for nightclubs and boat parties, young\nmen are often expected to buy tables and rent boats for thousands of dollars a\nweekend. The status anxiety on campus is acute, Fromer said, because of how\nostentatiously rich the upper crust of the student body is. Like Bergwall,\nmany students come from Northeast suburbs where they might have gone to\nprivate schools and thought of themselves as wealthy. But the richest students\nat UMiami are a different breed \u2014 trust-funders released from any sort of East\nCoast stealth-wealth sensibility.\n\nWhen Bergwall moved to a campus dorm, he fell in with a group of friends in\nhis building. Bergwall was a year older, given his gap year, and struck them\nas suave and intelligent. \u201cHe seemed put together,\u201d said one. While many of\nthe guys in the group projected machismo, Bergwall displayed a sensitive side.\nHe let a female friend in his building teach him how to take care of his curly\nhair.\n\nBergwall was also quick to embrace the Miami party life. His friend posted a\npicture of him, a year into his time in college, lounging in a hot tub on a\nyacht, shirtless in sunglasses and drinking from a red Solo cup. (He captioned\nit, \u201cBoat fit for a Bond villain.\u201d Bergwall commented back, \u201csometimes you\nneed to play the part.\u201d) As the months went by, he started dressing flashier,\nleaving behind the preppy button-ups of his New England youth. He motored\naround campus on an electric skateboard and told classmates he\u2019d bought a\nmatte-gray Tesla, which he started posing with on Instagram.\n\nHe leaned way into a tech-guru persona, describing himself on LinkedIn as \u201cSerial Entrepreneur | Venture Capital Catalyst | Igniting Innovation & Growth.\u201d During a business-class lecture in which the professor asked students not to use their laptops, Bergwall \u201cwould be the only one with it out,\u201d Fromer said. \u201cLike, \u2018Sorry, Professor, it\u2019s for work.\u2019\u201d Work, ostensibly, was his new venture fund, EJB Investments. After class, he\u2019d go to networking events for VCs and founders in the sleek high-rises of Brickell. At these, according to a friend, he\u2019d talk up the fund, adopting a hyperconfident online business jargon and claiming that he managed more than $1 million in assets. \u201cI\u2019ve been an entrepreneur since my early days. I\u2019ve always been passionate about building technology that didn\u2019t exist yet and finding new ways to solve complex problems,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn. Over the course of his freshman year, he told friends that the firm had invested in several local companies, including a beverage-ordering app and a concert-promotion business; it also launched an NFT project called Skeletal Cats. By his sophomore year, Bergwall had become the kind of guy who could walk up to the hottest clubs near campus and skip the line because he knew the bouncer. \u201cHe was just crazy connected. Like, it seemed like he knew everyone and that if you worked with him or were friends with him, you would have a great time and you would be in his circle and, like, you would be successful,\u201d said a student who was in a fraternity with one of Bergwall\u2019s friends. On Instagram, he posted pictures of himself dripped out in a Gucci belt, a Stone Island pendant, and a $41,000 Rolex President Day Date. Toward the end of his sophomore year, he started taking his girlfriend on lavish trips: Dubai in the summer of 2023, then Tulum. High-school friends watching on Instagram couldn\u2019t believe his glow-up: \u201cFor this wannabe Ken doll to pop out of nowhere, it was shocking,\u201d one said. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Where the hell is he getting all this money from?\u2019\u201d One student who worked at a finance firm was skeptical of what Bergwall told him: that the money came from his VC firm\u2019s investments paying off. \u201cIn VC world, it takes about three-to-five years to exit,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd he launched it, like, nine months before he met me. So I was like, \u2018How are these making you money right now?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe seemed to like showing off his travel, especially when he was with his\nsorority girlfriend. After Dubai, they went to Tulum, where they also posed in\npools overlooking the ocean and on mopeds. Photo: Matthew Bergwall/Instagram\n\nA few months ago, I bought a $60 toaster on Amazon that just would not heat up\nenough to toast bread. I wanted my money back. But repackaging the toaster and\ndropping it off at a post office seemed like too much of a hassle. So I did\nsomething slightly nefarious: I logged on to Amazon, opened the customer-\nservice chat window, and told the outsourced worker on the other end that my\ntoaster had never arrived. The agent apologized, asked zero follow-up\nquestions, and immediately refunded me $60. I had committed a common, low-\ngrade version of a type of fraud that has proliferated in recent years as\nmassive online retailers flood the world with packages and offer customers\nfrictionless returns. Often referred to simply as refunding, it involves\nfinding ways to get money back for products people have not actually returned.\nA lot of refunding is perpetrated by sophisticated cybercriminals who trick\nretailers and shipping companies at scale, obtaining high-value products in\nbulk and reselling them online to customers who want watches, computers, or\nother expensive items for cheap. According to a December 2023 report from the\nNational Retail Federation, retailers lost $101 billion from return fraud last\nyear.\n\nRefunding first emerged alongside the early-2010s explosion in online retail\nand typically involved simple methods like buying items and claiming they\nnever arrived (like my toaster). But as companies caught on, tactics evolved.\nIn 2019, a fraudster who went by Bob published Bob\u2019s Refunding eBook, which\ncollected a number of methods that had been circulating on hacker forums and\nother underworld sites. (Nowadays, such tips circulate mostly on Telegram, the\nanonymous chat app on which much contemporary fraud is coordinated. The\ncommunity is crass, like 4chan refitted for the zoomer mind: Refunding chat\nrooms with thousands of members host a flood of racist memes, slurs, cat GIFs,\nand extreme porn mixed in with advice on fraud methods.) Bob is credited in\nfraud circles with popularizing FTID \u2014 Fake Tracking ID, wherein the scammer\nreturns an empty box to a retailer but edits the shipping label provided by\nthe company to an address that is slightly different from the warehouse where\nreturns are meant to go. The package gets scanned by, say, UPS when it\u2019s\npicked up, allowing the customer to claim a refund, but it will never arrive\nat its destination.\n\nThere are other FTID methods. One involves writing addresses in special\ndissolving ink, which is legible when the package is picked up and scanned by\nthe delivery company but invisible by the time it arrives at its destination;\nthe courier on that end is unable to deliver the empty box, allowing the\ncustomer to claim a refund. The gold-standard method is what\u2019s known as\n\u201cinsider\u201d \u2014 scammer slang for compromised retail- or shipping-company-employee\naccounts that allow the scammer to directly submit false information about a\npackage. Scammers can contact insiders either by bribing logistics employees\nor hacking their computers. But recently, as refunding has become more\npopular, insiders have started to reach out directly to fraudsters on\nTelegram, offering back-end access to the companies at which they work in\nexchange for a cut of the scheme. However they\u2019re come by, having an insider\nallows the scammer to skip the more irritating steps of the scam \u2014 shipping\nempty boxes or Photoshopping false labels \u2014 and simply input a scan of a box\nthat doesn\u2019t exist, then change its status from \u201cIn transit\u201d to, say, \u201cAn\nemergency situation or severe weather condition has delayed delivery.\u201d Voil\u00e0 \u2014\nthe scammer can demand a refund. Fraudsters are constantly testing retailers\nto see how much they can get away with buying without sparking an\ninvestigation. But still, many investigations into refunding operations are\ncurrently underway, in part thanks to a former cybercrime fraudster turned FBI\nconsultant named Brett Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, at one of his regular check-ins with FBI agents in Alabama, Johnson\nmentioned the surge in refunding fraud he\u2019d begun seeing on Telegram. The\nagents were intrigued. The sheer volume of the crime, and the brazenness with\nwhich its practitioners were discussing it, opened up a potential enforcement\ngold mine. \u201cThey see that, Well, shit, it\u2019s pretty easy to identify these\nguys,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cOperational security is very low. They talk too much:\nThey post screenshots of actual orders, they share drop addresses, real names\n\u2014 things like that.\u201d The agents began trawling through the underbelly of the\nfraud internet, identifying major players. According to Johnson, their list\neventually grew to more than 300 people, including Matt Bergwall.\n\nAnother picture from Dubai, captioned \u201cdesert king.\u201d The posts from this trip\nmade his high-school friends, in particular, take notice of his lifestyle.\nPhoto: Matthew Bergwall/Instagram\n\nBergwall\u2019s alleged refunding operation was fairly sophisticated. When his\nindictment was unsealed on November 9, it revealed he\u2019d allegedly facilitated\nnearly 10,000 fraudulent returns between December 2021 and April 2022, which\n\u201cresulted in more than $3.5 million in lost product and sales revenue to\nvictim-retailers.\u201d (More recent court filings list the total value at $5\nmillion.) The indictment also alleged that Bergwall got high on his own\nsupply, so to speak: He refunded a number of products for himself, including a\n\u201c$41,000 Rolex President Day-Date watch, a $600 TeamGee H20 Electric\nSkateboard, a $350 Samsung 43-inch Smart UHD TV, and an $80 pair of Reebok\nshoes.\u201d His alleged operation, called UPSNow, was run, like most refunding\noperations, on Telegram, where he went by the pseudonym MXB and worked\nalongside a number of unindicted co-conspirators. He specialized in FTID with\na powerful edge: The government claims that Bergwall hacked into five\nemployees\u2019 back-end accounts at \u201ca multinational shipping, receiving, and\nsupply chain management company\u201d confirmed by sources to be UPS.\n\nAn archive of the UPSNow Telegram channel shows the complexity of running a\nbusiness like his. \u201cOur infrastructure is that of a legitimate company,\u201d MXB\nbragged in the channel. \u201cWe have 8 full time employees and have the ability to\nscale.\u201d Still, there were challenges. Primarily that his customers seemed to\nbe young scammers themselves \u2014 and could be incredibly demanding when it came\nto updates on their orders. Over time, they seemed to drive MXB up a wall. \u201cI\nwant to apologize for snapping at you guys, but please realize what is on our\nplate right now. We do not have the time to be asked \u2018yo ETA on scans?\u2019 or \u2018r\nscans online?\u2019\u201d MXB posted in the channel in March 2022. \u201cSo, we will be\ncontinuing to be assholes to those who deserve it. Customer service skills are\nout the window until our service gets resolved. Sorry. Not here to make\nfriends.\u201d Or: \u201cOops i just woke up, late night at the clubs, will be going\nthru dms shortly.\u201d MXB often seemed overwhelmed \u2014 not surprising given that he\nwas allegedly overseeing a multimillion-dollar fraud ring while juggling\nschool, VC networking, and a highly active social life. \u201cY\u2019all mfs start\nassuming shit\u2019s patched sooo fast,\u201d he wrote on March 7, 2022, when customers\nwere complaining about delays in service. (By \u201cpatched,\u201d he meant UPS cutting\noff his insider access.) \u201cShit ain\u2019t patched trust me i\u2019d tell you if it was.\ngive me a sec to finish giving the UPS ceo a handjob so we can get it back up\nand running.\u201d A few minutes later: \u201cwishing i was the ceo of ups \ud83d\ude14.\u201d\n\nThree days later, he posted a long message. \u201cI have an unfortunate\nannouncement to make. UPS has started to catch on to our little scheme here,\u201d\nhe wrote, urging patience. \u201cIf people freak out like they did last time\nclaiming the world was burning, I won\u2019t be as transparent with you guys. We\nare the ONLY service currently up and running for UPS instant scans. There is\nquite literally NO alternative for you guys to go to, so just be patient.\u201d He\ncontinued, \u201cWe are fighting a company with hundreds of employees whose sole\npurpose is to prevent the fraud we are doing.\u201d Later, he reminded everyone,\n\u201cWorking against a billion dollar company is quite the hard thing to do.\u201d He\nsigned it \u201cmxb .\u201d\n\nEventually, the stress caught up to him. \u201cim literally going to scream,\u201d he\nwrote on March 29. On April 3, a post in the channel announced \u201cthe\nacquisition of UPSNow\u201d by another fraud company called iFruit Services.\nSeemingly unable to deal with everything on his plate, MXB sold his black-\nmarket company and left the business. It was a year and a half before his\narrest.\n\nOne of Bergwall\u2019s closest college friends had kept in touch with him in the\nmonths following the indictment. \u201cI\u2019m obviously concerned, as I would be for\nanyone else. You know, make sure he\u2019s doing all right, check in where I can,\u201d\nhe said. He kept conversations casual: \u201cJust shoot the shit, you know, be\nboys, and try to make the time go by, be as normal as you can be, as it was\nprior.\u201d According to Fromer, the recent graduate who had a class with\nBergwall, students were generally impressed by his entrepreneurial moxie.\nFromer summarized the reaction as: \u201cSo yeah, he\u2019s a scammer, but good for\nhim.\u201d He added, \u201cThis type of fraud, at that high of a level, obviously would\nhave come from UM.\u201d\n\nOn Telegram, the reaction was less sympathetic. \u201cLooks like twerp,\u201d one user\nwrote in a fraud channel with a screenshot of Bergwall\u2019s LinkedIn profile\npicture. \u201cTimmy turner ass.\u201d Another user posted a meme of a stick figure\nstanding in the corner of a party Photoshopped with Bergwall\u2019s face, captioned\n\u201cTHEY DON\u2019T KNOW I HACKED UPS.\u201d\n\nPosters speculated on how he\u2019d gotten himself arrested: \u201cI\u2019m betting that $40k\nwatch got him some attention too. SMH\ud83d\ude48,\u201d one wrote. \u201cDamn I finessed 4 of\nthose same TeamGee H20s,\u201d posted another. Everyone seemed to be wondering who\nmight be next: \u201cAfter bergwall got clipped they lookin prolly in every chat,\u201d\none wrote. \u201cMore than 200 feds in here.\u201d\n\nThat poster is broadly right. Soon after Bergwall\u2019s arrest, the FBI announced\na major anti-refunding sweep called Operation Chargeback and indicted the\nmembers of several large refunding crews. And in December, Amazon filed a\nlawsuit against one in particular, called REKK. The suit, which named more\nthan 20 people, accused REKK of marketing itself on Telegram as a service\n\u201coffering fraudulent refunds to individuals around the world.\u201d It also claimed\nthat REKK paid thousands of dollars in bribes to seven Amazon \u201cinsiders\u201d to\nhelp them process refunds.\n\nAccording to one person I spoke to, Amazon was one of the companies allegedly\ndefrauded by Bergwall, and it supplied information to investigators to help\ncorroborate their findings. (While court filings don\u2019t list any of his\ntargets, more advanced refunders like Bergwall tend to go after places like\nthe Home Depot, Nike, and, yes, Amazon \u2014 large international companies, with\ncustomer-friendly return policies, selling items with a high resale value.)\nWhen I reached out to Amazon for comment, its vice-president of business\nconduct and ethics offered me this: The company is addressing this issue\n\u201chead-on\u201d through \u201cthe development of tools that use machine learning models\nto proactively detect and prevent fraud.\u201d Plus, the VP told me, Amazon is\nturning people in whenever it can. \u201cWhen bad actors attempt to evade our\ncontrols, we take action and work with law enforcement to hold them\naccountable.\u201d The problem for it is these \u201cbad actors\u201d don\u2019t seem to care\nmuch. \u201cThey immediately reoffend the moment they can get out on bail,\u201d said\nAllison Nixon, chief research officer at the cybersecurity firm Unit 221B, who\nhas investigated young cybercriminals. Nixon said she understood the\npopularity of refunding and similar scams within the larger \u201cmake money\nonline\u201d ecosystem, popularized by people like Andrew Tate. These young\nscammers are, to her mind, looking at their lives and making a fairly rational\nset of economic calculations. Bergwall is not the only one who doesn\u2019t want to\nbe a \u201cslave for Google.\u201d Google laid off 12,000 people last year. AI is\nrapidly rendering these once-valuable jobs useless. And sitting at a desk\ncoding all day can start to seem kind of ridiculous when \u2014 with the right\nskill set and some daring \u2014 there are so many different ways to avoid sitting\nat a desk coding all day. And make much more money.\n\nBergwall has pleaded not guilty. Although he hasn\u2019t been a student at UMiami\nsince spring 2023, according to the school, he seems to be living like\neverything is copacetic, going to nightclubs with college buddies and recently\npopping up in a friend\u2019s photo at Ultra Music Festival, a Miami EDM fest. His\ngirlfriend (now ex) told sorority sisters after he was arrested that she\nexpected everything to get sorted out. Which might still happen. In December,\nhe was granted permission by the judge to leave Florida to visit his family in\nConnecticut for the holidays. Johnson, the former fraudster, believes that\nsuch lenient treatment is a sign of a cooperation agreement. \u201cSo far, the\nnumbers of those refunders choosing not to cooperate can be counted on one\nhand,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Bergwall\u2019s public activity on the coding website GitHub,\nwhere I have watched him in recent weeks posting regular updates to a project\ntitled \u201cTelegram-monorepo.\u201d This appears to be an AI bot designed to trawl\nTelegram for information. Buried in the code is a list of scam-affiliated\nkeywords the bot seems to be hunting for. (For instance: logs, ftid, scans,\nrefund, refunds, flights, uber, airbnb, rental.) In other words, Bergwall has\nbuilt a tool to scour Telegram for people committing some of the very crimes\nhe\u2019s currently facing charges for and denying participation in. The existence\nof the tool raises the possibility that he\u2019s working with the FBI to identify\nnew targets as part of a cooperation agreement, though his lawyer declined to\ncomment on this and the project was scrubbed the day after I asked about it.\n(His lawyer also declined to comment when I asked if the case would go to\ntrial. He did say that several claims in this story were inaccurate but\ndeclined to specify which.)\n\nEven without Bergwall, refunding rolls on. Recently, I messaged iFruitVouches,\nan account seemingly affiliated with the one MXB sold his channel to. I asked\nif the company still offered refunding services. \u201cYes I do Ups insider scan,\u201d\nit replied minutes later. \u201cI\u2019m always available.\u201d\n\nThank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism.
