Variation kicks in when you look at\nthe later years, consider multiple marriages, divorce, separation, and\nopposite-sex versus same-sex relationships.\n\nCheck the following interactive chart to see how the age distributions break\ndown, among partners who live together.\n\n## Marrying Younger and Older\n\nSelect your relationship status through the menus.\n\nThis is based on data from the five-year American Community Survey from 2022.\n\nIn the teens and early twenties, we seem to favor people closer to our own\nage, but then the age distribution spreads out after that. Get into the late\nyears, and the distributions skews younger, largely because there are fewer\npeople who are older than you as you get older.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see the ages spread out more when you look at those who\nare divorced (and in a new unmarried relationship) or have multiple marriages.\n\nShift to same-sex relationships. The distributions spread out more and you see\ngreater variation when you subset to multiple marriages. Same-sex marriage was\nnot legalized nationally in the United States until 2015.\n\nMy main takeaway is that things appear predictable in the younger years, in\nfirst marriages, and in the population overall. But after that, as the\ndistribution squishes down and spreads out, age grows less important.\n\n#### Notes\n\nThe estimates are based on data from the five-year American Community Survey\n2018-2022, which I downloaded via IPUMS. I looked at households with married\ncouples or people in relationships who live together. This doesn\u2019t include\npeople who are in relationships who do not live together.\n\nAnalysis and data preparation was done in R. The rest was made with JavaScript\nusing D3.js.\n\nBecome a member. Support an independent site. Make great charts.\n\nSee What You Get\n\nMy work on FlowingData is supported by paid memberships.
