It represents an advancement in how\nwebsites manage user logins, when logging in through different identity\nproviders (such as \u201cSign in with GitHub/Google/etc.\u201d) while preserving user\nprivacy. The initial motivation is to be able to use federated authentication\nwithout the use of 3rd party cookies. As described by Google:\n\n> FedCM is a method that allows users to log into websites through federated\n> identity services, such as \u201cSign in with...\u201d, without sharing personal\n> information with either the identity service or the website.\n\nTraditionally, when you log into a website using an external service provider\n(like using \u201cSign in with GitHub\u201d), you are redirected to the provider\u2019s login\npage. This is the classic flow of federated authentication standards such as\nOIDC and OAuth. FedCM changes this flow by acting as an intermediary within\nyour browser, between the website (called Relying Party or RP) and in this\nexample GitHub (called Identity Provider or IDP). If the end-user/agent has\nonce before logged successfully into their IDP, the browser can on subsequent\nvisits to the RP retrieve the access token on behalf of the user without the\nneed of a redirect to the IDP. We all know these weird hops from the RP to the\nIDP and back. No more.\n\nIn the following example Alice has logged into her IDP beforehand and is not\nvisiting the RP again, where the session expired. Time for a new token.\n\nWithout FedCM| With FedCM  \n---|---  \n  \nIn practice, FedCM works through a JavaScript API that websites can use. This\nmeans when you click a \u201cSign In with...\u201d button on a website, instead of\ntaking you to another page, the FedCM API in your browser springs into action.\nIt helps you log in without leaving the website you\u2019re on. This new method is\nnot only more convenient but also keeps your personal information more\nprivate, as it reduces the amount of data shared directly between you, the\nwebsite, and the external service provider.\n\nFedCM demo\n\n## Federated Authentication Is Important for a Decentralized Web\n\nFederated identity systems plus the introduced credential management in the\nbrowser offer a significant convenience. Improved user experience by getting\nrid of redirects to the IDP and remembering the previously used IDPs.\nEssentially, making it easier for the end-user to re-use their existing\nfederated identity. All in all leading to a much smoother proof of identity on\nthe web. However, when only a handful of major companies control the gateways\nto digital identity, it leads to a centralization of power and data, which\nposes a challenge to a truly decentralized web.\n\nThis concentration of control not only stifles innovation and competition from\nsmaller, independent identity providers but also raises concerns about\nprivacy, data security, and user autonomy. In a truly decentralized web, users\nshould have the freedom to choose from a diverse array of IDPs, promoting an\nenvironment where privacy, security, and user empowerment are paramount.\nBreaking this monopoly is not just about diversifying options; it\u2019s a crucial\nstep towards realizing the full potential of a decentralized, open, and\ndiverse internet ecosystem.\n\n## Current Implementation of FedCM: a Challenge for Small IDPs\n\nThe present implementation of FedCM requires Relying Parties to offer a\npredefined list of IDPs through the browser\u2019s FedCM API, a practice mirroring\nthe current trend in federated identification. Typically, this list is\ndominated by major tech companies like the usual Sign in with Facebook,\nGoogle, and GitHub. This preference arises as RPs often choose the most famous\nIDPs for their wider user base and perceived reliability. While this approach\naligns with what users and developers are accustomed to, it perpetuates a\nsignificant drawback: the marginalization of smaller and independent IDPs. RPs\ntend to prioritize popular and widely used IDPs, inadvertently sustaining the\ntech giants\u2019 monopoly. Consequently, smaller and independent IDPs face\nchallenges in gaining visibility and usage, overshadowed by the more\nestablished names often used by RPs.\n\n## Promoting Equality: A Proposed FedCM Model Favoring Diverse IDPs\n\nA more equitable implementation of FedCM could significantly benefit other\nIDPs. In this alternative implementation, the browser would maintain a list of\nIDPs that a user has previously registered with or signed into. This list gets\npopulated as IDPs self-register with the browser during user registration or\nsign-in processes. In addition to relying on a hardcoded list of IDPs, Relying\nParties (RPs) could also ask for registered IDPs when calling the FedCM API.\nThis change allows the browser to present its own list of IDPs, which includes\na broader range of providers. Such a model levels the playing field for other\nIDPs, enhancing user autonomy and fostering a more diverse identity ecosystem.\nIt represents an important step away from the dominance of major tech\ncompanies in the realm of digital identities.\n\n## Benefits for the Decentralized Community\n\nThis FedCM implementation offers key advantages for the decentralized web.\n\n  * Broad IDP Support with Great UX: It enables Relying Parties to offer a wider range of Identity Providers while maintaining a smooth user experience. This approach allows for more IDP options without overwhelming the user.\n  * Opening Doors for Smaller IDPs: The model gives non-big tech IDPs a fighting chance to be utilized by RPs, breaking the monopoly of major tech companies and fostering diversity and innovation in digital identity management.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nWhile FedCM is a step in the right direction, its current specs need to be\npush a bit further to stride towards a more balanced and diverse web. The\nspecs are willing to go in this direction but don\u2019t want to develop and\nmaintain a feature if it is not used 1.
