But the habit doesn\u2019t seem to interfere with his\nbusiness acumen: Snoop has sold 35 million albums across the globe and has\ncollaborated extensively with numerous other successful celebrities, including\ndomestic doyenne Martha Stewart.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly alone in his cannabis hobby. In Canada, where I live and work,\nabout 9 percent of residents use cannabis three or more times per week. With\nincreasing social acceptance, legalization, and retail availability, these\nnumbers are likely to rise. Yet despite this prevalence, we know remarkably\nlittle about how chronic use affects people\u2019s emotions and motivation.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

That\u2019s what my\ncolleagues and I from the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School\nrecently set out to answer. Our new study of chronic cannabis use in everyday\nlife, forthcoming in Social Psychological and Personality Science, challenges\nentrenched stereotypes of chronic users as lazy, low-achieving, and\nindifferent ne\u2019er-do-wells.\n\n> People were just as willing to exert effort when they were high as when they\n> were not.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

They\nused cannabis on average five to six times per week, and a minimum of three\ntimes a week, providing a glimpse into chronic use. The group, primarily male\n(76 percent), included a mix of white (56 percent) and Black (38 percent)\nindividuals, with a majority living in the United States (65 percent) and the\nrest in Canada (35 percent).\n\nTo capture the essence of cannabis experience in real life, we used what\npsychologists call an experience-sampling approach: Participants were randomly\nsurveyed five times per day over seven days about whether they were high, and\nabout their emotions, motivations, and abilities to self-regulate.\n\nWe wanted to collect data on people\u2019s thoughts and feelings as they were going\nabout their daily lives, as opposed to in a clinical setting. We were also\ninterested in comparing chronic users with different rates of use\u2014several\ntimes a week versus several times a day\u2014and changes in the experiences of each\nindividual when high versus sober. By contrast, many other studies of chronic\ncannabis use have compared cannabis users to non-users\u2014but these groups may\ndiffer in myriad other ways, such as personality, neurological makeup, and\nmental health profiles, that could influence the results.\n\nOur study participants reported being high 64 percent of the times we asked,\nmostly from smoking dried cannabis. They listed numerous reasons for getting\nhigh, but the primary reason was that they liked the feeling. Surprisingly,\nusers also frequently reported using the herb to help them concentrate and\nfocus.\n\nThe study\u2019s results challenge the common belief that cannabis use flattens\none\u2019s emotional curve. In fact, it seemed to heighten emotions among our study\nsubjects, but how this played out depended on how frequently they used the\ndrug. Those who got high two to four times a week reported increases in\npositive emotions\u2014greater awe, silliness, happiness, inspiration, even\nlove\u2014while they were high. They also said they felt less scared and less\nstressed while high.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

These heavy users reported feeling greater levels of\nnegative emotions in daily life compared to the moderately frequent\nusers\u2014including feelings of embarrassment, disgust, and guilt\u2014both when high\nand when sober. It is difficult to know from our study results which came\nfirst: Did the negative emotions precipitate the more frequent use of\ncannabis, or did increased cannabis use lead to more negative emotions?\n\nOur results also undercut the myth of the unmotivated cannabis user. We found\nthat being high did not make participants less motivated than when they were\nsober. According to self-reports, those who used cannabis several times a day\ntended to be even more motivated than less frequent users to complete tasks to\nobtain rewards and social approval and to avoid guilt.\n\nGiven questions about whether self-report is a valid measure for motivation or\nother psychological features, we also used a more objective measure of\nmotivation, gauging how willing participants were to exert mental effort for\nthe prospect of some reward. Study subjects were asked during each time\nsampling to make choices about which of two tasks to perform\u2014an easy number\nsorting task for little compensation, or a harder number-sorting task for more\ncompensation. Being high had no impact: Our participants were just as willing\nto exert effort for compensation when they were high as when they were sober.\n\nBut there were a couple of areas where the impact of chronic cannabis seemed\nless benign: self-regulation\u2014which is generally defined as the ability to\nmanage one\u2019s actions and to set, monitor, and follow-through on goals\u2014and\nconscientiousness. Psychologists have long lauded the positive effects of\nself-regulation and conscientiousness for happiness, health, and productivity.\nWhen our study subjects were high, they reported being more impulsive, less\norganized, more willing to lie to get what they wanted, and less willing to\nfollow rules\u2014though effect sizes were small.\n\nIn all, our findings prompted us to revise how we view cannabis users. As\npeople become more accepting of cannabis use, studies like ours, rooted in\nscience rather than misconception, could inform future policies about\nconsumption. Not every chronic user is as checked out as The Dude of The Big\nLebowski fame.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
