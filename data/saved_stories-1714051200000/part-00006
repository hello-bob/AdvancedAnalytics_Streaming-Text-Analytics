However, the camera is suspicious at best\nand an outright lie at worst.\n\nThe camera, which promises to \u201ccapture beyond the horizon with your\nsmartphone,\u201d has shattered its modest $20,000 funding goal. At the time of\nwriting, it had just eclipsed $372,000 in support, and it is rapidly\nincreasing by the hour. There are still 57 days left in the campaign, which\nhas earned Kickstarter\u2019s \u201cProject We Love\u201d sticker, adding more legitimacy to\nthe Excope DT1.\n\nBy the way, the project is listed as from Boulder, Colorado on Kickstarter,\nbut Beaverlab is based in Shenzhen, per LinkedIn. It\u2019s just something worth\nmentioning.\n\n## Impossible Promises\n\nBefore considering what the Excope DT1 might achieve in reality, let\u2019s see\nwhat Beaverlab says it can do. The Excope DT1 promises 200 times\nmagnification, a 400mm focal length, a 48-megapixel image sensor, and \u201csuper\ncomputing power.\u201d Controlled wirelessly using a connected smartphone \u2014 not\nincluded, of course \u2014 the Excope DT1 includes \u201ccutting-edge optics and\nadvanced digital technology with an ultra-telephoto lens.\u201d\n\nGiven the 48-megapixel sensor\u2019s size (1/1.8-inch), the 400mm lens is not an\nactual 400mm lens but a shorter lens with a heavy crop factor. That\u2019s not\nwildly misleading, as smartphone companies do that sort of thing all the time.\nThe 24mm primary camera lens on an iPhone 15 Pro is a 6.8mm lens with a 3.5\ntimes crop factor to account for the image sensor size.\n\nThe Excope DT1 has all the \u201cright\u201d features and makes a lot of grand promises.\n\nIf that were the only suspicious thing about the Excope DT1 campaign, that\nwouldn\u2019t be bad. That\u2019s a standard way to talk about lenses with small image\nsensors on cameras.\n\nIf only things were so simple.\n\n## Are the Photos Deceptive?\n\nWhen a company sells a camera, photos in the official marketing materials can\nreasonably be expected to have been shot using that camera. In the case of the\nExcope DT1, a product that promises high-quality telephoto images, there would\nbe no apparent reason for the average Kickstarter user\u2019s hackles to be raised\nwhen looking at beautiful sample shots of animals. The page certainly doesn\u2019t\nsay anything to suggest that the photos aren\u2019t genuine.\n\nHowever, something can seem off for photographers. Can a Type 1/1.8-inch\nsensor, smaller than many modern smartphone image sensors, capture photos that\nlook this sharp and deliver this sort of bokeh? No.\n\nHowever, seasoned vets with dedicated camera gear aren\u2019t the campaign\u2019s\nexpected target audience. The goal is to sell a product using false promises\nto people who don\u2019t know better.\n\nGiven how most Kickstarter campaigns, the Excope DT1\u2019s included, put photos in\nlarger graphics, there is no way to pull individual frames from the page and\nstart digging into the data. So, PetaPixel asked Beaverlab for some original\nsample files.\n\n\u201cWhen you say \u2018samples,\u2019 are you referring to pictures taken through our\ndevice,\u201d Artak Mkrtichyan, the public relations manager for the Excope DT1\ncampaign, confirmed.\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d PetaPixel replied.\n\nAfter a short delay, the company obliged, sending two still photos and a pair\nof video files under the guise that, like all the samples on the Kickstarter\npage, these files were captured using the Excope DT1.\n\n## The \u2018Sample Photos\u2019 Are Not From the Excope DT1\n\nThe two .JPG files are of primary interest, as they are nice photos of an\nIberian lynx and a kingfisher in the wild. If someone liked wildlife and\nwanted an affordable way to capture great images, why wouldn\u2019t they be\ninterested in something like the Excope DT1?\n\nBeaverlab sent this \u201csample\u201d image.\n\nLooking first at the Iberian lynx file, which is a 5,472 x 3,648 .JPG image,\nsomething is not quite right. It isn\u2019t a 48-megapixel file, it is a\n19.9-megapixel image, which also rules out the possibility of a pixel-binned\n16-megapixel image capture \u2014 a common technique used on smaller image sensors\nto improve low-light performance.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t have the appearance of an image shot with a small image\nsensor. There is a reason that smartphone companies use digital trickery to\nget soft, out-of-focus backgrounds. It is exceptionally challenging, if not\nphysically impossible, to get the \u201cbig camera\u201d look from a small image sensor\nwithout artificial bokeh.\n\nTo be fair, Beaverlab says that it uses \u201creal-time image processing\u201d and\n\u201cintelligent background defocus.\u201d However, to admit that there is digital\nmanipulation at play while showing photos that have background defocus because\nof actual optics is deceptive.\n\nAnd its EXIF data, which clearly shows it is not from the Excope DT1.\n\nA quick look in ExifTool shows that the lynx photo doesn\u2019t look like it was\ncaptured with a diminutive image sensor because, well, it wasn\u2019t. It was shot\nusing a Canon EOS 70D DSLR. Despite its \u201csmall\u201d APS-C sensor, it is still an\ninterchangeable lens camera capable of professional image quality, and most\nimportantly, it is not the Excope DT1.\n\nThe image\u2019s source.\n\nSince Beaverlab ignored the attribution requirement listed on the photo\u2019s page\non Freepik.com, a stock image site, PetaPixel will tell you that it was shot\nby Sergio Rojo.\n\nFor those curious, Rojo took the photo on October 25, 2015, in manual exposure\nmode with a 1/640s shutter speed, f/3.5 aperture, and ISO 320. His lens was an\nEF 70-200mm f/2.8L USM at 200mm.\n\nSo, the lynx image was not shot with the Excope DT1; what about the Kingfisher\nphoto? That image file, which is a paltry 8.4 megapixels, lacks metadata. It\nstill has embedded keywords, though. A quick Google search brings up Deposit\nPhotos, PetaPixel\u2018s go-to source for stock images. When we use them, we label\nthem as such, but alas.\n\nHuh, the \u201cXL\u201d version of the kingfisher photo, offered by Wirestock, is the\nsame size as the file Beaverlab Technology emailed. This wasn\u2019t shot using the\nExcope DT1, either.\n\nHow about this so-called sample image?\n\nIf these are the images the company sends when specifically asked to send\nsample images shot with the camera, there is no reason to believe any of the\nother photos on the Kickstarter page were legitimately shot with the Excope\nDT1.\n\nNope. Not this one, either.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Consider the DT1 Night\nMode \u201csample\u201d below. That level of low-light performance from a sensor that\nsize is, frankly, unbelievable.\n\nImpossible.\n\nThere were many ways for Beaverlab Tech to avoid this situation. Instead of\nusing deceptive photographs, the company could have said upfront that sample\nimages were illustrative and not captured using the DT1.\n\nIf a company sells a camera and includes sample photos, everyone will\nreasonably think the included photos were shot using the offered camera. Why\nwould anyone think otherwise?\n\nAt least when Kenko Tokina used stock photos on a camera product page, the\ncompany said the images weren\u2019t indicative of what the camera could capture.\n\n## The Excope DT1 Exists, Even if the Legitimacy of Most Sample Photos Are\nQuestionable\n\nIf the camera hadn\u2019t been manufactured yet, that would be reasonable. That\nsaid, given that it has a video review of the camera on the Kickstarter page,\nat least one working sample must be floating around.\n\nYouTube channel HansTechTalk has an \u201chonest review\u201d of the Excope DT1, which\nhas garnered 18,000 views and some plaudits in the comments.\n\nA highlight from the \u201creview\u201d includes out-of-focus footage of a bird in a\nbirdbath playing, while Hans says that the 400mm lens enables users to capture\nfootage of dangerous wildlife safely. Oh, and this footage? It\u2019s also seen on\nthe Kickstarter page.\n\nSome of the sample images in the video do at least seem real; they look like\nthey were shot with a small image sensor.\n\nThe video ends with Hans casually saying that if the Excope DT1 were two times\nmore expensive than it is, it would still be worth it. That\u2019s funny because\nthe camera, available to backers now for $199, will have an MSRP of $399. Huh,\na review says the camera is worth precisely what its maker says it will cost\nat retail.\n\nBeaverlab also shared a video that shows the DT1 used to capture close-ups of\nthe Moon. This sample seems plausible.\n\n## The Issue With Misleading Photos\n\nIf getting more real sample images wasn\u2019t possible, why not use labeled\nillustrative examples that are at least realistic representations of what\ncustomers can expect from the Excope DT1? Photos from smartphones or small-\nsensor superzoom cameras would be reasonable stand-ins for a presale campaign.\nIt\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s better than what is available now.\n\nFor $199, even so-so imaging performance could still be worth it for people\nlooking to affordably document wildlife or take photos of the Moon. The Excope\nDT1 is not necessarily a bad product; it\u2019s just that the camera\u2019s actual\nresults will not match what people are shown on Kickstarter. People are being\nsold an impossible promise.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have given Beaverlab their money. The sample images are\ndoing a lot of work in the campaign because who wouldn\u2019t want photos like that\nusing their phone and a $200 camera accessory? It\u2019s an exciting proposition.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad that it\u2019s impossible, despite what Beaverlab claims, all while\ntaking people\u2019s money.\n\nPetaPixel has requested comment and genuine Excope DT1 sample photos. At the\ntime of publication, Beaverlab has not responded.\n\nImage credits: Beaverlab / Sergio Rojo / Wirestock\n\nEquipment, Features, News\n\ncrowdfunding, excopedt1, kickstarter, scam, sensorsize\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWe\u2019re Skeptical of the Sky-High Promises This $249 Camera Makes\n\nArsenal Tops $1 Million on Kickstarter for Its Smart Camera Helper\n\nThis Strange, Compact Tripod Head Promises Convenience and Speed\n\nThis Re-Imagined Camera Battery Challenges Conventional Design\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nThis \u2018Photo\u2019 Was Made From an 84-Year-Old Woman\u2019s Memory\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nFilm Director: If Guns Require Licenses, Why Not Cameras?\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nOld Movies Are Being Enhanced With AI Tools and Not Everyone is Happy\n\n23 hours ago\n\nThe Trailer for the World\u2019s First Fully AI-Generated Film is Here\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nMKBHD Calls Humane AI Pin the \u2018Worst Product\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Reviewed\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
