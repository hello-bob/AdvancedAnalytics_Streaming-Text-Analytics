Tesla has a number of its\nown 750kW chargers deployed \u201cbehind-the-fence\u201d in Pepsi and Tesla facilities,\nbut this 1.2MW charger beats those in speed and is also publicly available.\n\nMCS is a new charge standard being worked on by charging standards\norganization CharIN. The standard is close to being finished, though currently\nthere aren\u2019t really available MCS-capable trucks, or even UL-certified\ncharging units.\n\nWattEV CEO Salim Youssefzadeh displaying an MCS charger\n\nAs a result, WattEV\u2019s installation is somewhat of an experiment. The site has\n50 total chargers, split between 32 grid-tied 360kW CCS chargers on one side,\nand 3 1.2MW MCS and 15 240kW CCS chargers on the other side, attached to\nbackup batteries and solar and fully grid-islanded.\n\nThat latter part is particularly interesting \u2013 WattEV got grants from the\nCalifornia Energy Commission to create this grid-islanded setup, wherein power\nfor the chargers is fully provided by 5MW of on-site solar (which WattEV wants\nto expand to 25MW eventually) and 3MWh of battery backup.\n\nWattEV could connect the setup to the grid, but between its grant from CEC,\nthe lack of UL-certified MCS chargers, and delays that would have been caused\nin the permitting and interconnection process, it decided that grid-islanding\nhalf of the site would be the right decision for the time being.\n\nThe inclusion of an MCS charger promises the ability to fill a truck in the\nsame time as a traditional truck rest stop. While trucks don\u2019t currently have\n1.2MW charging capability, WattEV wanted to be ready for when they do.\n\nNotably, something many operators bring up is that they\u2019re waiting for\nchargers before they start building or buying trucks. Here, however, we have\nan infrastructure provider out in the lead \u2013 building infrastructure before\ntrucks are being built or purchased. In a world where operators have gotten\nused to using infrastructure as an excuse, WattEV seems uninterested in\nallowing them to continue to use that excuse.\n\nLike WattEV\u2019s other chargers, this one will be publicly available either via\nmembership or scanning a credit card/QR code at the site. It\u2019s near an\nindustrial park in Bakersfield with several distribution centers and near the\n99 freeway, which services the California central valley. WattEV also offers a\n\u201ctruck-as-a-service\u201d model, wherein the company offers electric trucking at a\nset price with lower startup costs.\n\nThe charger could be of use for those distribution centers, bringing goods in\nfrom the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and also for traffic in the\nvalley, as there are many local farming facilities and produce delivery\nservices (for example, OK Produce in Fresno, which has committed to full zero\nemission operations).\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
