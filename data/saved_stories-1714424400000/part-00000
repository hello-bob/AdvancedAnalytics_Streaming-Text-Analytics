They claimed ongoing\nproblems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing on the way his\nactions have allegedly undermined people nominally empowered to perform\nvarious moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has\ngained more than 100 signatures.\n\n#### Decision-making authority\n\nThe Nix project is governed by the NixOS Foundation, a non-profit organization\nthat handles the project's finances and legal responsibilities. The foundation\nitself is headed by a board with five voting members, chaired by Dolstra.\nThere are no term limits, and the board selects its own membership and chair.\nAccording to the board's team page, its responsibilities include handling\n\"\"administrative, legal, and financial tasks\"\", sponsorships and donations,\nfunding for \"\"community events and efforts\"\", and acting as an arbiter in case\nof conflicts in the community. Notably, the board \"\"is not responsible for\ntechnical leadership, decisions, or direction\"\", nor is it expected to handle\nall decision making. The board is responsible for providing \"\"a framework for\nteams to self-organize\"\", including a duty to \"\"[h]and out the credentials and\npermissions required for the teams' work\"\".\n\nThe open letter has several related complaints, but the most central one is\nthat they allege Dolstra has repeatedly strong-armed the board and members of\nother community teams to overrule their decisions:\n\n> For example, after months of discussion on sponsorship policy in the board,\n> with consensus having been formed on a policy that allows community veto of\n> NixCon sponsors, Eelco (and Graham [Christensen], at the same time) appeared\n> at the open board call over 45 minutes in, and began re-litigating the issue\n> of whether we need to limit sponsorship to begin with, which had already\n> been agreed upon by everyone but him.\n\nChristensen is Dolstra's co-founder at Determinate Systems. The letter lists\nother examples, such as Dolstra blocking longtime contributors from becoming\ncode reviewers or blocking a build-system change that had made it through the\nRFC process. The letter concludes that Dolstra is essentially leveraging\nsocial power from being the founder of the project to overrule decisions that\nare nominally supposed to be made collaboratively. In short, Dolstra is acting\nas \"\"the effective Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)\"\" of the project, even\nthough the NixOS Foundation's charter doesn't grant anyone that authority. The\nletter says this leads to \"\"a culture of responsibility without authority\"\"\nthat erodes contributors' desire to continue working on the project. It\nspecifically mentions the moderation team as an example of this, saying that\nits members are \"\"in fear of their authority being undermined directly by\nEelco or indirectly through the Foundation\"\".\n\nWhen asked to comment on the concerns raised in the letter, members of the\nNixOS moderation team responded:\n\n> Overall we think that the letter describes the situation of the moderation\n> team fairly well. We have been operating in an emergency mode most of the\n> time for over half a year now. Our team retention is at an all time low, and\n> we are barely able to keep up with recruiting new members as old ones quit.\n> Right now the moderation team is down to four people, including two who\n> desire to leave as soon as a replacement is found, not counting another\n> moderator who left last week.\n>\n> To the extent that the moderation team feels disempowered, this is mostly\n> because of heavy antagonism from some community members or risks of\n> destabilizing the community, and not because of an actual lack of power.\n> Most of that is a reflection of a deeper cultural conflict within the\n> community and not directly related to the foundation board.\n\nDespite slightly disagreeing with the source of the issue, they went on to\nacknowledge that Dolstra had impeded several attempts to improve the\nsituation, and said that they understood many community members' complaints.\nThe team also called the situation itself \"a deep structural and cultural\nissue involving many people\".\n\nPierre Bourdon, a long-time contributor to Nix, posted on Mastodon about his\nexperience working on NixOS, stating that while he disagrees with the tone and\napproach of the open letter, the factual statements about Dolstra's leadership\nmatch his own experience.\n\n#### Conflicts of interest\n\nThe letter also alleges several conflicts of interest, primarily concerning\nDolstra's employer, Determinate Systems. Anduril, a military contractor that\nuses NixOS, has repeatedly attempted to become a sponsor of NixCon, which did\nnot go over well with the community, as reflected in the minutes of the board\nmeeting on March 20. The letter says Dolstra pushed strongly for the inclusion\nof Anduril as a sponsor even after it became clear that many core contributors\ndisagreed. Anduril was eventually dropped as a sponsor for both NixCon 2023\nand NixCon 2024 after community pressure.\n\nOn April 10, Th\u00e9ophane Hufschmitt, the secretary of the board, shared an\nupdate on the board's new sponsorship policy. Hufschmitt expressed the board's\napologies for the way the situation was handled, and promised that \"\"we will\nprioritize transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in our decision-\nmaking processes\".\"\n\nThat same day, Samuel Dionne-Riel stated that Dolstra had refused to clarify\nwhether he had a relationship with Anduril and asked Christensen, a co-founder\nof Determinate Systems: \"\"Does DetSys have or had relationships with\nAnduril?\"\" Christensen replied: \"\"Did you know this category of question is\npretty much impossible to answer because NDAs are a thing?\"\"\n\nThis isn't the only time Dolstra has appeared to avoid disclosing potential\nconflicts of interest; the letter alleges that he kept his status as a founder\nof Determinate Systems secret for some months (a claim Dolstra later denied),\nand that this is especially worrying in light of some of the technical\npromises that Determinate Systems makes to customers. The company produces its\nown installer for Nix that the company promises will provide stable support\nfor some Nix features. The letter states: \"\"This is fine, however, it is\nquestionably acceptable to do that while employing the lead developer of\nCppNix [the main Nix implementation] and saying nothing about how this will\ninteract with the team's [decision-making] autonomy.\"\" The concerns are not\nentirely theoretical, either; the main Nix installer has been broken in\nvarious ways since version 2.18 in September 2023.\n\n#### Call to action\n\nThe final section of the letter calls for Dolstra's resignation from the\nboard, suggesting that he should also completely disengage from the project\nfor at least six months, to give the rest of the board time to reform the\nproject's governance.\n\n> This document should be seen as the canary in the coal mine for what many\n> people have been feeling for years and does not exhaustively cover\n> absolutely all problems in the community, but we hope it is enough to\n> justify action.\n\nThe letter ends by suggesting that if Dolstra doesn't resign, the signatories\nwould switch to and support a fork of the project. I contacted several of the\nsignatories to ask whether they'd be willing to provide additional commentary\non why they believed a letter like this to be a necessary step. Haydon Welsh\nresponded:\n\n> I signed the letter because it was clear that every other team member was\n> sick and tired of Eelco, and so I saw it only right if that's their only\n> hope to regain enthusiasm for the project. No open-source project should die\n> or be hard-forked because of one person, that destroys a lot of the purpose\n> for being open-source.\n\nKiara Grouwstra had stronger feelings on the matter:\n\n> While I want a full rotation of members on the NixOS board, as well as\n> changes to its goal and structure so as to better incorporate the community\n> including marginalized perspectives, my friend convinced me the polemic\n> response would not sit well with the moderators, and shared with me the\n> draft open letter about Eelco's role, which I opted to settle for as the\n> lower-hanging fruit right now.\n\nOn April 27, Xe Iaso wrote a blog post about xer perspective on the matter,\nstating that at this point a fork is both inevitable and doomed. Even if the\nactions called for in the letter do come about, the difficult situation is\nalready having an impact on the Nix community. On April 21, Nixpgs contributor\nKamila Borowska resigned from the project. On April 25, Mario Rodas, who had\ncontributed more than 250 packages, followed suit. In total, 24 maintainers\nhave left.\n\n#### Dolstra's response\n\nOn April 26, Dolstra posted a response to the letter. He states that the role\nof the board is to handle the financial and legal work, not to run the Nix\ncommunity. He also claims that he has had \"\"very little involvement in Nixpkgs\nand NixOS in recent years\"\". Dolstra goes on to state: \"\"I am just one member\nof the five-member Nix team and hold no more formal authority than the others\nin determining the direction of the team.\"\" While this is true, it does not\ndirectly refute the letter's claims that Dolstra exceeds the formal authority\ngranted to him.\n\nDolstra also reiterated his position that NixCon should not refuse Anduril's\nsponsorship, stating: \"\"It is my opinion that it is not for us, as open source\nsoftware developers, to decide whose views are valid and whose are not, and to\nallow or disallow project or conference participation as a result.\"\" Dolstra\ndoes, however, explicitly refute the claim that his involvement in Determinate\nSystems was at all secret: \"\"My role, participation, and focus on the good\nwork being done at Determinate Systems have been public knowledge since the\ncompany's inception\"\". He goes on to say that the claim that Determinate\nSystems seeks to have an outsized influence on the community is \"\"patently\nfalse\"\".\n\nHe ends his response by inviting community members who feel unwelcome in the\nNix community to work for Determinate Systems instead:\n\n> I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard,\n> and valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this\n> important work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have\n> not been heard or feels displaced to join the Determinate Systems community\n> as we continue working to make Nix as easy to use and as impactful as\n> possible.\n\nIt is difficult to predict where the Nix community will go from here, and what\nthe eventual fate of any forks will be. For now, Dolstra remains the chair of\nthe board \u2014 a position he seems unlikely to give up under pressure from the\nletter's signatories.\n\n> Did you like this article?

As a\ncommunity you can agree that certain kinds of sponsorships should be rejected\nand that it their right. Since there appears to be a significant consensus\nhere, I don't see that Eelco's personal opinion is really relevant here. He\nshould be trying to change people's minds, not just telling them they're\nwrong.\n\nIn general though, Foundations like this really should have a scheduled\nrotation of members, if only to prevent ossification.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:24 UTC (Mon) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]\n\nI mean, we don't have to speculate there. I first heard about Anduril about a\nyear or so ago in the tones of \"did you know there's this peter thiel backed\ncompany using nix to make some pretty heinous killer drone and border stuff?\new\". But at that point nobody was really hugely inclined to do anything about\nit. Even when their employees who, unsurprisingly, hold some pretty\nreprehensible views started airing them in discussions and engaging in \"I'm\nnot touching you\" rules probing, the response was more annoyance at Anduril.\nThings only truly came to a head regarding them when the foundation indicated\nthat it was going to side with Anduril over the community every step of the\nway unless their hands were forced by third parties, in combination with the\nother organizational issues. That is very different from just participation,\nor even taking a bit of sponsorship money.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 14:50 UTC (Mon) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nWow, what a disgusting attack on people, who in a meritocracy, actually the\nmost measurable merit. That's IMHO all that counts, people with strongly held\nopinions can hold them as strongly as they can, but that's about all they're\n>entitled< to. End of story. The NixOS community, if anything, is now in dire\nneed of help defending against this woke mob. Just like Linux kernel community\nhad to be defended (and yet it still pops up from time to time, but Linus\nshowing these people their place right at the beginning, saying he's not\nchanging - we need an analogue of that here right now)\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 14:57 UTC (Mon) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nKnowing Eelco and Graham personally, also knowing what the state of\n\"community\" was a little while ago - before I disconnected precisely because\nof the onramp of internal politics and more importantly, where that is coming\nfrom, nope, I am not interested in one single byte of what the opposing side\nhas to say. This is just becoming too much.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:01 UTC (Mon) by flussence (subscriber, #85566) [Link]\n\n> help defending against this woke mob\n\nScratch an LLM fanatic, find a fascist.\n\n### Let's stop this one here\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:03 UTC (Mon) by corbet (editor, #1) [Link]\n\nI don't see anything good coming from this particular subthread, can we just\nstop now and save us all a bunch of obnoxiousness, please?\n\n### Let's stop this one here\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:24 UTC (Mon) by rsidd (subscriber, #2582) [Link]\n\nTBH I think you should have flagged the parent comment of what you actually\nreplied to.\n\n### Let's stop this one here\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:30 UTC (Mon) by corbet (editor, #1) [Link]\n\nI flagged the subthread, not a specific comment; my request landed in that\nthread at the point that I found it, not necessarily where things started to\ntake a bad turn.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:12 UTC (Mon) by burtness (subscriber, #93747) [Link]\n\nThe impression I got is that Linus held on to his position by working to\nchange the behaviour thats been a problem? You're also misrepresenting the\nNixOS situation given that the complaints are coming (at least in part) from\npeople who very much do the work only to see it undermined, frustrated or\nundone. The status quo is not really meritocracy, its just a fiefdom for the\npioneers.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:17 UTC (Mon) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nThe way I see it, he maybe toned it down a bit, but from what I've seen, his\nrants can still hurt a person emotionally, which was the main complaint there.\nI don't think that has changed - maybe there was a bit of a period where some\npeople said he's changed, but one can absolutely find new rants that have\nspilled outside of LKML.\n\n### A leadership crisis in the Nix community\n\nPosted Apr 29, 2024 15:24 UTC (Mon) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\n> The status quo is not really meritocracy, its just a fiefdom for the\n> pioneers.\n\nYeah, that is absolutely true.\n\nI think if we were to look for the original root cause of these problems here,\nit is that Eelco was too hands-off with the community when it really began\nforming, he was polishing the rough edges on Nix for too long, so it grew fast\nway over what he was ever ready to handle and now it seems to me it is just\ntoo late - especially now that the tensions are so noticeable it's even made\nit here to LWN.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eklektix, Inc.
