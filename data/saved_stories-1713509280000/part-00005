The move comes as the won's sharp\ndepreciation, rising oil prices and high borrowing costs aggravate business\nuncertainties after some of the group's mainstay businesses delivered poorer-\nthan-expected results in 2023.\n\nThe executives of Samsung Electronics Co., including those in the\nmanufacturing and sales divisions, will work either on Saturday or Sunday\nfollowing the regular five-day work week, according to Samsung Group\nofficials.\n\nThey will review their business strategies and may modify them to adapt to the\nchanging business environment amid mounting gepolitical risks from the\nprolonged war between Russia and Ukraine and escalating tensions in the Middle\nEast.\n\n\u201cConsidering that performance of our major units, including Samsung\nElectronics Co., fell short of expectations in 2023, we are introducing the\nsix-day work week for executives to inject a sense of crisis and make all-out\nefforts to overcome it,\u201d said a Samsung Group company executive.\n\nTop management at Samsing Display Co., Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. and\nSamsung SDS Co. will adopt the six-day work week as early as this week.\nSamsung Life Insurance Co. and other financial services firms under the\nSamsung Group will likely join them soon.\n\nExecutives of Samsung C&T Corp., Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Samsung E&A\nCo. have already been voluntarily working six days a week since the start of\nthis year.\n\nBut employees below the executive level across the group will continue to work\nfor five days a week, as the company introduced in 2003.\n\n(Graphics by Sunny Park)\n\nIn 2023, Samsung Electronics recorded an operating loss of 15 trillion won\n($11 billion) in its mainstay semiconductors business. The Device Solutions\ndivision, overseeing the semiconductor business, accounts for about 80% of\nSamsung\u2019s earnings.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest memory chipmaker signaled the end to the chip market's\ndownturn earlier this month, after posting more than a tenfold surge in\npreliminary operating profit in the first quarter of this year.\n\nHowever, it could face headwinds from the steep depreciation in the Korean won\nand the upward spiral in oil prices, coupled with political risks from the US\npresidential election in November.\n\nEarlier this week, the won softened to 1,400 per dollar, its weakest point\nsince Nov. 7, 2022. Dubai oil, a benchmark index, rose to $90.26 per barrel on\nApril 16, from $86.31 at the end of last month.\n\nSamsung is fighting an uphill battle to overtake domestic rival SK Hynix Inc.\nin the growing high bandwidth memory (HBM) market, widely used for AI\napplications.\n\nIn the foundry field, it will grapple with a challenge from Intel Corp., which\nplans to manufacture chips for fabless semiconductor companies, while stepping\nup efforts to overtake the dominant leader TSMC.\n\n(Graphics by Sunny Park)\n\nSamsung's shift to emergency mode comes after South Korea\u2019s energy-to-telecom\nconglomerate SK Group in January reintroduced Saturday gatherings of its\nsubsidiaries' chief executives after it adopted a five-day work week in July\n2000.\n\nThe meeting replaced the once-a-month weekday Strategy Committee Meeting for\nCEOs of the country's No. 2 business group's units.\n\nPetrochemical companies in the country are also tightening their belts to\nsurvive the industry\u2019s downturn caused by oversupply from Chinese rivals.\n\nLG Chem Ltd. and Lotte Chemical Corp. are accelerating business restructuring\nby shutting down some money-losing operations, or putting key units up for\nsale.\n\nOther Korean conglomerates are expected to follow suit. The outcome of last\nweek's general elections raises doubts about the feasibility of President Yoon\nSuk Yeol's business-friendly proposals.\n\nThe main opposition Democratic Party won a landslide victory in the April 10\nelections to retain a majority in parliament.\n\nWrite to Jeong-Soo Hwang and Woo-Sub Kim at hjs@hankyung.com\n\nYeonhee Kim edited this article.\n\nMore to Read\n\n  * Electronics\n\nWith AI tech, Samsung Electronics on par with Apple: Han Jong-hee\n\nApr 17, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Korean chipmakers\n\nSamsung to mass-produce industry\u2019s fastest LPDDR5X DRAM in H2\n\nApr 17, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Mergers & Acquisitions\n\nSamsung Electronics' key M&A man returns; big deals in the offing\n\nApr 12, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Korean chipmakers\n\nSamsung to more than double chip investment in Texas\n\nApr 07, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n2 Min read\n\n  * Earnings\n\nSamsung Q1 profit soars, set to benefit from Taiwan quake, AI chip demand\n\nApr 05, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Korean chipmakers\n\nSamsung set to triple HBM output in 2024 to lead AI chip era\n\nMar 27, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Mergers & Acquisitions\n\nSamsung Elec vies for Johnson Controls' HVAC units\n\nMar 25, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n2 Min read\n\n  * Real estate\n\nSamsung Fire headquarters up for sale at about $746 mn\n\nMar 20, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n1 Min read\n\n  * Corporate restructuring\n\nLG Chem reshuffles R&D unit to turn into EV materials maker\n\nMar 18, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n2 Min read\n\n  * Petrochemicals\n\nLG Chem to close base chemical styrene monomer business\n\nMar 13, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n3 Min read\n\n  * Earnings\n\nSamsung offers upbeat 2024 outlook on chip recovery\n\nJan 31, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n5 Min read\n\n  * Corporate strategy\n\nSK Group reintroduces Saturday CEO meeting after 20 years\n\nJan 24, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n2 Min read\n\nComment 0\n\nLOG IN\n\nTHE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY GLOBAL EDITION BRANDED CONTENT\n\nCompanies\n\n  * Companies Home\n  * Latest on Korean Startups\n  * Future Unicorns\n  * Hidden Champions\n  * Branded Content\n  * Get It Made In Korea\n  * Companies A to Z\n\nKorean Investors\n\n  * Korean Investors Home\n  * Who's Who in Korean Investors\n  * Asset Owners Report\n  * Asset Managers' Perspectives\n  * Best Asset Managers by Korean Investors\n  * RFP Alert\n\nDeals\n\n  * M&A\n  * ECM/DCM\n\nMarkets\n\nCulture & Trends\n\nPerspectives\n\nHidden Champions\n\nFuture Unicorns\n\nFollow us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n\nFamily Site\n\n  * The Korea Economic Daily\n  * The Korea Economic TV\n  * The Korea Economic Daily Magazine\n  * Hankyung BP\n  * Ten Asia\n\n  * About us\n  * Help Center\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with KED Global\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Copyright Policy\n  * Editorial Policy & Code of Practice\n  * Online newspaper registration No: \uc11c\uc6b8, \uc54453319 Date of registration: Oct 7 2020\n\nPublisher: Park Haeyoung | Address: 13F The Korea Economic Daily Bldg., 463, Cheongpa-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul, Korea 04505 | Business registration No: 796-87-01625 | Contact: kedglobal@hankyung.com, +82-2-360-4319 | KED Global ENG | KED Global \u4e2d\u6587(Chinese) | KED Global \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e(Japanese) | Sitemap | Company list | News topic\n\nCopyright\u00a9 2023 KED Global News Network .
