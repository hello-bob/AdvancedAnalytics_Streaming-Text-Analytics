In a\nfield in central Auckland, New Zealand \u2013 where a sign warns of roaming bulls \u2013\nsits the entrance to a lava cave likely formed 70,000 years ago: one among the\nhundreds that lie beneath the city.\n\nWith a previously unknown cave being discovered each month, a new mapping\nproject is underway to pinpoint their exact whereabouts, provide a blueprint\nfor other volcanic areas globally \u2013 and potentially avert future disaster.\n\nAuckland's status as a city built on an active volcanic field is \"really\nspecial and unusual\", says Kate Lewis, geoheritage and natural features expert\nat Auckland Council. That makes it all the more important \u2013 and challenging \u2013\nto earmark and protect the caves, which are formed after eruptions. \"There's a\nhazard component, there's an engineering component, there's a heritage\ncomponent,\" she explains. \"And then there's a huge cultural component as\nwell.\"\n\nRocks carpet the ground of the 70,000-year-old cave we are standing in, moss\nand fern clinging in patches overhead in the 10ft-high (3m) hole that would\nhave formed \"pretty quickly\" once an eruption began. What are now the city's\ncaves have taken shape over the space of 200,000 years, with the newest being\ncreated after the eruption of Rangitoto \u2013 the only mountain in Auckland to\nblow twice \u2013 around 550 years ago.\n\nCharlotte Lytton\n\nMany of the caves have taken shape over the last 200,000 years of volcanic\neruptions (Credit: Charlotte Lytton)\n\n\"Lava caves are empty lava tubes that develop during transport of usually\nfluid molten lava,\" explains David Clague, a volcanologist at the Monterey Bay\nAquarium Research Institute in California. During energetic eruptions, molten\nrock pours out onto the Earth's surface, moving downhill before cooling, and\nforming a crust.\n\n\"Initially, when molten rock lava hardens, it's very, very glassy, and it's an\nincredible insulator, so these can go on for miles,\" Lewis adds, describing\nthe flowing material as \"like molasses or honey\". When the lava supply is cut\noff, either because the magma has stopped rising, or because it has been\ndiverted elsewhere, it drains out, with the caves' empty pockets left behind.\n\nCaves \"occur in most lava flows, but are most common where the lavas are fluid\nand flow rapidly\", Clague says, making them common features in the likes of\nHawaii and Iceland, as well as oceanic volcanic island groups such as the\nGalapagos, the Azores and Tahiti.\n\nLava caves are not only a geological quirk, but have come to have both\npractical and cultural significance over the millennia\n\nThe longest of those in Auckland run up to 290m (957ft); in the US, that\nfigure is closer to 4km (2.5 miles), with Ape Cave at the Gifford National\nPark in Washington the longest continuous tube in North America.\n\nThe US versions, which can be found in states including Hawaii, California\n(where the Lava Beds National Monument resides), New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and\nArizona, can be far more labyrinthine than their Antipodean equivalents. Some\nhave splits and junctions, different levels and sudden drops, mimicking the\nway the lava moved through them thousands of years ago.\n\nLava caves are not only a geological quirk, but have come to have both\npractical and cultural significance over the millennia. At Bobcat Cave in\nIdaho, research has shown that Native Americans used the structures as fridges\nin hard times, likely preserving bison meat during fallow hunting periods.\n\nCharlotte Lytton\n\nJaxon Ingold (left) and Kate Lewis are attempting to map the huge network\nbelow Auckland (Credit: Charlotte Lytton)\n\nFor the M\u0101ori, who first settled New Zealand around the 13th Century, a number\nof Auckland's caves are sacred, used as burial sites for human remains (or\nkoiwi). Since the early 1800s, however, when the country was formed and given\nBritish sovereign rule, uncovered koiwi have been stolen for the likes of\nprivate collections and museums, in some cases reaching as far as the UK or\nUS.\n\nThis demonstrates a \"lack of care or understanding by new people coming in who\nhaven't respected those sites\", says Malcolm Paterson, a local M\u0101ori heritage\npractitioner who belongs to the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua tribe of the Auckland region. In\nhis lifetime, human remains have been taken from caves, sometimes \"for really\ndisrespectful purposes; a skull paperweight, for example. We've all seen and\nknow of where our sacred places haven't been treated in the way that we would\nlike\".\n\nThe caves have also been found to have been repurposed as a clandestine\nCommunist printing press in 1940 (stumbled upon by three schoolboys), a\nmushroom farm in the 1960s, and more recently, in an advert for a house for\nsale \u2013 recast as a wine cellar. \"Using them today for profane reasons would be\nthe same as going into a church and having a party \u2013 it's not appropriate,\"\nPaterson says.\n\nAs development projects spread across the city, the phone rings each time a\ndigger hits a cave\n\nThese are among the problems Lewis's team are tasked with solving: how to\nmanage caves discovered on private land, which make up the vast majority\n(believed to be around 90% of those in the city). There is an \"accidental\ndiscovery rule\" in place for those who do inadvertently strike upon one, which\ndemands \"the same procedure as if someone discovers an archaeological site or\nhazardous waste, or bones in a cemetery, and they have to stop work and\nprotect the area\".\n\nAs development projects spread across the city, the phone rings each time a\ndigger hits a cave, at which stage Lewis and her colleagues will assess its\nsize and features. \"We look inside, and then try to work out what we do with\nthe contractors, with the landowners, [and] how we can preserve the cave while\ncontinuing the building project. That's been quite a job.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe indigenous M\u0101ori used some of the caves as burial sites before the arrival\nof Europeans (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nFor private owners, finding what is tantamount to archaeological remains\nbeneath their homes isn't always a boon. Most choose to keep it quiet, both in\norder to avoid locals and tourists arriving to take a look (I am not allowed\nto name the cave we meet in on public land due to the surge in interest since\nthe mapping project was announced), and because they become \"quite worried\nabout their land value. If someone had this under their land, that would be\nthe end of a basement, the end of a swimming pool,\" Lewis says. \"People get\nkind of touchy about it.\"\n\nDiscovering a cave can also be dangerous. There have been instances where\ndiggers have crashed into holes, and as construction continues across\nAuckland, that may well become a common feature. \"We have limited housing, so\nwe're looking at intensification or increased development across the city,\"\nsays Jaxon Ingold, a Master's student at the University of Auckland who is\nworking on the mapping project.\n\n\"With this [increased] construction, there will be more building and more\nexcavation, so definitely more lava caves will be found.\" This not only\npotentially affects construction workers, but \"has threatened many of\nAuckland's lava caves, placing them at risk of destruction\".\n\nFollowing severe flooding in Auckland last year, geologists know that water\ncan flow easily through the caves\n\nAlong with manmade issues, there are geological ones, too: Auckland \"has the\npotential for an eruption at any time\", Lewis points out. To prevent a future\ndisaster, there is active monitoring and a volcanic contingency plan designed\nby Devora (Determining Volcanic Risk in Auckland, funded by the Earthquake\nCommission and Auckland Council).\n\nUnsure where the next eruption will be, Devora has mapped out seven different\nscenarios across various parts of Auckland, \"so if there's an eruption there,\nwhat might it look like? How might that volcano behave? What would be the\nevacuation issues? What would be issues for infrastructure?\" Authorities,\nLewis adds, \"take it quite seriously, because the chance of this happening is\nquite low in anyone's lifetime. But the impact would be enormous\".\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022 The secrets of life hidden in enormous caves\n\n\u2022 The place no human will tread for 100,000 years\n\n\u2022 The bunker builders preparing for doomsday\n\nCreating the first-ever database of Auckland's lava caves will prove, they\nhope, an opportunity to arm the city \u2013 and perhaps others \u2013 against future\nhazards. \"Looking at past lava flows [the hard rock that flowed in a volcano's\neruptive history] can help us learn more about the way lava flows travel,\"\nIngold says.\n\nWhile caves like this one in central Auckland are sealed but for the entrance,\nfor lava caves in the likes of Hawaii \"that are potentially open in more than\none places, lava \u2013 if it flows into an old tube \u2013 can then flow through and\nreactivate potentially, further down\". Following severe flooding in Auckland\nlast year, geologists know that water can flow easily through the caves,\nraising the likelihood that molten lava could again.\n\nIngold hopes that his work might provide a blueprint for other similarly\nvolcanic areas around the world. Though he knows that there would be\n\"different needs, depending on where you were in the world, depending on what\nhappens nearby, or how strong the cultural element is, or what the hazard risk\nis\". Still, the idea that this nascent database might redefine the future of\nlava caves globally would, he admits, \"be very cool\".\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to\nyour inbox twice a week.\n\nCave\n\nFeatures\n\nGeology\n\nNature & Outdoors\n\nNature's Wonders\n\nMore\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## Was there an earthquake in County Donegal?\n\nAnyone who may have felt a shake on Thursday evening is asked to contact a\nlocal school teacher.\n\n1 hr ago\n\nEurope\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## Nine of the best TV shows to watch this May\n\nFrom Tudor detective show Shardlake to the return of Bridgerton and Doctor\nWho, and Benedict Cumberbatch starring alongside a puppet in Netflix thriller\nseries Eric.\n\n1 hr ago\n\nCulture\n\n22 hrs ago\n\n## Why biophilia should be part of your next holiday\n\nEngaging with nature on vacation can not only make you feel more rested and\nrestored, it can also enhance wellbeing when you're back home.\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n23 hrs ago\n\n## The Fall Guy shows stunt people are undervalued\n\nRyan Gosling and Emily Blunt's new film features spectacular action sequences\n\u2013 and makes an important case for the people who perform such feats to be\nrecognised as true artists.\n\n23 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n2 days ago\n\n## This rare cicada emergence last happened in 1803\n\nTwo broods of cicadas have started emerging simultaneously for the first time\nin 200 years.
