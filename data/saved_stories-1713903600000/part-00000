Those innovations include using AI to generate\ncoffee blends, an experiment Helsinki-based Kaffa Roastery undertook this\nweek.\n\nThe roastery, the third largest in the country, partnered with Elev, a Finnish\nAI consulting startup, to create \u201cAI-conic,\u201d the roastery\u2019s first blend\ngenerated by large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe roastery staff prompted ChatGPT and Copilot with a series of tasting notes\nand asked which beans would produce that flavor profile. The experimentation\nwith the LLMs yielded a blend of four different beans\u2014an unconventional move,\nbut one that surprisingly worked. Kaffa\u2019s staff made no changes to AI\u2019s\nsuggestions.\n\n\u201cThis (trial) was the first step in seeing how AI could help us in the\nfuture,\u201d Kaffa\u2019s managing director and founder Svante Hampf told AP. \u201cI think\nAI has plenty to offer us in the long run. We are particularly impressed [by]\nthe coffee taste descriptions it created.\u201d\n\nFinland has a strong coffee culture in part because of its location north of\nthe Arctic Circle, which produces long days\u2014sometimes with 19 hours of\nsunlight\u2014that necessitate a steady flow of caffeine. Some Finns drink up to\neight cups a day. Finnish cafes are not only places for locals to get a coffee\nfix; they\u2019re also the epicenter of family-led childcare services, cementing\ncoffee as a focal point in Finnish culture.\n\nBut despite Kaffa\u2019s dive into coffee experimentation, the AI-generated drink\ncraze did not originate in this Nordic nation. Coca-Cola launched Y3000 in\nSeptember, a beverage with flavors suggested by AI that\u2019s supposed to resemble\n\u201cwhat a Coke from the future might taste like.\u201d Columbus-based brewery Species\nX added two beers to its menu in February that draw on unconventional flavor\ncombinations created with the help of AI\u2014think pineapple, strawberry, and\nsubtly sweet lactose.\n\n## The cutting edge of coffee technology\n\nFinland\u2019s coffee industry has embraced outside-the-box technologies for years.\nVTT Technical Research Centre of Finland found a way to grow coffee beans in a\nlab by essentially soaking cells in a liquid containing the enzymes and\nnutrients needed for them to grow.\n\nIndeed, climate change has made it harder to grow coffee in farms, as the heat\nin areas growing the industry\u2019s most ubiquitous Arabica bean has become\ninhospitable to the plant. Other bean varieties such as Robusta can grow in a\nwider range of climates, but tastes bland compared to its counterparts. The\nindustry is also contending with soil contamination, deforestation, and the\nuse of chemicals treatments, all of which impact coffee bean harvests.\n\nBut while coffee bean farms can only generate a couple harvests a year\u2014and are\nalso limited by the labor-intensive processing of the crop\u2014scientists can\nproduce lab-generated beans in about a month. Yet the proliferation of the\ntechnology to grow coffee in a lab doesn\u2019t mean these beans are ready to reach\nthe mass market.\n\n\u201cAlthough the roasted cell coffee samples had several odor-active compounds in\ncommon with the conventionally prepared coffees, the complete aroma and flavor\nprofile of cell coffee samples require further efforts to closely resemble\nconventional coffee,\u201d Heiko Rischer, head of plant biotechnology at VTT, and\ncolleagues wrote in a 2023 Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry study.\n\nLab-grown coffee may not be as tasty as its farm-grown alternatives, but\nroasters and distributors have acquiesced around the idea of using the beans\nin the future, should climate change necessitate it.\n\n\u201cI think someday we\u2019re going that way because of all the natural coffee\nsources vanishing, so we have to move along...If it tastes good and the aroma\nis coffee based, so why not? I think it\u2019s possible,\u201d a Helsinki-based barista\ntold Reuters.\n\n## Latest in Retail\n\n  * 5 hours ago\n  * Retail - Grocery\n\n## Primark owner AB Foods expects \u2018significant growth\u2019 in profits for 2024 as\ninflation eases in recession-affected markets like the U.K.\n\nBYJennifer Creery, Deirdre Hipwell, and others\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 7 hours ago\n  * Retail - U.K.\n\n## Ocado overtakes rivals amid pressure from shareholders urging the group to\nleave London for New York\n\nBYJennifer Creery and Bloomberg\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 16 hours ago\n  * Environment - wildlife\n\n## \u2018Egregious\u2019\u2014designer who smuggled purses made of python and caiman\nsentenced to 18 months in prison\n\nBYJoshua Goodman and The Associated Press\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * 18 hours ago\n  * Retail - food and drink\n\n## Finland\u2014the world\u2019s No. 1 coffee consumer\u2014is turning to AI and lab-grown\nbeans to energize the industry\n\nBYSasha Rogelberg\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * 21 hours ago\n  * Success - Luxury\n\n## In a \u2018Succession\u2019-style move, even more of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault\u2019s kids\nare nabbing pivotal roles, while their Gen Z brother faces big test\n\nBYSasha Rogelberg\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Retail - Bankruptcy\n\n## Onetime mall favorite Express files for bankruptcy as its officewear\ncrashes into the hybrid-work world\n\nBYIrina Ivanova and The Associated Press\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Finance\n\n## The outlook for home prices has changed drastically in just the past month\nas Fed rate cuts look more and more distant\n\nBYJason Ma\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n  * 4 hours ago\n  * Politics\n\n## Baltimore accuses the owner and operator of Dali ship that collapsed bridge\nof providing \u2018incompetent\u2019 crew and \u2018clearly unseaworthy\u2019 vessel\n\nBYEleanor Pringle\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Health\n\n## Your reusable water bottle may be a breeding ground for strep and fecal\nbacteria.
