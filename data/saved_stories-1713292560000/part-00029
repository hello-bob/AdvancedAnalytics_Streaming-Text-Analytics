Work remote for the US.\n\nApr 12, 2024 3 min read Newsletter\n\n# Live in the EU. Work remote for the US.\n\nToday I'm telling you about Salary Arbitrage, the biggest opportunity in\nremote work: Working for a company in a high wage country (eg: US), while\nliving in a more affordable place (eg: Portugal).\n\nHey,\n\nI'm Sergio Pereira, and this is the Remote Work newsletter\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rise of Fractional remote jobs, following many\nquestion about my Fractional CTO work and the recent workshop I lectured at\nthe Remote Jobs Braintrust on this topic.\n\nStill, the Fractional opportunities are still a fringe of the market, compared\nto full time remote jobs. As I get through testing the JobsCopilot.ai with\ndifferent profiles, skill sets and seniority profiles I come to realise that\nremote work is much bigger than I had imagined myself.\n\nToday I'm telling you about Salary Arbitrage, the biggest opportunity in\nremote work. Take a look at this chart from the recent Stack Overflow\nDeveloper Survey:\n\nSoftware Developer compensation 2023\n\nThere are some obvious takeaways, right?\n\nThe US is the country with highest salaries, with a minimum of ~$110k/year\nreported. But, on the opposite end of the list, the highest salary reported in\nPakistan is ~$16k/year. So, if the highest paid Software Developer in Pakistan\nlands a remote US job earning a \"low\" US salary, that means an almost 7x\nsalary increase. Mind blowing stuff!\n\nWhat's even more impressive is that even for countries deemed as \"developed\"\nand having \"high salaries\", the gap to those US salaries is still huge.\n\nTake a look into Germany or France, two of the most prominent countries in the\nEU. The highest local salaries for Software Developers are around $90k and\n$70k a year, respectively. A well paid SWE in those countries can still gain a\nnice 50% salary bump by working remotely for the US.\n\nI live in Portugal, myself. Local salaries for Software Developers, as per\nthis survey, range between ~$30 and ~$70k a year. To be honest, I used to earn\na bit below those $30k/year back in the day, so the market here used to be a\nbit worse than it is nowadays.\n\nWorking remotely for companies in the US was truly life changing for me. I\nremember 5x'ing my salary back in 2016. That's stuff I couldn't have even\ndreamt with before then.\n\nIt goes without saying that from the standpoint of a US company, this is also\na massive opportunity to arbitrage costs. Paying an attractive salary in most\ncountries in the world is much cheaper than paying a low salary in the US.\n\nAs you probably know, I've been building the JobsCopilot.ai. I have a scraper\n\"listening\" for updates in jobs published by ~400k companies around the world.\nMost of the work has been on cleaning the data and fine tuning the matchmaking\nbetween jobs and users.\n\nOne of my earliest findings is that there are thousands of companies hiring\nremotely, including many companies in the US. This was my recent article about\nsome early findings based on this data.\n\nThis is a TL;DR:\n\nData on remote jobs from JobsCopilot.ai\n\nI'll soon launch the Jobs Copilot to the ~1500 people on the waitlist. Stay\ntuned.\n\nIn other news, this week I had my most engaging session so far at the Remote\nJobs Braintrust. With more than 50 people joining the live session \"How to\nstart a Fractional/Freelance career\". If you'd like to learn how I build my\nclient pipeline as a Fractional CTO, join here to access the recording and the\nQ&A on Slack.\n\nThanks for reading this newsletter until the end. You can read all past\neditions here. Make sure to share it with your friends and colleagues so they\ncan read it too.\n\nIf you're interested in sponsoring this newsletter, send me an email or DM.\n\nSee you next Friday,\n\nSergio Pereira, Startup CTO & Remote Work Lover\n\n### Published by:\n\nShare Tweet\n\n### You might also like...\n\nApr\n\n05\n\n## The rise of Fractional remote jobs\n\n4 min read\n\nMar\n\n29\n\n## One year of Remote Work Newsletter\n\n1 min read\n\nMar\n\n22\n\n## The impact of layoffs and AI in the remote job market\n\n3 min read\n\nMar\n\n15\n\n## Helping 1000 people find remote jobs\n\n2 min read\n\nMar\n\n08\n\n## Side projects can boost a remote career\n\n3 min read\n\n### Get the free ebook on your email\n\nSergio Pereira tells you how to land a remote job, both if your an experienced\ntech worker or if your just starting out.
