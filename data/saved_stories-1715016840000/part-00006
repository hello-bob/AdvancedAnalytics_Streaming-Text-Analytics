Keeping teams happy and growing \u2014 that was my job.\n\nThe first important decision came knocking on my door right after I had\nstarted.\n\nFor years the team had had monthly meetings with knowledge sharing\npresentations but we were really struggling to find engineers willing to\npresent. The issue was that the team was approaching 100 people, so these\nmeetings were no longer small and cosy. One of our senior leaders proposed to\nopen them up to an even broader audience and rename them to Backend Meetings,\nconnecting people from other technology units.\n\nI agreed to proceed; the Rails Meeting ceased to exist.\n\nThe results of the decision were immediate (first order consequences) and\nsatisfactory as we did not struggle to find participants. Problem solved?\n\nAfter a few months we realised that Backend Meetings were even more difficult\nto maintain. People missed their old meetings, and my team had no single place\nto discuss important announcements specific to us.\n\nSecond-order thinking is a mental model where we consider more than just one\nimmediate result of our decisions. As its name states \u2014 we also look at\npotential future results (second order consequences).\n\nThis is Perspectiveship.

However, be\ncautious of overthinking, as it may lead to decision paralysis.\n\nWhat I personally prefer is considering the reversibility of a given decision.\nIf it is easy to reverse, act fast. If it is difficult to revert, more time is\nneeded to decide.\n\nPause for a moment and ask:\n\n##\n\nAnd then what?\n\nWhenever you decide or consider different scenarios, ask: And then what?\nRepeat this process multiple times to discover first, second, or even third-\nlevel consequences.\n\nFor example, we need to decide today whether to add an extra feature before\nthe afternoon demonstration. However, if we choose to do so, we will have to\ncut corners to ensure it is ready.\n\n  * 1st order: (and then...) \u2014 The feature works correctly during the demo.\n\n  * 2nd order: (and then...) \u2014 This one-off feature is unexpectedly widely used and negatively impacts the performance, security, and maintainability of the entire application due to the way it was implemented.\n\nThis is a simple example, but \u201cAnd then what?\u201d can apply to any situation.\n\n##\n\n10-10-10 Rule\n\nThe 10-10-10 rule, introduced by Suzy Welch, is a time-bound approach for\nsecond-order thinking.\n\nConsider the consequences of the option you choose:\n\n  * In 10 minutes?\n\n  * In 10 months?\n\n  * In 10 years?\n\nThis approach is suitable for handling short-term negative consequences. For\nexample, consider changing the company-wide software development life-cycle:\n\n  * In 10 minutes, there may be resistance, and the transition could be chaotic. You might face criticism.\n\n  * In 10 months, it becomes optimised and streamlined, and engineers are satisfied.\n\n  * In 10 years, which is quite a stretch for software, the delivery processes have evolved several times, building on the initial change.\n\nYou can also adjust the time frame to hours, days, or weeks based on your\nneeds.\n\n#\n\nSummary\n\nWe revived Rails Meeting after 22 months, although it took much longer than it\nshould have. It came back in a refreshed form, with clear ownership. In\nhindsight, cancelling it was a mistake as I did not consider the long-term\nconsequences.\n\nSecond-order thinking focuses on the long-term impact rather than just\nimmediate results.\n\nEach time you are about to make a decision, pause and ask: And then what?\n\nI hope reading this will have a positive impact on you in the next 10 minutes,\n10 months, and maybe even 10 years from now.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nMicha\u0142\n\nShare\n\nPS: Practising second-order thinking may benefit you in the future. Be kind to\nyour future self.\n\nPPS My interest in mental models has been growing over the years thanks to\nFarnam Street. Their podcast, The Knowledge Project, and their books. Second-\norder Thinking was one of the first mental models I learned.\n\n##\n\nPost Notes\n\n###\n\nDiscover Weekly \u2014 Shoutouts\n\nArticles that might help you explore new perspectives which I have read this\nweek:\n\n  * \u201cContributing to Open-Source to accelerate your growth\u201d from\n\nSudo Make Me a CTO\n\nby\n\nSergio Visinoni\n\n\u2014 Sergio shared his experiences and tips on contributing to open-source\nprojects.
