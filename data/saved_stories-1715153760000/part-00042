Alamy\n\nA review of Nuclear War: A Scenario by Annie Jacobsen; 400 pages; New York:\nDutton (March 2024)\n\nAs Chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\nfrom 2008\u20132018, I helped unveil the Doomsday Clock every year for a decade.\nThat meant that each year, I sat down with my colleagues for several days and\nseriously contemplated how close we might be to the end of civilisation. But\neven that sombre preparation could not prepare me for the grim realities\nunveiled in the recent book, Nuclear War: A Scenario, by veteran national\nsecurity journalist Annie Jacobsen.\n\nJacobsen details the events that would take place, minute by minute, in the 72\nminutes from the launch of a rogue intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)\nby North Korea to the destruction of modern civilization and the death of up\nto five billion people.\n\nJacobsen imagines the following scenario:\n\n> (0 min) A lone ICBM is launched from North Korea. (19 min) The US launches\n> 50 ballistic missiles at targets in North Korea and instructs submarines to\n> launch 32 additional missiles. (21 min) Most of Southern California becomes\n> uninhabitable due to a North Korean submarine-launched ballistic missile\n> (SLBM) attack on the Diablo Canyon nuclear reactor. (33 min) Washington DC,\n> together with almost all its 6 million inhabitants, is vaporized by the\n> impact and explosion of the North Korean ICBM. (49 min) Fearing they are\n> under attack from the US missiles heading toward North Korea, Russia\n> launches 1,000 missiles at US targets. On detection of these, the US\n> launches an ICBM and SLBM attack on 975 Russian targets. (51 min) NATO\n> pilots launch an aerial nuclear attack on the Russian targets. (52 min)\n> North Korea is effectively wiped off the map, following the impact of 32\n> SLBM and 50 ICBM missiles. (57 min) All land-based US military bases are\n> destroyed by Russian SLBMs. (58 min) Much of Europe is destroyed by a\n> Russian SLBM attack on NATO bases. (59 min) The US launches the remainder of\n> its stock of SLBMs at Russia. (72 min) 1,000 locations in the United States\n> are hit by Soviet ICBMs. A large fraction of the US population is killed\n> immediately and most of the rest have little or no means of survival. A\n> similar fate befalls Russia several minutes later.\n\nMeanwhile, 52 minutes into this apocalyptic exchange, a nuclear device\nexplodes in space high above the US, producing an electromagnetic pulse that\nrenders almost all communication systems in the continental US inoperative,\ndestroying much of the country\u2019s infrastructure and causing widespread floods\nand fires, thus further complicating life for the few remaining survivors.\n\nWhether or not one finds the specific scenario Jacobsen outlines plausible, it\nis clear that any major nuclear confrontation would have apocalyptic\nconsequences. As Soviet Chairman Nikita Khrushchev said shortly after the\nCuban Missile Crisis, in such a situation, \u201cthe survivors would envy the\ndead.\u201d\n\nMilitary planners have been preparing for scenarios like this since at least\n1960, when the first comprehensive nuclear war planning exercise was carried\nout in the US.\n\nAs Jacobsen describes, in 1949, experts estimated that as few as 200 fission-\ntype weapons of the kind that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have been\nsufficient to essentially wipe out the Soviet Union. But despite this, both\nthe US and the Soviets continued to amass weapons. By 1967, the US and USSR\nhad around 30,000 nuclear and thermonuclear warheads each. While their arsenal\nhas since been reduced, the US still has over 1,700 warheads on hair-trigger,\nlaunch-on-warning alert. Russia has only slightly fewer. Both countries have\nover 3,000 additional nuclear weapons stockpiled and available for use.\n\nFor the past 79 years, we have been living under the Damoclean sword of\nmutually assured destruction (MAD), the basis of modern nuclear deterrence. It\nis argued that since any act of nuclear aggression would lead to the\nannihilation of most of the world, no rational leader would launch a first\nstrike. What is less frequently stressed, however, is that for this to work,\ndeterrence must never, ever fail. Because once it does, the world as we know\nit will end.\n\nThinking the Unthinkable\n\nAppeasement and deterrence in a nuclear age.\n\nQuilletteSteve Salerno\n\nThe madness of having almost 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert,\ncapable of being irretrievably launched on their missions of destruction at\nthe mere warning of an incoming nuclear attack\u2014before a single nuclear\nexplosion has even occurred\u2014has not been lost on US presidential candidates\nfrom both parties. Both George W. Bush, and Barack Obama vowed to take us back\nfrom the razor\u2019s edge while running for president, but neither made good on\nthis promise while in the White House. I was on Obama\u2019s science policy team\nduring his first run for the presidency. I was gratified when he won because I\nthought he would fix this lunacy. I was profoundly disappointed when he\ndidn\u2019t.\n\nMost of the US public thinks that America has renounced the optional first use\nof nuclear weapons. But while many presidential candidates have promised to do\nso, no one in office has ever made it an official policy.\n\nI have often wondered why successful presidential candidates change their tune\nonce they get into the Oval Office. I suspect that the generals who advise the\nPresident and the Secretary of Defence have lived with the idea of launch-on-\nwarning throughout their whole careers and cannot even imagine that a US\npresident might allow a nuclear weapon to explode on American soil without\nhaving already launched a response. Since most presidents have no experience\nwith war game planning\u2014and Democratic presidents, in particular, are often\nworried about appearing soft on defence\u2014they are easily swayed by their\nmilitary advisors.\n\nThe maddening ramping-up of nuclear arsenals is a real-world example of the\nwell-known game theory scenario called The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, in which two\nprisoners, who cannot communicate with either other, are motivated by mistrust\nto make choices that are in neither party\u2019s best interests. Likewise, each of\nthe superpowers assumes that its adversary will stockpile ever more nuclear\nweapons, so it seems logical to stockpile more themselves.\n\nThere is a simple way out of this dilemma. Unlike in the game theory example,\nthe prisoners here can talk to each other and, through diplomacy, can jointly\narrive at a win-win strategy. The problem is that there are currently almost\nno front-door communications between either Russia and the US or China and the\nUS on strategic nuclear issues. The resulting perils are clear\u2014especially at\nthis time, with the continuing war in Ukraine, tensions between China and\nTaiwan, and the brewing catastrophe in the Middle East.\n\nThe American public has been misinformed about the gravity of this threat\nbecause of a false narrative regarding anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defence.\nHaving witnessed Israel\u2019s recent success in defending itself against\nconventional missiles launched from Iran, many people assume that the US has a\nworking ABM system (a false claim first touted by George W. Bush in around\n2004). We don\u2019t\u2014despite having spent almost 176 billion dollars trying to\ncreate such a system. As Jacobsen emphasizes in her book, we have only 44 ABM\ninterceptors in place. Moreover, in carefully controlled tests that did not\nrealistically reproduce the many uncertainties inherent in an actual nuclear\nexchange\u2014including the possible use of decoys\u2014the prototypes of those\ninterceptors have failed more than 50 percent of the time. We have essentially\nno defences against nuclear weapons. All we can do is try to ensure that they\nare never used.\n\nFor the arms industry, however, nuclear weapons\u2014as horrifying as they are\u2014are\nthe gift that keeps on giving. The Biden administration\u2019s $850 billion defence\nbudget for 2025 allocates $69 billion to nuclear weapons operations and\nmodernisation. Plans for 400 new ICBMs, new nuclear submarines and bombers,\nand upgrades to existing warheads are currently in the works, at a projected\ncost of three quarters of a trillion dollars over the next decade. MAD isn\u2019t\nmad enough, it seems. Defence contractors, lobbyists, and right wing think\ntanks are concerned that 1,700 nuclear weapons are not enough and that\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s enemies will become even more emboldened... while facing a hobbled\nand undersized American nuclear deterrent.\u201d\n\nAlmost all the nuclear war games that military strategists have engaged in\nhave invariably escalated to the point of Armageddon. Spending further\nbillions to produce weapons whose sole purpose is to lead to nuclear\nannihilation will not make us safer. Far from enhancing American national\nsecurity, or the security of the world, nuclear weapons will lead us to the\nedge of destruction.\n\nI was proud to take the helm of the group established in 1947 by Albert\nEinstein and Robert Oppenheimer to warn the world of the dangers of nuclear\nweapons, in part through the annual setting of the Doomsday Clock. But, sadly,\nthat effort has been an abject failure. Perhaps Jacobsen\u2019s new book,\nreportedly soon to be adapted for the big screen, may bring people to their\nsenses. For the past 79 years, we have been lucky, but our luck may not hold\nforever. Even a single ICBM launch could lead to a war that abruptly ends over\n400,000 years of modern hominid evolution, leaving little or no trace of human\nexistence and of our other technological achievements\u2014all in less time than it\ntook me to write these words.\n\n  * Nuclear War\n  * Science / Tech\n  * war\n  * Military\n\n### Lawrence M.
