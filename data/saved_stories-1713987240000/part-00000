However, the\nJapanese had secretly abandoned the island two weeks earlier, and so the\nAllied landings were unopposed. Allied forces suffered over 500 casualties in\ntotal during the operation from Japanese landmines and booby traps, friendly\nfire incidents, and vehicle accidents.^[1]^[3]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nAleutian Islands campaign  \n---  \n  \n  * Dutch Harbor\n  * 1st Attu\n  * 1st Kiska\n  * Amchitka\n  * 15 July 1942\n  * Komandorski Islands\n  * 2nd Attu\n  * 3rd Attu\n  * 12 May 1943\n  * Pips\n  * 2nd Kiska\n  * Cottage\n\n  \n  \nMain article: Japanese occupation of Kiska\n\nThe Japanese under Captain Takeji Ono had landed on Kiska on June 6, 1942 with\n500 troops of Special Naval Landing Forces. Soon after arrival, they stormed\nan American weather station, where they killed two and captured eight United\nStates Navy officers. The captured officers were sent to Japan as prisoners of\nwar. Another 2,000 Japanese troops arrived, landing in Kiska Harbor. At this\ntime, Rear Admiral Monzo Akiyama headed the force on Kiska. In December 1942,\nadditional anti-aircraft units, engineers, and a negligible number of\nreinforcement infantry arrived on the island. In the spring of 1943, control\nwas transferred to Lt. General Kiichiro Higuchi.^[citation needed]\n\n## Invasion plan and execution[edit]\n\nThe Allied invasion of Kiska, August 17, 1943\n\nAfter the heavy casualties suffered at Attu Island, Japanese planners were\nexpecting another costly operation. They realized the isolated Kiska Island\nwas no longer defensible and planned for an evacuation.^[citation needed]\nStarting in late July, there were increasing signs of Japanese withdrawal.\nAerial photograph analysts noticed that routine activities appeared to greatly\ndiminish, and almost no movement could be detected in the harbor. Bomb damage\nappeared unrepaired, and aircrews reported greatly diminished anti-aircraft\nfire. On July 28, 1943, radio signals from Kiska ceased entirely.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nOn August 15, 1943, the U.S. 7th Infantry Division, 87th Mountain Infantry\nRegiment of the 10th Mountain Division and the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade\nfrom the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, landed on opposite shores of Kiska.\nCanadian regiments landed included the Canadian Fusiliers; the Winnipeg\nGrenadiers; the Rocky Mountain Rangers; and the Saint John Fusiliers. The\ninvasion also involved the first combat deployment of the First Special\nService Force, an elite special forces unit consisting of American and\nCanadian commandos.^[3]\n\nBoth U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other, after a Canadian soldier\nshot at U.S. lines believing they were Japanese, and a friendly fire incident\noccurred, which left 28 Americans and 4 Canadians dead, with 50 wounded on\neither side. Progress was also hampered by mines, timed bombs, accidental\nammunition detonations, vehicle accidents and booby traps that caused further\ncasualties.^[2] A stray Japanese sea mine caused the USS Abner Read (DD-526)\nto lose a large chunk of its stern. The blast killed 71 and wounded 47\npersonnel.^[3]\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n  * The USS Pennsylvania bombards Attu during landing operations of 11 May 1943\n  * Aerial photo of a U.S. Army Air Forces bombardment on Kiska Island in 1942.\n  * Aerial reconnaissance photo of the Japanese-held Aleutian Island of Kiska, taken in 1943.\n  * Japanese transport ship burning off Kiska, Alaska after U.S. attack on 18 June 1942\n  * Troops march up the beach at Adak, during pre-invasion loading for the Kiska Operation, 13 August 1943\n  * Ventura planes patrol skies during the initial Allied landing on Kiska Island\n  * U.S Soldiers getting off their landing craft onto the rocky shores of Kiska Island\n  * Allied Landing on Kiska Island\n\n  \n---  \n  \n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Friendly fire incidents of World War II\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Kostka, Del C.
