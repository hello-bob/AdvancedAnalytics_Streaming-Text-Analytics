There are no problems today with finding good calendar\nsoftware for any smartphone out there. But when it comes to desktops (or\nlaptops), there are exactly two cases in which using calendars in 2024 isn\u2019t a\ncomplete disaster:\n\n  1. You\u2019re using your calendar provider\u2019s web application,\n  2. You\u2019re using a Mac.\n\nAny other situation leads you to find yourself drowning in the quicksand of\nabjectly outdated, unmaintaned, broken calendar software offerings: if you\u2019re\non Linux or Windows, and especially if you want to link together multiple\ndifferent calendars from different accounts (Google, Outlook, CalDav, etc.).\n\nThis is insane. Calendars are important. We use them every day. How in heck\ndid they end up being so broken on the desktop, which is where we get work\ndone, except in two specific case scenarios? No, I\u2019m sorry, Thunderbird\u2019s\ncalendar isn\u2019t a good calendar. It\u2019s dialog boxes from 1998 coming up with\nthat \u201cdonk!\u201d sound, not being dismissable immediately, and also coming up\ntwice for no reason, or telling you that you modified the event when you\ndidn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t what I\u2019m talking about when I talk about \u201cgood calendaring\nsoftware\u201d.\n\n### How did we end up here?\n\nEasy: it\u2019s an incredibly unfashionable topic and a thankless thing to work on.\nWho wants to write calendar software? Who\u2019s going to pay for calendar\nsoftware?! Add to that the fact that web apps really are enough for most\neveryone out there, since they usually only have one calendar to worry about\nand it\u2019s usually either their work calendar or their personal calendar, both\nprovided either by Google, Outlook or iCloud.\n\nVolunteering to fix calendaring software reminds me of how Tal Rasha\nvolunteered to chain himself to the Runes of Containment in Lut Gholein so\nthat he could bind Baal\u2019s Soulstone within himself forever. Who the heck wants\nthat as their fate? There are so many better, more well-paying, less onerous\nand more prestigious things to do with your time. It\u2019s almost as bad as\nwriting a mail client. I don\u2019t even have the courage to write a blog post\nabout the need for better mail clients.\n\nBut what if you have multiple calendars from multiple accounts that you need\nto look at at once, like most professionals in tech? What if you just want a\ngoddamn desktop app?, well, in that case, your only lucky break is to be part\nof...\n\n### The curious Mac exception\n\nFor some reason, macOS has a thriving ecosystem of incredibly competitive\ncalendar software for desktops. Aside from Apple\u2019s built-in Calendar app, you\nhave BusyCal and Fantastical, to name a couple. They command outrageous\npricing and sell lots of copies! BusyCal\u2019s $49.99, while Fantastical is only\navailable by subscription. BusyCal in particular is nuts. Every feature you\ncan think of, every calendaring protocol. It\u2019s world-class calendaring\nsoftware. A real calendaring Cadillac.\n\nBut we do not have multiplatform or open source equivalents. What about, you\nknow, most computers out there? How do we live in a world where most\nworkstations don\u2019t have functioning goddamn calendars outside of a web\nbrowser?!\n\n### Something has to be done\n\nMy take is that the only realistic, viable solution to break free from this\nnonsense quagmire where most workstations don\u2019t have good calendars might just\nbe for us to roll up our sleeves and dive into the creation of a new open\nsource calendar project. The most promising approach is almost certainly\nleveraging Tauri. Why Tauri?\n\n  * Tauri integrates Rust and TypeScript \u2014 Rust for performance and security, TypeScript for ease of development and maintenance. There\u2019s a bridge between both.\n  * Tauri excels in creating multiplatform applications with remarkably low overhead. This is crucial as one of the core frustrations with existing Electron apps is their bloated nature and sluggish performance.\n\nBy building on Tauri, we can target multiple platforms while maintaining a\nunified codebase, which simplifies updates and bug fixes.\n\nSo, here you are, at the tail end of my rant about the dismal state of desktop\ncalendar software. We can continue to grumble into our coffees each morning or\nwe can actually do something about this farce. Seriously, how much longer are\nwe willing to tolerate this nonsense? The blueprint is right there: a sleek,\nmultiplatform calendar app built on Tauri, waiting to be forged from the fires\nof our collective irritation and genius. If none of this inspires you to\naction, then maybe continue your Sisyphean struggle with whatever archaic\ntools you\u2019re suffering through.\n\nOr, if the spirit of benevolence (or frustration) moves you enough, send a\ngrant my way \u2014 I\u2019ll take on the herculean task of writing this mythical\nsoftware myself. I\u2019ll be your Tal Rasha!\n\n## You are invited to leave a comment on my post.\n\nContact information: Email \u2022 LinkedIn \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Facebook \u2022 Instagram\n\n\u00a9 2024 Nadim Kobeissi.
