The Happiness of Pursuit\n\nFor years, some of the world\u2019s sharpest minds have been quietly turning your\nlife into a series of games. Not merely to amuse you, but because they\nrealized that the easiest way to make you do what they want is to make it fun.\nTo escape their control, you must understand the creeping phenomenon of\ngamification, and how it makes you act against your own interests.\n\nThis is a story that encompasses a couple who replaced their real baby with a\nfake one, a statistician whose obsessions cost the US the Vietnam War, the\napparent absence of extraterrestrial life, and the biggest FBI investigation\nof the 20th century. But it begins with a mild-mannered psychologist who\nstudied pigeons at Harvard in the Thirties.\n\nB. F. Skinner believed environment determines behavior, and a person could\ntherefore be controlled simply by controlling their environment. He began\ntesting this theory, known as behaviorism, on pigeons. For his experiments, he\ndeveloped the \u201cSkinner box\u201d, a birdcage with a food dispenser controlled by a\nbutton.\n\nSkinner\u2019s goal was to make the pigeons peck the button as many times as\npossible. From his experiments, he made three discoveries. First, the pigeons\npecked most when doing so yielded immediate, rather than delayed, rewards.\nSecond, the pigeons pecked most when it rewarded them randomly, rather than\nevery time. Skinner\u2019s third discovery occurred when he noticed the pigeons\ncontinued to peck the button long after the food dispenser was empty, provided\nthey could hear it click. He realized the pigeons had become conditioned to\nassociate the click with the food, and now valued the click as a reward in\nitself.\n\nThis led him to propose two kinds of reward: primary and conditioned\nreinforcers. A primary reinforcer is something we\u2019re born to desire. A\nconditioned reinforcer is something we learn to desire, due to its association\nwith a primary reinforcer. Skinner found that conditioned reinforcers were\ngenerally more effective in shaping behavior, because while our biological\nneed for the primary reinforcer is easily satiable, our abstract desire for\nthe conditioned reinforcer isn\u2019t. The pigeons would stop seeking food once\ntheir bellies were full, but they\u2019d take far longer to get tired of hearing\nthe food dispenser click.\n\nSkinner\u2019s three key insights \u2014 immediate rewards work better than delayed,\nunpredictable rewards work better than fixed, and conditioned rewards work\nbetter than primary \u2014 were found to also apply to humans, and in the 20^th\nCentury would be used by businesses to shape consumer behavior. From Frequent\nFlyer loyalty points to mystery toys in McDonalds Happy Meals, purchases were\nturned into games, spurring consumers to purchase more.\n\nSome people began to consider whether games could be used to make people do\nother things. In the Seventies, the American management consultant Charles\nCoonradt wondered why people work harder at games they pay to play than at\nwork they\u2019re paid to do. Like Skinner, Coonradt saw that a defining feature of\ncompelling games was immediate rewards. Most of the feedback loops in\nemployment \u2014 from salary payments to annual performance appraisals \u2014 were\ntorturously long. So Coonradt proposed shortening them by introducing daily\ntargets, points systems, and leaderboards. These conditioned reinforcers would\ntransform work from a series of monthly slogs into daily status games, in\nwhich employees competed to fulfil the company\u2019s goals.\n\nIn the 21st century, advances in technology made it easy to add game mechanics\nto almost any activity, and a new term \u2014 \u201cgamification\u201d \u2014 became a buzzword in\nSilicon Valley. By 2008, business consultants were giving presentations about\nleveraging fun to shape behavior, while futurists gave TED Talks speculating\non the social implications of a gamified world. Underpinning every speech was\na single, momentous question: if gamification could make people buy more stuff\nand work more hours, what else could it be used to make people do?\n\nThe tone was generally utopian, because back then gamification seemed to be\nmostly a force for good. In 2007, for instance, the online word quiz FreeRice\ngamified famine relief: for every correct answer, 10 grains of rice were given\nto the UN World Food Programme. Within six months it had already given away\nover 20 billion grains of rice. Meanwhile, the SaaS company, Opower, had\ngamified going green. It turned eco-friendliness into a contest, showing each\nperson how much energy they were using compared with their neighbors, and\ndisplaying a leaderboard of the top 10 least wasteful. The app has since saved\nover $3 billion worth of energy. And then there was Foldit, a game developed\nby University of Washington biochemists who\u2019d struggled for 15 years to\ndiscern the structure of an Aids virus protein. They reasoned that, if they\nturned the search into a game, someone might do what they couldn\u2019t. It took\ngamers just 10 days.\n\nEven established corporations saw gamification\u2019s potential. In 2008,\nVolkswagen debuted a campaign called \u201cThe Fun Theory\u201d, based on the idea that\n\u201cfun is the easiest way to change people\u2019s behavior for the better\u201d. Piano\nstairs were installed at a Stockholm rail station to encourage people to use\nthem instead of the escalator, leading to a 66% increase in stair use.\nVolkswagen also tried to gamify gamification itself, creating a contest for\ngood game ideas. The winning idea was a \u201cspeedcam lottery\u201d, where people who\nkept to the speed limit would be entered into a prize draw, funded by speeding\nfines.\n\nIt all seemed so simple: if we could only create the right games, we could\nmake humanity fitter, greener, kinder, smarter. We could repopulate forests\nand even cure cancers simply by making it fun.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, gamification took a less wholesome\nroute.\n\nWe humans are harder to manipulate than pigeons, but we can be manipulated in\nmany more ways, because we have a wider spectrum of needs. Pigeons don\u2019t care\nmuch about respect, but for us it\u2019s a primary reinforcer, to such an extent\nthat we can be made to desire arbitrary sounds that become associated with it,\nlike praise and applause.\n\nRespect is so important to humans that it\u2019s a key reason we evolved to play\ngames. Will Storr, in his book The Status Game, charted the rise of game-\nplaying in different cultures, and found that games have historically\nfunctioned to organize societies into hierarchies of competence, with score\nacting as a conditioned reinforcer of status. In other words, all games\ndescend from status games. The association between score and status has grown\nso strong in our minds that, like pigeons pecking the button long after the\nfood dispenser has stopped dispensing, we\u2019ll chase scores long after everyone\nelse has stopped watching.\n\nAnd so, when Facebook added \u201clikes\u201d in 2009, they quickly became a proxy for\nstatus, and a score to compete for. People now had a social stake in posting\ncontent. Hitting \u201csend\u201d became like activating a slot machine, initiating an\nexcitingly uncertain outcome; the post might go completely unnoticed, or it\nmight hit the jackpot and go viral, awarding the coveted prizes of respect and\nfame.\n\nOther social media platforms followed, leveraging Skinner\u2019s three laws to\nmaximize button-pecking. They offered immediate reinforcement in the form of\ninstant responses, conditioned reinforcement in the form of \u201clikes\u201d and\n\u201cfollowers\u201d, and unpredictable reinforcement that varied with each post and\neach refresh of the page. These features turned social media into the world\u2019s\nmost addictive status game. And thus, just as pigeons were made to chase\nclicks, so eventually were we.\n\nBut this was just the beginning. Many in the managerial class saw the success\nof social media and wondered how they could use gamification for their own\nends. The Chinese Communist Party was among the first to apply the principles\nof social media to the real world. In several towns and cities, it began\ntrialing social credit schemes that assign citizens a level of \u201cclout\u201d based\non how well they behave. In some areas, such as Rongcheng and Hangzhou, there\nare public signs that display leaderboards of the highest scoring citizens.\nThe lowest scoring citizens may be punished with credit blacklists or\nthrottled internet speeds.\n\nMeanwhile, in the West, gamification is used to make people obey corporations.\nEmployers like Amazon and Disneyland use electronic tracking to keep score of\nemployees\u2019 work rates, often displaying them for all to see. Those who place\nhigh on the leaderboards can win prizes like virtual pets; those who fall\nbelow the minimum rate may be financially penalized.\n\nGame features are even more pervasive in the digital world. In little over a\nyear, the Chinese shopping app Temu has exploded in popularity thanks to its\n\u201cplay to pay\u201d model: as users browse deals they\u2019re presented with puzzles to\nsolve, roulette wheels to spin, and challenges to complete, which reward them\nwith credit and special offers. Unsurprisingly, users are now spending double\nthe amount of time on Temu than on Amazon.\n\nGamification has also transformed dating apps. Zoosk works like a typical\nrole-playing game, where you gradually accumulate \u201cexperience points\u201d, which\nunlock new abilities, such as animated virtual gifts to send to prospective\ndates. Meanwhile, on Tinder you can purchase various \u201clevel-ups\u201d \u2014 Boosts,\nSuper Likes, and Rewinds \u2014 that increase your chances of winning and compel\nyou to keep playing to get your money\u2019s worth. And if you have no luck on\ndating apps, there are always AI girlfriends to play with: apps like iGirl and\nReplika award users points for their commitment, which can be used to \u201clevel\nup\u201d their virtual lovers into a version that is more intimate.\n\nThese are only a few examples. Virtually every kind of app, from audiobook\napps to taxicab apps to stock trading apps, now employs game mechanics like\npoints, badges, levels, streaks, progress bars, and leaderboards. Their\nubiquity attests to their success in hooking people.\n\nGamification once promised to create a better society, but it\u2019s now used\nmainly to addict people to apps. The gamifiers, like Skinner\u2019s pigeons,\nprioritized immediate rewards over delayed ones, so they gamified for the next\nfinancial quarter and not for the future of civilization.\n\nSo where does this all lead? What is the endgame?\n\n###\n\nII. A Maze Called Utopia\n\nAt the University of Michigan in the mid-twentieth century, there was a\nzoologist named James V. McConnell. A strong believer in fun, he often\npresented his academic research alongside satire and poetry, so it was\ndifficult to tell which was which, a habit that made him popular with students\nbut unpopular with his fellow professors.\n\nOne of the few things McConnell took seriously was behaviorism. He was\ntransfixed by Skinner\u2019s work on pigeons, and wished to expand the work to\nhumans, with an eye to creating a perfect society. In a 1970 Psychology Today\narticle he wrote:\n\n> We should reshape our society so that we all would be trained from birth to\n> want to do what society wants us to do. We have the techniques now to do it.\n> Only by using them can we hope to maximize human potentiality.\n\nIn short, he wanted to turn society into a Skinner box.\n\nThroughout the Seventies, McConnell used Skinnerian techniques to create\nrehabilitation programs for prisoners and psychiatric patients, some of which\nwere successful. But his most ambitious scheme emerged in the early Eighties,\nwhen he witnessed people being captivated by video games like Donkey Kong and\nPac Man, and realized their addictive mechanics could be translated to other,\nmore productive activities. He pitched an ambitious project to gamify\neducation to tech companies like Microsoft and IBM, but he was 30 years too\nearly, and they couldn\u2019t yet see its promise. There was, however, one person\nwho\u2019d taken a keen interest in McConnell\u2019s work. His name was Ted Kaczynski.\n\nKaczynski was an awkward but gifted student, coldly matter-of-fact in manner,\nfor which he was described by his schoolmates as a \u201cwalking brain\u201d. In a\nschool IQ test he\u2019d scored 167 (140 is considered \u201cgenius\u201d).\n\nHe\u2019d come to Michigan in 1962 as a postgraduate from Harvard, where he\u2019d\nstudied mathematics and graduated at just 18. But at Harvard, he\u2019d also been\nsubjected to torturous experiments. In a lab not far from where Skinner had\nonce experimented with pigeons, psychologists linked to US intelligence were\nnow experimenting with humans \u2014 one of whom was Kaczynski. Under the glare of\nblinding lights, he was methodically humiliated to see how he reacted. He\nclaimed the experience didn\u2019t affect him, and yet, within just a few years,\nhe\u2019d developed an intense paranoia about psychological conditioning. And so,\nwhen Kaczynski learned of McConnell\u2019s proposals to create a utopia through\nbehavior modification, he concluded that the jocular professor was an\nexistential threat to humanity, and that he needed to die.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision Kaczynski had made lightly; he\u2019d developed an entire\nphilosophy to justify it. Influenced by techno-dystopian writers like Aldous\nHuxley and Jacques Ellul, Kaczynski believed the Industrial Revolution had\nturned society into a cold process of production and consumption that was\ngradually crushing everything humans valued most: freedom, happiness, purpose,\nmeaning, and the ecosystem. In his view, everything society now\nproduced\u2014including science and technology\u2014served industry, not humanity, and\nthus was increasingly being purposed not to enrich our lives but to\npsychologically condition us so we wouldn\u2019t resist what was being done to us\nand to the earth.\n\nIn short, where society had once been shaped to accommodate people, now people\nwere being shaped to accommodate society. And this misshaping was destructive\nbecause it conflicted with our deepest nature.\n\nKaczynski believed modern society made us docile and miserable by depriving us\nof fulfilling challenges and eroding our sense of purpose. The brain evolved\nto solve problems, but the problems it had evolved for were now largely solved\nby technology. Most of us can now obtain all our basic necessities simply by\nbeing obedient, like a pigeon pecking a button. Kaczynski argued that such\nconveniences didn\u2019t make us happy, only aimless. And to stave of this\naimlessness, we had to continually set ourselves goals purely to have goals to\npursue, which Kaczynski called \u201csurrogate activities\u201d. These included sports,\nhobbies, or chasing the latest product that ads promised would make us happy.\n\nFor Kaczynski, the result of reorienting our lives to chase artificial goals\nwas that we became increasingly dependent on society to provide us with them.\nAnd without our own inherent sense of purpose, we\u2019d inevitably be made to\nchase goals that were good for the industrial machine but bad for us.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s theories eerily prophesize the capture of society by gamification.\nWhile he overlooked the benefits of technology, he diligently noted its\ndangers, recognizing its role in depriving us of purpose and meaning. Today\nthe evidence is everywhere: religion is dying out, Western nations are\nculturally confused, people are getting married less and having fewer\nchildren, and many are losing their jobs to automation, so the traditional\npillars of life \u2014 God, nation, family, and work \u2014 are crumbling, and people\nare losing their value systems. Amid such uncertainty, games, with their well-\ndefined rules and goals, provide a semblance of order and purpose that may\notherwise be lacking in people\u2019s lives. Gamification is thus no accident, but\nan attempt to plug a widening hole in society.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems to be only a band-aid. Kaczynski observed that\nsurrogate activities rarely kept people contented for long. There were always\nmore stamps to collect, a better car to buy, a higher score to achieve. He\nbelieved artificial goals were too divorced from our actual needs to truly\nsatisfy us, so they merely served to keep us busy enough not to notice our\ndissatisfaction. Instead of a fulfilled life, a life filled full.\n\nToday, people increasingly live inside their phones, bossed around by\nnotifications, diligently collecting badges and filling progress bars, even\nthough it doesn\u2019t make them happy. On the contrary, substantial research\ncomprising over a hundred studies finds that prioritizing extrinsic goals over\nintrinsic goals \u2014 in other words doing things to win prizes and achieve high\nscores rather than for the inherent love of doing them \u2014 leads to lower well-\nbeing.\n\nKaczynski seemed to recognize this long before smartphones emerged. He felt\nthat building a life around chasing what was offered on billboards and in\nmagazines wouldn\u2019t make him happy, and would only feed the Machine, so in 1971\nhe fled society, holing himself up in a log cabin in the Montana wilderness.\nThere he attempted a simple and self-sufficient life, enjoying the small\nthings like the sound of birds singing and the feeling of sunrays on his back.\n\nBut this idyll wouldn\u2019t last. He claims that while hiking across one of his\nfavorite spots \u2014 a rocky ridge with a waterfall \u2014 he was aghast to find a road\nhad been built through it. As he saw it, industrialization, like some fungus\ncreeping across the world, had followed him even here. Enraged, he decided\nmodernity couldn\u2019t be escaped, and had to be destroyed.\n\nHis emotional instability got the better of him, and in 1978 he began posting\nhomemade bombs to those he accused of betraying humanity. In 1985, a package\narrived at McConnell\u2019s home. It was opened by his assistant, Nicklaus Suino.\nThe package only partially exploded, injuring Suino and McConnell, and leaving\nthem both shaken for life.\n\nThey were lucky. Less than a month later, Kaczynski would send another, more\ncarefully prepared bomb to computer store owner, Hugh Scrutton, who\u2019d become\nKaczynski\u2019s first murder victim.\n\nBy then, the FBI\u2019s investigation into the bombings had grown into the largest\nin its history. For over a decade they scoured the country as Kaczynski\ncontinued to kill and injure, but much of their time was wasted chasing\nmirages, for Kaczynski would often scatter his bomb parcels with red herrings\nsuch as notes referencing fictitious conspiracies and signed with made-up\ninitials.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s actions, though unforgivable, can teach us as much about\ngamification as his philosophy. His red herrings lured people away from what\nthey actually sought, and, as we shall see, this is the greatest danger of\ngamification.\n\n###\n\nIII. When Red Herrings Become White Whales\n\nWhile Kaczynski wanted to demolish industrial society and return humanity to\nan agrarian life, US defense secretary Robert McNamara wanted the opposite: to\nuse American industrial might to crush the agrarian society of Vietnam.\n\nMcNamara was a statistician who believed what couldn\u2019t be measured didn\u2019t\nmatter. He charted progress in the Vietnam war by body count, because it was\nsimple to measure. It was his way of keeping score. But his focus on what\ncould be easily measured led him to overlook what couldn\u2019t: negative public\nopinion of the US Army both at home and in Vietnam, which deflated US morale\nwhile boosting enemy conscription. In the end, the US was forced to withdraw\nfrom the war, despite winning the battle of bodies, because it had lost the\nbattle of hearts and minds.\n\nThus, the McNamara fallacy, as it came to be known, refers to our tendency to\nfocus on the most quantifiable measures, even if doing so leads us from our\nactual goals. Put simply, we try to measure what we value, but end up valuing\nwhat we measure.\n\nAnd what we measure is rarely what we mean to value. As Skinner showed, the\ngoals of games \u2014 points, badges, trophies \u2014 are secondary reinforcers that\nonly derive their worth due to their association with something we actually\ndesire. But these associations are often illusory. A click is not the same\nthing as a food pellet. And points are not the same as progress.\n\nWe\u2019re easily motivated by points and scores because they\u2019re easy to track and\nenjoyable to accrue. As such, scorekeeping is, for many, becoming the new\nfoundation of their lives. \u201cLooksmaxxing\u201d is a new trend of gamified beauty,\nwhere people assign scores to physical appearance and then use any means\nnecessary to maximize their score. And in the online wellness space, there is\nnow a \u201cRejuvenation Olympics\u201d complete with a leaderboard that ranks people by\ntheir \u201cage reversal\u201d. Even sleep has become a game; many people now use apps\nlike Pokemon Sleep that reward them for achieving high \u201csleep scores\u201d, and\nsome even compete to get the highest \u201csleep ranking\u201d.\n\nMost such scores are simplifications that don\u2019t tell the whole story. For\ninstance, sleep trackers only measure what\u2019s easy to measure, like movement,\nwhich says nothing about crucial facts like time spent in REM sleep. A more\naccurate measure of how well you slept would be how refreshed you feel in the\nmorning, but since this can\u2019t be quantified, it tends to be ignored.\n\nFurther, if increasing one\u2019s youthfulness score requires a daily 2-hour\nskincare routine, a diet of 50 pills each morning and night, abstention from\nmany of life\u2019s pleasures, and constant fixation on one\u2019s vital metrics, is it\nreally worth it? Of what value is adding a few years to your life if the cost\nis a life worth living? The scores we use to chart progress can\u2019t articulate\nthe nuances of reality, and yet we often tie our life goals and even self-\nworth to such arbitrary numbers.\n\nIn the end, even Kaczynski, with his IQ of 167, was led astray by red herring\ngoals. In 1995 he enacted his endgame, demanding the New York Times and\nWashington Post print his anti-technology manifesto to prevent further\nbloodshed. All along, his goal had been to get the widest possible newspaper\ncoverage, to maximize how many people would see his manifesto, but like\nMcNamara he didn\u2019t account for what couldn\u2019t be quantified, such as how people\nwould see his manifesto. Skinner\u2019s pigeons had learned to desire the click of\nthe food dispenser because it had been accompanied by food, and Kaczynski\u2019s\nintended audience learned to hate his arguments because they\u2019d been\naccompanied by violence. By maximizing audience size at the expense of\neverything else, Kaczynski gained a massive audience unwilling to give him a\nfair hearing.\n\nFurther, his manifesto contained a peculiar choice of words (\u201ceat your cake\nand have it\u201d), which was recognized by his brother, David, who alerted the\npolice, leading to Kaczynski\u2019s capture. And so, by fixating on the most\nobvious metric \u2014 the size of his audience \u2014 Kaczynski lost the one thing he\u2019d\nbeen fighting for all along: freedom.\n\nKaczynski played the wrong game, and was trapped by it. Today, we all face\nsimilar traps. We chase numbers and icons because they\u2019re always available,\nand the chase is often so immersive that it keeps us from seeing where it\nleads, which is often far away from what we actually want. This can lead to\nwhat the evolutionary psychologist Diana Fleischman calls \u201ccounterfeit\nfitness\u201d: the constant, momentary \u201cwins\u201d that come with playing digital games\ngive us a false sense of progression and accomplishment, a neurochemical high\nthat feels like victory but is not, and which, if it becomes a habit, risks\nplacating our ambitions to pursue true fulfilment.\n\nIt explains why so many young men have lost themselves in video games, and are\nno longer in employment or relationships. The false signals they\u2019re getting\nfrom video game progress, combined with the sexual reward of online porn, are\nconvincing their dopamine pathways that they\u2019re winning in life, even as their\nminds and futures atrophy.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to persuade people into tying their sense of progress to fake or\ntrivial goals. Casinos keep their customers happily losing money by\ndistracting them with minor side games they\u2019re likely to win. The small\nvictories convince them they\u2019re winning overall even as they lose the only\ngames that actually matter.\n\nThis strange quirk of human behavior can even cost lives. In South Korea, a\nyoung couple became so addicted to raising a virtual baby that they let their\nreal baby starve to death. The parents prioritized what they could quantify \u2014\nlevelling up their virtual baby \u2014 over that which they couldn\u2019t \u2014 the life of\ntheir real one.\n\nWhat makes pathological gameplaying so dangerous is that the more harm it\ndoes, the more alluring it becomes. If your baby is dead, why not raise a\nvirtual one? If your life of playing video games has stopped you finding a\ngirlfriend, why not play the AI girlfriend game? Thus, bad games form a\nfeedback loop: they distract us from pursuing the things that will bring us\nlasting contentment, and without this lasting contentment, we become ever more\ndependent on false, transient metrics like scores and leaderboards to imbue\nour lives with meaning.\n\nAll the things a gamified world promises in the short term \u2014 pride, purpose,\nmeaning, control, motivation, and happiness \u2014 it threatens in the long term.\nIt has the power to seclude people from reality, and to rewrite their value\nsystems so they prioritize the imaginary over the real, and the next moment\nover the rest of their lives.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\n###\n\nIV. Playing for Keeps\n\nThere are billions of habitable planets in our galaxy, and many of them are\nfar older than our own. Statistically, this would suggest that by now our\ngalaxy would be teeming with signs of advanced alien life. And yet space is\nsilent. This discrepancy, known as the Fermi paradox, has puzzled scientists\nfor almost a century. Ted Kaczynski believed his prophecies offered an answer.\n\nWhile serving a life sentence in jail, Kaczynski wrote a little-known sequel\nto his manifesto, entitled \u201cAnti-Tech Revolution: Why and How\u201d. In it he\noutlines his belief that all technologically advanced civilizations become\ntrapped in fatal games before they learn to colonize space. This happens\nbecause industry is driven by competition, and competition favors short-term\nwins over long-term sustainability, because players who care about long-term\nsustainability are significantly disadvantaged compared to players who only\ncare about winning.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Kaczynski describes a thought experiment involving a\nforested region occupied by several rival kingdoms. The kingdoms that clear\nthe most land for agriculture can support a larger population, affording them\na military advantage. Every kingdom must therefore clear as much forest as\npossible, or face being conquered by its rivals. The resulting deforestation\neventually leads to ecological disaster and the collapse of all the kingdoms.\nThus, a trait that is advantageous for every kingdom\u2019s short-term survival\nleads in the long term to every kingdom\u2019s demise.\n\nKaczynski was describing a \u201csocial trap\u201d, a term coined by a student of\nSkinner, John Platt, who\u2019d theorized that an entire population behaving like\npigeons in a Skinner box, each acting only for the next immediate reward,\nwould eventually overexploit a resource, causing ruin for everyone. What Platt\ncalled \u201csocial traps\u201d, Kaczynski called \u201cself-propagating systems\u201d, because he\nviewed them as negative-sum games that took on a life of their own, defeating\nevery player to become the only winner. He believed such games not only drove\nindustrialization but also replaced the sense of purpose and meaning that\nindustrialization destroyed. They were thus inextricable from technological\nadvancement, and, in a society like ours, impossible to stop.\n\nIn jail, Kaczynski was forbidden access to the web, and in letters he\nstruggled to understand what Facebook was. Nevertheless, his warnings could\neasily have been referring to social media.\n\nOn Instagram, the main self-propagating system is a beauty pageant. Young\nwomen compete to be as pretty as possible, going to increasingly extreme\nlengths: makeup, filters, fillers, surgery. The result is that all women begin\nto feel ugly, online and off.\n\nOn TikTok and YouTube, there is another self-propagating system where\npranksters compete to outdo each other in outrageousness to avoid being buried\nby the algorithm. Such extreme brinkmanship frequently leads to arrest or\ninjury, and has even led to the deaths of, among others, Timothy Wilks and\nPedro Ruiz.\n\nOn X, meanwhile, there is a self-propagating system known as \u201cthe culture\nwar\u201d. This game consists of trying to score points (likes and retweets) by\nattacking the enemy political tribe. Unlike in a regular war, the combatants\ncan\u2019t kill each other, only make each other angrier, so little is ever\nachieved, except that all players become stressed by constant bickering. And\nyet they persist in bickering, if only because their opponents do, in an\nendless state of mutually assured distraction.\n\nThose are just three examples of social traps that have emerged in our\ngamified age. But the most worrying social trap is gamification itself.\n\nCompanies that exploit our gameplaying compulsion will have an edge over those\nwho don\u2019t, so every company that wishes to compete must gamify in ever more\naddictive ways, even though in the long term this harms everyone. As such,\ngamification is not just a fad; it\u2019s the fate of a digital capitalist society.\nAnything that can be turned into a game sooner or later will be. And the games\nwon\u2019t just be confined to our phones \u2014 \u201cextended reality\u201d eyewear like Meta\nQuest and Apple Vision, once they become normalized, will make playing even\nharder to avoid.\n\nGames will be created not just to extract money from people, but also data.\nThe 2025 Enhanced Games, for instance, is a new futuristic version of the\nOlympics, funded by tech moguls like Peter Thiel, where contestants can\nexploit anything from cybernetic implants to PEDs to get a competitive\nadvantage. The purpose of the games seems to be transhumanist: to motivate\npeople to discover new ways to augment human abilities, with the eventual goal\nof turning men into gods.\n\nThere is, after all, a vacancy in heaven. When God is dead, and nations are\natomized, and family seems burdensome, and machines can beat us at our jobs\nand even at art, and trust and truth are lost in a roiling sea of AI-generated\nclickbait \u2014 what is left but games?\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Games can motivate us to destroy\nourselves, but they can also motivate us to better ourselves. In a gamified\nworld, it\u2019s possible to play without getting played, if one only chooses the\nright games. As the poker-player-turned-podcaster Liv Boeree said:\n\u201cIntelligence is knowing how to win the game. Wisdom is knowing which game to\nplay...\u201d So how do you decide which games to play? The story of gamification\noffers five broad rules.\n\nFirst: choose long-term goals over short-term ones. Short, frequent feedback\nloops offer regular reinforcement, which helps motivate us. But what is made\nto motivate us too often addicts us. So consider the long-term outcomes of the\ngames you\u2019re playing: if you did the same thing you did today for the next 10\nyears, where would you be? Play games the 90-year-old you would be proud of\nhaving played. They won\u2019t care how many trophies you have; they will care how\nmany times you saw your parents before they died.\n\nSecond: choose hard games over easy ones. Since the long-term value of games\nlies in their ability to hone skills and build character, easy games are\nusually a trap. People with unearned wealth \u2014 thieves, heirs and lottery\nwinners \u2014 often end up losing it all, because the struggle to obtain a reward\nteaches us the reward\u2019s worth, and is thus a crucial part of the reward.\n\nThird: choose positive-sum games over zero-sum or negative-sum ones. Games\nevolved to confer status, and status is zero-sum \u2014 for some to have it, others\nmust lose it. But we no longer have to play such games; we can change the\nrules so a win for me doesn\u2019t mean a loss for you. Educational games are one\nexample. Wealth creation is another. Positive-sum games \u2014 where every player\nbenefits by playing \u2014 are a form of competition that brings people together\ninstead of driving them apart.\n\nFourth: choose atelic games over telic ones. Atelic games are those you play\nbecause you enjoy them. Telic games are those you play only to obtain a\nreward. Chasing rewards like trophies and leaderboard rankings can help drive\nus to succeed, but a fixation on such rewards can become a source of stress,\nand can even make leisure activities feel like drudgery, turning games into\nwork.\n\nFinally, the fifth rule is to choose immeasurable rewards over measurable\nones. Seeing numerical scores increase is satisfying in the short term, but\nthe most valuable things in life \u2014 freedom, meaning, love \u2014 can\u2019t be\nquantified.\n\nThere are an overwhelming number of games to choose from. If you want to keep\nfit, try Zombies Run, an app that takes the form of a post-zombie-apocalypse\nradio broadcast telling you which direction to run to avoid being eaten. If\nyou want to learn general knowledge while helping those in poverty, play the\nFreeRice quiz. And if you want to form good habits, there\u2019s Habitshare, which\nlets your friends track your attempts, motivating you more than if you were\nonly accountable to yourself.\n\nBut if, among the countless games out there, you can\u2019t find one right for you,\nthen you can just create your own. Fun is not the pursuit of happiness, but\nthe happiness of pursuit, and literally anything can be pursued. By now\nthere\u2019s a way to keep any kind of score and play any kind of game.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s game is over; he committed suicide last summer, still adamant\nhumanity was doomed. His fearful legacy has since passed to his disciples,\nlike Liverpool man Jacob Graham, who was recently jailed for terrorism after\ntrying to emulate his idol. Graham may have thought he was saving the world,\nbut, with all his talk of maximizing kill counts, he too was just playing a\nbad game.\n\nIn the end, Kaczynski and his followers made the same mistake as Skinner: they\nviewed us as mere puppets of our environment, devoid of agency and the ability\nto adapt. They needn\u2019t have feared the world becoming a Skinner box, because,\namong all the papers written about that troublesome contraption, one fact is\nalways omitted: Skinner\u2019s pigeons only kept pecking the button because they\nwere in a cage, with nothing else to do. But you are still free. Even in a\nworld where everything is a game, you don\u2019t have to play by other people\u2019s\nrules; you have a wide open world to create your own.\n\nYour move.\n\n265 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n63 Restacks\n\n265\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Everything is Becoming a Game\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n61\n\nShare\n\n61 Comments\n\nrickster9 hrs agoLiked by GurwinderFeels almost grubby to click the like\nbutton after that but what an excellent read, thank youExpand full commentLike\n(26)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nIrina Dumitrescuthe process10 hrs agoLiked by GurwinderThis was superb. Thank\nyou.The one thing I'll add is that even gamified learning is of doubtful use.\nDuolingo is a case in point. I've known multiple people who worked their way\nup the leaderboards without improving their ability in the language much at\nall. Don't get me wrong, I like playing with it too, and I think it can be\nused smartly as a support for proper learning. But taking a class, memorizing\nvocab and paradigms, doing grammar exercises... These are still better uses of\none's time.Expand full commentLike (13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n7 replies by Gurwinder and others\n\n59 more comments...\n\nThe Perils of Audience Capture\n\nHow influencers become brainwashed by their audiences\n\nJun 30, 2022 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n941\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Perils of Audience Capture\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n125\n\nTikTok is a Time Bomb\n\nThe ultimate weapon of mass distraction\n\nJan 21, 2023 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n1,093\n\nShare this post\n\n#### TikTok is a Time Bomb\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n76\n\nWhy Smart People Believe Stupid Things\n\nIntelligence is not rationality\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n1,017\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n243\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Gurwinder\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
