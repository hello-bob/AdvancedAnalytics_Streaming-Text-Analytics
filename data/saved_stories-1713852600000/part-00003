In America, the best of them worked for the movies; in Soviet Russia they\nworked for a different kind of propaganda machine known as the State, not just\nproducing official photos but going back to previous official photos and\nchanging them to reflect the regime\u2019s ever-shifting set of preferred\nalternative facts.\n\n\u201cLike their counterparts in Hollywood, photographic retouchers in Soviet\nRussia spent long hours smoothing out the blemishes of imperfect complexions,\nhelping the camera to falsify reality,\u201d writes David King in the introduction\nto his book The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art\nin Stalin\u2019s Russia. \u201cStalin\u2019s pockmarked face, in particular, demanded\nexceptional skills with the airbrush. But it was during the Great Purges,\nwhich raged in the late 1930s, that a new form of falsification emerged. The\nphysical eradication of Stalin\u2019s political opponents at the hands of the\nsecret police was swiftly followed by their obliteration from all forms of\npictorial existence.\u201d\n\nUsing tools that now seem impossibly primitive, Soviet proto-Photoshoppers\nmade \u201conce-famous personalities vanish\u201d and crafted photographs representing\nStalin \u201cas the only true friend, comrade, and successor to Lenin, the leader\nof the Bolshevik Revolution and founder of the USSR.\u201d\n\nThis quasi-artisanal work, \u201cone of the more enjoyable tasks for the art\ndepartment of publishing houses during those times,\u201d demanded serious\ndexterity with the scalpel, glue, paint, and airbrush. (Some examples, as you\ncan see in this five-page gallery of images from The Commissar Vanishes,\nevidenced more dexterity than others.) In this manner, Stalin could order\nwritten out of history such comrades he ultimately deemed disloyal (and who\nusually wound up executed as) as Naval Commissar Nikolai Yezhov, infamously\nmade to disappear from Stalin\u2019s side on a photo taken alongside the Moscow\nCanal, or People\u2019s Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs Nikolai Antipov,\ncommander of the Leningrad party Sergei Kirov, and Chairman of the Presidium\nof the Supreme Soviet Nikolai Shvernik \u2014 pictured, and removed one by one,\njust above.\n\nThis practice even extended to the materials of the Soviet space program,\nwrites Wired\u2019s James Oberg. Cosmonauts temporarily erased from history include\nValentin Bondarenko, who died in a fire during a training exercise, and the\nespecially promising Grigoriy Nelyubov (pictured, and then not pictured, at\nthe top of the post), who \u201chad been expelled from the program for misbehavior\nand later killed himself.\u201d Yuri Gagarin, the cosmonaut who made history as the\nfirst human in outer space, did not, of course, get erased by the proud\nauthorities, but even his photos, like the one just above where he shakes\nhands with the Soviet space program\u2019s top-secret leader Sergey Korolyov, went\nunder the knife for cosmetic reasons, here the removal of the evidently\ndistracting workman in the background \u2014 hardly a major historical figure, let\nalone a controversial one, but still a real and maybe even living reminder\nthat while the camera may lie, it can\u2019t hold its tongue forever.\n\nh/t @JackFeerick\n\nRelated Content:\n\nJoseph Stalin, a Lifelong Editor, Wielded a Big, Blue, Dangerous Pencil\n\nLeon Trotsky: Love, Death and Exile in Mexico\n\nWatch the Surrealist Glass Harmonica, the Only Animated Film Ever Banned by\nSoviet Censors (1968)\n\nSoviet Union Creates a List of 38 Dangerous Rock Bands: Kiss, Pink Floyd,\nTalking Heads, Village People & More (1985)\n\nRussian History & Literature Come to Life in Wonderfully Colorized Portraits:\nSee Photos of Tolstoy, Chekhov, the Romanovs & More\n\nBased in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities and culture.\nHe\u2019s at work on the book The Stateless City: a Walk through 21st-Century Los\nAngeles, the video series The City in Cinema, the crowdfunded journalism\nproject Where Is the City of the Future?, and the Los Angeles Review of Books\u2019\nKorea Blog.
