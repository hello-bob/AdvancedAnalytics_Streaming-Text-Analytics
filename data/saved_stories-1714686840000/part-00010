Our finding reconciles the longstanding mismatch between the\n> electromagnetic mass calculated from the classical electrodynamics' 4/3\n> (E/c^2) and the relativistic theory.\n\nComments:| 5 pages, 1 figure, and 14 references  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| General Physics (physics.gen-ph)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.00071 [physics.gen-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2405.00071v1 [physics.gen-ph] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Ebrahim Karimi [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 23:17:21 UTC (408 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled On the Electromagnetic Mass Dilemma, by Qasem\nExirifard and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nphysics.gen-ph\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2405\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nphysics\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
