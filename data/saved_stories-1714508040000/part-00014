And now we have a swarm of\nrobo-bees.\n\nFesto BionicBee\n\nEven though the BionicBee is Festo's smallest flying robot, you still wouldn't\nwant one or more buzzing around you at a picnic as each measures 220 mm (8.6\nin) in length, has a wingspan of 240 mm (9.5 in) and weighs in at 34 g (1.2\noz) \u2013 though the insectoid flyer does at least lack a sting in its tail.\n\nUnless that picnic is indoors at Festo's labs, you'll be pretty safe as these\nbees receive signals from ultra-wideband anchors installed over two levels of\na room so that they can \"see\" where they are within that space as they flap\naround. For swarming behavior, a central computer determines the flight path\nfor collision-free formation flight.\n\nThe BionicBees were developed using generative design, where a software\napplication was tasked with coming up with the best lightweight structure\nusing the least possible materials while also aiming for maximum stability.\n\nThe swarm flight path is determined by a central computer, allowing for \"safe\nand collision-free flight in close formation\"\n\nFesto\n\nCrammed within the small frame is a brushless motor, three servos, a battery,\na gear unit, comms technology and control components. The wings beat between\n15 and 20 hertz, back and forth over 180 degrees. The servos \"change the\ngeometry of the wing\" for lift and direction control.\n\nFesto notes that each bot is assembled by hand and even the tiniest of\ndifferences in build can adversely impact performance. The team has therefore\nincluded an auto-calibration feature that spots any subtle hardware oddities\nduring a brief test flight. An algorithm then makes any necessary adjustments\nto flight characteristics so that the control system see all bees as identical\n\u2013 which makes for safe swarming.\n\nFesto launched the swarm flight of the BionicBees at Hannover Messe 2024 last\nweek.\n\nSource: Festo\n\nView gallery - 4 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
