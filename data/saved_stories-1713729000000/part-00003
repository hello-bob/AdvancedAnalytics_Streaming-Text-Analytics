Are you sure none interfere with your JS?\nDoes their adblocker block a script you\u2019re accidentally dependent on?\n\n    Many people use adblockers, which may blanket-block whole domains. If you have one script dependent on another and that other script gets blocked, the remainder of your scripting may not start up.\nIs the CDN up?\n\n    CDNs are good at staying up (that\u2019s what being a CDN is) but a minute downtime a month will still hit users who browse in that minute.\nDoes their browser support the JavaScript you\u2019ve written?\n\n    Check Can I Use for browser usage figures.\n\nIs all the above true?\n\nThen yes, your JavaScript works.\n\nProbably.\n\n    \n\nProgressive enhancement. Because sometimes your JavaScript just won\u2019t work.\n\nBe prepared.\n\nRussian translation available at Frontender Magazine courtesy of \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0446\u0435\u0432.\n\nThis is an @sil thing.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
