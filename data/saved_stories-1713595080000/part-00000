It was produced by Theodore Beale (also known as Vox Day), made by\nBeale's Fenris Wolf studio, and published by GT Interactive.^[1]^[2] A\nPlayStation version was also announced,^[3]^[4] but GT Interactive decided to\nput the PlayStation version on hold until sales figures for the PC version\ncame in, and later cancelled this version.^[5] In the game, the Moon has been\ncolonized, and due to political conflicts, the Lunar colonies are rebelling\nagainst the United Nations. The player is on the side of the Lunar alliance,\nfighting against United Nation forces. The game later takes a twist, when an\nalien species is discovered.\n\nThis game is the sequel to Rebel Moon. With the same basis as Rising, the\nplayer takes on 27 levels in the original Rebel Moon, quite a few more levels\nthan Rising. Rebel Moon was only released in a bonus disk with the Creative\nLabs hardware \"3D BLASTER PCI\". The series was also planned to have a third\ngame, titled Rebel Moon Revolution, but it was cancelled by GT\nInteractive.^[citation needed] Due to insufficient communications about the\ncancellation, Fenris Wolf instated a lawsuit against GT Interactive.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nThe PC shareware version of Rebel Moon Rising is included on disc 2 of the\nEIDOS Interactive game Blood, copyright 1997.^[citation needed]\n\nA novelization of Rebel Moon, written by Beale and Bruce Bethke was published\nin 1996.^[citation needed]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nLoyd Price, reviewing the game for Computer Gaming World in September 1997,\ngave it three out of five stars. Price praised the game's mission design and\nmultiplayer, but described the sprite-based graphics as \"a little dated\" and\nsaid the game's oxygen management system and arbitrary puzzle designs \"add a\njarring and frustrating element to an otherwise solid game\".^[6]\n\nThe game was commercially unsuccessful. Beale claimed the release of Quake at\nabout the same time made gaming consumers look for 3D games, rather than the\n\"2.5D\" of Rebel Moon Rising.^[7]^[unreliable source?]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Fenris Wolf v.
