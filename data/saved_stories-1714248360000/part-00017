In August 1945, following Japan\u2019s defeats\nin every recent battle and the obliteration of two cities with nuclear bombs,\nhe broadcast that \u201cthe war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan\u2019s\nadvantage\u201d.\n\nWell, I\u2019m sorry to have to announce that my cancer situation has also\ndeveloped not necessarily to my advantage.\n\nLast September, I described in these pages my diagnosis of throat cancer, and\nlikened my upcoming treatment to a journey to the South Pole. Sadly, although\nthe chemo and radiation did a good job on the tumours in my throat and neck,\nmy lungs are now riddled with the bloody things. The prognosis is not quite\n\u201cDon\u2019t buy any green bananas\u201d, but it\u2019s pretty close to \u201cDon\u2019t start any long\nbooks\u201d.\n\nSo it seems I\u2019m going to hop the twig, and probably sooner rather than later.\nBut many things give me comfort at the minute. The huge support and compassion\nwhich my wife, Aurelie, and I have received from friends, neighbours and even\ntotal strangers. My job, which I\u2019m so lucky to love. (I\u2019m still working every\nday, but quite often leave at 3pm for a pint with someone. The rules are\ndifferent in Cancerland!)\n\nAnd there are three related thoughts I have again and again, which bring me\njoy and which I am writing this to share with you.\n\nFirst of all, I take comfort from the thought that I\u2019ve had a really good \u2013\nalmost charmed \u2013 life. (I\u2019ll start this piece with the boasting, in the hope\nyou will have forgiven or forgotten it by the end.)\n\nI have dined with lords and billionaires, and broken bread with the poorest\npeople on earth. I have accomplished prodigious feats of drinking. I have\nallocated and for several years personally delivered at least a hundred\nmillion pounds\u2019 worth of overseas aid. I have been a Samaritan and a\npoliceman, and got off an attempted-murder charge in Vietnam (trumped up, to\nextract a bribe) by singing karaoke in a brothel.\n\nI have climbed the Great Pyramid, sailed across the Med and chipped chunks of\nconcrete off Checkpoint Charlie. I have travelled extensively on five\ncontinents, sung in choirs on three and crossed borders with diplomatic\nimmunity.\n\nI have seen whales and tigers and bears in the wild. I have seen air strikes,\nrockets and gun battles, the despair of the bereaved and the vacant stares of\nthe ethnically cleansed. I\u2019ve rolled a car, been shot in the leg and pulled\none of my own teeth out. The Times has printed seven of my letters, and I am\ncurrently vanity-publishing an exceptionally rude poem about cyclists.\n\nMost of all, I have loved and been loved. I\u2019m cocooned in the stuff; my cup\noverfloweth.\n\nSimon Boas Director of the Jersey Overseas Aid Commission Picture: DAVID\nFERGUSON. (37464904)\n\nAt 46, I have lived far longer than most of the humans in the 300,000-year\nhistory of our species. So have you, probably. And if the book of my life is\nshorter than many modern people\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t make it any less of a good read.\nLength and quality are not correlated in lives any more than they are in\nnovels or films. So carpe that diem and keep it carped. And enjoy the tiny\nways you can make other people a little happier. That\u2019s actually the secret of\nbeing happy oneself.\n\nMy second comforting thought is this: Nobody knows whether there\u2019s a God, or\nan afterlife, but it seems unlikely to me that our existence is merely a brief\nand random flash of consciousness between two eternities of nothing. A\nbenevolent creator strikes me as no more far-fetched than the latest efforts\nof physics to make sense of our world: for example that volume is illusory and\nthe universe is really a hologram, or that there are infinitely many universes\nall existing in parallel. Our almost-instinct may well be almost true: What\nwill survive of us is love.\n\nAnd finally, the thought I keep coming back to is how lucky it is to have\nlived at all. To exist is to have won the lottery. In fact, there are so many\nbits of extraordinarily-unlikely good luck that have occurred just for us to\nbe born, that it\u2019s like hitting the jackpot every day of the year. Consider\nsome of them:\n\nThere is something rather than nothing. The laws of physics, the strengths of\nforces, the mass of an electron are poised precisely so that stars and planets\ncan form. Inanimate stardust somehow combined to become self-replicating, and\nthen somehow developed further into eukaryotic, complex life. And then complex\nlife didn\u2019t just stop at ferns and fishes, but evolved into creatures that\nwere aware of their conditions. Matter became conscious of itself.\n\nOf all the billions of people in the world, your parents met and merged. And\nof all the sperm and eggs they produced \u2013 this is a billion-to-one shot just\non its own \u2013 the only two that would make YOU fused and multiplied. If the\nmoment you were conceived had been any different at all \u2013 a week later; a\nbottle of Blue Nun soberer \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t have been born.\n\nTo the staggering improbability of you just being here to read this \u2013 in\nphysical and biological terms \u2013 is added our good fortune in where and when we\nlive. To update Cecil Rhodes, to have been born in Western Europe is itself to\nhave won first prize in the lottery of life. And we live in the longest era of\npeace in human history, where our chances of dying from disease or violence\nare lower than ever before. We also live in an age of extraordinary abundance,\nthe poorest of us richer than any medieval king in terms of access to food,\nenergy, care, transport, knowledge, justice.\n\nSo if I whine that my life will have been shorter than many modern people\u2019s I\nam massively missing the point. I\u2019ve existed for 46 years. It\u2019s as churlish as\nwinning the \u00a392m Euromillions jackpot and then complaining bitterly when you\ndiscover that there\u2019s another winning ticket and you\u2019ll only get half the\nmoney.\n\nLife is inordinately precious, unlikely and beautiful. You are exquisite. When\nyou say \u2013 as you do, 20 times a day \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, realise that you don\u2019t just\nmean \u201cI\u2019m adequate\u201d. You are FINE. Refined. Unique. Finely crafted; fine\ndining; fine china! You really are fine in that sense too. We say it all the\ntime, but unknowingly we speak the truth.\n\nWe should be dazzled by our good fortune \u2013 dancing on the tables every day.\nAnd I mean to keep dancing in whatever time I have left here, and (who knows?)\nperhaps afterwards too.\n\n\u2013 Simon Boas is the director of Jersey Overseas Aid and chair of Jersey\nHeritage.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n## Trending Stories\n\n  1. ### Condor and Brittany Ferries offer discounted trips to Spain and Ireland\n\n  2. ### WATCH: 20ft fountain in St Helier as water main bursts\n\n  3. ### Suspected drink-driver reported by her husband\n\n  4. ### Islanders criticise court after artist found with indecent images avoids prison\n\n  5. ### Woman who drove through St Helier while more than three times alcohol limit avoids jail for \"absolutely appalling\" offence\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n## UK News\n\nUK News\n\n### Humza Yousaf seeks \u2018common ground\u2019 with opponents ahead of crunch vote\n\n27 April, 2024\n\nUK News\n\n### Man dies and four arrested after \u2018unusually strong\u2019 heroin circulates in\nDevon\n\n27 April, 2024\n\nUK News\n\n### British tourist in \u2018intensive care\u2019 after shark attack off Caribbean\nIsland\n\n27 April, 2024\n\nUK News\n\n### Former rival Kate Forbes backs Yousaf\u2019s leadership as FM seeks way forward\n\n27 April, 2024\n\nMore UK News\n\n## Read the latest free supplements\n\nRead the Town Crier, Le Rocher and a whole host of other subjects like\nmortgage advice, business, cycling, travel and property.\n\nRead More\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\u00a9 2024 Jersey Evening Post.
