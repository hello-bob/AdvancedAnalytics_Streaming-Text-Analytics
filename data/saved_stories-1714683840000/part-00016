Using only TERCOM and\nDSMAC guidance. GPS is more crucial over water, since there is no topography,\nand it also can greatly help in two situations. First IF for some reason\nTomahawk goes off course and can not match up with TERCOM / DSMAC programmed\nin, then the missile will attempt to do a sweeping pattern search until it\nrefinds land topography it recognizes or simply use GPS to keep it on its pre-\nprogrammed flight path. A rare occurrence but a possibility. Secondly it helps\nnarrow and hone in the target making it that much more precise. Without GPS it\nis quite capable of reaching and hitting the target with only TERCOM / DSMAC.\nBut with GPS it can hit the middle of the target. Or at least darn close to\nthe middle of the target.\n\nAlso from my experience during Operation Desert Storm, we unloaded VLS full of\n50+ Tomahawks. All of them found and hit the target. So 100%. However, we were\ntold that was not typical. They also told us the percentage overall, which I\ndo not recall precisely, but from memory it was something like ~85% effective\nin hitting the target. And partly why they kept re-assigning us more Tomahawk\nmissiles to launch because oddly all of ours worked in hitting the target. In\nfact our destroyer was the first to launch from Persian Gulf ... even though\nour ship was not originally planned to be. Simply because the USS Missouri who\nwas planned to launch the first, their Tomahawk failed to load up and launch.\nAnd we already had one warmed up and preparing to be ready, so we got the\nprivilege.\n\nTomahawks greatest issues with being effective is in the early stages. Fail to\nload, due to bad pin connection and/or gyro not syncing up. Failure to deploy\nits wings, booster separation failure, etc. Most of those can simply load\nanother Tomahawk to be launched, if there are still more available. I do not\nknow if that percentage we were told included all overall, or not. However,\nthe USN keeps using Tomahawk all these decades because it has proven to be\nfairly effective and is very helpful in times to avoid using and potentially\nrisking human life to do the same job.\n\nJS Squidley\n\nFormer Senior Chief Petty Officer BMCS (SW/AW)(E-8) at United States Navy\n(USN) (1995\u20132021) \u00b7 Author has 2K answers and 26.2M answer views\n\n\u00b7 7mo\n\nRelated\n\nIf a battleship fires a tomahawk cruise missile, could they if they wanted to\ndestroy the missile with like a self destruct built into it before it strikes\nsomething on the ground?\n\nLets break this completely down but lets get a couple things out of the way\nfirst.\n\n* Battleships.

A lot of normal people don\u2019t realize that there are no more actual battleship type warships in active service anywhere in the world. The last active battleship was USS Missouri BB-63, it was decommissioned in 1992. Any remaining examples of battleships left in the world at static museum ships or \u2018set in place\u2019 graveyards (see USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor.\n\nUSS Missouri BB-63 at sea in 1990.\n\nUSS Missouri BB-63 as a museum ship in Pearl Harbor at Ford Island, Hawaii.\nCredit myself for the pic.\n\nUSS Arizona BB-39 Memorial and Grave\n\n* Tomahawks. There have been many examples of Tomahawk cruise missiles historically, some are obsolete and no longer in use, others are modern modifications of the original and in service currently. So let's state that not all Tomahawks are created equal. Tomahawks were in fact carried by the defunct Iowa-class battleships but those versions of the missile are all also defunct. Modern Tomahawks are carrier by many modern warships and submarines alike.\n\nBlock I Tomahawk. The Block I was essentially a fire and forget weapon. You\ncould not communicate with it after it was launched. There was not link to the\nfiring platform and there was no GPS transceiver to transmit or receive any\nkind of information.\n\n1\\. BGM-109A Tomahawk Land Attack Missile - Nuclear (aka TLAM-N). TLAM-N had a\nW80 Mod O warhead. This version of the warhead was different than the W80 used\nin the USAF\u2019s ALCM or Air Launched Cruise Missile. The Mod 0 used Supergrade\nPlutonium. This was done so that the missile could be used in submarines, as\nit was far less radioactive in terms of what was given off, that way it would\nnot be a risk for handling in the close confines. The TLAM-N could also be put\non surface ships. 2. BGM-109B Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile (aka TASM). TASM was\nalso the same as the TLAM-A except it replaced the guidance section with a\nHarpoon Anti-Ship Missile Active Radar Seeker and a programmable search track\ncomputer for the INS (Intertial Navigation System) in place to fit TLAM-A\nTERCOM (Terrain Contour Mapping).\n\nBlock II Tomahawk. Block II was also a fire and forget weapon. You could not\ncommunicate with it after it was launched.\n\n1\\. BGM-109A Tomahawk Land Attack Missile -Conventional (aka TLAM-C). TLAM-C\nwas essentially a TLAM-N with a conventional 1000 pound warhead. It range was\nconsiderable shorter (900 miles) than TLAM-N (1500 miles) because the warhead\nwas 750 pounds larger. TLAM-C could be used from ships and submarines.\n\nBlock III Tomahawk. Block III added a different turbofan engine, an improved\nwarhead, and most importantly GPS. Adding GPS allowed for some information to\nbe received from the missile. This allowed for the missile to be tracked but\nmore importantly this made it much more accurate in targeting as it could more\naccurately keep course. However you still could not change the missile target\nor destruct it.\n\n1\\. BGM-109C Tomahawk Land Attack Missile - Conventional (aka TLAM-C). The new\nengine gave it 1000 miles range. 2. BGM-109D Tomahawk Land Attack Missile -\nDispenser (aka TLAM-D). TLAM-D was a TLAM-C with munitions dispenser in place\nof the warhead with 166 BLU97B bomblets. This increased the payload to over\n1400 pounds and decreased the range considerable to around 700 miles.\n\nBlock IV Tomahawk. Ok so this is where the rubber meets the road in terms of\nthis question. Block IV not only upgraded the missiles but it added a great\ndeal to the platforms launching the missile in terms of link to the missile\nand customization of the flight plan both before and after launch.\n\nPrior to Block IV, Tomahawk launching platform would receive mission planning\ninformation, something the USN Fleet affectionately called \u201cTomahawk Indigo\u201d\njust ahead of any launches of said weapon. Tomahawk missions were not a\nlocally derived effort, they had to come from the National Command Authority,\nvery similar to how nuclear weapons are authorized, even though the Tomahawks\nwere most certainly ALL conventionally armed. This Indigo was uploaded\nserially into the appropriate TLAM-C/D and the salvo was ordered. Once the\nmissile were away, the platform could only track the missiles to the extent of\nthe ship-own sensors.\n\nWith Block IV that all changed. Just prior to the arrival of the Block IV\nmissiles, all Tomahawk firing platforms upgraded to the Tactical Tomahawk\nWeapons Control System (TTWCS). TTWCS first and foremost allow the firing\nplatform to conduct the actual mission planning. Even then the mission\nplanning will be a tightly coordinated effort with command elements. Once\nTTWCS was in place the Block IV missile was fielded.\n\n1\\. BGM-109E Tomahawk Land Attack Missile - E (aka TLAM-E). TLAM-E again adds\na better engine giving it more range. Its aerodynamics are also improved with\na different shaped nose, redesigned engine inlet & exhaust and redesigned\ncontrol surfaces. TLAM-E improves up the GPS of Block III with the addition of\na SATCOM Transceiver. TLAM-E also incorporates imaging optics that allow it to\nrelay real-time imagery. TLAM-E\u2019s can be pre-programmed with up to 15\ndifferent targets. During flight the missile can be set to terminal attack or\nloiter and at any time can use the SATCOM to relay a targets live disposition\n(aka Real Time Battle Damage Assessment or BDA). The firing platform can then\nuse the SATCOM to change to another of the pre-programmed targets. This allows\ncommand to tell what the status of targets is real time and adjust fires to\nother targets not wasting missiles on targets already destroyed. In theory\nthis also allows the firing platform to call the missile off and send it to a\npoint where it won\u2019t harm anything. I cannot however tell you if this have\nbeen done. In my experience being on ships using TLAM-E in combat, they always\nfind other targets and typically they prefer to keep hitting an already\ndamaged target.\n\nBlock V changes the dynamic even more. Block V is now in the fleet, with 2\ndifferent version already and another set to be on the way soon.\n\nBlock V improves the ...\n\nRelated questions\n\nHow effective is the Autonomous Tomahawk cruise missile with only DSMAC and\nTERCOM guidance?\n\nWhat is the destructive force/range/blast area of a Tomahawk cruise missile?\n\nHow good is the Tomahawk cruise missile?\n\nHow accurate are Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, and how do they compare in\ncapability to an, latest generation, American Tomahawk?\n\nWhat are Tomahawk cruise missiles?
