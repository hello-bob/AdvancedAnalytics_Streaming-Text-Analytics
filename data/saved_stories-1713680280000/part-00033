Crosby\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\n328\n\nShare\n\nMy name is Max Azzarello, and I am an investigative researcher who has set\nhimself on fire outside of the Trump trial in Manhattan.\n\nThis extreme act of protest is to draw attention to an urgent and important\ndiscovery:\n\nWe are victims of a totalitarian con, and our own government (along with many\nof their allies) is about to hit us with an apocalyptic fascist world coup.\n\nThese claims sound like fantastical conspiracy theory, but they are not. They\nare proof of conspiracy. If you investigate this mountain of research, you\nwill prove them too. If you learn a great deal about Ponzi schemes, you will\ndiscover that our life is a lie. If you follow this story and the links below,\nyou will discover the rotten truth of \u2018post-truth America\u2019. You will learn the\nscariest and stupidest story in world history. And you will realize that we\nare all in a desperate state of emergency that requires your action.\n\nTo my friends and family, witnesses and first responders, I deeply apologize\nfor inflicting this pain upon you. But I assure you it is a drop in the bucket\ncompared to what our government intends to inflict.\n\nBecause these words are true, this is an act of revolution.\n\n\\--\n\nLast March, a billionaire named Peter Thiel started a bank run on Silicon\nValley Bank. I knew enough about Thiel that I found this incredibly\nsuspicious: My hunch was that this was intentional, though I couldn\u2019t fathom\nwhy.\n\nI began investigating online, and quickly found cryptocurrency\u2019s fingerprints\nall over it. The bank run occurred just days after Silvergate Bank \u2013 which\ncatered almost exclusively to crypto companies \u2013 collapsed. Meanwhile, several\ncrypto cheerleaders were all over financial media warning of a regional\nbanking crisis, and nobody in media was addressing the clear crypto\nconnections.\n\nI dug deep into the financials of Thiel\u2019s venture capital firm Founders Fund\nand eventually uncovered the following, all proven many times over.\n\n  * Cryptocurrency is our first planetary multi-trillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. It was expressly created for this purpose by a laundry list of rich and powerful people out of Stanford/Silicon Valley and Harvard/Facebook.\n\n  * The March 2023 bank failures were all intentional: the banks were used to move out stolen Ponzi money. This signals that they\u2019re no longer dumping cash in to keep the cryptocurrency Ponzi afloat, and that it will soon go insolvent, as all Ponzis must.\n\n  * When the Ponzi scheme goes insolvent, it will take down half the stock market with it: The perpetrators used their major companies to pipe into the blockchain so they could funnel money out from the crypto exchanges. This includes Google, Tesla, Apple, PayPal, Facebook, Disney, Walmart, Target, InBev, Zoom, and countless others.\n\n  * It is a Ponzi scheme so large that it created global inflation, which is why the price of Bitcoin has been a remarkable leading indicator for inflation rates. Victims who bought crypto don\u2019t realize their money has already been stolen, so the money gets double-counted by the victims and the criminals who stole it.\n\n  * As it turns out, our elites are awash in Ponzi schemes. Stanford\u2019s StartX.com investment fund and Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018Program for Evolutionary Dynamics\u2019 he ran at Harvard are both fake-science Ponzi factories that these schools have invested billions in: They are filled with fraudulent companies that use smoke and mirrors to promise miraculous new technology, but always collapse while the perpetrators only get richer.\n\n  * Funneling trillions of dollars in stolen cash through the stock market created the largest stock-market anomaly in history. The stock chart signature of a Ponzi scheme is a massive increase (while they stack up cash) and then a massive fall (as they funnel out the stolen cash). This chart shape appeared in all the companies listed above. In order to explain the massive anomaly, our criminal government unleashed COVID on the world and told us these were the \u201cstay at home stocks.\u201d\n\n\\--\n\nPonzi schemes are vicious beasts, and cryptocurrency is history\u2019s largest\nPonzi by orders of magnitude. It could best be described as an economic\ndoomsday device, intentionally made to shatter the world economy.\n\nThe U.S. government is fully involved in this totalitarian con: To illustrate\nits bipartisan support, I\u2019ll note that nearly every participant of the Clinton\nGlobal Initiative has ties to cryptocurrency, while two of the biggest tech\nVCs who participated are Trump associates Josh Kushner and Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nTo better understand our form of government, I will point you to one of the\nmost astonishing pieces of stand-alone evidence I\u2019ve found: Arkansas Governor\nBill Clinton\u2019s 1988 DNC speech where he nominated Mike Dukakis for president\nagainst George H.W. Bush. The speech is a vile, mean-spirited roast of Dukakis\nthat makes no sense whatsoever: For Clinton to ruthlessly attack a member of\nhis own party should have been political suicide, and he repeatedly mocks\nDukakis\u2019 noble and earnest qualities.\n\nNotably, actor Rob Lowe, who was supporting Dukakis, was victim of a teen sex\nblackmail operation at the DNC that year. Since we know Clinton is a close\nassociate with teen sex blackmail artist Jeffrey Epstein, we can suddenly make\nperfect sense of the nonsensical speech by applying this lens: Bill Clinton is\na cocky mob boss who blackmailed Mike Dukakis because Dukakis thought his job\nwas to help the public. He teases out the future public revelation that Kitty\nDukakis drank rubbing alcohol, and offers a strange anecdote about the crack\nepidemic that reveals he is an exceedingly proud drug runner.\n\nWhat does this revelation tell us? That our government is conning us\ncompletely. That Bill Clinton was secretly on (former CIA Director) George\nH.W. Bush\u2019s side, and that the Democrat vs. Republican division has been\nentirely manufactured ever since: Clinton is with Bush; Gore is with Bush;\nTrump is with Hillary, and so on. When they present themselves in public, they\nare acting as characters that are against one another, practicing kayfabe as\nwrestlers do.\n\nAs it turns out, we have a secret kleptocracy: Both parties are run by\nfinancial criminals whose only goals are to divide, deceive, and bleed us dry.\nThey divide the public against itself and blame the other party while\neverything gets worse and more expensive and handful of people take all the\nmoney.\n\nSince it is fully parasitic, a secret kleptocracy is an incredibly unstable\nform of government \u2013 left to its own devices, it can only lead to fascism or\nfailed state.\n\n\\--\n\nOne of the key findings of this research is that Harvard University is one of\nthe largest organized crime fronts in history, which is how they churn out\nbillionaires \u2013 it\u2019s a major hub of this sprawling criminal network.\n\nAs it turns out, dozens of the writers of The Simpsons went to Harvard. So I\nasked myself the question: If The Simpsons served the interests of organized\ncrime, how would it do so?\n\nWell, it offers a dysfunctional family suffering from moral decay, a community\nincapable of solving its problems, a worker drone who slaves away for an evil\nbillionaire, and cathartic laughs for our poor collective circumstances.\n\nThere are some notable specifics as it relates to this research, too: In Marge\nvs. The Monorail, the townsfolk are too oafish and divided to invest in the\ntown\u2019s needs (fix Main Street) and fall for the charms of a dazzling showman\nwith a bogus monorail Ponzi scheme. When we know that the show is closely\nlinked to an organization that invests billions of dollars in Ponzi factories,\nthis becomes quite damning.\n\nIn Lisa the Iconoclast, Lisa discovers that town founder Jebediah Springfield\nwas a secret criminal con artist, and that the townsfolk\u2019s lives are a lie.\nRealizing this is an important discovery, she desperately tries to get the\ntownsfolk to listen to her. But they meet her with hostility, apathy,\ndisbelief, and partisanship and she fails to get through to them. Ultimately,\nshe realizes the town is so far gone that perhaps it\u2019s better for them to be\nlied to by con artists, and she keeps the secret to herself.\n\nAnd here I\u2019ve been, like Lisa Simpson, desperately trying to get friends,\nfamily, and the public to believe the proof of a totalitarian con I\u2019m trying\nto show them, and they\u2019ve turned away with hostility, apathy, disbelief, and\npartisanship.\n\nAnd so, we realize the criminal truth of The Simpsons: Our elites are telling\nus that our eroding collective circumstances are our own fault, and we can\u2019t\ndo anything about it, while they steal the American Dream from us. It is, for\nlack of a more elegant word, brainwashing.\n\n\u2014\n\nLastly, we string these major discoveries together: Cryptocurrency is an\neconomic doomsday device; our government is a secret kleptocracy; The Simpsons\nexists to brainwash us. From there, the only research we need is critical\nthinking and we\u2019re able to piece together the true story of our circumstances.\n\nConsider America since 1988: Institutions like healthcare and universities\nhave become parasitic in their skyrocketing prices. News media tells us to be\nangry and tribalized. Daytime television warns us of moral decay. Local news\ntell us to fear our neighbors. The Simpsons tells us we\u2019re too oafish and\ndivided to save the American Dream. Seinfeld tells us to celebrate the\nassholes and be irritated by all the normal people around us. \u201cReality\u201d TV\ntells us that real life is filled with hedonism and strife.\n\nSocial media, owned by crypto criminals like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, is\nflooded with nonsense conspiracy theories and memes reminding us that we are\nhopeless, helpless, anxious, depressed, ironic, scared, apathetic, escapist,\nlonely, misguided, and jaded, telling us we can\u2019t do anything but have a laugh\nat our circumstances.\n\nLiberals mock the hypocrisy of conservatives; conservatives mock the hypocrisy\nof liberals, and our collective circumstances erode. The left shouts \u201cAll Cops\nAre Bastards,\u201d which ensures they\u2019ll be hated by the police and the public\n(and flies in the face of leftist theory). The public\u2019s distrust of the\ngovernment is at an all-time high, but so is the belief that we are helpless\nto do anything about it.\n\nAnd with all this, a sharp rise in apocalyptic messaging: Climate change will\nkill us all; COVID will kill us all; vaccines will kill us all; AI will kill\nus all \u2013 no matter the bubbles we ascribe to, we\u2019re bombarded with existential\ncrises with no solutions. We\u2019ve seen a surge in apocalyptic film, literature,\nand video games that tell us there is no way out of our poor circumstances but\ntotal societal breakdown. Zombies tell us that the public is our enemy. If you\ngo to your nearest convenience store, you can buy a can of water called\n\u201cLiquid Death.\u201d\n\nThis is our rotten farce: For our entire lives, we have been flooded with\nmedia designed to slowly steer us into a world where the American Dream was\ndead, where the public was fully divided against itself, where everybody\nbelieved we were powerless to do anything about our worsening circumstances.\nIt is all so they can organize an unprecedented, apocalyptic rug pull on the\nentire populace as they pivot to fascism, which is perhaps best understood as\nkleptocracy at the barrel of a gun.\n\nWhen we piece it all together, we understand the truth: We are in a\ntotalitarian doomsday cult.\n\nWhy on earth would our elites do this? There are many reasons, but the\nsimplest is because capitalism is unsustainable, and they knew it: Climate\nchange and resource extraction would catch up eventually. So, they never\nintended to sustain it. They knew all along that they would gobble up all the\nwealth they could, and then yank the rug out from under us so they could pivot\nto a hellish fascist dystopia.\n\n\u2014\n\nThings escalated wildly in 1988 when former CIA Director George H.W. Bush got\nthe White House, but this plan had been in action long prior:\n\nWhy is Stanley Kubrick\u2019s comedy about mutually assured destruction called Dr.\nStrangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb? Because he\nwas a cocky secret fascist who was getting us to stop worrying and love the\nbomb. Why did he make A Clockwork Orange? So we\u2019d rejoice at ultra-violence\ndesigned to desensitize us to the horrors of the world.\n\nWhy were the Manson Family murders crawling with cover-ups and intelligence\nagents? Because our government wanted to make us fear for our lives and\nbelieve that hippies are deranged psychopaths.\n\nWhy did Walt Disney produce a fraudulent documentary that told us Lemmings\nfollow each other off cliffs? So we would believe it.\n\nWhy did The Beatles tell us to fear the taxman, to scoff at revolution, chase\nnonsense conspiracy theories, and that happiness is a warm gun? So we would\nbelieve it.\n\nWhy did Easy Rider tell us that the hippie movement was dead? So we would\nbelieve it.\n\nWhy did Chinatown end with defeatism in the face of massive corruption? So we\nwould believe it.\n\nWhy did George Orwell tell us of a hellish future of totalitarian control that\nwe are powerless to stop? So we would believe it.\n\nWhy did Wall Street tell us \u201cgreed is good\u201d? So we would believe it.\n\nWhy did Do The Right Thing tell us we\u2019re all racially tribalized? So we would\nbelieve it.\n\nWhy did Simpsons creator Matt Groening make a comic strip called Life in Hell?\nSo we would believe it.\n\nAnd on, and on, and on, and on. When it comes to any popular media, if you ask\nyourself the question, \u201cWhy would secret doomsday cult kleptocrats want the\npublic to consume this?\u201d, you will find your answers.\n\n\u2014\n\nThis is obviously very bad news, but the biggest lie we\u2019ve been told is that\nwe are powerless. We\u2019ve got one way out of hellworld, and that\u2019s for the\npublic to realize that we\u2019ve been conned completely so we can build a united\nmovement that shatters every lie they\u2019ve told us, mocks this rotten farce as\nloudly as it deserves, and aims at nothing short of abolishing our criminal\ngovernment so we can build one that serves the public.\n\nTo understand this story is to see right through the con, to become immune to\nthe endless sea of criminal propaganda, and to feel the great joy and power\nthat comes with freedom.\n\nIf a small number of people quickly put on these truth-colored glasses, we are\nin for an unimaginably bright future. If not, we get an apocalypse.\n\nFor more information, I\u2019ve put together this booklet that includes other major\nfindings and a map to a sea of proof, along with all the other essays on this\nsite.\n\nFor the true history of America since the end of World War II, see here.\n\nTo see this discovery unfold in real-time, along with further explanations,\nhundreds of pieces of evidence not covered here, advice, inspiration,\npolitical theory, and the heart and soul of a man escaping history\u2019s largest\ndoomsday cult, see my Instagram story highlights. I apologize for leaving\nthings so scattered, but this has been an exhausting affair. So long as you\nunderstand this (true) ideology, you will be able to learn the whole story.\n\nHere is a federal lawsuit I filed against dozens of perpetrators of the\ncryptocurrency Ponzi \u2013 not for litigation, but just to preserve the\ninformation and attach my name to it. I was terrified and hadn\u2019t slept in days\nand it shows, but it served its purpose of keeping myself alive long enough to\nkeep learning and telling this story.\n\nI no longer have my original research files from the crypto rabbit hole. If\nyou want to see them, you\u2019ll have to get my laptop back from the government.\nAsk them how they got it - it\u2019s a very fun story.\n\nI hope you know how powerful you are. I wish you a hell of a lot more than\nluck.\n\nMax Azzarello\n\n### Subscribe to The Ponzi Papers\n\nBy M.
