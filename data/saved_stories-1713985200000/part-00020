Credit: Jim\nDaley\n\nThis story was co-published in collaboration with WIRED.\n\nWhen mayor Brandon Johnson announced in February that Chicago would stop using\nthe gunshot-detection system known as ShotSpotter by year\u2019s end, local\nactivists were elated.\n\nEver since 2021, when the police fatally shot thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo\nwhile responding to a ShotSpotter alert, the Stop ShotSpotter Campaign has\nbeen pressuring the city to ditch the technology. Johnson\u2019s decision not to\nrenew the Windy City\u2019s contract with ShotSpotter was seen as the culmination\nof the campaign\u2019s efforts.\n\nBut ending the contract may not be enough to remove the company\u2019s more than\n2,500 sensors from neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South and West Sides, where\nthey\u2019re disproportionately located. Internal emails reviewed by South Side\nWeekly and WIRED suggest ShotSpotter keeps its sensors online and, in some\ninstances, provides gunshot detection alerts to police departments in cities\nwhere its contracts have expired or been canceled. The emails raise new\nquestions about whether the sensors in Chicago will be turned off and removed,\nregardless of Johnson\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe continue to focus on serving the City of Chicago with our critical gunshot\ndetection technology service during our contractual term,\u201d a ShotSpotter\nspokesperson wrote in a statement. \u201cNothing has changed regarding our singular\npurpose to close the public safety gap by enabling law enforcement agencies\nglobally to more efficiently and effectively respond to incidents of criminal\ngunfire...where gunshot wound victim\u2019s lives are in the balance.\u201d\n\nAn organizer who\u2019s been active in the push to cancel ShotSpotter\u2019s contract in\nChicago wasn\u2019t surprised the company has continued to work with police behind\nthe scenes in cities where contracts have ended.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s exactly what cops and corporations do,\u201d says Nathan Palmer, an\norganizer with the Stop ShotSpotter Campaign and Black Youth Project 100.\n\u201cEspecially when we\u2019re thinking about Chicago, it would benefit ShotSpotter to\nkeep the mics up and working so that they can also throw lobbying money at\nwhoever\u2019s gonna oppose mayor Brandon Johnson in the next election.\u201d\n\nShotSpotter, which rebranded as SoundThinking in 2023, has a customer base of\nroughly 170 cities, according to its most recent filing with the US Securities\nand Exchanges Commission. Chicago is not the first to deem the ShotSpotter\ntechnology not worth the cost. (By the time the city\u2019s contract extension ends\nin November, ShotSpotter will have cost Chicago more than $57 million since\nthen-mayor Rahm Emanuel inked a comprehensive deal with the company in 2018.)\n\nSign up to get the Weekly Digest delivered to your inbox\n\nSan Antonio, San Diego, and Dayton have all joined a growing list of cities\nthat have publicly cut ties with ShotSpotter. Confidential company emails\nreviewed by the Weekly and WIRED, however, indicate that the company never\ncompletely pulled its technology out of some cities.\n\nAn October 2023 email sent to John Fountain, a director of field and network\noperations at SoundThinking who left the company in December, described how\nthe company continued to secretly offer its help to police in cities where\ncontracts had lapsed. The email, which addressed a shortage of sensors in a\ncity with an active contract, apparently referred to Clark Dunson,\nSoundThinking\u2019s director of systems engineering.\n\n\u201cI would like to imagine we can pull some [sensors] from an old coverage area\n... Maybe San Diego and Indianapolis,\u201d wrote the sender, whose name was\nredacted. \u201cLast time we looked to remove sensors from an old coverage area I\nknow Clark flipped out since we still work with police using those sensors\n(which I did not know).\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the company declined to answer detailed questions about\nwhat services the company has provided to police departments after contracts\nare up and emailed a statement instead. \u201cSoundThinking believes this\nconfidential information was illegally disclosed by ex-employees and is\ncurrently pursuing civil and criminal remedies against the private parties\nresponsible,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDue to this ongoing litigation, we cannot\ncomment specifically on the leaked materials; however, we will continue to\nobject to the use of our stolen data and reinforce the safety and privacy\nrisks of disclosing individual sensor locations.\u201d\n\nShotSpotter is suing two former employees who the company alleges posted\nconfidential company information on Twitter after one was fired last November.\n\nIn February, WIRED reported ShotSpotter sensor locations based on leaked\ncompany data showing more than 25,000 microphones arrayed across the globe.\nThose maps revealed active sensors remained in both San Diego and\nIndianapolis. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police (IMP) recently told the\nIndyStar that they do not have a contract with the company after piloting\ntechnology from three different gunshot detection companies in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe evaluation of whether or not gunshot detection technology system is right\nfor Indianapolis is still ongoing,\u201d a police spokesperson told the IndyStar.\nThe statement added that the department believed it was ShotSpotter\u2019s\nresponsibility to remove its sensors.\n\nShotSpotter doesn\u2019t sell its sensors to cities. Instead, the company uses a\n\u201csoftware-as-service\u201d model, billing cities for the software and applications\nthat allow police to access ShotSpotter alerts. When a contract expires, the\ncompany apparently doesn\u2019t always retrieve its sensors.\n\nA Flourish map\n\nAn email from Fountain dated from December 2022 estimated that there were a\n\u201cfew hundred sensors still installed\u201d in San Diego and that they are \u201cactive\neven if the market isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFountain noted that removing any sensors from San Diego would require Clark\nDunson\u2019s approval. \u201cClark is really pushy and he likes to tinker around with\nthose coverage area[s] but I imagine we can pull a few here and there,\u201d he\nwrote.\n\nIn August 2023, Dunson sent an internal email that said ShotSpotter had been\nproviding \u201ctest alerts\u201d to police in San Diego and San Antonio. \u201cAs a last\nresort we can pull sensors away from San Diego or San Antonio if needed but\nLee [Lim, a SoundThinking tech-support engineer] has been working with the PD\nin those areas giving test alerts and tracking down detections for them.\u201d\n\nThe San Diego Police Department (SDPD) denied that sensors in that city are\nactive or collecting any data. SDPD also claimed to never have asked the\ncompany for help with gunshot detections in any incidents involving homicides\nor shootings.\n\n\u201cAt this time, there is no contract and there is no plan to move forward with\nthe company,\u201d a spokesperson for the department wrote in an email. San Diego\nand ShotSpotter entered into an agreement that allows the company to leave its\nsensors on city property. \u201cHowever, as of September 2021, the equipment is\ndeactivated, cannot collect any data, and is inoperable.\u201d\n\nBut emails the Weekly and WIRED obtained via a California Public Records Act\nrequest show that ShotSpotter stayed in touch with SDPD for more than 15\nmonths after the city\u2019s contract expired in September 2021. In those emails,\nShotSpotter support staff routinely address SDPD as a \u201cShotSpotter Customer.\u201d\n\nThese weren\u2019t just mass marketing emails that all customers past and present\nare frequently subjected to. The emails we obtained show that in October 2021,\nafter the contract had lapsed, ShotSpotter also provided an SDPD officer with\nan \u201cinvestigative lead summary\u201d about a shooting in San Diego, including the\nprecise location and the number of rounds detected, upon SDPD\u2019s request.\n\nShotSpotter also sent SDPD emails updating the department about routine\nscheduled maintenance in October 2022 and how the company planned to address\nthe \u201cextremely high volume of fireworks activities\u201d around New Year\u2019s Day in\n2023.\n\n\u201cDespite our efforts, we may occasionally miss a gunshot in error,\u201d wrote Dinh\nNguyen, a technical support engineer at ShotSpotter, in a December 2022 email\nto SDPD. \u201cYou may also experience some delays in the publication of\nincidents.\u201d\n\n## RELATED STORY\n\n### CPD Reported Hundreds of Missed Shootings to ShotSpotter Last Year\n\nThe department reported misses more than 550 times in 2023, and a public\nsafety director complained about a 55-round miss in 2022.\n\nby Jim Daley and Max Blaisdell\n\nShotSpotter is not on a list of surveillance technologies the SDPD are\nrequired to frequently publish as a part of a sweeping surveillance ordinance\npassed by the San Diego City Council in August 2022 and amended in January of\nthis year.\n\nA San Diego city council member whose district includes several of the\nneighborhoods where ShotSpotter sensors were installed in 2016, said that\ntheir \u201coffice is aware of the ShotSpotter situation\u201d via a spokesperson. In\nJuly 2021, the then-District Four councilmember requested the city remove\nsensors from his district, which helped scuttle the contract renewal.\n\n\u201cA request to remove such [sensors] has been forwarded to the San Diego Police\nDepartment and the Mayor\u2019s office,\u201d a spokesperson for current District Four\ncouncilmember Henry L. Foster III (who was sworn in in April) wrote in an\nemail to the Weekly and WIRED. \u201cDevices that have not been approved in\naccordance with the Surveillance Ordinance should not be installed and or\noperational by the City of San Diego or third party.\u201d\n\nSan Diego mayor Todd Gloria\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2021, San Diego\u2019s city council pulled a scheduled vote on a four-year\nextension to ShotSpotter from its agenda, effectively sunsetting the city\u2019s\nagreement with the company. Although Gloria\u2019s office said in statements at the\ntime that they would bring the extension back up in the city council, there is\nno indication that they did.\n\nBased on a map of the secret locations of every ShotSpotter sensor in the\ncountry published by WIRED, there are still about 30 active sensors in San\nDiego, most of which are clustered near the University of California, San\nDiego\u2019s La Jolla campus and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n\nWhen asked to comment on whether SDPD receives and responds to ShotSpotter\nalerts from these active sensors, a spokesperson for the department directed\nquestions to the UC San Diego police. UCSD did not respond to requests for\ncomment.\n\nThe Weekly and WIRED requested emails sent between San Antonio Police\nDepartment (SAPD) and ShotSpotter dated after the city\u2019s contract with\nShotSpotter expired in the fall of 2017. In March, the SAPD filed an appeal\nwith the Texas Attorney General, seeking to have the responsive records\nwithheld under a laundry list of exemptions provided for by the state\u2019s public\nrecords act. The police provided sealed records to the Texas AG to review. The\nAG is expected to decide whether to release the records by May.\n\nSAPD said that after the contract lapsed, they never asked ShotSpotter for\nassistance and no arrests were made based on detections provided by the\ncompany.\n\nRecords produced in response to a separate public records request show that\nShotSpotter sent four-term San Antonio mayor Ron Nirenberg at least two\nmarketing emails months after the city council voted not to include\nShotSpotter in its budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The company does not\nappear to have communicated with his office after November 2018, however.\nNirenberg\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cTo me it sounds like, on their part, another strategic business decision, and\nthat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing in every city,\u201d says Palmer, the Stop ShotSpotter\norganizer. \u201cIt sounds like a business decision, because they don\u2019t actually\ncare about public safety.\u201d\n\n\u2736 \u2736 \u2736 \u2736\n\nJim Daley is the Weekly\u2019s investigations editor.
