After a few billion years, here we are:\nintelligent and technologically advanced. Where's everyone else?\n\nIntelligent aliens, if they exist in the galaxy or the Universe, might be\ndetectable from a variety of signals: electromagnetic, from planet\nmodification, or because they're spacefaring. But we haven't found any\nevidence for an inhabited alien planet so far. We may truly be alone in the\nUniverse, but the honest answer is we don't know enough about the relevant\nprobabilities to draw definitive conclusions. Our first discovery of life\nbeyond Earth still awaits.\n\nCredit: Ryan Somma/flickr\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * Long ago, Enrico Fermi posed a simple question just by gazing at the stars: \"Where is everybody?\"\n  * Known today as the Fermi Paradox, there are many possible solutions, but some explanations are far simpler than others: namely, that there isn't anyone else.\n  * Still, the most common way of estimating who's out there, the Drake equation, should never be used. Here's the science of how to do it right.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare The unsurprising non-detection of intelligent aliens on Facebook\n\nShare The unsurprising non-detection of intelligent aliens on Twitter (X)\n\nShare The unsurprising non-detection of intelligent aliens on LinkedIn\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever gazed up at a dark and clear night sky, you might feel the same\nthing that I do each and every time: a feeling that it\u2019s beckoning us and\ndrawing us in to explore and wonder what\u2019s out there in the great abyss of\nspace. Each point of distant, twinkling light isn\u2019t just a star in its own\nright, but also a chance: for planets, for biochemistry, and for life. If we\nreally allow our imaginations to run wild, we might even imagine the existence\nof something better than mere life, such as the existence of intelligent,\nself-aware, and technologically advanced civilizations.\n\nBut that brings up a question that humanity has obsessed over for generations:\nIf the ingredients for life are common, and we evolved naturally, then where\nis everyone else? Many of you consistently write in with variations on this\nquestion, including Franco Camporeale, Oleg (Alex) Naum, and Zoe Eppley,\nasking things like:\n\nThe Fermi Paradox has come up a few times in my recent reading...do the\nfollowing things have anything to do with the possibility of life beyond\nEarth?\n\n  * faster-than-light travel\n  * radio attenuation\n  * the necessity of enough rare elements\n  * the merger of humans with machines\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating topic to speculate about, but even a better topic for\nlaying out the science. Let\u2019s take an in-depth look at what we know about all\nthat\u2019s out there.\n\nWith recent discoveries, we have a tremendous amount of knowledge about the\nnumber of planets out there, including what stars they\u2019re around and what\nsizes and distances from their star they possess. But when it comes to the\nquestion of whether they\u2019re inhabited, we have no information at all.\n\nCredit: Lucianomendez\n\nIf we want to understand how the Universe makes intelligent life, we have to\nconsider two things. First, we have to consider the steps that needed to occur\nin order to bring about our own existence. And then, we need to think about\nways that intelligent life could arise in circumstances that differ from our\nown, and to make sure, wherever possible, that we\u2019re doing it in as\nquantitatively accurate a fashion as possible. We also have to make sure that\nwe don\u2019t make unfounded assumptions, or fall for any one of a number of\nlogical fallacies, like conflating \u201cabsence of evidence\u201d with \u201cevidence of\nabsence,\u201d or the post hoc ergo propter hoc (this came after, therefore it was\ncaused by) fallacy.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to learn how not to estimate what\u2019s out there. There are\ntwo all-too-common mistakes that people \u2014 even the most brilliant of\nscientists \u2014 make when considering this question. One is that they make point\nestimates akin to \u201cwe may not know this parameter, so here\u2019s what we estimate\nit to be,\u201d which is relatively meaningless. If you\u2019re going to make such an\nestimate, it\u2019s only meaningful if you include an uncertainty range, a set of\nerror bars, or some other likelihood predictor. There\u2019s an enormous difference\nbetween saying that you estimate the odds of something to be 1 in 100 with a\n10% uncertainty, a 1,000% uncertainty, or a two-tailed uncertainty where it\ncould be as high as 1 in 10, but there could be no lower limit at all.\n\nThe Drake equation is one way to arrive at an estimate of the number of\nspacefaring, technologically advanced civilizations in the galaxy or Universe\ntoday. However, it relies on a number of assumptions that are not necessarily\nvery good, and contains many unknowns that we lack the necessary information\nto provide meaningful estimates for.\n\nCredit: University of Rochester\n\nBut the other mistake that people make is perhaps the most common of all when\nit comes to attempting to answer the Fermi Paradox: making use of the Drake\nequation. The Drake equation yields many interesting lessons, and when it was\nfirst put forth, it was a monumental achievement from a scientific\nperspective. For the first time, it broke up a seemingly unknowable question\nof how many intelligent, spacefaring civilizations there are within our galaxy\ntoday, into a series of smaller questions that we could conceive of solving\none at a time.\n\nWe could, for example, measure or estimate things like:\n\n  * the rate of star formation in the Milky Way\n  * the share of stars that have planets\n  * the average number of potentially life-supporting planets around stars with planets\n  * the fraction of planets that could have life that actually wind up with life\n  * the fraction of planets with life that go on to develop intelligent life\n  * the fraction of intelligently inhabited planets that emit detectable signals\n  * the length of time that such civilizations continue to emit those signals\n\nWhen you multiply all of those things, you\u2019ll wind up with an estimate for the\nnumber of active civilizations that we could potentially detect today.\n\nA visualization of the planets found in orbit around other stars in a specific\npatch of sky probed by the NASA Kepler mission. As far as we can tell,\npractically all stars with more than ~25% of the heavy elements found in the\nSun have planetary systems around them, although certain very dense stellar\nregions may be exceptional.\n\nCredit: ESO/M. Kornmesser\n\nBut immediately, we run into a few major problems. For one, we\u2019ve measured the\nrate of star formation in the Milky Way, and we actually know it pretty well.\nUnfortunately, if you took that star formation rate and multiplied it by the\nage of the Universe since the hot Big Bang, you\u2019d wind up with almost no\nstars; you\u2019d calculate that the Milky Way should have formed a total of around\n10 billion stars over our cosmic history.\n\nI know that 10 billion probably sounds like a big number, but compared to the\nactual estimate for the number of stars in our galaxy \u2014 which is more like 400\nbillion \u2014 it\u2019s only 2-3%.\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s easy to identify why this method of calculating how many\nstars we\u2019ve formed, which you\u2019d imagine would give you the total number of\nstars in the galaxy, is so thoroughly wrongheaded. The superficial reason is\nfairly obvious: The star-formation rate is not constant over our cosmic\nhistory. In fact, we\u2019ve come to understand that the Universe was born without\nstars, which began forming during the first ~200 million years or so. We\u2019ve\nlearned that star formation increased for the first ~3 billion years of our\ncosmic history, reached a peak, and has been dropping ever since. Locally,\nwe\u2019ve probably experienced bursts of star formation when we\u2019ve absorbed\nsmaller, satellite galaxies, and we might even be starting to experience\nanother burst as the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda exert their gravitational\ninfluence on the gas, dust, and other neutral matter within our own galaxy.\n\nThe largest group of newborn stars in our Local Group of galaxies, cluster\nR136, contains the most massive stars we\u2019ve ever discovered: over 250 times\nthe mass of our Sun for the largest. The brightest of the stars found here are\nmore than 8,000,000 times as luminous as our Sun. And yet, these stars only\nachieve temperatures of up to ~50,000 K, with white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars,\nand neutron stars all getting hotter.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, and P. Crowther (University of Sheffield)\n\nBut that\u2019s only the superficial reason why the Drake equation is problematic\ntoday. The deeper reason is that the Drake equation, when it was put forth,\nmade an assumption about the Universe that we now know is untrue: It assumed\nthat the Universe was eternal and static in time. As we learned only a few\nyears after Frank Drake first proposed his equation, the Universe doesn\u2019t\nexist in a steady state, where it\u2019s unchanging in time, but rather has evolved\nfrom a hot, dense, energetic, and rapidly expanding state: a hot Big Bang that\noccurred over a finite duration in our cosmic past.\n\nInstead, a much more productive route is to calculate the quantities we now\ncan speak about with some level of certainty, and then move on to the great\ncosmic unknowns in as responsible a fashion as we can.\n\nUnlike the situation some 60 years ago, when the Drake equation was first\nproposed, we now have an excellent idea of what our Universe is like, both in\nand beyond the Milky Way and the Local Group. We understand what the various\npopulations of stars are that exist, and what sorts of steps need to occur to\nmake heavy elements, rocky planets, and allow for the possibility of complex\nchemistry and important reactions, such as the formation of energy-storing\nmolecules from nothing more than the ubiquitous building blocks and starlight.\n\nThis image from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory shows the location of\ndifferent elements in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant including silicon\n(red), sulfur (yellow), calcium (green) and iron (purple), as well as the\noverlay of all such elements (top). A supernova remnant expels heavy elements\ncreated in the explosion back into the Universe. Although it isn\u2019t shown here,\nthe ratio of U-235 to U-238 in supernovae is approximately 1.6:1, indicating\nthat Earth was born from largely ancient, not recently, created raw uranium.\n\nCredit: NASA/CXC/SAO\n\nWe\u2019ve also learned a lot about the types and abundances of planets that exist\naround stars other than our own: exoplanets. As recently as 30 years ago, we\nwere only discovering our very first planets around stars besides the Sun; at\nthe end of 2021, we\u2019re closing in on a whopping 5,000 confirmed exoplanets.\nAnd sure, there are biases in our data \u2014 we\u2019re preferentially detecting the\nplanets that are the easiest to detect \u2014 but we know how to account for those\nbiases.\n\nInstead of needing to speculate about how many stars form, how many have\nplanets, how many planets per system have the potential for life, etc., we can\nactually utilize some excellent data. Here in our modern Milky Way, we already\nknow:\n\n  * how many stars there are\n  * how those stars are divided into different populations\n  * how many planets there are per star\n  * how many of those planets have the right composition of elements to lead to complex chemistry\n  * how many of those planets have the potential for hosting life\n\nOn this front, it\u2019s actually straightforward to come up with a solid estimate\nfor how many potentially habitable planets are in our galaxy.\n\nThis illustration depicts one possible appearance of the planet Kepler-452b,\nthe first near-Earth-size world to be found in the habitable zone of a star\nsimilar to our Sun.\n\nCredit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle\n\nIn fact, we can perform that calculation in a variety of ways, just to show\nthe power of our set of knowledge. Of the approximately 400 billion stars in\nthe Milky Way:\n\n  * ~80% are red dwarfs\n  * ~18% are like the Sun\n  * only ~2% are too massive and short-lived to be interesting for life\n\nAs far as we can tell, there are about 5 to 10 planets per stellar system,\nwith approximately ~1 to 2 planets in what we (questionably) call the\nhabitable zone around each star. Of the planets that exist around Sun-like\nstars, we believe that ~20% of them are Earth-like in terms of size; a greater\npercentage than that are terrestrial around the more common red dwarf stars.\n\nIf we assume, conservatively, that red dwarf systems are not habitable at all,\nbut Sun-like systems are, then all we have to do is multiply the following\nfigures:\n\n  * the number of stars (400 billion)\n  * the proportion that are Sun-like enough to support life (0.18)\n  * the number of expected potentially habitable-zone planets per relevant star (1.5)\n  * the fraction of those planets that are Earth-like in size (0.20)\n\nWe then derive an estimate for the number of potentially inhabited planets in\nthe Milky Way: 21,600,000,000.\n\nMost of the planets we know of that are comparable to Earth in size have been\nfound around cooler, smaller stars than the Sun. This makes sense with the\nlimits of our instruments; these systems have larger planet-to-star size\nratios than our Earth does with respect to the Sun. It\u2019s reasonable, based on\nwhat we know, to expect that there will be billions-to-tens of billions of\npotentially habitable planets around stars that can admit the possibility of\nlife.\n\nCredit: NASA/Ames/JPL-Caltech\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to use so many significant figures \u2014 20 billion is good\nenough \u2014 but also we have to remember that all of these numbers have\nuncertainties. There may be as few as 200 billion stars; half of our estimate.\nSome of the stars may be too low in metals \u2014 what astronomers call the heavy\nelements in the Universe \u2014 for planets to support life, but the percentage is\nsmall; less than 10% for certain. Some stars might not have planets, but again\nthe percentage is small; less than 20% for certain. The habitable zone may be\nlarger or narrower than we think; tack another ~33% uncertainty onto our\nestimate.\n\nAnd we haven\u2019t sampled the low end of the mass/radius portion of the exoplanet\npopulation very well; our estimate of 20% being Earth-like in size could go up\nor down, so it\u2019s reasonable to put a 25% uncertainty on that figure. All in\nall, there could reasonably be as few as 5 billion potentially habitable\nplanets in the Milky Way, or perhaps as many as 50 billion. If red dwarf\nsystems are potentially habitable as well, that number could increase tenfold.\nAnd at the same time, many of the things we\u2019ve worried about in the past\nlikely don\u2019t particularly matter one way or the other, such as:\n\n  * whether a planet has a major moon or not\n  * whether it has a Jupiter-like world in its stellar system\n  * whether it\u2019s located close to or far from the galactic center\n  * whether it\u2019s a part of a singlet or multi-star system\n\nThe raw ingredients that we believe are necessary for life, including a wide\nvariety of carbon-based molecules, are found not only on Earth and other rocky\nbodies in our Solar System, but in interstellar space, such as in the Orion\nNebula: the nearest large star-forming region to Earth.\n\nCredit: ESA, HEXOS and the HIFI consortium\n\nBut beyond that, we still have some major, major unknowns where our level of\ncosmic ignorance is truly staggering. We know the ingredients that life\nrequires are ubiquitous everywhere we look: in asteroids, in gas in the\ngalactic center, in outflows around massive, newly forming stars, and even in\nthe atmospheres and on the surface of other planets and moons in our Solar\nSystem.\n\nBut even with all the raw ingredients, what is the fraction of potentially\ninhabited planets where life actually arose from non-life? In Carl Sagan\u2019s\noriginal Cosmos series, he gave a figure of 0.1 \u2014 10% \u2014 and asserted that this\nwas a conservative number.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nThat is not necessarily the case; life could be difficult. Just because it\narose early in the history of Earth doesn\u2019t mean that a significant fraction\nof planets actually have (or ever had) life on them. It could be nearly 100%,\nor 10%, or 1%, or 0.01%, or a one-in-a-million chance that life arises from\nnon-life. If we rewound the clock and started Earth over again, how likely is\nit that life would have arisen and thrived here? Our ignorance is astounding.\n\nThe Moon and clouds over the Pacific Ocean, as photographed by Frank Borman\nand James A. Lovell during the Gemini 7 mission. Despite the white appearance\nof the Moon, it actually absorbs much more light than it reflects.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nSimilarly, once life does arise, how often does it get wiped out, versus how\noften does it endure for many billions of years? How frequently does it remain\nin a relatively simple state, unable to develop complexity, differentiation,\nmulticellularity, or sexual (meiotic) reproduction? How often, even after\nbillions of years, does it actually begin to look like life on Earth at the\nstart of the Cambrian explosion?\n\nAgain, we have no knowledge at all about how this might work. If you estimated\nthat it occurred 10% of the time, that\u2019s reasonable. But so is 90% of the\ntime. So is 0.001% of the time. Without observational or experimental evidence\nto point us in the right direction, we\u2019re simply deluding ourselves if we make\na strong assertion.\n\nFurthermore, we know that after life on Earth became complex, differentiated,\nmulticellular, and sexually reproductive, it still took more than 500 million\nyears for a species to arise that would become technologically advanced, and\nthat was likely just the result of random chance. How often does that occur?\nDoes it make sense to represent this probability in percentages, or is this\nsuch a rare event that it\u2019s like winning the Powerball lottery five times in a\nrow? Furthermore, how long does that technologically sophisticated life\nendure? Does it ever become a multi-planet or even an interstellar\ncivilization, or is the progression from \u201ctechnologically advanced\u201d to\n\u201cextinct\u201d a relatively rapid one?\n\nAt this point, our uncertainties are so large that it\u2019s eminently reasonable\nthat not only might human beings be the only intelligent life in the Milky\nWay, but in the entire observable Universe, which likely contains more than a\ntrillion (1,000,000,000,000) times as many stars as our own galaxy.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve long envisioned a sustained human presence not only in space, but\nextending our civilization to other worlds and even other star systems or\ngalaxies, the sobering fact remains that this is all evidence-free\nspeculation. In all the Universe, it really may be just us.\n\nCredit: NASA/Alan Chinchar\n\nWe can confidently say, give or take, that there are perhaps 20 billion Earth-\nsized planets, made of similar elements to our own world, at the right\ndistance from their parent star to have liquid water on their surface,\nassuming an Earth-like atmosphere as well. But of those worlds, how many of\nthem have life? It could be most of them, many of them, or only a tiny\nfraction. Of the ones with life, how many of them develop complex,\ndifferentiated, intelligent, and technologically advanced life?\n\nBefore we even start asking questions about longevity, colonization, or\nmachine-based life, we should admit \u2014 with a non-negligible probability \u2014 the\nmost obvious resolution to the Fermi Paradox: The reason we haven\u2019t made first\ncontact with intelligent, technologically advanced, and spacefaring alien\ncivilizations is because there are none. In all the galaxy, and perhaps even\nin all the Universe, we really may be alone.\n\nWithout evidence to the contrary, we have every reason to keep looking and\nsearching, but still no reason other than our own preferences to believe that\nother creatures, similar to humans, exist out there. While it may be\nincredibly fun to theorize a myriad of possible explanations as to why\nintelligent extraterrestrials might remain hidden from us, the simplest\npossibility \u2014 that they just aren\u2019t out there \u2014 should be the default\nhypothesis until proven otherwise.\n\nEthan is on medical leave until May 6th.
