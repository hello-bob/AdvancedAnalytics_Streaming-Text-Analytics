As such, it\u2019s worth a look to see what lessons we can learn. For those\nwho weren\u2019t paying attention, reports generally seem to agree that Iran (and\nits proxies in Yemen) launched about 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and\n110-120 ballistic missiles. And to be clear, 300+ missiles (some sources are\nsaying 350, probably with the balance made up by more drones) is a lot. For\ncomparison, during the first Gulf War, the United States launched 288\nTomahawks. Obviously, that was in the context of a much larger air campaign,\nbut this was clearly more than just lobbing a few missiles as harassment.\n\nBut the attack was a complete failure, with the net result reported of two\nIsraeli airbases damaged (not clear exactly how much) and a single girl left\nin critical condition by falling debris. Some of this was because about half\nof the Iranian ballistic missiles failed during launch and crashed short of\nthe target^1 but most of it was a superb performance by Israeli and American\nABM systems, and the rapid work of an impromptu coalition of basically\neveryone who wasn\u2019t Iran in the region to deal with the atmospheric threat.\n\nFocusing first on the ballistic missile aspects, I want to say that I was\nright about the capability of modern ABM systems, and if anything\nunderestimated how well they would handle a large-scale attack. Most of the\nmissiles seem to have been handled by the Israeli Arrow 3 and David\u2019s Sling\nsystems,^2 but USS Arleigh Burke and USS Carney, operating in the\nMediterranean, are credited with getting a few of them, too, and they provide\nus with our best window into the performance of ABM systems. Four to seven\nSM-3s were launched, downing four to six ballistic missiles. CENTCOM is\nclaiming the total is six, which in turn would imply that it\u2019s likely 7 SM-3s\nwere launched, for an 85% hit rate in its first combat test, although even the\n57% resulting from worst-case numbers is still quite good. Critics of ABM also\nfrequently claim that while the system may work when faced with one or two\ntest missiles, it will be overwhelmed by an actual attack, and it\u2019s worth\npointing out that whatever the threshold is, it\u2019s clearly somewhere north of\n50.^3 As it was, we have reports that 4 missiles got through near one Israeli\nairbase, and none hit anything critical. It\u2019s unclear if this was luck or an\nextension of the long-standing practice with Iron Dome of ignoring inbound\nweapons that will land in unpopulated areas.\n\nAs for the atmospheric efforts, the interesting thing here was the formation\nof an impromptu coalition to defeat the attack, containing not only Israel\u2019s\ntraditional allies like the US and UK, but also traditional enemies among the\nArab states. Early warning reportedly came from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who\nIran gave advance notice about the attack to, and who passed said notice onto\nthe US, giving it time to prepare for the attack. Later, it was their radars\nwhich picked up the launch of the Iranian drones, information that allowed the\nUS-led plan to swing into action. The Iranians apparently attempted a\ncoordinated attack, with all of the weapons arriving at the same time, but\nthis meant the slow drones gave everyone several hours of notice, including\nthose watching at home.\n\nThe vast majority of the drones and cruise missiles^4 were shot down by the\ncombined efforts of the Israeli Air Force, the USAF, the RAF and the Royal\nJordanian Air Force. The USAF contingent, Strike Eagles flying from an unknown\nbase in the Middle East, is credited by CENTCOM with 80 drones^5 while the\nJordanians reportedly shot down 20% or so of the attack in defense of their\nown airspace. The RAF contributed an unknown number of Typhoons flying from\nRAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, but the lion\u2019s share had to be done by the IAF\u2019s own\nfighters, a mix of Eagles, F-16s and F-35s. France also participated in an\nunclear capacity, most likely shooting down Yemen-launched drones and/or\nmissiles with ships in the Red Sea.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the attack has led a number of people from Joe Biden on\ndown to suggest that Israel shouldn\u2019t retaliate, a position I find rather\nsilly given the scale of the attack. And it appears that Israel isn\u2019t going to\ntake that approach, having launched an attack of some sort on targets near the\nIranian city of Isfahan. The Iranians are claiming it was a drone attack that\nwas successfully countered, but it looks more likely that the drones were for\npost-attack surveillance and the actual attack was carried out by air-launched\nballistic missiles, with unclear results. All sources seem to agree that it\nwasn\u2019t targeted at the Iranian nuclear facilities around Isfahan, and it\nappears to have attacked one of Iran\u2019s four S-300 SAM batteries. This pretty\nmuch confirms the theory that this strike was intended to reassure the Israeli\npeople that they have done something and remind the Iranians that their\ndefenses won\u2019t handle an Israeli attack nearly as well without pushing them\ninto continuing escalation. In all honestly, they probably handled it better\nthan I would, as my first reaction was that we should take away Iran\u2019s navy.\nTo be fair, I\u2019m still not sure that would be a bad policy for the US, given\nIran\u2019s continuing provocations.\n\n1 A significant part of why US weapons are so expensive is because we make\nvery sure this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen. \u21d1\n\n2 It\u2019s worth noting that the US and Israel have been working together on\nmissile defense for decades, and both systems are coproduced by American\ncompanies, so their performance speaks to the capability of US BMD as well. \u21d1\n\n3 A US Army Patriot battery near Erbil, in northern Iraq, is also credited\nwith one of the ballistic missiles, but I strongly suspect this was one of the\nballistic missiles that failed on launch. Erbil is close to the Iranian\nborder, and it\u2019s unlikely Patriot, which is a fairly short-ranged missile,\nwould have the energy to chase down a ballistic missile bound for Israel. \u21d1\n\n4 I have argued against this distinction before, but some recent work in\nCommand has convinced me that while there may be no philosophical distinction\nbetween the two types, there is in fact a significant practical distinction\nbetween a weapon that travels at ~100 kts and one that does 400+ kts, and it\nmakes sense to talk about them separately. \u21d1\n\n5 This is almost twice as many air-to-air kills as the US has managed since\nthe end of Vietnam, although one could make the argument that drones don\u2019t\ncount, as I\u2019m sure the USN is doing right now. \u21d1\n\n  * by bean\n  * 0 comment(s)\n\n### Comments from SlateStarCodex:\n\nSearch\n\n  *     * login\n\nUseful Posts\n\n    * About\n    * Topical Index\n    * Top Posts\n    * Virtual Meetups\n    * Discord\n    * SSC Naval Gazing Posts\n    * Bibliography\n    * Link Index\n\nRecent Comments\n\n    * I like all the apologizing about the confidently asserted garbage when you ask \u201d...\n    * megasilverfist:...\n    * Given that Iran is increasingly Islamic in name only I wonder what it would to t...\n    * Iran could be just as useful an ally for the US/west as Israel, possibly even mo...\n    * John Schilling:...\n    * In 1990 the UK was considering replacing the aging (and recently discovered corr...\n    * wan casino http://methodcasino.com...\n    * We definitely want trade with Israel, we want technology transfer with Israel, a...\n    * Hmm.
