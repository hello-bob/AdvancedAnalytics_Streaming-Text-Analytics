I deleted it, just to be frustrated when the folder reappeared on its\nown.\n\nAdding a new folder to the Home directory is a Cardinal Sin of Mac\nProgramming, so I was on a mission to root out the cause. After some searching\nonline, it seems that this folder was generated by Logi Options+, the software\nthat came with my mouse, the Logitech MX Master 3S.^1\n\nVersion 1.70 of Logi Options+ launched last week with \u2014 I kid you not \u2014 AI\ntools you can launch anywhere your cursor is located:\n\n> In today\u2019s fast-paced, technology-enabled world, everyone is learning to\n> work differently with breakthroughs in Generative AI.\n>\n> Mastering prompt building enhances your efficiency and creativity. That\u2019s\n> why we developed the Logi AI Prompt Builder, a time and click-saving\n> solution. Rephrase, summarize, and create custom-made prompt recipes with\n> ChatGPT faster, with virtually no disruption to your workflow.\n\nI cannot tell how little I want THE SOFTWARE FOR MY MOUSE to include features\ntied to ChatGPT ... let alone a mouse with a built-in button to start a\nprompt.\n\nThese features are spun up into their own process named \u201cLogi Al Prompt\nBuilder\u201d as you can see here:\n\nBest I can tell, there\u2019s no way to disable these features, and they are\nautomatically loaded with the Logi Options+ software is running. Some people\nhave suggested running the \u201cOffline\u201d version of Options+ to avoid these\nfeatures.\n\nUpdate: You can also jump through these hoops to disable the AI features in\nthe regular versions of Options+.\n\nThat seems to have done it for me, but only after I nuked everything Logitech\noff my system, including a 700 MB support folder buried in my Home folder.\n(Thanks, Hazel!)\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need Logitech software to use a Logitech mouse once the\ninitial settings are in place. For future tinkering, I\u2019ve decided to check out\nSteerMouse and keep Logitech software off of my system.\n\nAs you can see, it can be used to adjust parameters on my MX Master 3S just\nfine, without any AI-powered bloatware:\n\nI know AI is all the rage right now and having a deal to bring ChatGPT into\nyour software is trendy, but including a tool like this in what is basically a\nmouse driver is ridiculous. I\u2019m not opposed to using AI in software. I\u2019m just\nopposed to when it shows up as an unexpected, poorly-implemented feature in\nsoftware that doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nAt least Logitech\u2019s Mac developers did such a bad job with it, that it was\neasy to spot.\n\n  1.
