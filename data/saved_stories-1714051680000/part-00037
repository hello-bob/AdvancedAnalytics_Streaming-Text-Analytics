The product is\nready when the product owner says it is. But before starting a project, most\nmanagers want at a least budget. So the product owner puts together his wish\nlist and asks the ScrumMaster what it will cost to build. The answer comes\nback \u2013 usually a long time and whole lot of money! Then the customer turns\npale as he tries to decide what it will really cost, whether he can afford it\nand whether it\u2019s worth it.\n\nBut there is a better way: the product owner can perform a double worst case\nanalysis. This quick and easy tool uses the project\u2019s business value to\ndetermine a reasonable price for the software investment.\n\nScenario: You are the product owner. Your company, Congo Lomerate Corporation,\nplans to automate its internal operation by developing a tool for its staff,\n\u201cTurboCongo.\u201d Over the next 5 years, TurboCongo should produce cost savings\nand additional revenue of \u20ac10 Million. You have developed a list of User\nStories and given it to your team. Their response: \u201cYes, we can do it!\nIncluding support it will cost \u20ac2.6 Million.\u201d Is that a good investment?\n\nThe fundamental financial project risks are 1) the benefit will be less than\nanticipated or 2) the costs will be higher than anticipated. A significant\ndelay in the project increases the cost and probably reduces the benefit. Even\nif both occur, the investment in the project should still be more attractive\nthan putting the money in a savings account.\n\n###\n\nDetermine Business Benefits\n\nA product has features for the users, but it should accomplish business goals\nfor the company, for example: increase productivity by X%, increase market\nshare to Y%, or create a community with 100\u2019000 active users, etc. Each of\nthese factors can be converted into a monetary equivalent. For instance,\nincreasing productivity implies doing more business or saving on labor costs.\nEven members of a community site with no revenue have a value.\n\nSum the value of all benefits over your planning horizon, typically 3 to 5\nyears. The examples use five years, but you can edit the spreadsheet and\nexperiment with other values.\n\n###\n\nDouble Worst Case Analysis\n\nCombining the two possible worst cases gives the double worst case. Less\nbenefit, higher costs. Worst case number one: the project is more expensive\nthan planned. Let\u2019s assume twice as expensive. If you\u2019re using Scrum or Agile,\nthis is may seem very conservative but is actually quite common (I\u2019ve had to\nclean up after worse!). Worst case number two: the benefit is less than\nplanned. Let\u2019s assume half the hoped for benefit. Your management may or may\nnot consider this conservative. In any case, you can adjust these factors as\nappropriate.\n\nROI (return on investment) is simply the profitability of an investment:\n\n  * Profit = Total Benefits - Total Costs ROI = Profit / Total Costs / Time Horizon\n\nFrom our case above (figures in thousands):\n\n  * Total Benefit = 2,000 per Year for 5 years = 10,000\n\n  * Total Cost = 2,600\n\n  * Profit = 10,000 - 2,600 = 7,400\n\n  * ROI = 7,400 / 2,600/ 5 = 57% / year\n\nThis looks good, but what happens if the project goes badly? Assume half the\nbenefit and twice the costs. Now the project is losing money. Even if the\nresult were slightly positive, there are much safer investments which produce\nthe same return. So a budget of \u20ac 2.6 Million is surely too high, unless you\ncan lower the risks of the project. (Hint: use Scrum and release early to\nstart achieving benefits as soon as possible).\n\n###\n\nDevelopment Budget\n\nThe target cost will depend on the time horizon and the minimum acceptable\nROI. I would suggest 15%, but pick a number you are comfortable with.\n\nIf the expected average yearly benefit is 100, then a target cost of 72 will\nmean the project has an ROI of 15%, even if cost and benefit calculations are\nboth wrong by a factor of two.\n\nThe target cost will need to be apportioned to development and operational\ncosts. Using the rule of thumb that yearly operational costs (including\nsupport) are 1/3 of the initial development cost, the total cost over 5 years\nequals (1 + 4/3) times development costs. The target development costs are\nestimated to be 3/7ths or 43% of the total costs.\n\n###\n\nHow much may it cost?\n\nWhat about Congo Lomerate? What is a reasonable budget for the initial cost of\ndeveloping TurboCongo?\n\nFor the budget planning, total costs should not exceed 72% of \u20ac2 Million, or\n1.44, Million, of which 620\u2019000 are development costs and 824\u2019000 are support\ncosts spread over the following four years. Even if the total benefit is half\nthat and the cost double, the project will still be profitable for the\ncompany.\n\n###\n\nWhen to Use Double Worst Case Analysis\n\nDouble Worst Case Analysis identifies a reasonable cost for a software\ndevelopment project, based on the expected benefits and reasonable risks. As\nProduct Owner, you have a clear of idea of what your project is worth and have\na basis to negotiate prices and scope with you suppliers. You have a tool to\nassure not just the functional success of the project, but a financial success\nfor your company as well.\n\n### Subscribe to Dev\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Dev Sohor \u00b7 Launched 2 hours ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\n1 Like\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Big Development Project: How much should it cost?\n\ndevsohor.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dev Sohor\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
