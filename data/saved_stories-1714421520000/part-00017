Roads and some homes near the Fowl River were submerged.\n\nBut this was no ordinary flood.\n\nBy Chris Mooney,\n\nJohn Muyskens,\n\nKevin Crowe and\n\nBrianna Sacks\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 6:00 a.m.\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nTHEODORE, Ala.\n\nJohn Corideo drove the solitary two-lane highways of southern Alabama, eyeing\nthe roadside ditches. It had been raining off and on for days and Corideo,\nchief of the Fowl River Fire District, knew that if it continued, his\ndepartment could be outmatched by floodwaters.\n\nIt kept raining. Water filled the ditches and climbed over roads, swallowing\nparts of a main highway. About 10 residents who needed to be rescued were\nbrought back to the station in firetrucks. More remained stranded in\nfloodwaters, out of the department\u2019s reach. \u201cThat week ... we just caught\nhell,\u201d Corideo said.\n\nWhat the residents and rescuers of the Fowl River region faced on that day was\npart of a dangerous phenomenon reshaping the southern United States: Rapidly\nrising seas are combining with storms to generate epic floods, threatening\nlives, property and livelihoods.\n\nIn the Fowl River\u2019s case, unusually high tides slowed floodwaters as they went\ndownstream to drain. This increased the water\u2019s depth and flooded a wide\nexpanse \u2014 even several miles upstream. The result was deluged roads, washed\nout cars and damaged houses from a flood that was larger, deeper and longer-\nlasting due to rising seas.\n\nThese supercharged floods are one of the most pernicious impacts of an\nunexpected surge in sea levels across the U.S. Gulf and southeast coasts \u2014\nwith the ocean rising an average of 6 inches since 2010, one of the fastest\nsuch changes in the world, according to a Washington Post examination of how\nsea level rise is affecting the region.\n\nThe Post\u2019s analysis found that sea levels at a tide gauge near the Fowl River\nrose four times faster in 2010 to 2023 than over the previous four decades.\n\nChart showing sea level rise at Dauphin Island, Alabama. The chart shows the\nrate of sea level rise from 1980 to 2009 which was 0.1 inches per year, and\nthe rate from 2010 to 2023 which was 0.5 inches per year. The chart also\ncompares these rates to the overall rates in the Gulf of Mexico, which in the\nformer period were slower than and in the latter period were faster than the\nGulf.\n\nDauphin Island, Ala.\n\n6.7 inches\n\nsea level rise since 2010\n\n10 inches\n\n0.48 inches per year\n\n2010-2023\n\n5\n\n0.11 inches per year\n\n1967-2009\n\n0\n\nGULF OF MEXICO RATE\n\nAnnual mean\n\n-5\n\n1980\n\n2000\n\n2020\n\nDauphin Island, Ala.\n\n6.7 inches\n\nsea level rise since 2010\n\n10 inches\n\n0.48 inches per year\n\n2010-2023\n\n5\n\n0.11 inches per year\n\n1967-2009\n\n0\n\nGULF OF MEXICO RATE\n\nAnnual mean\n\n-5\n\n1980\n\n2000\n\n2020\n\nThe rapid burst of sea level rise has struck a region spanning from\nBrownsville, Tex., to Cape Hatteras, N.C., where coastal counties are home to\n28 million people. Outdated infrastructure built to manage water, some of it\nover a century old, cannot keep up. As a result, the seas are swallowing\ncoastal land, damaging property, submerging septic tanks and making key roads\nincreasingly impassable.\n\n\u201cOur canary in the coal mine for sea level rise is storm water flooding,\u201d said\nRenee Collini, director of the Community Resilience Center at the Water\nInstitute. \u201cEach inch up of sea level rise reduces the effectiveness of our\nstorm water to drain and the only place left for it to go is into our roads,\nyards, homes and businesses.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo explore sea level rise in the region, The Post analyzed trends at federal\ntide gauges and drew on satellite data to compare the Gulf of Mexico with the\nrest of the globe. The Post also worked with Bret Webb, a coastal engineer at\nthe University of South Alabama, to closely study the 2023 flood in the Fowl\nRiver region. A sophisticated river simulation Webb produced showed how higher\nseas would have turbocharged the flood, making it worse \u2014 with deeper waters\ncovering a larger area for a longer time \u2014 than if the same event had occurred\nin an era of lower seas.\n\nThese analyses showed how much the ocean is rising and how it\u2019s affecting\nflooding across this region, a preview of what other parts of the United\nStates and the world that are affected by sea level rise will face in coming\ndecades.\n\n##### Key findings\n\n  * The ocean off the U.S. Gulf and Southern Atlantic coasts has, since 2010, risen at about triple the rate experienced during the previous 30 years. In just the Gulf of Mexico, sea levels rose at twice the global rate over the past 14 years.\n  * There are now more dangerous rain-driven and flash floods reported within 10 miles of the coast in the region. Their numbers increased by 42 percent from 2007 to 2022 \u2014 a total of 2,800 events, according to a Post analysis of National Weather Service data.\n  * The Fowl River flood was caused by intense but not record-breaking thunderstorms that collided with high tides, according to Webb\u2019s analysis. Working together, they caused the river to spill miles inland. The higher seas of today, compared with sea levels in 1967, would have increased the volume of the flood by nearly 10 percent of the river in its normal state, the analysis showed.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is driving an acceleration of sea level rise\nglobally, largely because of the faster melting of the globe\u2019s giant sheets of\nice. Scientists do not know for certain why this region is experiencing a\nsurge in sea levels beyond the global average, but one theory is that\nnaturally occurring ocean currents are moving ever-warmer ocean water deep\ninto the Gulf. This warm water expands and causes seas to rise. This comes on\ntop of sinking land, which has long exacerbated sea level rise in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved here in 2007, the rule of thumb was a foot per century,\u201d\nsaid Webb. \u201cWell, looking back now in the last 20 years, we\u2019ve gotten half of\nthat in a fifth of the time.\u201d\n\nPress Enter to skip to end of carousel\n\n### The Drowning South\n\nCarousel - $The Drowning South: use tab or arrows to navigate\n\nSeas are rising across the South faster than almost anywhere. The Post\nexplores what that means on the ground.\n\nPart 1\n\nThe new face of flooding\n\nPart 2\n\nWhere seas are rising at alarming speed\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe Fowl River region is a quiet inland expanse of flat spaces and pine\nforests filled with large riverfront homes, more modest dwellings and a few\nmobile home parks. The wealthier inhabitants live along the wider stretches of\nthe river and near the coast, and lower income residents generally populate\nrural areas upstream. The community is largely White, and the population\nswells in the summer, when people come to boat and fish in the river.\n\nThe Fowl River meanders to Mobile Bay through a low-lying region about 20\nmiles south of Mobile.\n\nThe events of June 19, multiple longtime residents said, were unlike anything\nthey have seen.\n\n(Fowl River Volunteer Fire Department)\n\nDebra Baber saw some of the worst flooding. When rescuers arrived, Baber stood\nthigh deep in the water and handed them three month-old puppies in a blue\nlaundry basket.\n\n(Sam St. John)\n\nSam St. John, a resident of Mobile, drove along flooded roads to secure his\nvacation home.\n\n(Kim Baxter Knight)\n\nKim Baxter Knight was shocked by how quickly water engulfed her cars.\n\nTo study how sea levels turbocharged the flood, Webb modeled a roughly six-\nsquare-mile area of the river and the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe rainfall on June 19 was dramatic, but not necessarily record-breaking. And\nthe tide at the end of the Fowl River barely qualified as a NOAA high tide\nflooding event. But it was the confluence of these factors, Webb said, that\nmade the flood extreme \u2014 and highlights a phenomenon that is growing in\nfrequency but has received little attention.\n\nScientists in the United States have mostly focused on this type of collision\nof precipitation and tides \u2014 known as compound events \u2014 with hurricanes, not\neveryday rain events. But more local deluges are now attracting growing\nscientific attention. Webb\u2019s analysis shows that the sea level acceleration\nsince 2010 was substantial enough to have an impact in the Fowl River flood \u2014\na finding that breaks new ground as scientists grapple with rising oceans.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### A deeper, wider flood\n\nTo simulate the flow of the river, Webb used modeling software designed by the\nfederal government.

Experts who\nreviewed Webb\u2019s analysis broadly agreed with its finding that today\u2019s sea\nlevels would have caused worse flooding. The main takeaway from the model,\nthey said, was that it showed the impact of sea level rise across the entire\nflooded area, rather than in specific locations.\n\nMost of the individual stories in this story nonetheless took place in areas\nnear the Fowl River where Webb\u2019s model shows sea level rise impacted flooding.\nIn some spots upstream, the model suggests its influence could emerge in the\nfuture.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Awash in water\n\nCorideo has worked in emergency response for nearly five decades. He was\ndispatched to Ground Zero on 9/11 while a firefighter in Mastic, N.Y. In 2005,\nhe came to the Gulf Coast with FEMA as part of the emergency response to\nHurricane Katrina, and stayed after meeting his wife.\n\nToday, Corideo responds to over 1,000 calls a year and operates his department\non a $120,000 budget, which pays his salary, fuel and operating costs. He\ndoesn\u2019t have the money to repair the ceiling of the engine bay where the\nfiretrucks park, from which streams of insulation dangle. Corideo\u2019s department\nmostly scrapes by for house fires, health calls and brushfires \u2014 but an\nextreme flash flood is another matter.\n\nJohn Corideo, fire chief of the Fowl River Volunteer Fire Department, stands\nin the department's dilapidated engine bay. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington\nPost)\n\nHe remembers being \u201cwet for most of the day\u201d on June 19. When he thought his\ntruck might get submerged he got out and waded. Floodwaters are often filled\nwith hazards such as submerged wood and snakes. In this case, T.John Mayhall\nof Servpro of Mobile County, a cleaning and restoration company, said the\nwaters were also \u201chighly contaminated\u201d due to runoff from agricultural land,\nchemicals and other substances.\n\nBut Corideo had no protective equipment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a poor little fire department,\u201d he said.\n\nCorideo had no boat, either, and needed to call in the Mobile Fire-Rescue\nDepartment, located about 20 miles to the north, to do the most harrowing\nwork. The department has a team trained in water rescues and used a drone to\nlocate stranded residents, said district chief J.P. Ballard, who led the\nresponse.\n\n\u201c[The water] was rushing in certain places. It presents its own kind of\nchallenges, you have got to have the right people and the right kind of gear\nto get into those places,\u201d Ballard said.\n\nTwo rescuers arrived at Debra Baber\u2019s house by boat around 6 p.m. They\nnavigated up to Baber\u2019s porch while a drone buzzed overhead, steering the boat\ncarefully between two vehicles with little more than their roofs visible.\n\nDebra Baber sits on the porch where she was rescued by boat during last year's\nflood. Baber owns property along the Fowl River that includes her home, a\nswimming hole and camping site. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe boat came \u201cright up here to this ramp,\u201d Baber said, gesturing outward from\nher deck. \u201cI got on it ... I said, man, I\u2019m going to have me a drink, for 6\nhours, I mean, I\u2019ve been panicking.\u201d\n\nThe Mobile Fire-Rescue Department was not the only outside assistance Corideo\nhad to call in \u2014 the nearby Theodore Dawes Fire Rescue department, Mobile\nCounty\u2019s Road and Bridge division and others had to help conduct rescues and\nkeep people off flooded roads.\n\nThe Post talked to 15 people who experienced the deluge. They boated across\nfields, streets and front yards located miles inland, drove across flooded\nroads and rescued neighbors\u2019 belongings that had floated downstream. Again and\nagain, residents said that the storm was extreme, even in a rainy and flood-\nprone region.\n\nKim Baxter Knight\u2019s house sits nearly 12 feet off the ground on stilts,\nseveral hundred feet from the river. It was \u201cunbelievable\u201d how quickly the\nrains swelled the river and submerged both her cars, ruining them, she said.\n\nKnight, who lives with her ailing 77-year-old father and 10 cats, didn\u2019t try\nto evacuate, but with how quickly the water moved, she didn\u2019t think she could\nhave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never flooded like that before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get flooded, but not like\nthat.\u201d\n\nWhile her insurance company covered her losses, Knight\u2019s monthly payment more\nthan doubled from $128 to $267.\n\nMobile County spent about $150,000 responding to the flood, including putting\nup barricades and removing objects like toys and yard furniture from drainage\nsystems, said Sharee Broussard, the county\u2019s director of public affairs and\ncommunity services. Road flooding was localized, she said, and the ground was\nheavily saturated from days of heavy rainfall.\n\n\u201cThe water rose quickly, and it receded quickly,\u201d Broussard said.\n\nMayhall\u2019s company responded to at least a dozen homes after the waters\nreceded. People had to treat or discard belongings or parts of their homes\nthat got wet. The cost to remediate a damaged house started around $12,000,\nMayhall said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no small, insignificant or mildly impactful situation for this,\nunless the water just barely made its entry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it actually came\ninto the home, it\u2019s going to create a significant impact.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Vanishing islands\n\nWhen it rains hard enough or there\u2019s a very high tide along the Fowl River,\nSam St. John\u2019s neighbor calls to let him know that his wharf has gone under.\nSt. John drives down from his main residence in Mobile to lift his boats and\nsecure his property.\n\nAnd over time, he said, it has become harder to find a dry road on his drive\ndown.\n\nSt. John drove by Baber\u2019s house late in the afternoon of June 19, and saw a\nwhite pickup with water nearly up to the steering wheel.

Back then, there was an island a\nlittle offshore from the land they owned, which the family called Monkey\nIsland. Trees and azaleas grew on it.\n\n\u201cThe kids used to, in order to be able to swim by themselves without their\nlife jacket, they had to swim from there out to that island,\u201d Henken said,\ngesturing from his boat as he motored downriver.\n\nMonkey Island has been swallowed by the river. Other submerged islands are\nmarked by white poles, which warn boats not to drive over their remnants.\n\nHenken spent nearly 40 years working for Chevron and started a side hustle in\nretirement: He and two of his brothers raise neighbors\u2019 lower \u201ccrabbing\u201d docks\n\u2014 where people would once sit and lure crabs with just a net and a chicken\nbone. The higher tides have gotten so bad that water covers these docks so\noften that they become slimy and corroded. It takes the brothers two days\u2019\nwork to lift each one.\n\nHenken also monitors the environment of the Fowl River by taking water samples\nat a calm tributary north of his home and is the host of \u201cAL-MB-86,\u201d the code\nfor a rain gauge in his yard that reports daily data as part of a volunteer\nobservers\u2019 network.\n\nHenken\u2019s station reported 10.94 inches of total precipitation on June 19 \u2014\nhigh, but not extraordinary for rainy Mobile County. If the reading is\ncorrect, it amounts to about a one in 25 year storm event, according to Webb.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### A worsening problem\n\nWebb\u2019s model suggests that events like the one in June will get worse as sea\nlevels increase. By 2050, rising seas would produce a flood 17 percent larger\nby volume than what would have occurred in 1967; by 2100, that increase would\nbe 44 percent.\n\nIt also illustrates how places farther upstream, which were marginally\naffected by sea levels but still flooded last year due to rainfall, may feel\nthe growing effects of the ocean in the coming decades. Heavy rains in many\nregions \u2014 including coastal Alabama \u2014 are also expected to get worse due to\nclimate change, exacerbating the potential for extreme events.\n\nBroussard said Mobile County is \u201cengaged in planning and implementation\u201d to\naddress the threat of sea level rise. The county \u201cworks within its purview to\nmitigate current issues and plan for the future,\u201d she said. For instance, it\nfunds the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program and helps implement its\nstrategies \u2014 which take climate change into account. Last year the county\napproved a coastal restoration project that will help protect a vital road,\nthe Dauphin Island Causeway, from flooding.\n\nAt this point, Mobile County is not seeing more road maintenance because of\nflooding, or worsening storm water effects that it can quantify, Broussard\nsaid.\n\nLast year\u2019s storm impacted much of Mobile County.\n\nDavid Rice, executive vice president of Master Boat Builders. (Jahi\nChikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nJust outside of Mobile, waters swamped an on-ramp to Interstate 10 from the\nMobile Causeway, lined with seafood restaurants. Along the coast at Bayou La\nBatre, two casino boats broke from their moorings and crashed into the\ndockside.\n\nMaster Boat Builders, a family-run business, has been in the same Coden Bayou\nspot for more than 40 years. The storm shattered a wooden bulkhead, took out\nelectrical equipment and caused part of the shipyard to go underwater, forcing\nthe company to stop work for the day, said David Rice, the company\u2019s executive\nvice president for corporate resources.\n\nMaster Boat Builders is one of the area\u2019s largest employers and just\nmanufactured the first electric tugboat in the United States, powered by at\nleast 1,100 batteries. The ship, the eWolf, was delivered to the Port of San\nDiego earlier this year and has just begun operations.\n\nRice said part of the shipyard now floods during major high tides, something\nthat never used to happen. When it does, the company moves workers out of that\nlocation and onto a different project until the seas relent. From his home on\nDauphin Island, Rice said he\u2019s seen the arrival of much higher tides.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think people think about it,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThey see it on TV\nand I think it\u2019s some kind of liberal hoax. But it\u2019s not. If you live on the\nwater, you\u2019re on the water, you can see that it\u2019s actually justified.\u201d\n\nShipbuilders construct tug boats at the mouth of Coden Bayou in Bayou La\nBatre, Ala.

This is adjusted for seasonal signals for ocean\ntemperature, currents and other marine and atmospheric variables.\n\nFor its analysis The Post relied on dozens of tide gauges along the coasts of\nthe United States, measurements which are affected both by the rising ocean\nand slow but persistent movement of land. It also took into account satellite\ndata for global sea level rise, which measures ocean heights independent of\nland movement.\n\nAnnual means for two time periods \u2014 1980 to 2009 and 2010 through 2023 \u2014 were\ncalculated. Only gauges which had at least eight months of data for a given\nyear and 70 percent of the years were used. Three gauges used in this analysis\nare not currently in service but had sufficient data for the 1980 to 2023 time\nperiod to include in the analysis.\n\nA linear regression model was applied to the annual means for each gauge to\ndetermine the trends for each time period and calculate an annual rate of\nrelative mean sea level rise. Because readings from tide gauges are also\ninfluenced by the rising or sinking of land, these findings are referred to as\nchanges in relative mean sea level.\n\nTo analyze changes in sea level around the globe, The Post used data based on\nsatellite altimetry readings produced by NOAA. Annual means were calculated\nfor 1993 through 2023 for the global data and for each ocean. The Post applied\na linear regression model estimating the annual rates of change in mean sea\nlevel for each ocean and the global average. The data from the satellite\naltimeters are measures of ocean height independent of any land movement, or\nabsolute means.\n\nScientists, including Jianjun Yin and S\u00f6nke Dangendorf, have studied regional\ntrends in sea level rise. The Post\u2019s analysis builds on this body of work and\ncompares trends for the 2010-2023 and 1980-2009 time periods to drive home the\nrate of acceleration in recent years. The Post also presents the trends for\neach tide gauge included.\n\n###### Flood events\n\nTo examine trends in reported flood events along the Gulf and Southeast\nAtlantic Coasts of the United States, The Post relied on the Storm Events\nDatabase compiled by the National Weather Service and maintained by the\nNational Centers for Environmental Information. After consulting with data\nexperts from the NWS and NCEI, The Post used the events data from 2007 to 2022\nsince reporting and data maintenance practices had been standardized by late\n2006.\n\nThe Post examined and geolocated all events classified as \u201cflood\u201d or \u201cflash\nflood\u201d for eight states: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,\nGeorgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, removing events related to\nhurricanes and tropical storms. A shoreline shapefile from NOAA was used to\ncalculate the distance to the coast for each event, focusing on events within\n10 miles of the coast for the analysis.\n\n###### The simulation of the Fowl River flood\n\nFor the simulation of the Fowl River flood, The Post worked with an outside\nexpert, Bret Webb. He assembled key data elements around elevation and tide\nlevels from the two closest federal tide gauges.\n\nWebb fed the elevation data to the Sedimentation and River Hydraulics \u2014 Two-\nDimensional model (SRH-2D model), a hydraulic model developed at the U.S.\nBureau of Reclamation. Webb used the Surface-water Modeling System (SMS)\nsoftware to deploy the model.\n\nReporters from the Post also provided Webb with locations and details about\nhow high the water was, which was used to tune the model.\n\nWebb developed six scenarios to test the impacts of different sea levels on\nthe flood. The first is the baseline flood, using the data from June 18-21.\nThen, Webb changed the mean sea level variable at the mouth of the river to\nsimulate the extent of the flood based on lower ocean levels from 1967, 1990\nand 2010. Webb also projected sea levels forward to 2050 and 2100. For each\nscenario, the model produced time and spatially varying velocity (speed and\ndirection), water depth and water surface elevation for the duration of the\nsimulation.\n\nThe Post showed Webb\u2019s work to sea level rise experts who backed the analysis\nand findings. Reviewers included:\n\n  * Christopher Piecuch, a sea level scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n  * Thomas Wahl, an expert on compound events at the University of Central Florida\n  * Renee Collini, director of the Community Resilience Center at the Water Institute.\n\nThe reviewers generally described Webb\u2019s analysis as a thorough look at a\nsingle event, and said that it captured the likely role of sea level rise in\nmaking that event worse. They cautioned that while the research shows the\nbroad impact of sea level rise on rain driven flooding in the Fowl River\nevent, it is less reliable for inferring the exact flooding risk, or exact\nrole of sea level rise, in a specific location.\n\nClick here for a detailed explanation of Webb\u2019s work.\n\nChris MooneyChris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter covering climate\nchange, energy, and the environment.
