It\nincludes a set of technical specifications, standards, and policy guidance\nthat define a uniform approach for integrating current and emerging learning\ntechnologies into a learning services ecosystem. Within this ecosystem,\nmultiple services and learning opportunities (of various modalities and points\nof delivery) can be managed in an integrated, interoperable \u201cplug and play\u201d\nenvironment.\n\nOnce matured and implemented, the TLA will enable personalized, data-driven,\nand technology-enabled lifelong learning across the DoD, other Federal\nGovernment agencies, and beyond.\n\nThis video \u2013 \u201cOut-Learn, Out-Think, Win: Future Learning and Development\u201d \u2013\nshows the possibilities in future learning ecosystems, such as the TLA, as\nwell as potential for efficiencies in training and mission successes when the\nmanagement of our talent and learning are data-driven.\n\n### Rationale\n\nIn today\u2019s DoD, personnel must develop an ever-expanding set of sophisticated,\nagile knowledge and skills\u2014without significantly increasing time or costs for\neducation and training. Advances in learning science and technology,\nubiquitous access to the Internet on a growing variety of devices, and new\ncapabilities for data analytics are enabling new approaches for DoD education\nand training.\n\nMilitary Services and other DoD organizations have generally adopted a shared\nvision for a future learning ecosystem comprised of interconnected learning\nopportunities, supported by technology, driven by data, and integrated with\nother talent management capabilities.\n\nA servicemember or DoD worker progressing through their career will have\naccess to hundreds of formal and informal learning opportunities, tailored to\ntheir goals and based on their existing competencies. Teams can be assembled\nwith a specific skills mix, and managers will know exactly what additional\ntraining they may require to support a mission. Distributed learning courses,\ndevice-driven micro-learning activities, and traditional learning management\nsystems will be interoperable, using common data standards. Terabytes of\nlearner-related data will be distributed throughout this interconnected\necosystem, available for leaders to make data-driven decisions on investments\nand force structures to optimize readiness while minimizing costs.\n\nThis envisioned \u201ccontinuum of learning\u201d includes features such as the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Continuous: Career-long, continuous learning replaces the status quo\u2019s stovepipe, episodic learning\n  * Blended: Formal education and training, just-in-time support, and informal learning are integrated\n  * Enterprise Focused: Education, training, and talent management are considered in concert, holistically\n  * Diverse: Disparate learning technologies and methods are interoperable within a cohesive ecosystem\n  * Learner Centric: Learning adapts to individual and team needs, contexts, and characteristics\n  * Data Driven: Learner data from across many sources are aggregated and analyzed to drive decisions\n  * Competency Based: Competency frameworks support assessment and guide developmental trajectories\n  * On Demand: Modular education and training can be delivered at the point of need\n  * Cloud Based: Software services and network-based repositories support flexibility and discoverability\n\n### TLA Focus Areas\n\nConcerted development of TLA components largely began in 2016 and culminated\nwith empirical testing in 2017. Throughout the development process, the ADL\nInitiative adopted a multiyear \u201cspiral\u201d design-based research approach. In\n2019 the focus was on development and refinement of the formal requirements,\nspecifications, and architectural design. The TLA design is now aligned with\nmodern education and training architectures favored by its stakeholders, with\na streaming data architecture emphasizing the articulation of content\nmetadata, persistent learner profiles, and competency data definitions. The\napproach builds a foundation for future capabilities that will leverage\nadaptive artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms.\n\nMultiple TLA components are now being tested and validated in collaboration\nwith various DoD organizations:\n\n#### Data Strategy Standards Development\n\nThe TLA data strategy provides a common set of goals and objectives across\nDoD\u2019s education and training community to ensure data are used effectively.\nCommon data standards, business rules, governance rules, and policies are the\nTLA ingredients required for the interoperability of DoD education and\ntraining systems. This interoperability will ensure that all data resources\ncan be used, shared, and moved efficiently across multiple DoD organizations.\n\nData standards must be broadly accepted throughout the user and developer\ncommunities. The ADL Initiative is working with the Institute of Electrical\nand Electronics Engineers (IEEE), an internationally recognized standards-\ndevelopment organization, to formally establish the data standards required\nfor successful TLA implementation:\n\n  * IEEE P9274.1 Experience API (xAPI) 2.0 \u2013 Learning activity tracking uses the xAPI to capture learning activity streams. The xAPI standard also includes xAPI Profiles such as cmi5 and the TLA\u2019s Master Object Model (MOM). xAPI 2.0 is targeted for approval in 2020.\n  * IEEE 1484.12.1 Learner Object Metadata 2.0 \u2013 Descriptions of learning activities and their associated content are stored in the TLA\u2019s Experience Index and use a modified version of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative standard. A draft standard is being submitted for finalization in early 2020.\n  * IEEE 1484.20.3 Sharable Competency Definitions \u2013 The definition of a competency, the relationship to other competencies, and the alignment of evidence to help measure proficiency of the competency, are included in this standard. This standard is expected for approval in 2022.\n  * IEEE 2997 Enterprise Learning Record \u2013 Learner profile standards do not currently meet all TLA requirements. These new standards are actively being developed and modified based on input from numerous industry groups and associations.\n\n#### TLA DevSecOps Pipeline\n\nBridging the research-to-practice divide has been a challenge for distributed\nlearning technologies. Transitioning R&D efforts into operational systems is\nhampered by resource constraints, security concerns, and inconsistent\napproaches to test and evaluation. The ADL Initiative\u2019s DevSecOps pipeline\ntakes an idea or concept, matures it into a capability, transitions it through\nInformation Assurance protocols, and houses it using containers so that it\u2019s\neasy to install and configure.\n\nAt the end of this development pipeline is the Learning Technology Warehouse\nportal. This is a secure, cloud-based repository where DoD and Federal\nGovernment education and training stakeholders can acquire distributed\nlearning tools and technologies for testing and evaluation. This portal\nprovides front-end services, secure authentication, enhanced workflow to aid\ntransitioning of tools, and support resources for testing activities.\n\n#### TLA Reference Implementation (Prototype)\n\nThe TLA Reference Implementation is a process for investigating specifications\nand standards to determine their applicability and suitability for the future\nlearning ecosystem. While existing specifications and standards are considered\na starting point for the development of the TLA, the ADL Initiative is\ninvestigating additional specifications and standards for continued\ninteroperability as new technologies are developed. Within the TLA Reference\nImplementation, candidate standards and specifications are analyzed to\ndetermine whether they are partially or entirely appropriate for meeting the\nTLA\u2019s various data integration requirements. If changes are needed to extend\nthe specification/standard, this work is documented to inform future\nspecification/standard development bodies.\n\nThe 2020 TLA Reference Implementation work is centered around achieving the\nvision of learning with \u201cany device, anytime, anywhere.\u201d This requires\nunderstanding how devices are to be discovered, connected, secured,\nidentified, and instrumented to generate understandable learning data, while\nmaintaining the loosely coupled nature required of a true ecosystem. This\neffort includes completion of software for the testbed and the incorporation\nof cybersecurity, and network management for devices, generally prescribed in\nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) 800 series national\nstandards for computer security. \u201cAny device anywhere\u201d specifically suggests\nan approach called the \u201czero trust network,\u201d which ensures user identity and\nsystem security assuming no physical control over the origin or location of\nthe device.\n\n#### TLA Sandbox\n\nThe TLA Sandbox enables the testing, evaluation, and demonstration of next\ngeneration learning tools, technologies, and capabilities. Established in\ncollaboration with the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) USALearning, the\nTLA Sandbox provides a shared infrastructure for other Federal and DoD\norganizations to test and evaluate their modernization strategies and\nindividual components. It lowers the barrier to entry by enabling a shared DoD\nresources that emulates the operational systems in use today. The TLA Sandbox\nis available to support various modernization efforts across the DoD and other\nagencies with a range of complexity.\n\n#### Conformance Testing\n\nIn addition to the functional testing of tools within the TLA Sandbox, the\ndata products they produce must conform to a variety of specifications and\nstandards. This requires various methods of conformance testing, including for\nthe structure of learner records, xAPI Profiles, and other data. The ADL\nInitiative is developing a suite of conformance test products for this.\n\nOne example is conformance testing to ensure online learning content designed\nto Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM\u00ae) standards remains\nfunctional in a more interoperable environment than it was designed to\nsupport. The ADL Initiative developed the cmi5 specification to ensure SCORM\ncontent can be used in broader TLA-compliant environments, and a corresponding\ncmi5 Conformance Test Suite to ensure its compatibility.\n\n### Testing and Evaluation of TLA through Implementation\n\nDevelopment of the TLA includes a rigorous, independent efficiency and\neffectiveness assessment. A comprehensive assessment is comprised of the draft\nspecifications and associated reference implementation model, scoping test and\ndemonstration events, developing and executing the research assessment plans,\nand reporting findings (as appropriate) in conferences, technical reports, and\ntargeted academic journals. This project includes participation in ADL\nInitiative-sponsored committees and working groups, as well as other\nspecifications and standards working groups, to illustrate current and\nemerging capabilities and eventual contributions to DoD operations and the ADL\nInitiative mission.\n\nAs new learning approaches move from concept to practice, the TLA has become\nthe foundation for education and training modernization efforts by multiple\nDoD organizations.\n\n  * The ADL Initiative is placing an Air Force Learning Services Ecosystem (AFLSE) sandbox within the TLA sandbox to test and evaluate the interoperability of TLA components with ongoing Air Education and Training Command (AETC) efforts.\n  * The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is modernizing their learning infrastructure into a TLA-compliant ecosystem. The Sandbox in 2020 is expected to provide DHA with the computing infrastructure to test and evaluate their own TLA implementation. Beyond the shared computational resources, the lessons learned and operational experience from working together is expected to expedite the maturity of key TLA systems.\n  * The Army Futures Command, Combat Capabilities Development Center (CCDC) is leveraging the TLA Sandbox to support a combined effort that uses the TLA to inform the Army\u2019s Synthetic Training Environment (STE) and Army Training Information Systems (ATIS) programs.\n  * The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) is working with the ADL Initiative on a Talent Development Toolkit (TDT) for the DoD intelligence community (IC). This addresses the challenges for exchanging learner-related data among 17 different IC organizations.\n  * The Center for Development of Security Excellence, a component of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), is using the TLA Sandbox to expedite testing and evaluation of different approaches for enabling Federated Identity, Credentials, and Access Management (FICAM).\n\n### Projects\n\n#### Competency Based Learning / Competency and Skills System (CaSS)\n\nThe CaSS project focuses on the research, design, and development of services\nthat enable competency frameworks to be leveraged within the TLA. The CaSS\nenables collection, processing, and incorporation of credentials and data\n(\u201cassertions\u201d) about an individual\u2019s competencies into accessible, sharable\nlearner profiles. CaSS will create an infrastructure enabling competencies,\ncompetency frameworks, and competency-based learner models to be managed and\naccessed independently of a learning management system, course, training\nprogram, or credential.\n\n#### Data Analytics and Visualizations Efficiently (DAVE)\n\nThe DAVE project explores the use of a novel assessment tool in the context of\nthe TLA, which helps inform the maturation of the \u201clearning ecosystem\u201d concept\nby generating unique learner data. DAVE extends xAPI within the TLA by\ndeveloping models, prototypes, and specifications for analyzing, interpreting,\nand visualizing data.\n\n#### DATASIM\n\nDATASIM is an open source application that will provide a valid means of\nproducing the datasets necessary to benchmark and stress test the TLA and\ndistributed learning acquisitions. Additionally, DATASIM can help learning\nscientists, Instructional System Designers, IT and technology acquisition, and\ndecision-making stakeholders to determine the effectiveness of xAPI data\ndesign and implementation across the TLA.\n\n#### Privacy Support for the Total Learning Architecture (PS4TLA)\n\nThe PS4TLA project investigates user-tailored privacy to support TLA users\u2019\nprivacy decisions. The user-tailored privacy methodology accounts for the high\nvariability and context-dependency of people\u2019s privacy decisions by creating a\npersonalized, context-dependent model of users\u2019 privacy preferences, and then\ntailors users\u2019 privacy settings to these modeled preferences.\n\n#### Fast Learning from Unlabeled Episodes for Next-generation Tailoring\n(FLUENT)\n\nFLUENT is an adaptive recommendation system that evaluates xAPI Statements\nwithin a Learning Record Store (LRS) to collect details about learning\ninteractions across different sequences of learning events. These \u201cLearning\nEpisodes\u201d include specific information about learning events, their\neffectiveness for different types of users, and the context of each learning\nevent (e.g., the string of learning events that preceded it). FLUENT provides\na platform to build on, and mature, the TLA by identifying, implementing, and\nevaluating candidate standards and specifications required to interoperate\nwith other TLA components.\n\n#### Talent Development Toolkit (TDT)\n\nThe TDT project was conducted within the Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary\nof Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&T)), in collaboration\nwith OUSD(I)\u2019s Human Capital Management Office. The project leverages the TLA\nto establish the policy, standards, and specifications for IC learning\necosystems. Engineering requirements and architectural designs were developed\nfor the TDT\u2019s data specifications (e.g., learner profiles) and core services\n(e.g., content management). It uses the general TLA framework to improve the\nquality of personnel readiness through optimized talent development, the\nquality of workforce planning through data analytics, and the long-term\nsustainability of learning systems by reducing dependency on single-vendor\nsolutions.\n\n#### Publications\n\nTLA Standards Digital Learning Acquisition Techniques Report Johnson, A.;\nMiller, S. 2023\n\nTLA Standards Digital Learning Acquisition Guidance Johnston, J.; Miller, S.\n2022\n\n2021 TLA Functional Requirements Document Smith, Brent; Johnson, Andy; Hayden,\nTrey; Tolk, Florian 2022\n\nADL DAU Sandbox Final Report Schatz, S., Ph.D.; Feemster, V.; Tompkins, J.\n2021\n\nTotal Learning Architecture (TLA) Data Pillars and their Applicability to\nAdaptive Instructional Systems Smith, Brent; Milham, Laura 2021\n\n2019 Total Learning Architecture Report Gordon, Jerry; Hayden, Trey; Johnson,\nAndy; Smith, Brent 2020\n\n2018 Total Learning Architecture Report Smith, Brent; Gordon, Jerry 2019\n\nTotal Learning Architecture: Moving Into the Future Smith; Gallagher; Schatz,\nS., Ph.D.; Vogel-Walcutt 2018, IITSEC\n\nRecommendation across Many Learning Systems to Optimize Teaching and Training\nNeville, K.J.; Folsom-Kovarik, J.T. 2018, AHFE, Applied Human Factors and\nErgonomics\n\nTotal Learning Architecture Development: A Design-Based Research Approach\nGallagher, P.S.; Folsom-Kovarik, J.T.; Schatz, S., Ph.D.; Barr, A.; Turkaly,\nS. 2017, IITSEC\n\nExploring Assessment Mechanisms in the Total Learning Architecture (TLA)\nGoodwin, G; Folsom-Kovarik, J.T.; Johsnon, A.; Schatz, S., Ph.D.; Sottilare,\nR. 2017, Chapter in Book - GIFT\n\nHumans as the Strong Link in Securing the Total Learning Architecture Maym\u00ed,\nF.; Woods, A.; Folsom-Kovarik, J. 2017, Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics,\nAHFE\n\nTotal Learning Architecture (TLA) Enables Next-generation Learning via Meta-\nadaptation Folsom-Kovarik, J.T.; Raybourn, E.M. 2016, IITSEC\n\n#### News\n\nThe Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative Continues to Support the Royal\nDefence College as they Advance their Learning System November 23, 2022\n\nTLA PlugFest to Help Government and Vendors Adopt New Learning Ecosystem\nInteroperability Standards May 12, 2022\n\nADL Initiative Returns to In-Person I/ITSEC 2021 November 22, 2021\n\nToward the Harmonization of Learning Activity Metadata May 28, 2021\n\nDAU and ADL Initiative Partner for Digital Learning Transformation February\n19, 2021\n\nBuilding the Infrastructure for DoD Digital Learning Modernization July 30,\n2020\n\nADL Initiative Update on Competency Based Learning July 16, 2020\n\nEducation and Training Modernization is a Key Part of DoD Healthcare\nRestructuring May 07, 2020\n\nTotal Learning Architecture (TLA) Sandbox January 20, 2020\n\nTLA Working Group Meets Face-to-Face at I/ITSEC 2019 December 27, 2019\n\n#### Webinars\n\nImpactful Specifications and Standards from the Total Learning Architecture\nMay 18, 2021 Learn More\n\nMeasuring and Assessing Human Readiness March 9, 2021 Learn More\n\nADL-DAU Sandbox: TLA and Competency-Based Learning Demonstration February 17, 2021 Learn More | Video\n\n#### Videos\n\nTotal Learning Architecture (TLA) Overview 2021\n\nFGDLA Webinar: Modernizing Learning\n\nOut-Learn, Out-Think, Win: Future Learning and Development\n\n#### Links\n\nTLA Quick-Start Services Definitions Guide\n\nTLA Open-Source Software on GitHub\n\nBack to top\n\n## Defense Human Resources Activity | Defense Support Services Center\n\n### JOIN THE INITIATIVE\n\nsupport@adlnet.gov\n\n", "frontpage": false}
