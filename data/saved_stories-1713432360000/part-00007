To make matters even more confusing,\nsometimes the fake experts even have very impressive credentials, and every\nonce in a while, the real, genuine experts are entirely self-taught.\n\nHere are 12 signs we look for in an expert to help us determine whether they\nare trustworthy.\n\n## 1\\. They have deep factual knowledge\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious: for most topics, a lot of factual knowledge is\nrequired before you can have genuine expertise. This means that a genuine\nexpert will have an impressive command of the relevant (non-debated) facts on\nthe topic of their expertise. Thankfully, it's a lot easier to tell if an\nexpert has a strong command of the non-debated facts than whether they are\ncorrect about more controversial claims.\n\n## 2\\. They communicate their confidence levels\n\nNot all knowledge is equally well-established. Even theories that are widely\naccepted enjoy different levels of support from the relevant evidence. When an\nexpert regularly pretends that all their claims are equally well-established,\nthey demonstrate they are willing to make you believe something is certain\nwhen it isn't.\n\nIt\u2019s a good sign that someone treats their subject with the nuance expected\nfrom genuine expertise, when they indicate how confident they are (e.g., \u201cIt's\nbeen shown in many high-quality studies that...\u201d, or \u201cMy best guess is...\u201d),\nand they explain limitations in the evidence they are using (e.g., \u201cthis is\nunfortunately based on just one study, but that is all that currently exists\u201d)\n\n## 3\\. They admit not knowing\n\nGenuine experts also sometimes say that they don\u2019t know the answer to a\nquestion, or that the answer is generally not known by anyone. This is\nimportant because every topic will have some unknowns, and no expert can know\neverything about a topic. Telling you when they don't know is a sign that,\nwhen they say they do know, they actually do know.\n\n## 4\\. They tell you to look at sources other than themselves\n\nThis might happen when an expert doesn\u2019t know the answer to a question, or\nwhen they want to help you go beyond the answer they can give you. Genuine\nexperts don't seek to be seen as a sole arbiter of knowledge or authority on a\ntopic (which can be an indication that ego, rather than truth-seeking, is a\nprimary motivation for them), but instead encourage you to look at resources\nother than the ones they have produced.\n\n## 5\\. They use logic and evidence\n\nAnyone can use rhetorical devices like emotional appeals, no matter how wrong\nthey are, but a well-reasoned argument that uses valid logic and strong\nevidence will tend to point toward truth. Or, put another way, using strong\nlogic and strong evidence is easier to do when you're right, whereas emotional\nappeals are no easier when you're right than when you're wrong.\n\n## 6\\. They cite high-quality evidence\n\nSome evidence is much more reliable than other evidence, and those who rely on\nthe less reliable kinds when the more reliable kinds exist probably aren't\ndoing the best job they can at figuring out the truth. For this reason,\ngenuine experts cite high-quality evidence when it exists (e.g., looking at\nmultiple randomized controlled trials for causal claims) rather than low-\nquality evidence (e.g., just talking about personal anecdotes), and when high-\nquality evidence doesn\u2019t exist, they cite the highest quality evidence that\ndoes exist.\n\n## 7\\. They acknowledge the consensus\n\nConsensus views among experts are more often correct than the idiosyncratic\nviews of just one or two experts. The consensus will not always be right, of\ncourse, but often it will be the best understanding we have available. That\u2019s\nwhy reliable experts are transparent about the degree to which their opinion\ndiffers from the majority of experts, provide reasoned explanations for any\ndeviations, and they are cautious not to present fringe theories as\nmainstream. This shows a deep engagement with the topic of their expertise and\nalso an adherence to ethical standards of honesty and accuracy in\ncommunication.\n\n## 8\\. They change their mind\n\nGenuine experts will change their minds about topics within their expertise in\nresponse to evidence and arguments. It\u2019s hard to become an expert in something\nwithout having been wrong from time-to-time.\n\nThat means that anyone claiming to be an expert who has never changed their\nmind probably has not found and corrected their mistakes. Relatedly, changing\none's mind in response to evidence is also a sign of the epistemic humility\nassociated with genuine expertise.\n\nOf course, if someone has a long history of being wrong, that is evidence\nagainst them being a genuine expert, not in favor of it. But, since everyone\nmakes some mistakes, if they make mistakes from time to time and then note\nthey were wrong and improve their beliefs, that is a sign that they are\nfollowing the evidence where it leads rather than continuing to believe what\nthey do regardless of the evidence.\n\n## 9\\. They Steelman\n\nWhen you \u2018straw man\u2019 an argument, you misrepresent or oversimplify someone\nelse's position to make it easier to attack or refute. Instead of dealing with\nthe actual argument, you replace it with a weaker version that distorts the\noriginal point, which you then argue against. The opposite of this is called\n\u2018steelmanning\u2019, and it involves presenting the strongest possible version of\nan argument you\u2019re objecting to, even if it's more robust than the one\noriginally presented. This approach aims to strengthen the opposing case in\norder to facilitate a more genuine and constructive debate.\n\nThe most reliable experts will accurately present the strongest arguments made\nby those that disagree with them while pointing out flaws in those arguments,\nrather than focusing on just weak arguments from the other side or just\nmocking the other side (including ad hominem attacks rather than focusing on\nthe substance of the claims of the other side). This is important because\nknocking down a weak argument from the other side of a debate does little to\nshow the other side is wrong; you have to refute the strongest claims of the\nother side to actually show they are wrong. Additionally, demonstrating a\nknowledge of the strongest arguments against your own position shows a deeper\nlevel of expertise than only understanding the opposing point of view at a\nsuperficial level.\n\n## 10\\. They clearly explain their reasons for believing\n\nThe philosopher Daniel Dennett has said: \u201cif I can\u2019t explain something I\u2019m\ndoing to a group of bright undergraduates, I don\u2019t really understand it\nmyself.\u201d This sentiment is echoed by philosopher John Searle, who said \u201cIn\ngeneral, I feel if you can't say it clearly you don't understand it yourself.\u201d\n\nWhen communicating with non-experts, genuine experts are often able to give\nclear, easy-to-follow (and, ideally, checkable) explanations for why they\nbelieve what they believe - without dumbing down the points. They avoid\nunnecessary jargon and technical language (which sounds smart but makes their\narguments very difficult for their audience to follow). Not every genuine\nexpert is able to do this, but the ability to do this well is a sign of\ngenuine expertise. This is important because an expert who cannot explain\ntheir ideas clearly will end up requiring you to believe them based on their\nauthority rather than engaging with the arguments themselves. And sometimes,\npeople claiming to be experts will hide behind technical expertise and jargon\nso that you won't notice that their arguments are actually weak.\n\n## 11\\. They have a track record\n\nSometimes genuine experts will have track records of predictions or successes\nthat you can check, and this provides direct evidence of their knowledge or\nskill. Unfortunately, this only applies to some fields, like chess masters,\nmartial experts who fight in tournaments, experts who make public predictions\nabout the economy or politics, etc.\n\n## 12\\. They use multiple lenses\n\nThe world is complex and multi-faceted, and any one simple theory is going to\nfail to explain a lot of what's really going on. For this reason, genuine\nexperts tend to look at problems from multiple frames and perspectives; they\ndon't act as though one way of looking at things solves all problems, or that\none solution works for all problems, or that one simple theory explains\neverything.\n\nSo the next time you hear claims from an alleged expert on a topic that is\nimportant to you, you may want to consider: how many of these signs of\nexpertise do they exhibit? You can use this checklist, considering if they:\n\n  1. have deep factual knowledge\n\n  2. communicate their confidence levels\n\n  3. admit not knowing\n\n  4. tell you to look at sources other than themselves\n\n  5. use logic and evidence\n\n  6. cite high-quality evidence\n\n  7. acknowledge the consensus\n\n  8. change their mind\n\n  9. steelman\n\n  10. clearly explain their reasons for believing\n\n  11. have a track record\n\n  12. use multiple lenses\n\nAnd if you\u2019re seeking to be an expert in something yourself, you may want to\nask yourself: \u201cto what extent do I exhibit these traits?\u201dBeing able to discern\ngenuine expertise from B.S. requires good judgment.
