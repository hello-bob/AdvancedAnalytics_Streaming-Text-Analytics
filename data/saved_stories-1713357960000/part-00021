China has agreed to curtail shipments of the chemicals used to\nmake fentanyl, the drug at the heart of the U.S. overdose epidemic.\n\nDoug Mills/AP\n\nInvestigators for a U.S. House committee released a report on Tuesday\ndetailing what they describe as new evidence the Chinese government is\ncontinuing to \"directly\" subsidize \"the manufacturing and export of illicit\nfentanyl.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Chinese officials encourage production of precursor\nchemicals by giving \"monetary grants and awards to companies openly\ntrafficking illicit fentanyl materials.\"\n\nSpecifically, researchers found companies making fentanyl precursors and\nanalogues could apply for state tax rebates and other financial benefits after\nexporting the product.\n\nStreet fentanyl has driven a devastating surge in fatal overdoses, killing\ntens of thousands of people in the U.S every year.\n\nThe Biden administration and drug policy experts say China is the primary\nsource of precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug gangs to manufacture the\npowerful street opioid.\n\nLast November, U.S. officials said their counterparts in China promised to\ncrack down on the illicit fentanyl industry.\n\n\"We're taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals\nand pill presses from China to the Western hemisphere,\" President Joe Biden\nsaid, following a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in California.\n\n\"It's going to save lives and I appreciate President Xi's commitment on this\nissue.\"\n\nBut five months after that announcement, a report produced by a bipartisan\nteam with the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,\nfound the tax rebates and other incentives appear to still be in place.\n\n### China's role in fentanyl production previously documented\n\nMany of the findings were known previously among drug policy experts. They\nappear to confirm reports that the Chinese government bureaucracy is aiding\nthe production and export of fentanyl-related substances.\n\nIn a 2019 book, Fentanyl, Inc., journalist Ben Westhoff wrote about \"a series\nof tax breaks, subsidies and other grants\" that benefit Chinese companies who\nproduce fentanyl analogues.\n\nAn NPR investigation in 2020 found a web of Chinese companies whose employees\nwere openly marketing fentanyl precursors and selling them to clients in\nMexico and the United States.\n\nHowever, despite U.S. diplomatic efforts to stem the production of precursors,\nChina has done very little to enforce international and domestic laws banning\nfentanyl production.\n\nAccording to the House report released Tuesday, Chinese officials appear to\nhave taken steps to conceal financial incentives linked to fentanyl, but\nfailed to end them.\n\nOne of the investigators told reporters it was clear companies were\ncontributing directly to the overdose crisis by leveraging benefits available\nthrough China's complex bureaucracy.\n\n\"The fact that these [precursor chemicals] are subsidized solely for export is\nwhat allows them to go through so cheaply,\" said the staffer, who spoke on\nbackground in order to outline details of the report ahead of a committee\nhearing today.\n\nInvestigators say they found evidence that many of the subsidized companies\nare marketing their products directly to illicit buyers in Mexico, using\ncrypto-currencies to help conceal transactions.\n\n\"Rather than investigating drug traffickers, [Chinese] security services have\nnot cooperated with U.S. law enforcement, and have even notified targets of\nU.S. investigations when they received requests for assistance,\" said the\nreport.\n\nNPR requested comment from the White House late Monday, but received no reply\nbefore press time.\n\nThe House report points to a number of possible motives for the Chinese\ngovernment allegedly aiding the production of illicit fentanyl.\n\n\"The fentanyl crisis has helped [Chinese Communist Party-linked] organized\ncriminal groups become the world's premier money launderers, enriched the\n[Chinese] chemical industry, and has had a devastating impact on Americans,\"\ninvestigators concluded.\n\nTuesday's committee hearing will include testimony about China's role in\nillicit fentanyl trafficking from former U.S. Attorney General William Barr,\nRay Donovan, a former Drug Enforcement Administration Official, and David\nLuckey, a drug policy expert with the RAND Corporation.\n\nWith more than 110,000 drug overdose deaths every year in the U.S., fentanyl\nhas become a major flashpoint in the 2024 presidential campaign. Staff-members\ninvolved in producing this latest report described the investigation as a bi-\npartisan effort.\n\n  * House of Represantatives\n  * fentanyl precursors\n  * fentanyl\n  * China\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 156 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
