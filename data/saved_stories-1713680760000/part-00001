Sorry, sorry. That isn\u2019t the freshest zinger to zing\nin the direction of this sprawling new Taylor Swift double album, but please\nknow that after funneling 19 of its 31 tracks through my headphones on Friday\nmorning, my phone died, as if by its own volition. Same for any hope I had\nthat the overall mood might improve in the third act of this two-hour hostage\nsituation, a despair made manifest once I located my charger and heard the\nlyric, \u201cMy friends used to play a game where we would pick a decade we wished\nwe could live in ... I\u2019d say the 1830s, but without all the racists.\u201d\n\nAs a 21st-century pop omnipresence, Swift remains mercilessly prolific and\nunwilling to edit for length, which makes this extended version of her new\nalbum, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,\u201d feel miserable and\nbottomless. The big surprise is how much of that misery is intentional. In\nconcussive contrast to the good times she\u2019s been having in the public eye \u2014\nhighest grossing concert tour in the history of the species; highest grossing\nconcert film to match; on-field kisses with her boyfriend after he won the\nSuper Bowl \u2014 Swift\u2019s new ballads are sour theater, fixated on memories of\nbeing wronged and stranded, sodden with lyrics that feel clunky, convoluted,\nsamey, purple and hacky. There are song titles that burn hot like distress\nflares (\u201cI Hate it Here\u201d), and lines that feel waxy with Freudian slippage (\u201cI\nknow I\u2019m just repeating myself\u201d), and a profusion of soft-edged, slow-moving\nmelodies \u2014 produced by Swift, Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner and Patrik Berger \u2014\nthat do her lyrics few favors. As she unloads every last item from her\ngrievance vault, it\u2019s hard for sentient listeners to not want to reciprocate.\n\nThat said, is this the album that finally grants us societal permission to say\nthat Swift is not a great lyricist? She can be, sometimes, but greatness isn\u2019t\na part-time job, and the thinning thinness of her words can make big emotions\nfeel hollow. Plus, the objects of affection that populate these midtempo\nreminiscences all sound like real creeps. \u201cAt dinner, you take my ring off my\nmiddle finger and put it on the one people put wedding rings on,\u201d sings the\nmost celebrated songwriter of her generation on her album\u2019s title track, \u201cand\nthat\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to my heart exploding.\u201d Oh man. In \u201cThe\nManuscript,\u201d she sings in the third person, describing a flame who once \u201csaid\nthat if the sex was half as good as the conversation was, soon they\u2019d be\npushing strollers.\u201d During \u201cI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),\u201d she gloms onto\nsome imaginary bad boy, describing how \u201chis hand, so calloused from his\npistol, softly traces hearts on my face\u201d \u2014 which must be pretty close to what\nyou get when you ask ChatGPT to compose a Lana Del Rey hook. Attempting to\nfurther signal her maturity, Swift deploys profanity with awkward\nrelentlessness across too many of these songs, sounding like a child test-\ndriving her illicit new vocabulary in hopes of convincing the greater populace\nthat she is, in fact, 34 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### The Style section\n\nStyle is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of\nculture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends,\npolitics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

Hey, why didn\u2019t I barf when that dude played his cringey ring\ngame? \u2014 but Swift almost always steps back into the shallow end, dulling her\nideas with reflexive clich\u00e9s. Lightning appears in bottles. Wrinkles appear in\ntime. Ships are abandoned or gone down with. Plans are best laid. Hearts are\ncold, cold. Scripts get flipped. Poisons get picked. To zest things up, she\nlikes tweaking certain words in rote figures of speech, or grafting them onto\nmore melodramatic phrases until a completed line begins to resemble cathartic\nteenager poetry. \u201cThey say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you aware,\u201d she sings\non \u201cCassandra,\u201d a piano ballad that vaguely surges in the direction of Tori\nAmos. (Stay that course, please.) \u201cOld habits die screaming,\u201d she sings while\nseething tidily during \u201cThe Black Dog.\u201d On \u201cLoml,\u201d she feels \u201cbetter safe than\nstarry-eyed,\u201d but eventually grieves \u201cour field of dreams engulfed in fire.\u201d\nOn \u201cHow Did It End,\u201d she flips the old playground matrimony ditty so that\nshe\u2019s \u201csitting in a tree, D-Y-I-N-G.\u201d\n\nEnough. These are highly embarrassing combinations of words made to serve an\neven more embarrassing narrative: the childish idea that the most famous\nsinger alive should be pitied for living alone atop her mountaintop of money,\nfeeling sad and aggrieved. We should all try our hardest to forget the\nmanipulative underdog posture that Swift refuses to forfeit with each passing\nalbum, especially when the genuine tragedy-like feeling to be gleaned from all\nof these songs \u2014 and from nearly every Swift song that came before, too \u2014 is\nthat Swift has traded her adulthood for superstardom.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been an anonymous human being since she was 17, and in terms of her\nart, many of her horizons seem to have stopped right there. It helps to\nexplain why at least three songs on this double album take place on\nplaygrounds; and why another one is set at a high school party (where the\nsexiest lyric of her career sounds like additional AI-generated Lana worship:\n\u201cYou know how to ball, I know Aristotle ... Touch me while your bros play\nGrand Theft Auto\u201d). It\u2019s probably why her songs rely so heavily on the make-\nbelieve concepts of destiny, and prophecy, and fate. She has not lived a\nnormal life. She doesn\u2019t make normal choices. Everything in her creative and\nprofessional world happens at epic heights that are difficult to comprehend\nand from which there is no coming down. Where are the songs about the profound\nsadness in all that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlso, who cares what I want? You are a middle-aged man, you\u2019re saying, This\nmusic is not for you. The first part is true. But I would argue that pop music\nis for everyone. You\u2019re here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m writing, you\u2019re reading, we\u2019re in\nthis listening life together, and it\u2019s probably just fine to wish that the\nmost widely circulated music of our lifetimes might be more imaginative and\nless self-obsessed. We\u2019re long overdue for a Swift album that feels even a\nlittle bit curious about the world she rules.\n\n  * Taylor Swift\u2019s new album leaked, but it was only half the story\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s new album leaked, but it was only half the story\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * Australian conductor Simone Young shoots for the stars with the NSO\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nAustralian conductor Simone Young shoots for the stars with the NSO\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * A guide to the Easter eggs and name-drops on Taylor Swift\u2019s new album\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nA guide to the Easter eggs and name-drops on Taylor Swift\u2019s new album\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTravel\n\nLocal guides, travel tips and the latest industry news\n\nAdvice|9 beach rules for not being the absolute worst\n\nAmsterdam blocks construction of new hotels to fight overtourism\n\nYou can still find affordable flights to Europe this summer\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
