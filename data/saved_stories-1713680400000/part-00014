Philip Ball explores the new biology,\nrevealing life to be a far richer, more ingenious affair than we had guessed.\nThere is no unique place to look for an answer to this question: life is a\nsystem of many levels\u2014genes, proteins, cells, tissues, and body modules such\nas the immune system and the nervous system\u2014each with its own rules and\nprinciples. In this talk, discover why some researchers believe that, thanks\nto incredible scientific advancements, we will be able to regenerate limbs and\norgans, and perhaps even create new life forms that evolution has never\nimagined. Philip Ball is a freelance writer and broadcaster, and was an editor\nat Nature for more than twenty years. He writes regularly in the scientific\nand popular media and has written many books on the interactions of the\nsciences, the arts, and wider culture, including 'H2O: A Biography of Water',\n'Bright Earth: The Invention of Colour', 'The Music Instinct', and 'Curiosity:\nHow Science Became Interested in Everything'. Philip's book 'Critical Mass'\nwon the 2005 Aventis Prize for Science Books. He is also a presenter of\nScience Stories, the BBC Radio 4 series on the history of science. He trained\nas a chemist at the University of Oxford and as a physicist at the University\nof Bristol. He is the author of 'The Modern Myths' and lives in London.
