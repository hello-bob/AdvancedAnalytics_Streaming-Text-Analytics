The tool is for\nmanaging administrative tasks, appointment scheduling, updating patient\nmedical records, and patient billing - one place to streamline all of the\npatient management. I have thousands of customers globally using this tool.\nHowever, I need to make sure that patient data is secure, compliant with HIPAA\nlaws, and only accessible to the applicable staff and doctors for that\nspecific customer. For example, a chiropractor\u2019s office in Los Angeles uses my\nSaaS tool, and a dermatologist office in New York is also a customer of mine.\nThese two healthcare providers should not be able to access each other\u2019s data,\nnor should they even know about each other. Each healthcare provider trusts my\nSaaS tool to manage their day-to-day operations efficiently. However, with\nsensitive patient data at stake, it's imperative to safeguard this information\nand ensure that it remains accessible only to authorized personnel within each\norganization. In order to do this, let's dig into the capabilities of VPCs in\norder to illustrate how you can safeguard patient privacy, maintain regulatory\ncompliance, and instill trust and confidence in your healthcare SaaS platform\namong both providers and patients.\n\n## Why using a VPC is better than a VPN or VLAN\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how we would secure our healthcare app. SaaS providers\ntypically operate multi-tenant environments where multiple customers share the\nsame underlying hardware. In the healthcare management example above, various\nhealthcare providers, ranging from small clinics to large medical facilities,\naccess the SaaS platform to streamline their administrative tasks, manage\nappointment schedules, and handle patient billing. While this shared model\noffers cost-efficiency and scalability benefits, it also introduces security\nchallenges, particularly concerning data isolation and access control.\n\nThere's a few options here for network security. Let\u2019s compare using a VPN,\nVLAN, and VPC with this architecture.\n\nIf we use a VPN for network security, we\u2019d be able to provide secure remote\naccess to healthcare resources. Whether it's accessing electronic health\nrecords (EHR), collaborating on patient care plans, or communicating with\ncolleagues, healthcare professionals can rely on VPNs to ensure\nconfidentiality and integrity in their interactions. However, VPNs extend the\norganization's network perimeter to external devices, including personal\nlaptops, tablets, and smartphones. While this enables seamless connectivity\nfor remote workers, it also introduces security risks associated with exposing\ninternal resources to external threats. To mitigate these risks, organizations\nmust implement robust security measures to protect VPN endpoints and safeguard\nsensitive data. This includes strong authentication, encryption, access\ncontrols, etc. Most of these will cost extra. And although VPNs can provide\nsecure remote access to the healthcare app, most of the time the app users\n(doctors, nurses, staff) will be in the office and not remote, so VPNs may not\nbe the best solution here.\n\nIf we use a VLAN, we can segment traffic based on departments or functional\ngroups. For example, you might allocate VLAN 10 for administrative staff and\nVLAN 20 for nurses, doctors, and physicians assistants. Administrative staff\nwould have access to patient billing and appointments, but not have access to\nmedications, and highly sensitive patient information. However, VLAN\narchitecture proves challenging when it comes to scaling. Adding new VLANs or\nexpanding existing ones may require additional switches, routers, and cabling,\nas well as careful planning to avoid network congestion and performance\nissues. As a result, scalability may be constrained. It\u2019s also harder to meet\ncompliance requirements when you use VLANs. Although you have this network\nsegmentation, you may not be able to address all aspects of GDPR compliance,\nlike data encryption, audit logging, or geographic restrictions. As a result,\nyou may struggle to demonstrate compliance to regulatory authorities or face\npotential penalties for non-compliance. In a healthcare environment, this just\nwon\u2019t work.\n\nIf we use a VPC, we\u2019d wrap each VM with a VPC. VPCs enable us to define custom\nnetworking configurations, implement access controls, and establish private\ncommunication channels, safeguarding sensitive healthcare data from\nunauthorized access and external threats. Within each VPC, we\u2019d add firewalls\nto control inbound and outbound traffic to our virtual machines and resources.\nFirewalls allow us to define and enforce granular security rules based on IP\naddresses, ports, and protocols, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized\naccess and cyber threats. This is a great way to ensure that doctors' offices\ndon\u2019t have access to each others\u2019 patient records and ensure compliance. By\ndeploying these applications within separate VPCs, we ensure that each\nenvironment remains isolated from the others. You also get encryption at rest.\n\nVPCs also enable SaaS providers to create isolated network environments for\neach customer or group of customers. Within their dedicated VPC, each\ncustomer's data and resources are logically separated from those of other\ntenants, ensuring that sensitive information remains segregated and protected\nfrom unauthorized access or interference.\n\nHere\u2019s how I would secure my healthcare app with VPCs: I would create a\ndedicated VPC for each healthcare provider, ensuring that their data and\nresources are logically separated from other tenants.\n\nThe chiropractor\u2019s office in Los Angeles has their own VPC, and the\ndermatologist in New York has their own VPC. Within each VPC, I would\nconfigure custom network settings, including subnets, tailored to the specific\nrequirements of the healthcare provider. This network isolation ensures that\npatient data remains segregated and protected from unauthorized access,\nthereby minimizing the risk of data breaches or privacy violations. Access to\npatient records, and sensitive healthcare information is restricted to\nauthorized personnel within that specific healthcare provider's organization,\nbased on predefined roles and permissions. That means that for my application,\na doctor\u2019s office in Los Angeles will not be able to see or access data from a\ndoctor\u2019s office in New York. They are two separate entities, two separate\ncustomers, each on their own VPC.\n\nVPCs also enable SaaS companies to have granular access controls. You can\ndefine security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and cloud\nfirewall rules to regulate inbound and outbound traffic. By enforcing strict\naccess policies within the VPC, SaaS providers can restrict access to customer\ndata and services based on predefined rules, mitigating the risk of\nunauthorized access or data breaches. In my healthcare app example, I could\nmake patient billing only accessible to office administrators, or vaccination\nrecords only accessible to parents or legal guardians. This adds another layer\nof security to my SaaS app.\n\n## Encryption and Compliance\n\nIn addition to network isolation and access control, SaaS providers must\nimplement encryption mechanisms within the VPC to protect data in transit and\nat rest. This additional layer of security ensures that sensitive information\nremains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized parties, thereby\nbolstering data privacy and compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nWhen data is transmitted between users and the SaaS platform, it traverses\nvarious network pathways, including public internet connections, which may be\nsusceptible to interception or eavesdropping by malicious actors. By\nencrypting data streams within the VPC, SaaS providers can render intercepted\ndata unreadable, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or\ndisclosure. This encryption process involves encoding the data using\ncryptographic algorithms, making it indecipherable to anyone without the\nappropriate decryption key.\n\nSimilarly, when data is stored within the SaaS platform's storage\ninfrastructure, it is vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches if\nadequate security measures are not in place. By encrypting storage volumes at\nrest within the instances of the VPC, SaaS providers can ensure that data\nremains protected even if physical storage devices are compromised. Encrypted\ndata stored within the VPC is unintelligible without the corresponding\ndecryption key, effectively safeguarding sensitive information from\nunauthorized disclosure or tampering.\n\nFor example, the customers using my healthcare SaaS app can rest easy knowing\ntheir patient information is encrypted. Within the VPC environment, sensitive\npatient data, such as current medications, billing information, and medical\nhistory, should be encrypted to ensure confidentiality and compliance with\nhealthcare regulations. Each piece of sensitive information is encrypted\nbefore transmission or storage, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and\nenhancing trust in the SaaS platform's security practices.\n\nThis proactive approach to security not only enhances data privacy and\ncompliance but also strengthens the overall integrity and trustworthiness of\nthe SaaS platform.\n\n## To VPC or not to VPC? That is the question.\n\nNow, let\u2019s compare this architecture to the same healthcare app not using a\nVPC. Data security instantly becomes more challenging. How would we ensure\nthat patient records from one doctor\u2019s office are not accessible by patient\nrecords from another doctor\u2019s office? We would have to rely heavily on\ntraditional security measures like firewalls and access control lists to\nprotect data. This approach could work when you\u2019re dealing with non-sensitive\ndata. However, because we\u2019re dealing with highly sensitive patient\ninformation, medical records, and billing information, this may prove\nchallenging. Also, data transmission over the public internet introduces risks\nlike interception and eavesdropping. Meeting stringent regulatory standards,\nsuch as HIPAA, becomes increasingly difficult in the absence of granular\ncontrol over network traffic. If you don\u2019t use a VPC, Compliance efforts may\nbe hindered by the lack of visibility and control inherent in traditional\narchitectures.\n\nIn contrast, SaaS applications, especially ones dealing with sensitive\ninformation, that use VPCs can benefit from a heightened level of security,\ncontrol, and compliance capabilities. From enhanced isolation and granular\ncontrol to advanced security measures and streamlined compliance efforts, the\nbenefits of leveraging a VPC are indisputable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVPCs play a crucial role in enhancing security and compliance for SaaS\nproviders and their customers. By leveraging VPCs to create isolated network\nenvironments, SaaS providers can safeguard customer data, enforce access\ncontrols, and demonstrate compliance with data privacy regulations. SaaS\nproviders can also utilize VPCs for security to deliver secure and reliable\nservices to customers worldwide.\n\n## More Resources\n\nConnect with the Akamai team and fellow users in the Akamai VPC discussion\ngroup dedicated to our VPC feature (click here to sign up if you\u2019re not a\nmember).\n\nYou can also check out our VPC documentation for more information and help\ngetting started.\n\nThanks for reading!
