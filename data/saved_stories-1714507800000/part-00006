US Pacific Fleet IG\n\nThe West Philippine Sea, a crucial maritime region, witnessed a surge in\ntensions as two Chinese warships were observed shadowing fleets from the\nUnited States, the Philippines, and France during recent maritime drills.\n\nAccording to reports from naval officials, the Chinese vessels have been\nclosely monitoring the movements of naval assets from the US, the Philippines,\nand France as they conducted 'joint exercises' in the WPS. These exercises,\nwhich also involved various types of naval vessels and aircraft, were aimed at\nenhancing interoperability and coordination among the allied forces.\n\nThe vessels, marked People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) warships with bow\nnumbers 793 and 167, were not engaging with the naval vessels but were\nfollowing closely, said Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Command\nspokesperson Capt. Ariel Coloma.\n\n## Maritime Conflict\n\nThe West Philippine Sea, which encompasses vital shipping lanes and is\nbelieved to contain significant oil and gas reserves, has been a flashpoint of\ntensions between China and its neighbouring countries, including the\nPhilippines and Vietnam.\n\nChina's expansive claims, based on its controversial 'nine-dash line map'\nfirst published in the 1940s, have been vigorously contested by other claimant\nstates and rejected by an international tribunal in 2016.\n\nThe map, which outlines China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, has\nbeen a source of contention as it overlaps with the exclusive economic zones\nof other countries.\n\nThese disputes, which involve issues such as the delimitation of maritime\nboundaries, the status of disputed features, and the exploitation of natural\nresources, have been a source of tension in the region for years.\n\nNaval exercises and patrols by the US, the Philippines, and other regional\nallies promote maritime security, enhance interoperability among allied\nforces, and deter aggressive actions by external actors.\n\nHowever, China's persistent presence and surveillance activities in the WPS\ncontinue to challenge these efforts and raise concerns about the risk of\n'miscalculation or confrontation.' This refers to the potential for accidental\nclashes or escalations of tensions that could lead to a military conflict.\n\nTensions between China and the Philippines date back to 2012 when the PH Navy\narrested two Chinese fishermen at the Scarborough Shoal.\n\nHowever, Chinese maritime surveillance vessels intervened; this resulted in\nmonths of diplomatic back and forth until the two nations decided to remove\nships in the area with the help of US intervention.\n\n## Allies and Foes\n\nThe Philippine government voiced its commitment to safeguarding its sovereign\nrights and maritime interests. Philippine officials have called for restraint\nand 'strict adherence to international law.'\n\nThis includes respecting the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n(UNCLOS), which provides the legal framework for resolving maritime disputes,\nand refraining from actions that could escalate tensions or violate the rights\nof other countries.\n\nOn July 12, 2016, the arbitral tribunal delivered a surprising ruling on the\ndispute - favouring the Philippines in 14 of its 15 claims against China's\nexpansive territorial claims. The court said that China's nine-dash claim\nviolated international law.\n\nThe United States has reiterated its commitment to supporting its allies and\npartners, including the Philippines, in upholding a free and open maritime\norder. The US has been conducting freedom of navigation operations to\nchallenge China's excessive maritime claims and demonstrate its commitment to\ninternational law.\n\nFrance, which maintains territories in the Indo-Pacific region, has expressed\nits support for a rules-based order and has called for a peaceful resolution\nof maritime disputes based on international law.\n\nRead more\n\nUK Orders Crack Down On 'Dirty Money' And 'Counterfeit Goods' Coming From\nLondon's American-Style Candy Shops\n\nChina Calls Swimmer Doping Reports 'Fake News'\n\nChinese Fishermen Accused of Poisoning Waters, Coral Reefs With Cyanide\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2024.
