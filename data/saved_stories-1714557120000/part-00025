These\nstructures, recognized as blue holes, stand out for their remarkable\ndimensions within a shallow estuarine environment. Particularly the Taam Ja\u2019\nBlue Hole (TJBH), revealed a depth of ~274 mbsl based on echo sounder mapping,\nmomentarily positioning it as the world's second-deepest blue hole. However,\necho sounding methods face challenges in complex environments like blue holes\nor inland sinkholes arising from frequency-dependent detection and range\nlimitations due to water density vertical gradients, cross-sectional depth\nvariations, or morphometric deviations in non-strictly vertical caves. Initial\nexploration could not reach the bottom and confirm its position, prompting\nongoing investigation into the geomorphological features of TJBH. Recent CTD\nprofiler records in TJBH surpassed 420 mbsl with no bottom yet reached,\nestablishing the TJBH as the deepest-known blue hole globally. Hydrographic\ndata delineated multiple water layers within TJBH. Comparison with Caribbean\nwater conditions at the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, reef lagoons, and\nestuaries suggests potential subterranean connections. Further research and\nimplementation of underwater navigation technologies are essential to decipher\nits maximum depth and the possibilities of forming part of an interconnected\nsystem of caves and tunnels.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAnchialine systems stand out as impressive and exciting environments to be\nexplored across different disciplines. These systems provide a vast research\nfield, from microbiology (Ben\u00edtez et al., 2019; Little et al., 2021; Sha et\nal., 2021), to sea-level dynamics or paleoclimate (van Hengstum et al., 2011;\nHusson et al., 2018; van Hengstum et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2021),\nstratigraphy (Vimpere, 2017), physicochemical water properties (Perry et al.,\n2002, Perry et al., 2009), as well as groundwater hydrology (Gondwe et al.,\n2010; Bj\u00f6rner\u00e5s et al., 2020). However, a common basis across all disciplines\nis the need to understand the geomorphology and dimensions of the karst\nstructures.\n\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, part of Central America's Maya block, lacks Paleozoic\nfolds (Weber et al., 2012). With dynamic diagenesis and gradual Pliocene\nemergence, it exhibits significant geological structures in vadose (Perry et\nal., 2003, Perry et al., 2009) and phreatic settings (van Hengstum et al.,\n2010, van Hengstum et al., 2011), as well as in coastal submarine environments\n(Bauer-Gottwein et al., 2011a). Moreover, the Yucatan Peninsula's northern\nside hosts the Ring of Cenotes Fault, a regional-scale structure formed by\nsinkholes, related to the Chicxulub meteorite impact 65 million years ago\n(Bauer-Gottwein et al., 2011a). Simultaneously, the world's most extensive\nsubterranean cave system, shaped by glacio-eustatic sea-level changes, is\nfound on the western side (Supper et al., 2009; Kambesis and Coke, 2013).\nAcross the eastern margin, parallel to the Caribbean coast, the Yucatan\nPeninsula features two regional fracture zones\u2014the Holbox Fracture Zone to the\nnorth and the Rio Hondo Fault Zone to the south (Bauer-Gottwein et al., 2011a)\nwith possible intersections and water exchange (Gondwe et al., 2011). To the\nsoutheast, inland sinkholes and lagoons aligned with the Rio Hondo Fault Zone\nhave been extensively studied (e.g. Gischler et al., 2011; Perry et al.,\n2021). Also, recent exploration in Chetumal Bay reported large coastal karstic\nformations recognized as blue holes (Carrillo et al., 2009b; Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta\net al., 2023; Fl\u00f3rez-Franco et al., 2023). These blue holes represented an\noutstanding revelation, particularly that of the Taam-ja\u2019 Blue Hole (TJBH),\npreliminarily recognized as the world's second-deepest, surpassing the depths\nof the Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas (~202 mbsl) (Vimpere, 2017), the Dahab\nBlue Hole in Egypt (~130 mbsl) (Li et al., 2018), or the Great Blue Hole in\nBelize (~125 mbsl) (Schmitt et al., 2021).\n\nThe TJBH, first documented by Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al. (2023), stands as a\nnoteworthy geological feature. Bathymetric mapping employing echo sounder\ntechnology indicated an impressive maximum depth of 274.4 meters below sea\nlevel (mbsl). Echo sounding, serving as an indirect method, allowed a\ncomprehensive 3D spatial coverage of the TJBH morphology. However, this method\ncould grapple with constraints arising from frequency-dependent detection and\nrange limitations (Colbo et al., 2014). These challenges are usually\naccentuated in blue holes and inland sinkholes due to fluctuations in water\ndensity (Cejudo et al., 2022) and cross-sectional variations in depth (Li et\nal., 2018), particularly in non-strictly vertical caves where the blue hole\nstructure deviates from their entrance position. Direct methods for depth\nmeasurement employed in TJBH relied on CTD profiling but encountered\nlimitations with measurements being restricted to a maximum depth of 200 mbsl\nto safeguard against potential instrument damage (Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al.,\n2023; Fl\u00f3rez-Franco et al., 2023). Notably, the measurements could not reach\nthe bottom and confirm its position, leaving the depths of TJBH and the\nvertical thermohaline structure partially unresolved.\n\nTherefore, recent direct methods for water depth measurement gathered with a\nSWiFT CTD Profiler reveal water depths within the TJBH that surpassed the\nprevious reported records, but also the maximum water depth record held by the\nSansha Yongle Blue Hole (SYBH) at ~301 mbsl in the South China Sea (Li et al.,\n2018). This groundbreaking finding establishes the TJBH as the recently\nconfirmed deepest-known blue hole globally. Additionally, the hydrographic\ndata collected is also described to delineate the water temperature and\nsalinity variations along the recent depths reached, the formation of\npreviously unknown pycnoclines, and comparison of the thermohaline conditions\nin TJBH with those found in the literature for waters in the Caribbean at the\nMesoamerican Barrier Reef System and coastal reef lagoons, as a proxy of\npossible hydraulic connectivity between them and the blue hole.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study area\n\nCenotes, underground springs, freshwater inlets, and a complex lagoon and\nanchialine system develop at the southeastern region of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula\n(Figure 1A). The system connects with Chetumal Bay, a semi-closed mesohaline\ntropical estuary developed over carbonated sedimentary deposits of the\nMiocene, Mio-Pliocene and Holocene (Gondwe et al., 2010; Dom\u00ednguez-Herrera et\nal., 2023), which hydrographic conditions are described in Carrillo et al\n(2009a), Carrillo et al (2009b) and Ru\u00edz-Pineda et al. (2016).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1 (A) Location of the Taam ja\u2019 Blue Hole (TJBH) in Chetumal Bay,\nMexico, is presented alongside the CC and CSW data regions for further\ncomparison of water temperature and salinity conditions. Regional fracture\nzones and geological faults in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula are indicated (INEGI,\n2002), along with the locations of documented blue holes within Chetumal Bay.\nCB data was measured at sampling stations positioned at cardinal positions\n~500 m apart of the TJBH (TJBH_N, TJBH_S, TJBH_E and TJBH_W). Images from\nscuba explorations of the TJBH at depths (B) 5.0 mbsl, (C) 20 mbsl, and (D) 30\nmbsl are also presented.\n\nThe TJBH (378823 m E, 2059390 m N, UTM 16Q) is located in the central portion\nof Chetumal Bay, within the Mexican State Reserve \u201cChetumal Bay-Manatee\nSanctuary\u201d (RESMBCH). It is ~4.5 km from Tamalcab island, and ~19.2 km from\nChetumal, the most urbanized area. TJBH, Lool ja\u2019 Blue Hole (LJBH), and\nCh\u2019och-ja\u2019 Blue Hole (CJBH) are among the blue holes recently documented in\nChetumal Bay (Carrillo et al., 2009b; Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al., 2023; Fl\u00f3rez-\nFranco et al., 2023) (Figure 1A), for which preliminary insights into their\ngeomorphological features, and temporal variability of physicochemical\nproperties have been provided.\n\n### Field work and data analysis\n\nOn December 6^th, 2023, a scuba diving expedition was conducted to identify\nthe environmental conditions prevailing at the TJBH and related to factors\nsuch as visibility, substrate characteristics, and wall coverage within a\ndepth range extending from 0 to 30 mbsl. Additionally, on December 6^th and\n13^th, 2023, measurement of new CTD profiles was conducted within the TJBH\naiming to reach its bottom and confirm the echo-sounding results described in\nAlc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al. (2023). Employing a SWiFT CTD Profiler (Valeport UK),\nsingle profiles at each campaign with simultaneous measurements of water\npressure, temperature, and conductivity were acquired throughout the water\ncolumn of TJBH. The coordinates for the CTD profiles were 378830.7 m E and\n2059383.6 m N (UTM 16Q), selected based on preliminary echo sounding\nmeasurements that indicated water depths surpassing 250 mbsl. The vessel was\nanchored to prevent drifting caused by waves and currents. In this specific\nlocation, the CTD instrument was lowered, utilizing ~500 m of cable down to\nthe bottom, adhering to the maximum depth supported by the instrument.\n\nSalinity and density values from CTD casts are computed employing the Chen and\nMillero/UNESCO international algorithm (Chen and Millero, 1977; Fofonoff and\nMillard, 1983), leading to an accuracy of \u00b10.01 PSU and \u00b10.01 kg/m3,\nrespectively. Temperature data from SWiFT CTD Profiler measurements has an\naccuracy of \u00b10.01 \u00b0C. Data was resampled to achieve a fixed depth resolution\nof 0.5 m for the calculation of temperature (\u2202T/\u2202z), salinity (\u2202S/\u2202z), and\ndensity (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202z) vertical gradients, to delineate variations in these\nparameters with depth. The vertical gradient resulted from the absolute\ndifference in a variable quantity over the vertical distance between their\nresampled measurement locations. Pycnoclines, indicative of density\nvariations, were estimated by considering the maximum vertical density\ngradient surpassing a defined threshold of \u03b4_1 = 0.5 kg\u00b7m^4 (Read et al.,\n2011; Fl\u00f3rez-Franco et al., 2023). Building upon the findings by Fl\u00f3rez-Franco\net al. (2023), density transition zones are identified assuming a density\ngradient of \u03b4_2 \u2265 0.05 kg\u00b7m^4.\n\nA temperature-salinity diagram was also devised to identify a potential\nrelationship between the waters of the TJBH and those in coastal and open-sea\nwaters in the Caribbean. For this purpose, existing hydrographic data from the\nCaribbean Surface Water (CSW data) at the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (0-150\nmbsl) delineated in Carrillo et al. (2016) was employed. Insights derived from\ndata detailed in Tovar et al. (2009), encompassing coastal reef lagoons within\nthe Mexican Caribbean, were considered (CC data). Additionally, existing\nquarterly data measurements at stations ~500 m apart from the TJBH (i.e.,\nTJBH_N, TJBH_S, TJBH_E, TJBH_W) between March 2021 to December 2023, were used\nto describe the observed conditions within Chetumal Bay and in the vicinity of\nthe TJBH (CB data). Location of the different comparative study areas (CB, CSW\nand CC) is depicted in Figure 1A.\n\n## Results\n\nThe boundary of TJBH, clearly defined around 5.0 mbsl, features a soft\nsubstrate covered by biofilms, which extends across the upper walls of the\nblue hole (Figure 1B). The turbidity of Chetumal Bay's waters conceals this\nborder from being visible at the surface. However, the border becomes clearly\nseen after a depth >4.0 mbsl The TJBH wall exhibits speleothem-like formations\ncovered by biofilms, yet they are soft, fragile, and prone to collapse (Figure\n1C). Beyond 25-30 mbsl, the wall steepens and develops a firm substrate. This\nsubstrate occasionally forms a tilted roof largely free of biofilms (i.e.\n0-20% coverage), possibly due to limited natural light penetration (Figure\n1D).\n\nProfiles and vertical gradients of water temperature, salinity, and density\nare depicted in Figure 2. The depths attained from CTD casts on both December\n6^th and 13^th, 2023, recorded 416.0 and 423.6 mbsl, respectively.\nConsequently, these new findings unequivocally establish the Taam Ja\u2019 Blue\nHole (TJBH) as the world's deepest known blue hole, with its bottom still not\nreached.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2 Vertical profiles and gradients of (A) water temperature, (B)\nsalinity, (C) density, and (D) sound speed measured on 06.12.2023 and\n13.12.2023 in TJBH with a CTD profiler. Pycnoclines are given by the maximum\ndensity gradient above a threshold \u03b4_1=0.5 kg/m^4. Regions next to the\npycnoclines location with a density gradient \u03b4_2>0.05 kg/m^4 (TZ) are also\nshown.\n\nThe CTD measurements revealed a depth shorter than the cable length (~500 m)\nemployed to lower the CTD profiler, indicating an oblique descent of the\ninstrument at an angle of approximately 32.1-33.7\u00b0 from the vertical. This\ndeviation in orientation could be ascribed to either the specific\ngeomorphology of the Taam Ja\u2019 Blue Hole (TJBH) or the influence of prevailing\nunderwater currents. Moreover, echo sounding data from prior investigations\n(Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al., 2023) had reported a maximum depth of 274.4 mbsl,\nwith the deeper regions of the TJBH concentrated predominantly on the northern\nside, where depths were in average 250 mbsl. This depth coincides with the\nlocation of a pycnocline, positioned at a depth of 246.1 mbsl. Consequently,\nit can be inferred that the echo sounding results reported by Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta\net al. (2023) might have been affected by a possibly non-strictly vertical\nmorphology of the TJBH or acoustic scattering given by fluctuations in water\ndensity (Figure 2C, D).\n\nThe development of four primary clines with density gradients exceeding 0.5\nkg/m^4 is also shown in Figure 2A\u2013C. Pycnoclines were delineated on average at\n4.6-5.3 mbsl for the 1^st pycnocline, 246.1 mbsl for the 2^nd pycnocline,\n323.3 mbsl for the 3^rd pycnocline, and 414.5 mbsl for the 4^th pycnocline.\nTransition zones (TZ) between layers above and below the pycnoclines are\ndefined by gradients \u2202\u03c1/\u2202z > 0.05 kg/m^4.\n\nThe surface water layer (~0-4 mbsl) above the 1st pycnocline exhibits\nsubstantial variability in temperature (ranging from 24.9 to 27.9\u00b0C) and\nsalinity (13.5-15.0 PSU) across measurements. Temperature and salinity\nvariabilities decrease within the layers below the 1st pycnocline within the\nTJBH. On average, the layer between pycnoclines 1-2 describes an average\ntemperature of 24.9\u00b10.30 \u00b0C and salinity of 22.2\u00b11.02 PSU within a depth range\nof 8 to 236 mbsl. In the layer encompassing depths of 249-313 mbsl (between\npycnoclines 2-3), the average temperature decreases, while salinity increases,\nwith values of 22.3\u00b10.18 \u00b0C and 29.5\u00b10.53 PSU, respectively. The layer below,\nspanning depths of 332-399 mbsl, registers an average salinity of 35.1\u00b10.01\nPSU and the lowest average temperature (19.8\u00b10.01 \u00b0C). Beyond 400 mbsl, there\nis a significant increase in temperature within the transition zone, rising\nfrom 19.8 to 23.9 \u00b0C, accompanied by a salinity increase of up to 37.5 PSU and\nan average water density of 1027 kg/m^3.\n\nPossible hydrographic relationships across the TJBH, Chetumal Bay (CB), the\nCaribbean Surface Water (CSW) and Mexican Caribbean reef lagoons (CC) are\nexplored in the temperature-salinity diagram in Figure 3. The CB data presents\na wide variability of temperature (>25\u00b0C) and salinity (<17 PSU) with water\ndensities below 1010 kg/m^3, similar to those observed in the surface layer\nabove the entrance of TJBH. This reflects the influence of the estuarine\nChetumal Bay water atop the TJBH entrance.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3 Temperature-salinity diagram for the water features corresponding to\nthe TJBH. Water temperature and salinity from measured data in Chetumal Bay\n(CB) between 2021-2023 is also depicted together with data corresponding to\nthe Caribbean Surface Water (CSW) for water depths 2-150 m (Carrillo et al.,\n2016) and to reef lagoons in the Caribbean Coast (CC) (Tovar et al., 2009).\nCurves show density in kilograms per cubic meter. Color bar refers to water\ndepth in meters.\n\nBeyond the depth of 400 mbsl within the TJBH, the water conditions gradually\nconverge with those of in the Caribbean Sea (CSW and CC, Figure 3). Salinity\nlevels in the Caribbean Surface Water reach up to 36.9 PSU, particularly at\ndepths ranging from 115 to 150 mbsl, where the water densities are in average\n1023\u00b10.1 kg/m3 and reach up to 1026 kg/m3. These marine hydrographic values\nresemble the results obtained from CTD casts within TJBH at depths exceeding\n400 mbsl with average salinity of 36.0\u00b10.74 PSU and density of 1027\u00b10.3 kg/m3.\nSimilarly, data from the coastal reef lagoons of the Mexican Caribbean\ndescribe an average salinity value of 36.0\u00b10.53 PSU, accompanied by water\ntemperatures surpassing 18.3 \u00b0C and averaging approximately 27.9\u00b12.48 \u00b0C.\nCoastal reef hydrographic data represents shallow areas (less than 9.5 mbsl)\nshowing a wider range of density values between 1020 and 1026 kg/m3 with a\nmean value of 1023\u00b10.8 kg/m3. This data alignment suggests a potential\nsubterranean connection between these water bodies and the TJBH.\n\n## Discussion and concluding remarks\n\nHydrogeology and geomorphology of karst systems such as blue holes are highly\nvaluable with implications for water resources, biodiversity, or\nphysicochemical and geological processes. The initial results in Alc\u00e9rreca-\nHuerta et al. (2023) yielded preliminary insights into the geomorphology,\ndepths, and water properties of TJBH. Confirmation of the maximum depth was\nnot possible due to instrumental limitations during the scientific expeditions\nin 2021, prompting the need for further exploration and analysis.\n\nThe recent records from CTD profiling in 2023 conclusively verifies that the\nTJBH is now the deepest blue hole discovered to date, exhibiting water depths\nsurpassing 420 mbsl, with its bottom yet to be reached. In line with the\napproach undertaken by Li et al. (2018), further investigations should\nincorporate advanced underwater navigation technologies in conjunction with\nCTD profilers. This integrated methodology would allow an accurate three-\ndimensional spatial representation of the TJBH leading to a detailed analysis\non its geomorphological features and water depths.\n\nCTD measurements provided valuable results into the temperature\u2013salinity\nstratification of the TJBH, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding\nof its hydrographical characteristics. Variations in temperature and salinity\nwithin the water layers of the TJBH and the pycnoclines development offered\ninsights of TJBH in relation to surrounding marine environments. In this\nregard, the CTD measurements hint potential yet undiscovered connections with\nthe seawater of either the coastal reef lagoons or deeper coastal zones of the\nMesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The notable increase of temperature (~\u0394T>4.0\n\u00b0C) and salinity (up to 37.5 PSU) at depths beyond 400 mbsl could probably be\nrelated to these connections. The increase in salinity may stem from various\nmechanisms, as delineated by Fleury et al. (2007). These mechanisms could\ninclude salinization processes triggered by the inflow of marine water through\na Venturi effect, water density differences (Mijatovic, 1962; Fleury et al.,\n2007), or the difference in hydraulic head as long as that of the seawater is\nhigher than that of the freshwater (Whitaker and Smart, 1997). Thermal\nspecific features could also be related to geological, volcanic or tectonic\nprocesses in relation to water circulation (\u0160u\u0161melj et al., 2024). The\nincrease in water temperature at depths >400 mbsl in TJBH could be\nhypothesized to resemble that observed in the Floridian aquifer (Meyer, 1989;\nFleury et al., 2007), where geothermal activity warms cold seawater at deep\nlayers, prompting its upward movement through existing sinkholes or factures\nat confining units. Subsequent interaction with the aquifer and the presence\nof further hydraulic connections with seawater could occur at upper layers,\nresulting in a reduction of the water temperature. This geothermal activity\nand the recharging areas from seawater have been related with fracture and\nfault zones in Florida (Whitaker and Smart, 1997) and the Northern Adriatic\nSea (\u0160u\u0161melj et al., 2024).\n\nResearch on blue holes encompasses a series of ambitious and exploration\nprojects, often spanning several years or even decades, as occurred for the\nSYBH (e.g. Li et al., 2018; He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; He et al.,\n2020; Jinwei et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023) or the Bahamian blue holes (e.g.\nBottrell et al., 1991; Mylroie, 2008; Gonzalez et al., 2011; Vimpere, 2017;\nvan Hengstum et al., 2020; Sha et al., 2021). Moreover, the exploration and\nresearch of inland vertical caves, such as the Krubera\u2013Voronya, the world's\ndeepest known cave with a depth of 2191 meters, has continually set successive\nnew depth records since 1960s (Klimchouk et al., 2009; Klimchouk, 2019). This\nevinces the needs of continuous exploration of these karst geological\nstructures, their intricate geomorphology, and the development of cave\nbranches. Delving into the underwater spatial geomorphology of TJBH, the focus\nis on deciphering its maximum depth and the possibilities of forming part of\nan underwater intricate and potentially interconnected system of caves and\ntunnels.\n\nTherefore, the new findings and the discovered challenging depths of TJBH\nentails a multifaceted inquiry encompassing various scientific dimensions.\nEfforts should extend to unravel the hydrogeology, stratification, and mixing\nprocesses within TJBH, delineating their relationship with regional water\nbodies, hydraulic connections, water quality dynamics, and water residence\ntimes. Within the depths of TJBH could also lie a biodiversity to be explored\nand linked to physicochemical and geomorphological processes, forming a unique\nbiotope. Geological studies should extend to understanding TJBH's relationship\nwith the fault and fracture system of the region (i.e. the Rio Hondo Fault\nZone), with implications for its origin. Analyses are needed to describe the\nstratigraphic sequence within TJBH and potential connections between TJBH,\nother blue holes and cenotes in or nearby Chetumal Bay. Thus, uncovering the\nchallenges and mysteries concealed in TJBH urges further exploration,\nmonitoring, and scientific inquiry.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because the\ndata belong to a project funded by the authors.
