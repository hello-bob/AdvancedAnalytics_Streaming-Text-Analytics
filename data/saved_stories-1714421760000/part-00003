This could be an improvement to an existing\nbusiness or operational process, or it could be the introduction of a new\ntechnique or tool. Regardless, no matter what solution you come up with,\ntrying to drive change within an organization always starts with getting\npeople to do something different than they\u2019re used to doing.\n\nBut beware. Inertia is a powerful force to overcome.\n\nThanks for reading!

Break down your larger objective into a smaller pilot\nthat you can run with a group willing to pilot it with you. And it\u2019s likely\nyou\u2019ve already identified them: you probably already have a close working\nrelationship with them, have worked with them before, or they are already\nbought into your idea and are already invested in its success. For all of\nthese reasons, it probably won\u2019t be hard to convince them to get onboard. And,\nif you\u2019re lucky, there might even be a few more groups lining up to help pilot\nit as soon as the initial group is done.\n\nSo, fast forward, you run your pilot, and congratulations! It\u2019s a success! Now\nwhat?\n\nIdeally, you\u2019d share your results, and everyone around the organization would\nsee it and be lining up to follow along, right? However, remember you chose\nyour first group(s) because they were already bought into your idea. They\ndidn\u2019t need that much convincing. And just because you have a successful\noutcome from your pilot now doesn\u2019t mean people are ready to adopt a new way\nof doing things just because you\u2019ve demonstrated that it\u2019s objectively better.\n\nThis is where many teams get stuck. The Plateau of Change.\n\nThe initial pilot was a success. The teams who were excited about it initially\njumped on it immediately and helped to prove it out. Then perhaps there were\neven another set of groups who wanted to adopt it and who gave you even more\nvalidation and data to help make the solution even better. But now the rollout\nhas stalled.\n\nOne solution could be to try to drive adoption from the top down. This is\nusually easiest in one of 3 situations:\n\n  1. You\u2019re in an authoritative position in the organization where you can drive the prioritization of the rollout yourself\n\n  2. The clear financial and/or business benefit of adoption by all teams makes it easy to find an executive sponsor to make the case to prioritize it\n\n  3. This initiative neatly fits inside or complements another already-prioritized initiative, so this could simply become part of that work\n\nHowever, most of the time, things don\u2019t end up working out that easily.\nEspecially when it means convincing people to do something new that may feel\nlike it conflicts with their current goals or the way they are getting things\ndone now.\n\nAs an aside, this is an important point that I want to stress about feelings.\nMany times, these initial reactions or even decisions are not based on data.\nThese very human responses come from the fact that change is uncomfortable.\nTherefore, any change management strategy should start from a place of empathy\nfor those whom the change affects, which could and should probably be a deeper\nexploration in a post by itself.\n\nSo, knowing that, how do you break through that next plateau of adoption?\n\nFirst, recognize that, just as you started with a pilot, you\u2019re not going to\nroll out your solution to the rest of the organization all at once. So start\nwith a few more groups to target for the next phase of the rollout. Start by\nthinking about your organization as a whole and also at individual teams that\nyou need to influence through the lens of these four main questions:\n\n  * Who sets the priorities?\n\n  * What motivates them?\n\n  * What worries or concerns them?\n\n  * Who do they trust when making decisions?\n\nNext, consider the fact that adoption of this new solution was almost\ncertainly a cross-functional effort made by your pilot team. It probably\nwasn\u2019t done by an individual; it needed coordination and group buy-in to get\nit done and see it through. And that\u2019s what will be needed for every\nsubsequent rollout. But remember: the pilot was the easy one. To help you\nhere, you should think about your pilot team as part of your extended team.\nSolicit their help in this next phase. They likely speak the language of their\nfunctional counterparts on the other teams (their motivations, concerns, etc)\nand can be your advocates and ambassadors.\n\nLeverage that team and every additional team who adopts the solution to help\nget organizational buy-in on your behalf. This will increase the odds that\nyour solution will be adopted and result in:\n\n  * Increased credibility by hearing it from someone in similar role(s) to theirs\n\n  * Reassurance that the adoption of the solution was beneficial (or at least not detrimental to their goals/objectives)\n\n  * Internal support knowing that others have gone through the change\n\nOnce you break through that plateau, it becomes a snowball effect. More and\nmore teams will begin to adopt your solution, and you eventually gain a\ncritical mass of internal support to help others adopt it. Sure, there will be\nsome stragglers who haven\u2019t found the time or, for whatever reason,\nwillingness \u2014 and you will simply have to find ways to bring them along. But\nif you\u2019ve covered the majority of the organization and navigated the\ncomplexity of change management on that scale to solve a business problem, you\nhave likely established a new level of organizational credibility and trust,\ndeepened your understanding of how the company works, and maybe even started a\nshort list of new opportunities you might want to tackle next.\n\n### Subscribe to Nathan Broslawsky's Blog\n\nLaunched 2 months ago\n\nThis is where I share my journey and musings as a technology leader, polymath,\nand optimist.
