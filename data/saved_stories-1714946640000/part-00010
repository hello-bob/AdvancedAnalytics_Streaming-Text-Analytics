Credit: Nature Synthesis\n(2024). DOI: 10.1038/s44160-024-00531-7\n\nA new type of porous material that can store carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases has been developed by a team of scientists jointly led by\nHeriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nIn a collaboration with the University of Liverpool, Imperial College London,\nthe University of Southampton, and East China University of Science and\nTechnology in China, the team used computer modeling to accurately predict how\nmolecules would assemble themselves into the new type of porous material.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Synthesis, details how the\nscientists created hollow, cage-like molecules with high storage capacities\nfor greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur\nhexafluoride is more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and can last\nthousands of years in the atmosphere.\n\nThese cage molecules were assembled using other cages to create a new type of\nporous material that the scientists say is the first of its kind in its porous\n\"cage of cages\" structure.\n\nMaterials scientist Dr. Marc Little, an Assistant Professor at Heriot-Watt\nUniversity's Institute of Chemical Sciences and an expert in porous materials,\njointly led the research.\n\nHe said, \"This is an exciting discovery because we need new porous materials\nto help solve society's biggest challenges, such as capturing and storing\ngreenhouse gases.\"\n\nComputer modeling specialists at Imperial College London and the University of\nSouthampton created simulations to help the team understand and predict how\ntheir cage molecules would assemble into this new type of porous material.\n\nIntegral to the team were Professor Kim Jelfs from Imperial's Department of\nChemistry and the Institute for Digital Molecular Design and Fabrication\n(DigiFAB), and Professor Andy Cooper from the University of Liverpool and\nMaterials Innovation Factory.\n\nDr. Little added, \"Combining computational studies like ours with new AI\ntechnologies could create an unprecedented supply of new materials to solve\nthe most pressing societal challenges, and this study is an important step in\nthis direction.\"\n\nDr. Little added that molecules with complex structures could also be used to\nremove toxic compounds known as volatile organic compounds from the air and\ncould play an important role in medical science.\n\n\"We see this study as an important step towards unlocking such applications in\nthe future,\" he said.\n\nMore information: Qiang Zhu et al, Computationally guided synthesis of a\nhierarchical [4[2+3]+6] porous organic 'cage of cages', Nature Synthesis\n(2024).
