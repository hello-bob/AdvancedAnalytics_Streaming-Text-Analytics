The current debacle surrounding\nthe TikTok ban (forced sale?) in the US is making journalists believe that the\ninternet as a global town square where people can interact is over if\ngovernments start banning these huge platforms.\n\nI don\u2019t believe the web is dying. Not for one second. Maybe this specific\nversion of the web is dying, that might be true. Let\u2019s imagine we ban TikTok.\nAnd Facebook. And Instagram. And Threads. And all the other huge platforms.\nThere would still be one global town square left. It\u2019s called the web. The web\nitself IS the global town square.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a lot harder to reach a million people if you have to start from\nyour own little corner of the web. But you know what? Tough shit. Some things\nin life are hard. And maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Maybe being able to instantly\nbecome viral is not a good thing overall. Maybe we do want some friction in\nthe system.\n\nThe web is not dying. People won\u2019t stop creating because silly AI tools will\nflood the web with generated crap. Photographers won\u2019t stop taking pictures\nbecause Midjourney exists. Filmmakers won\u2019t stop creating videos because Sora\nis now available to everyone.\n\nCreative people are driven by the passion for creation. Writers write because\nthey love writing. Bloggers will keep blogging away because that\u2019s what they\ndo.\n\nThe web is not dying. I started People and Blogs last September. I post one\ninterview a week. I almost completely stopped searching for new people to\ninterview because my list of potential guests had enough entries to last a few\nyears. And yet I\u2019m still finding new blogs daily. Ooh.directory has more than\n2200 blogs listed. The Kagi small web dataset contains more than 12000\nentries. I have more than 1400 sites listed on theforest.link. You could click\non a new link every day and have enough new content for the next 40 years. And\nI am 100% certain that those sites will contain links to other new sites you\ncan explore.\n\nThe web is not dying. The web is huge. The web is ever-expanding. The fact\nthat the web is just the same 5 big websites is a fucking lie. It\u2019s like\nsaying the restaurant industry is the same 5 fast food chains. It is not. It\u2019s\nup to you to decide to stop visiting those 5 sites and stop ingesting their\nfast food content.\n\nThe web is not dying. Start clicking around. Be curious. Follow random links.\nSearch something on Marginalia or Wiby. Make a blog on Bear Blog or Micro.blog\nand start creating. Join a Webring. Write something for the IndieWeb Carnival.\nConnect with others.\n\nThe web is not dying. The only thing that\u2019s slowly dying is the spirit, the\nmindset that made the web such a wonderful place to begin with.\n\n### Follow along\n\nVia RSS or email. If my posts aren't enough I send a newsletter from the top\nof a mountain.\n\nRSS Email\n\n### Get in touch\n\nHave something to share? Want me as your first reader? Get in touch.
