He has taken all your money, leaving you\nwith only five credits, but as a gentleman El Bandito gives you the chance to\nwin it back through the only respectable way in the west . . . a rock, paper,\nscissors showdown!\n\nThe normal rules of rock, paper, scissors (aka scissors, paper, stone in parts\nof the old world) apply. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors\nbeats paper.\n\nOn top of the normal rules both players have combo counters. A combo counter\nshows how long a player has gone unbeaten. With each round played the losing\nplayer pays the winning player the number of coins of the winning player combo\ncounter. By achieving large combos you can win a lot of money fast, but also\nlose it. If you win a round and it ends the combo of El Bandito and his combo\nis 3 or more then you have achieved a combo breaker.\n\nEl Bandito is smarter than he looks, and learns how you play in order to\ndefeat you most effectively. Luckily for you he forgets how you play with each\nnew game, so you have a fighting chance.\n\nThere are online leaderboards for those that sign up with their profiles.
