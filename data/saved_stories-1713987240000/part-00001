You just need to memorize a series of taxon names, and\nthen memorize a series of suffixes that go with each taxon.\n\nSo Hominidae just means \u201cthe family that Homo is in.\u201d Would it have been\nsimpler to call them homofamily, homotribe, and so on? Yes, but that wouldn\u2019t\nhave sounded scholarly and latinish, so we can\u2019t have that.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just zoology. Plants, fungi, and algae use different systems, but\njust similar enough to be confusing.\n\nBut at least if you memorize all that, you can sound like you know what you\u2019re\ntalking about, right? Wrong! Because how do you even pronounce Rosaceae, for\ninstance? As far as I can tell, there is no official guide, so in practice the\npronunciation is \u201cwhatever your graduate advisor says.\u201d And then you get to\ntalking with someone whose graduate advisor said something different, and the\nawkwardness is just sublime.\n\nfor all that this is a relatively sensible system compared so some other\ndisciplines\n\n46 notes\n\n## Complete list of the greatest military geniuses of all time\n\n  1.

Because you\u2019d constantly have to\nstruggle with the issue of whether to accept the update to a new operating\nsystem. Because if you do, are you still really you anymore?
