Housed in a 17-mile circular underground tunnel, the LHC accelerates\nprotons and ions to near lights peed. The particles complete each turn at a\nmind-bending 11,000 times per second and spectacularly collide about 600\nmillion times per second.\n\nWhile the total collision energy is far from being enough to birth another\nuniverse, the fact that it is concentrated in the minuscule proton beams gives\nphysicists clues into the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces\ngoverning our universe.\n\n## A petabyte per second\n\nCERN\u2019s computing infrastructure is as ambitious as its scientific endeavors.\nSubatomic particles are invisible to the naked eye. So, physicists must devise\nways to detect, measure, and visualize the trillions of particles shooting out\nof each collision, some of which exist for a mere septillionth of a second (a\ndecimal point followed by 22 zeroes).\n\nWith layer upon layer of complex devices, the LHC detectors generate a\nstaggering petabyte of collision data per second. As Eric Bonfillou, the\ndeputy group leader of CERN\u2019s IT Fabric group, aptly put it, \u201cit\u2019s an amount\nof data no one can really deal with.\u201d\n\nThe computing farms within the LHC sift and filter the data in real time. Only\nthe most essential data get shipped to the primary data center, now home to\nmore than an exabyte.\n\nBonfillou and the IT Fabric group procure, manage, and operate the layer\nproviding IT equipment for CERN\u2019s experiments and user community, including\nthe data centers and associated computing facilities.\n\nOver the years, Bonfillou has watched CERN\u2019s IT data center evolve from modest\nPC farms stacked on shelves to the current industry standard rack\narchitecture. The data center is home to more than 10,000 servers, 100,000\nhard disk drives, and nearly 500,000 processing cores. It\u2019s one of the most\ndemanding computing environments in the research world.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that we always have to put more resources, storage capacity,\nand computing power within existing boundaries,\u201d said Bonfillou.\n\nThose constraints are primarily cost and power. As a publicly funded\ninstitution supported by 23 member states, one of the most critical metrics is\nstorage efficiency\u2014maximizing capacity for every dollar spent.\n\n## Bigger, faster, more energy\n\nThe LHC has recently undergone its second major upgrade for a series of\nexperiments known as Run 3. Run 3 can smash particles at an unprecedented\ncollision energy. With much of the particle accelerator chain upgraded, the\ncollider can produce more energy and drive more collisions, allowing the\nexperiments to precisely study infinitesimal particles.\n\nBut all that brawny goodness meant Run 3 would collect more data than during\nthe first two runs combined.\n\nTo store this data, Bonfillou and his team had to find new solutions. The\nchallenge was not only in aggregating massive capacity but in the ability to\npush tremendous amounts of data to storage fast enough.\n\nWhile flash storage would offer a far more performant alternative to hard\ndrives, \u201cThe costs for capacity would be up through the roof, and I\u2019d fail at\nmy job,\u201d said Bonfillou.\n\nYet coalescing the performance of hard drives can come with challenges. While\nenterprise hard drives (HDDs) are designed to work under the most rigorous\ndata operations, the harder they work, the more heat they generate. When many\ndrives are crammed into a server, temperature thresholds can potentially cause\nthrottling of HDD performance to keep drives from overheating.\n\nIn addition, HDD read and write heads position at about the micron level\n(about 1/90 of the thickness of a human hair). When a few dozen hard drives\nspin next to one another at maximum speed, they can generate vibrations,\npotentially affecting the HDD head positioning, which will impact throughput\nand performance.\n\n## A new generation of JBODs\n\nOn the search for new solutions, Bonfillou meets regularly with CERN\u2019s various\ntechnology partners, such as Western Digital. CERN and Western Digital have\nhad a long-standing partnership, and quarterly meetings allow technologists to\ndiscuss current products used by CERN and share developments in Western\nDigital\u2019s portfolio of hard drive and flash solutions.\n\nWhen Bonfillou shared the requirements from the next generation collider, the\nteam suggested testing the company\u2019s new series of JBODs (Just a Bunch of\nDrives), the Ultrastar hybrid storage platforms.\n\nJBODs are the workhorse of most large data centers (CERN, too, has been using\nthem for more than a decade). The no-frills, rack-sized enclosures are\ndesigned to deliver expandable capacity with little complexity, which is why\nthey aren\u2019t an obvious hotbed for tech innovation.\n\nYet several years ago, Western Digital realized it could use its expertise in\nHDD and SSD manufacturing to develop uniquely optimized enclosures for its\ndevices and innovate on a data center monolith.\n\nWith its Ultrastar storage platforms, the company introduced several\ntechnologies to better circulate air within enclosures while reducing\nrotational vibrations, in some cases by more than 60%. So even when all the\ndrives are working hard, performance can be better maintained. The result is a\nhigher-performing JBOD that also runs cooler and consumes less electricity.\n\nThe numbers looked promising for the demands of Run 3, but the JBODs would\nneed to go through CERN\u2019s fantastically rigorous evaluation.\n\n## New science and a new data center\n\nAfter over three years of shutdown, LHC\u2019s Run 3 kicked off in summer 2022.\nMore than 100 tons of superfluid helium were flowing through LHC\u2019s pipes,\ncooling it to a temperature of -456 Fahrenheit (colder than outer space), and\nparticles began swooshing through one of the world\u2019s most complex scientific\ninstruments.\n\nBonfillou admits that his excitement for the launch was coated with a dash of\nnervousness. \u201cAt CERN, we are doing something that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere.\nIt\u2019s unique. You never know, you can\u2019t compare, and you can\u2019t guarantee that\nit\u2019ll all work,\u201d he said.\n\nBut everything is running smoothly, confirmed Bonfillou. Western Digital\u2019s\nJBODs fulfilled every stringent power, performance, capacity, and reliability\nrequirement and are now integrated into CERN\u2019s data center, which has recently\nexceeded the exabyte threshold. Each box, roughly the size of a coffee table,\ncan pack up to a whopping two petabytes of storage. Together, they deliver\nmany petabytes of capacity while meeting the experiments\u2019 data throughput\ndemands, with some enclosures even used directly at the LHC collision sites.\n\nBonfillou and his team have little time to celebrate these successes. CERN is\nfinishing the construction of a new data center to extend its computing\ncapabilities for the next run, Run 4, which is expected to start in 2029.\n\nThe new data center is located on the French side of the border, gifting\nBonfillou additional computing power.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing for the foreseen computing needs of Run 4, but it\u2019s not\nstraightforward as there is absolutely nothing available on the market today\nthat would allow to transfer and store data at its estimated figures,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAs scientists continue to seek answers within the LHC\u2019s experiments, they will\nrely on the capabilities of the CERN Data Centers and their technology\npartners to innovate tirelessly and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on\nthe quest to probe our universe.\n\n\u2014\n\nFor a virtual tour of CERN\u2019s data center, visit here.\n\nCheck out Western Digital JBODs.\n\nArtwork by Cat Tervo\n\nFacebookTwitterRedditEmailLinkedIn\n\n## Related Stories\n\nData\n\n#### What is the 3-2-1 Backup Strategy?\n\nMarch 26, 2024 \u2022 3 min read\n\nData\n\n#### A Green Start: The Data Center\u2019s Role in Climate Change\n\nFebruary 27, 2024 \u2022 6 min read\n\nWestern Digital Technologies, Inc. is the seller of record and licensee in the\nAmericas of SanDisk\u00ae products.\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This website may\ncontain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to\nexpectations for our product portfolio, the market for our products, product\ndevelopment efforts, and the capacities, capabilities and applications of our\nproducts.
