But Starship,\nMatthews believed, held the potential to change all that. With full\nreusability, a barn-size payload fairing, and capability to loft 100 or more\nmetric tons to orbit in a single throw, Starship offered the tantalizing\nprospect of a world in which flying into space was not crazy expensive. He\nenvisioned Starships delivering truckloads of cargo to the Moon or Mars.\n\nMatthews spent a decade working on robots and rovers at NASA's Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory before coming to SpaceX in 2012. He began to suggest that the\ncompany work on a system that could unload and distribute cargo from Starship,\nlike the cranes and trucks that offload cargo from large container ships in\nport. However, he didn't get far, as SpaceX was focused on developing the\nStarship transportation system.\n\nSo he left SpaceX and founded a company to develop a cargo-carrying rover.\n\n\"It was thinking about the implications of Starship that prompted me to found\nAstrolab,\" he said. \"The premise was that, if we\u2019re really going to go to\nMars, the first thing we\u2019re going to have to do is set up a bunch of\nequipment. I left SpaceX knowing the width of the Starship door, and we made\nthe biggest thing that could pass through it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis turned out to be a prototype rover. Matthews related his history with\nSpaceX as we stood on top of a 3-meter-wide vehicle in an asphalt parking lot\nnear Johnson Space Center in Houston. Standing about a meter off the ground,\nwe had a commanding view, and soon he told me to grab the joystick. Off we\nwent\u2014backward and forward, sideways and at odd angles.\n\nShortly after Matthews let me drive around the parking lot in various modes, I\nhad three immediate thoughts. It was a hell of a lot of fun to drive. For\nsomeone like me with limited piloting skills, it was remarkably intuitive to\nhandle. And holy crap, can you imagine being an astronaut driving across the\nMoon in this?\n\n## Getting on board with NASA\n\nMatthews can. He founded Astrolab in January 2020. It was terrible and\nterrific timing. The bad part was the onset of COVID-19 just weeks later. The\ngood part was that, early that year, NASA released its first request for\ninformation about a \"Lunar Terrain Vehicle\" to support the activities of its\nArtemis astronauts on the surface of the Moon. In those first months, the\ncompany consisted of Matthews and the company's chief engineer, Rius Billing,\nreplying to that request.\n\nBut they did not just complete paperwork. Almost immediately Matthews and a\nsmall but growing team began building this full-size prototype rover. By the\nend of 2021 they invited noted Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, now on the\ncompany's board of advisers, out to the desert to test-drive the vehicle while\nwearing a spacesuit.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n106\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
