Most of the time, they must wait to be enrolled in an\ninstitution to slowly learn how to read the signs of civilization. According\nto experts, most children in America should have learned to sound out simple\nwords in 1st grade (six years of age) and should be able to read novel but\nshort sentences in 2nd grade (seven years of age)\u2014standards many schools now\ndon\u2019t reach.\n\nYet, if a child is instead taught to read by their parents, or an early\ncaregiver, it is quite possible for toddlers to read at the age of two. I know\nthis because my two-year-old son can now read, after just a few months of\ntutoring (see the video of us below for results). Reading is, of course, a\nspectrum that begins at D-O-G and hopefully ends at cracking books as complex\nas Ulysses, so to clarify, by \u201creading\u201d here what I mean is roughly the first\nto second grade standard of \u201cthe ability to work out simple sentences never\nseen before.\u201d\n\nPlease note: teaching your child to read, and especially to read early, is not\nfor everyone. In fact, it doesn\u2019t make sense for a ton of families\u2019 situations\nand isn\u2019t the right move for all children. I want to be really clear about\nthat. However, I\u2019m writing this because I believe there is a significant\nuntapped pool of parents who could teach their child to read, and also who\nwould want to, and that this outcome would be best\u2014for their situation, for\ntheir relationship with their child, for the child itself\u2014yet these parents\ndon\u2019t do it because none of them even know it\u2019s an option.\n\nWhile teaching reading is definitely taking on a challenge, it requires less\neffort than one might think. Because the truth is that a parent and child can\nradically outperform any school, public or private, in about 10 minutes a day\nof tutoring, at ages far younger than normally thought possible.\n\nBelow is a video showing this process. At the beginning, in January, I\u2019d only\npreviously taught the most common letter sounds to my son, Roman, and we were\njust putting very simple words together. Yet by video\u2019s end, filmed in April,\nhe\u2019s reading full sentences, and understanding their gestalt. This is despite\nme, his teacher, starting with zero experience and zero background knowledge\n(other than, you know, being able to read myself).\n\nWhy do I think there are other parents who should consider doing this?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a dryly analytic perspective: tutoring reading is probably\none of the most maximally-helpful things you can do as a parent when it comes\nto cognitive development (another candidate: modeling imaginary play).\nEducational researchers refer to early-age reading as \u201ca head-start\u201d and\nconsistently find it positively correlated with future educational\nachievement, and practices like language-centric bedtime routines (the\nspecific place where I first recommend reading practice) are found to causally\nimprove cognitive outcomes. In longitudinal studies, early readers have an\nadvantage compared to later readers in categories like \u201cgeneral information,\u201d\nand this is true even when accounting for reading ability at the start of the\nstudy, or if IQs are initially matched between groups. Positive cognitive\neffects from reading even show up in twin studies. Reading is not just a\nskill, it helps create a more mature, creative, and analytic mind.\n\nThe technical term for reading at a very early age is hyperlexia. But there\u2019s\nno evidence it has anything other than benefits in otherwise normal children.\nJohn Stuart Mill began to learn his first written language, Greek, at the age\nof three, while Samuel Johnson edged him out at two. One reason why so many\nfamous intellectuals started reading early is that small advantages compound\nin development (the technical term is the \u201cMatthew effect\u201d), which is why\nbirth year is so good at predicting academic performance. It\u2019s not\ngenetics\u2014kids born in September are simply older than their peers, and the\nminor advantage of being a bit ahead developmentally compounds significantly\nacademically (e.g., Nobel laureates from the UK are twice as likely to be born\nin September-November than June-August).\n\nUnfortunately, in the United States reading scores nationwide have been\ndeclining consistently since 2012 and are now back at 1980 levels according to\nthe National Center for Education Statistics. Having lost 40 years of\nprogress, it\u2019s easy to find shocking statistics, like how in Illinois alone\nthere are 30 schools where not one student was reading at grade level during\nthe 2021-2022 school year. At the recent State of the Union President Biden\nmade a shocking admission: that many children in the US education system do\nnot learn to read by the age of eight.\n\nThe pandemic bears some responsibility, but it only accelerated a previous\ndecay. TikTok is full of schoolteachers getting students who are 13 years old\nand saying literally that \u201cthese kids can\u2019t read\u201d\u2014not just individuals, but\nentire classes. Here\u2019s a college professor in Slate bemoaning the loss of\nliteracy in Gen Z.\n\n> I have been teaching in small liberal arts colleges for over 15 years now,\n> and in the past five years, it\u2019s as though someone flipped a switch... Now\n> students are intimidated by anything over 10 pages and seem to walk away\n> from readings of as little as 20 pages with no real understanding...\n> Considerable class time is taken up simply establishing what happened in a\n> story or the basic steps of an argument\u2014skills I used to be able to take for\n> granted.\n\nOne can find similar articles in places like The Chronicle of Higher Education\nor The New York Times, all saying the same thing. Personally, I know some\ncollege professors\u2014heck, I was one. Those on the inside say it too. Something\nhorrific has been quietly happening in education for the past decade, maybe\neven worse than the decline in test scores show.\n\nWith all that said, I want to stress that \u201cSchools are failing!\u201d or \u201cEarly\nreading correlates to X, Y, and Z\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s worth [blah blah] dollars in\nsalary when they\u2019re 35\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m adding my kid to the rank of child geniuses!\u201d\nare bad reasons to do it. The real reason to teach your toddler to read is for\ntheir immediate experience, for their quality of life. As much as we bemoan\nthe dangers of screens for young children, we also deny them the literacy that\nwould provide other options than TV for when parents need to send an email or\ncook dinner. And sparking a love of books is much easier if the child is\ninterested in language itself.\n\nPhilosophically, being able to read puts a child in communication with the\nlogic of the world around them. It gives them a mastery over events by making\nthe mechanisms of society legible, and this in turn gives them confidence.\nLabels are not mysteries to a literate child, nor displays, nor directions.\nSigns denote their signifiers. At STOP, cars stop. In all ways, the flow of\nthis world obeys language. It is a civilizing force for a child\u2019s personality,\nfor to be literate means to be living in the post-Mesopotamia age. It is\npossible that other animals, like whales or chimpanzees, have language and\ncould be said, under some definitions, to talk. No animal reads.\n\nIn the process of learning to read, a child is also learning to learn; indeed,\nthe ability to conscientiously interact with future teachers is, by itself,\nworth its weight in gold. It also means their first big learning experience\ntakes place not in the context of grades, or scores, or worksheets, but just\nlearning for the sake of learning, the way education should be in the best of\nall possible worlds. Other adults will respond positively to a child with\nhyperlexia (some are even openly astonished), and it\u2019s important for children\nto get positive feedback from non-parental adults\u2014it helps them feel they are\nnot an annoyance and approach social interactions with enthusiasm and bravery.\n\nFor the parent, the process is great too. How can I express the joy of running\naround celebrating when Roman got a difficult word correct, then tickling him\ndown in congratulations? Or how blown away I was when he started to make puns,\nseeing him realize that language qua language can be played with and enjoyed?\nThose were priceless experiences beyond any reptilian calculation of\n\u201cadvantage\u201d or icky \u201cparental ambitions.\u201d Toddlers like spending time with\ntheir parents, and teaching literacy lends a longterm project to do together.\nIt was fascinating for me intellectually too, as I got to witness things\nusually ascribed only to artificial neural networks, like overfitting,\ncatastrophic forgetting, and grokking.\n\nIt\u2019s true that, like with everything involving a toddler, from getting their\ncoat on to not having exactly what they want for dinner (regular nuggets not\ngood\u2014it must be dino nuggetttssssss) there is occasional friction. But the\nvast majority of the time Roman was happy and willing to learn because there\nwas a lot of play mixed in and the practice just became part of his schedule.\nIn fact, a lot of the time he learned to read while happily stuffing his face,\nsince our practice shifted to dinner, acting as basically just a secretly\nbeneficial distraction (he previously got bored while eating).\n\nIt\u2019s considered completely normal for parents to teach their kids to ride a\nbike or swim or play a favorite sport quite early on, all of which face the\nsame challenges of attention and repetition and require the same deployment of\nparental techniques and resources. What I found is that teaching a toddler to\nread required no greater coercion in comparison to the many other skills\nparents teach. It\u2019s just a longer process. You\u2019re still throwing the ball back\nand forth, but with language instead.\n\nHow does teaching your toddler to read actually work in practice? The best\nmethod is via phonics\u2014teaching the child how to sound out words. Specifically,\nI think the most efficient way to teach this young is to use phonics to create\na lower-dimensional rendering of the English language, one the toddler can\nlearn thoroughly first until they are reading sentences and even simple\nstories. Such a dimension reduction is still correct, even highly applicable,\nbut shorn of complexities (they can\u2019t just pick up an encyclopedia and start\nreading, since they\u2019ll run into words like, well, \u201cencyclopedia\u201d). But after\nan understanding of sentences is established, it\u2019s straightforward to expand\nto more complex rules and words.\n\nChildren all develop abilities at different speeds, and while many might not\nbe ready for reading at two (e.g., being so bursting with energy they can\u2019t\nattend for long enough), I believe many actually are, and also that a larger\nnumber are ready at three or four. That\u2019s still years before they enter\nkindergarten, and teaching them is still worth it for the same reasons (again,\ndepending on the circumstances).\n\nSo I\u2019ll be adding occasional installments about how to trigger hyperlexia here\non The Intrinsic Perspective (it won\u2019t interfere with the other subjects I\nwrite about). I\u2019ll overview the method and philosophy of my approach, but also\nactionable information about the flash cards I used, the tips and tricks, and\nother resources. I hope, as it unfolds, it\u2019ll become clear that teaching your\nchild to read is a synecdoche of the entire parental process, distilling its\ntrials and triumphs and joys (I guess I\u2019m joining the ranks of daddy bloggers\nnow).\n\nBecause it draws on my own life, and the above video is the limit of what I\u2019m\nwilling to post of my kid publicly, further installments will be for paid\nsubscribers only.\n\nOne last pitch for why parents should consider tutoring their child to read.\nThere\u2019s an old adage that working with your hands, actually creating something\nphysical, makes you feel psychologically more fulfilled, happier, than just\nmoving icons around on a computer screen. Well, it turns out the same goes for\nreally teaching someone something. Especially teaching a thing so fundamental\nthey\u2019ll use every day. I feel like I built an addition to his cognitive\narchitecture with my own hands. As an accomplishment it is ontologically\nsolid, visceral, real in a way difficult to access in this day and age. For\nthe rest of my life, I\u2019ll be proud I taught my son to read. Part of me will be\nwith him, always, at every word.\n\n### Subscribe to The Intrinsic Perspective\n\nBy Erik Hoel \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nBridging the two cultures of science and the humanities\n\n205 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n19 Restacks\n\n205\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to teach your two-year-old to read\n\nwww.theintrinsicperspective.com\n\n73\n\nShare\n\n73 Comments\n\nAndrew RoseGood VibrationsApr 24Liked by Erik HoelI'm so so excited to read\nthis series, Erik.

The first could\nread at two and was reading chapter books at four and adult books (e.g. To\nKill a Mockingbird) at eight. By nine-years-old he was completely off reading\nand has barely read a book since.The second didn't read until six and until\nshe was about ten or eleven she still preferred to have me read to her. She\njust got her Master's but the other day she said she wishes I would still read\nto her. She loves stories but just doesn't enjoy reading. I think having two\nchildren is the cure for thinking that parents can determine how their\nchildren develop.They can both read just fine. They just don't enjoy it. I'm a\nbook-addict and am always in a book.
