In Europe, the\nMiddle East and Africa, that figure came in a 30.7%; for the Asia-Pacific\nregion, it was 30.1%\n\nThe rapid innovation and adoption of generative AI among enterprises, smaller\ncompanies, and consumers has come with almost as many worries about security\nand privacy as it has with the promise of vast benefits in everything from how\nbusinesses run to how people interact with the various devices in their homes.\n\nThe story for developers is no different. \u201cDevelopers have relied on machine\nintelligence for years: automation, code completion, low-code development,\nstatic code analysis, and the like,\u201d cybersecurity company Trend Micro wrote.\n\u201cBut generative AI marks a distinct and major leap forward.\u201d\n\nThere are myriad generative AI products aimed at developers, from OpenAI\u2019s\nChatGPT chatbot \u2013 which helped kick off the land rush that is generative AI\nwhen it was released in November 2022 \u2013 and GitHub Copilot to Google\u2019s PaLM 2,\nCohere Generate, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, all of which can be used to help\ngenerate code. Each of them promises to make a developer\u2019s life better in oh-\nso-many ways.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nGenAI can improve the efficiency and productivity of software development\nworkflows by automating coding tasks and providing real-time code suggestions,\naccelerating the time to market for products and saving money. It allows for\nnatural language interfaces in development tools, improves code by identifying\nredundancy or inefficiency and enhances documentation, according to IBM.\n\nGlobal consultancy McKinsey and Company found in a study that developers can\ncomplete coding tasks twice as fast with genAI.\n\n### Code Security Benefits\n\nSuch benefits can also include improving security in the development process.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI can enhance code security by analyzing vast datasets to\nidentify vulnerabilities and suggest patches,\u201d Evans Data said in a statement.\n\u201cIt learns from historical security breaches to predict potential threats,\nautomatically generates secure coding patterns, and provides real-time\nfeedback to developers, significantly reducing the risk of security flaws in\nsoftware applications.\u201d\n\nIn addition, developers can use the technology to automatically create test\ncases, which means they can identify potential issues earlier in the\ndevelopment process, according to IBM. Plus, IBM claimed, \u201cBy analyzing large\ncodebases, generative AI can assist software development teams in identifying\nand even automatically fixing bugs. This can lead to more robust and reliable\nsoftware, as well as faster development cycles.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA, whose GPUs are cornerstones in many of the large language models\n(LLMs) that underpin generative AI tools, notes that the technology can create\nsynthetic data to simulate previously unseen attack patterns, run safe\nsimulated attacks to test defenses, and analyze vulnerabilities, a time-\nconsuming task when done only by developers. \u201cAn LLM focused on vulnerability\nanalysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first,\u201d\nthe company wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly powerful security assistant because it\nreads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the\nfeatures and APIs it supports.\u201d\n\n### And Yet, Dangers\n\nAll that said, there are dangers and risks lurking in generative AI that\ndevelopers need to keep in mind. The open-source OWASP organization in a\nreport detail 10 types of vulnerabilities for AI apps built with LLMs, ranging\nfrom data leakage and prompt injections to insecure plug-ins, supply-chain\nrisks, and misinformation or \u201challucinations.\u201d\n\nJacob Schmitt, senior technical content marketing manager for continuous\nintegration and continuous development (CI/CD) platform maker CircleCI, noted\nthe benefits that come with using generative \u201cin the right way,\u201d \u201cthe\ntechnology poses inherent risks that demand careful consideration and ongoing\nvigilance against the potential for introducing errors, security\nvulnerabilities, compliance issues, and ethical concerns into your code base.\u201d\n\nSchmitt noted a few examples: poor or inefficient code quality that doesn\u2019t\nmeet a company\u2019s standards, for one. A lack of visibility into the generative\nAI-generated code, for another \u2014 where even the code works, it might be\ndifficult to understand its logic. Given that many LLMs are trained on both\npublic and proprietary code, software created with generative AI may violate\ncopyright laws or leak proprietary or sensitive information, violating\nregulations around data privacy and security.\n\nIn addition, AI models trained on large code repositories could including\nexploitable patterns or known vulnerabilities that could inadvertently find\ntheir way into a developer\u2019s work. Schmitt also warned about increasing an\norganization\u2019s technical debt, \u201cthe cumulative consequences of suboptimal\ndesign choices, shortcuts, or compromises made during development.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccumulated technical debt can lead to decreased code maintainability,\nincreased development time for future enhancements or bug fixes, and higher\ncosts in the long run,\u201d Schmitt wrote. \u201cCrucially, the extent of the technical\ndebt you are likely to accrue depends on how you deploy and integrate\ngenerative AI into your development workflow.\u201d\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n  * CoralRaider Group Delivers Three Infostealers via CDN Cache\n  * HHS Strengthens Privacy of Reproductive Health Care Data\n  * UnitedHealth: Ransomware Attackers Stole Huge Amount of Data\n\nMore from Jeffrey Burt\n\nApril 25, 2024April 25, 2024 Jeffrey Burt AI Security, DevOps and security,\nevans data, generative AI, Software Developers\n\n  * \u2190 AI Adoption Prompts Security Advisory from NSA\n\n#### Jeffrey Burt\n\nJeffrey Burt has been a journalist for more than three decades, writing about\ntechnology since 2000.
