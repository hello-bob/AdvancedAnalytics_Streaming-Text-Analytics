EC2 Instances (M7i-Flex and\nM7i)\n\nby Jeff Barr | on 02 AUG 2023 | in Amazon EC2, Announcements, Launch, News | Permalink | Share\n\nToday we are launching Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) M7i-Flex and\nM7i instances powered by custom 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors\navailable only on AWS, that offer the best performance among comparable Intel\nprocessors in the cloud \u2013 up to 15% faster than Intel processors utilized by\nother cloud providers. M7i-Flex instances are available in the five most\ncommon sizes, and are designed to give you up to 19% better price/performance\nthan M6i instances for many workloads. The M7i instances are available in nine\nsizes (with two size of bare metal instances in the works), and offer 15%\nbetter price/performance than the previous generation of Intel-powered\ninstances.\n\nM7i-Flex Instances The M7i-Flex instances are a lower-cost variant of the M7i\ninstances, with 5% better price/performance and 5% lower prices. They are\ngreat for applications that don\u2019t fully utilize all compute resources. The\nM7i-Flex instances deliver a baseline of 40% CPU performance, and can scale up\nto full CPU performance 95% of the time. M7i-Flex instances are ideal for\nrunning general purpose workloads such as web and application servers, virtual\ndesktops, batch processing, micro-services, databases and enterprise\napplications. If you are currently using earlier generations of general-\npurposes instances, you can adopt M7i-Flex instances without having to make\nchanges to your application or your workload.\n\nHere are the specs for the M7i-Flex instances:\n\nInstance Name| vCPUs| Memory| Network Bandwidth| EBS Bandwidth  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nm7i-flex.large| 2| 8 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i-flex.xlarge| 4| 16 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i-flex.2xlarge| 8| 32 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i-flex.4xlarge| 16| 64 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i-flex.8xlarge| 32| 128 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \n  \nM7i Instances For workloads such as large application servers and databases,\ngaming servers, CPU based machine learning, and video streaming that need the\nlargest instance sizes or high CPU continuously, you can get price/performance\nbenefits by using M7i instances.\n\nHere are the specs for the M7i instances:\n\nInstance Name| vCPUs| Memory| Network Bandwidth| EBS Bandwidth  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nm7i.large| 2| 8 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i.xlarge| 4| 16 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i.2xlarge| 8| 32 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i.4xlarge| 16| 64 GiB| up to 12.5 Gbps| up to 10 Gbps  \nm7i.8xlarge| 32| 128 GiB| 12.5 Gbps| 10 Gbps  \nm7i.12xlarge| 48| 192 GiB| 18.75 Gbps| 15 Gbps  \nm7i.16xlarge| 64| 256 GiB| 25.0 Gbps| 20 Gbps  \nm7i.24xlarge| 96| 384 GiB| 37.5 Gbps| 30 Gbps  \nm7i.48xlarge| 192| 768 GiB| 50 Gbps| 40 Gbps  \n  \nYou can attach up to 128 EBS volumes to each M7i instance; by way of\ncomparison, the M6i instances allow you to attach up to 28 volumes.\n\nWe are also getting ready to launch two sizes of bare metal M7i instances:\n\nInstance Name| vCPUs| Memory| Network Bandwidth| EBS Bandwidth  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nm7i.metal-24xl| 96| 384 GiB| 37.5 Gbps| 30 Gbps  \nm7i.metal-48xl| 192| 768 GiB| 50.0 Gbps| 40 Gbps  \n  \nBuilt-In Accelerators The Sapphire Rapids processors include four built-in\naccelerators, each providing hardware acceleration for a specific workload:\n\n  * Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) \u2013 This set of extensions to the x86 instruction set improve deep learning and inferencing, and support workloads such as natural language processing, recommendation systems, and image recognition. The extensions provide high-speed multiplication operations on 2-dimensional matrices of INT8 or BF16 values. To learn more, read Chapter 3 of the Intel AMX Instruction Set Reference.\n  * Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA) \u2013 This accelerator drives high performance for storage, networking, and data-intensive workloads by offloading common data movement tasks between CPU, memory, caches, network devices, and storage devices, improving streaming data movement and transformation operations. Read Introducing the Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (Intel DSA) to learn more.\n  * Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (IAA) \u2013 This accelerator runs database and analytic workloads faster, with the potential for greater power efficiency. In-memory compression, decompression, and encryption at very high throughput, and a suite of analytics primitives support in-memory databases, open source database, and data stores like RocksDB and ClickHouse. To learn more, read the Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel IAA) Architecture Specification.\n  * Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) -This accelerator offloads encryption, decryption, and compression, freeing up processor cores and reducing power consumption. It also supports merged compression and encryption in a single data flow. To learn more start at the Intel QuickAssist Technology (Intel QAT) Overview.\n\nSome of these accelerators require the use of specific kernel versions,\ndrivers, and/or compilers.\n\nThe Advanced Matrix Extensions are available on all sizes of M7i and M7i-Flex\ninstances. The Intel QAT, Intel IAA, and Intel DSA accelerators will be\navailable on the m7i.metal-24xl and m7i.metal-48xl instances.\n\nDetails Here are a couple of things to keep in mind about the M7i-Flex and M7i\ninstances:\n\nRegions \u2013 The new instances are available in the US East (Ohio, N.
