The Scottish\nphysicist James Clerk Maxwell had already concluded on theoretical grounds\nthat radio waves, being electromagnetic like light, could possibly be\nreflected from flat metal objects, and this was demonstrated experimentally in\n1888 by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz. By 1904, another German named\nChristian H\u00fclsmeyer had already patented a device that he called an \u201cobstacle\ndetector\u201d which could be used on board ships to avoid icebergs, rocks or other\nvessels at a distance. H\u00fclsmeyer approached the navies of several countries\nwith his idea, but none of them were interested. That changed in the 1920s, as\ncombat aircraft and naval guns became more sophisticated and capable. Now,\ntargets could be attacked at long range, and by 1930, research on radar was\nbeing carried out, in great secrecy, in the US, UK, Germany, France, USSR,\nItaly, Holland, and Japan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nIn the United States, this work was being done at the Naval Research\nLaboratory in Washington DC. In 1930, the Lab was carrying out experiments\nwith a setup using two separate antennae, one for transmitting and one for\nreceiving, and was able to successfully detect aircraft, but this system was\nlarge and cumbersome, which limited its usefulness. Things improved\ntremendously when the Lab figured out how to incorporate both sending and\nreceiving in the same antenna. That caught the interest of military\ncommanders, and by 1939 the US Navy had deployed a number of crude but\neffective radar sets to detect incoming aircraft and ships at sea.\n\nThe British were also working on radar, and by 1939 they had begun installing\na string of radar stations, codenamed \u201cChain Home\u201d, along the coast with the\nexpress purpose of detecting German aircraft as they crossed the English\nChannel. The Germans, meanwhile, were working on their own radar system, but\nit was not as capable as the British.\n\nThe Blitz, however, demonstrated to the RAF that what they really needed was a\nradar system that had better resolution and range, could detect and track\nsmaller objects, and, above all, was small and light enough to be carried\naloft in an airplane or mounted on small ships like destroyers. This was\nsimply impossible with the vacuum-tube technology of the time.\n\nThen there was a technological breakthrough.\n\nTwo British researchers at the University of Birmingham named John Randall and\nHenry Boot were already working on a device that would become known as the\n\u201ccavity magnetron\u201d. In simple terms, this worked on much the same principle as\nblowing across the mouth of an empty bottle to produce a sound\u2014but the\nmagnetron used a beam of electrons instead of air. Just as bottles of\ndifferent size and shape produce different tones, different arrangements of\ncavities in the magnetron produced radio waves of different frequencies.\n\nBy February 1940, Randall and Boot had produced a prototype radar with a\nwavelength of just 10 centimeters, giving it much superior resolution, and a\nfew months later they were able to produce power outputs of over a megawatt,\ngiving it superb long range. Best of all, the magnetron\u2019s small size meant it\ncould easily be carried in the bomber and fighter planes of the period.\n\nThe British knew that this new radar system would be of enormous importance in\nthe war, but with England under near-daily air attack by the Luftwaffe,\nChurchill feared that they would never be able to fully develop it. So, he\ndecided to bring the United States and its immense industrial power into the\npicture. In September 1940, a committee was dispatched to Washington DC to\ninform the Americans about the top secret British device (even though the US\nwas supposed to be technically \u201cneutral\u201d in the war). The Americans instantly\ngrasped the significance of the discovery, and began immediate efforts to\nproduce the British radar and to improve upon it. And much of this work was\ncentered at MIT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nOne of the people involved in this was John G. Trump. The younger brother of\nreal estate mogul Fred Trump (and the uncle of Donald Trump), John had earned\na doctorate in electrical engineering and was a professor at MIT. After the\nBritish showed up with their magnetron, however, MIT set up a specialized lab\nfor radar research that was known as the \u201cRad Lab\u201d, and Trump took a position\nas secretary to the lab\u2019s Director, Alfred Loomis. When in February 1944 the\nUS and UK decided to send a select group of specialists\u2014the \u201cBritish Branch of\nthe Radiation Laboratory\u201d\u2014to England to coordinate their joint efforts, Trump\nwas sent along as Director.\n\nWithin a short time, Trump was applying his technical expertise and his\norganizational experience to radar research. He was selected by the US Army\nAir Force to serve on the \u201cAdvisory Specialist Group on Radar\u201d, which kept\nGeneral Carl Spaatz informed about radar developments. Working with the\nBritish, Trump and his American team oversaw the development and deployment of\nvirtually every radar and radio-navigation system that was introduced during\nthe war, including radar systems that were used for naval and anti-aircraft\ngun fire control, night fighter interception, bomber navigation, locating\nsurfaced submarines, and long-range early warning of enemy ships and\nairplanes. In addition, Trump\u2019s lab was involved in designing counter-measures\nfor German radar systems. Throughout the second half of the war, Allied\ntechnological systems were vastly superior to the Germans or Japanese, and\nthey played a decisive role in the defeat of the Axis.\n\nAt the end of the war, Trump was appointed to interview and debrief captured\nand surrendered Nazi radar technicians and operators to learn as much as\npossible about the German technology. In recognition of his wartime work,\nTrump was decorated by both the UK and US, receiving the King\u2019s Medal for\nService in the Cause of Freedom from King George VI and the President\u2019s\nCertificate of Merit from Harry Truman. He died in 1985, and was remembered as\na genuine war hero.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Post a Comment Cancel reply\n\n## Forgotten mysteries, oddities and unknown stories from history, nature and\nscience.\n\n# \u201cThe Nuclear Tourist\u201d, available at Amazon.Com: click here to order\n\n# \u201cThe Civil War Tourist\u201d, available at Amazon.Com: click here to order\n\n# \u201cThe Revolutionary War Tourist\u201d, available at Amazon.Com: Click here to\norder:\n\n# \u201cIcons of Aviation History 1900-1945\u201d Available at Amazon.Com: Click here to\norder\n\n# \u201cWild Florida\u201d, available at Amazon.Com: click here to order:\n\n# \u201cFlorida\u2019s Invaders\u201d, available at Amazon.Com: click here to order:\n\n# Recent Comments\n\nDavid Windhorst on Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s Rifl...  \n---  \nBucket Helmet Gladia... on Roman Gladiator Types  \n\u4e2d\u60c5\u5c40\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u6d6a\u732b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u95f4\u8c0d\u7684\u51b7\u6218\u8ba1\u5212 -... on The CIA\u2019s Cold War Plan...  \nLenny Flank on The CIA\u2019s Cold War Plan...  \nJ.Tokarz on The SL-1 Nuclear Reactor Accid...  \n  \n# This Month\u2019s Posts\n\n# Search Hidden History Blog\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Hidden History\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
