After the administration called in the New York City\npolice department in a failed attempt to evict the encampment, students across\nthe country established encampments and occupations of their own. In the\nfollowing analysis, participants in the movement explore the strategic\nquestions it confronts today.\n\n# Why the State Can\u2019t Compromise with the Movement in Solidarity with Gaza\n\nAfter students began occupying Columbia in solidarity with Palestinians,\nstudent occupations and encampments spread like wildfire, occupying over one\nhundred universities around the world. Well over two thousand students have\nbeen arrested. Each day has seen new occupations and new tactics. Again and\nagain, police repression has outraged students, professors, and community\nmembers, drawing larger numbers to more and more militant demonstrations. The\nmovement for Palestinian liberation is growing by leaps and bounds in the\nUnited States as a consequence of the bravery of demonstrators and blockaders\nover the past six months\u2014most recently, thanks to occupiers who have been\nwilling to risk arrest, police brutality, defamation, doxxing, and expulsion.\n\nOn April 30, police staged a militarized raid on Columbia University, locking\nother students and faculty members inside dormitories and campus housing and\nholding them hostage while they brutalized and arrested demonstrators. Similar\nscenes played out at the City University of New York (CUNY). Police have\nlaunched tear gas at students at the University of South Florida in Tampa,\nallowed fascists and Zionists to attack an encampment at the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles (UCLA) with pepper spray and fireworks, and engaged\nin skirmishes with students across the country.\n\nYet as repression has escalated, so has resistance. The movement gained its\ninitial momentum when students at Columbia immediately reestablished an\nencampment after police evicted the first one. Similar stories have played out\nfrom Texas to California and Illinois. When the Los Angeles Police Department\njoined fascists in attempting to evict the Gaza solidarity encampment at UCLA,\nprotesters with helmets and shields held them at bay for eight hours.\n\nWhy are the police being so heavy-handed? Why are the media contorting\nthemselves into increasingly bizarre contradictions to condemn the protests?\nWhy are the Democrats and the Republicans united in opposing these protests?\nAnd how is it that, in their haste to crack down, university administrations,\npoliticians, and police appear to have forgotten the basic principles of\nprotest management?\n\nDemonstrators face off with the police from behind a barricade on UCLA campus\non May 1, 2024.\n\n## Where We Are\n\nWhat follows is a brief attempt to address those questions, in hopes of\ngetting oriented in the new terrain that is opening up before us.\n\n### The basic demand to see Palestinians as human beings is incompatible with\nthe agendas of the United States government and universities.\n\nThe US needs Israel as a strategic partner to maintain a foothold in the\nMiddle East; universities rely on funding from and research relationships with\nthe military, arms manufacturers, and Zionists.^1 It is impossible to\nacknowledge that Palestinians are entitled to the universal human rights that\nform the basis of the US empire\u2019s claim to moral legitimacy while continuing\nto supply the weaponry, funding, and diplomatic cover necessary for the\nIsraeli military to continue killing civilians and destroying their homes.\nThese protests reveal deep-seated contradictions between discourse and\npractice that the government, corporate media platforms, and universities are\ndetermined to conceal.\n\nThey know full well that they are complicit in genocide\u2014yet, like any bully,\nthey double down on their lies when confronted. There is simply no space in\nthe US government or media to acknowledge opposition to Israeli settler-\ncolonialism as a morally defensible position. This explains the unification of\nDemocrats and Republicans in opposition to the protests as well as the intense\nrepression that the authorities immediately meted out. It also explains the\nincredible rhetorical acrobatics on display from media outlets as they excuse\npolice for beating large numbers of demonstrators\u2014many of whom are Jewish\u2014in\nthe name of combatting anti-Semitism. This is especially egregious as mass\ngraves are uncovered in Gaza, Israeli bombardments continue, and Netanyahu\ncontinues to promise a ground invasion of Rafah, even after slaughtering over\n35,000 Palestinians, over two thirds of whom were women and children.\n\n### University administrations are caught in an impossible position.\n\nFrom one side, despite their inherent institutional conservatism, the\nuniversities face an escalating frontal assault by right-wing politicians on\nboth the state and federal levels, not to mention the threat of capital flight\nleveraged by billionaire donors. On the other side, the universities are\nexperiencing a mass revolt from students and faculty mobilizing around the\nseemingly reasonable demand that they stop supporting the mass murder of\nchildren and the attempt to erase an entire people. The only way the\nadministrations can imagine that they might survive the former is by cracking\ndown on the latter as hard as possible.\n\nThey are forced to justify this in the name of free speech and safety, even as\nthe police they bring in shoot live rounds at random inside campus buildings.\nLikewise, although many of the protest encampments represent the most\nsuccessful voluntary collaboration between Muslim and Jewish students taking\nplace anywhere in the world today, the administrations have claimed that it\nwas necessary to destroy them in order to keep the peace.\n\nPolice carrying out a militarized raid of a Gaza solidarity encampment to\n\u201ckeep the peace\u201d and protect student \u201csafety.\u201d\n\n### Accusations of anti-Semitism are cynical lies coming from administrators\nand politicians who have already showed that they could not care less about\nprotecting students from actual white nationalists.\n\nThe same university administrators who used \u201cfree speech\u201d as an excuse to\nvilify and arrest students for protesting against white nationalists speaking\non campus are now attacking and brutalizing anti-Zionist Jewish and\nPalestinian protestors in the name of protecting Jewish students from anti-\nSemitism. Free speech and student safety are both false pretenses: the truth\nis that university administrations and police will seek to destroy any force\nthat actively challenges their power. This explains the previously unthinkable\nalliance between Republicans who refuse to disavow white nationalists in their\nown party, Democrats who champion genocide in the name of resisting anti-\nSemitism, and university administrators.\n\n### The Democrats are attacking these struggles because it is impossible to\nincorporate them into the left wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nThere is no way for Democrats to give the Israeli government carte blanche to\ncarry out genocide while buying the votes of those who believe that the lives\nof Palestinians have inherent value. This makes for a situation that may be\nunique among all the mass struggles in recent history.\n\nCentrist media outlets and Democratic politicians were prepared to countenance\nthe George Floyd Uprising of 2020 in hopes of drawing activists back into the\nfold of policy negotiations. They thought that they could exploit those\nprotests to build an electoral base against Trump during an election year.\n\nThis moment is different. It is impossible for the Democrats to budge at all\nnow because both parties have hinged their political platforms on unequivocal\nsupport of the Israeli government, condemning any opposition as anti-Semitic.\nDemocratic politicians have continued doubling down on that position even as\nit has become more and more preposterous. The fact that the Democrats now\ncontrol the federal government prevents them from benefiting from outrage\nagainst what is effectively a bipartisan policy.\n\nIn that sense, there is a sort of symmetry here. While the (first?) Trump era\nended with the George Floyd Uprising, cementing the ascendancy of direct\naction tactics at the culmination of four years of resistance to Trump, the\nBiden era appears to be ending with a conflagration of its own, signifying an\nirreparable break between the centrists and the autonomous movements they have\nlong sought to co-opt.\n\nThe barricades around the Gaza solidarity encampment at UCLA.\n\n### We should read the violent repression and media slander as a sign of the\nrigidity and vulnerability of those in power.\n\nThey are defending a fundamentally untenable position with an apparently\nirrational amount of violence. Likewise, corporate media pundits are decrying\nus despite the fact that the demand to stop the genocide is more popular than\neither presidential candidate\u2014according to one recent poll, 55% of Americans\ndisapprove of Israel\u2019s military actions, while only 36% approve. The fact that\nthe movement has grown in numbers and ferocity despite so much repression is a\nsign of its vitality and strength.\n\nThis situation is somewhat reminiscent of the circumstances in which the\nmovement for Black Lives originally got off the ground. A decade ago, when the\nrevolt in Ferguson broke out in response to the murder of Michael Brown, it\nwas difficult even to obtain information about how many people police killed\nevery year; abolitionists were among the only people addressing the issue. As\na consequence, the movement gained momentum as that question gained traction\namong the general public, because practically no one else was offering a\npersuasive account of what was occurring or why. Similarly, the fact that\nneither Republicans nor Democrats are willing to acknowledge the truth about\nwhat is happening in Gaza, who opposes the genocide, and why they oppose it\nconstitutes a tremendous vulnerability for them.\n\n### Politicians are terrified of the protests, but they are even more\nterrified by the prospect that the protests could continue past the end of the\nschool year, spilling over the bounds of the campus and into a long, hot,\nsummer.\n\nIt is the responsibility of anyone trying to stop this genocide to ensure that\ntheir nightmare becomes a reality. And it could: the George Floyd Uprising is\nstill alive in the memories of the millions of people who participated.\n\nThe state wants to smash these protests before they expand. Anyone who truly\naims to end the genocide in Gaza should want this political crisis to expand\nand deepen. In the long run, the only way to end the genocide in Gaza will be\nto the dismantle the American war machine and the corporate board rooms that\ndrive it.\n\n## Potential Pitfalls\n\nIf the foregoing hypotheses are correct, then there are several pitfalls that\nparticipants in this movement should be careful to avoid.\n\n### Every occupation that disbands after winning minor concessions will only\npave the way for genocide.\n\nThe original Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University began by\nrejecting empty promises:\n\n> The administration sent representatives to negotiate. In the first round,\n> they offered a \u201cnon-binding, university-wide divestment referendum\u201d\u2014an\n> unimpressive offer, since the university had refused to take any action\n> after a similar referendum passed at Columbia College in 2020 with 61% of\n> the vote.\n\nThe wave of encampments around the country was only possible because the\nstudents at Columbia refused to fall into that trap again.\n\nAbandoning the encampments and the spirit of confrontation that has made them\npossible means closing the space of political possibility that we desperately\nneed right now. It means shutting down the zone of potential encounters, where\nparticipants can experience the sort of political and tactical development\nthat will be necessary to build a post-imperial, anti-colonial form of life.\n\nAt the same time, the only way that these occupations can actually stop the\ngenocide will be by catalyzing a much larger social explosion and political\ncrisis. The terrain at stake here is much larger than the university\u2014and the\nparticipants in every occupation should operate with that in mind. Our\nobjective should not be to obtain promises, or committees, or even divestment,\nper se; our goal should be to bring about Palestinian liberation as an aspect\nof total liberation. We should evaluate every tactic according to whether it\ncan enable us to advance towards those goals, understanding that Palestinian\nliberation will only come about as the result of a full-scale political crisis\nin the United States.\n\n### Do not let \u201ccentering Palestine\u201d serve as a rationale to become less\ndisruptive.\n\nThe war machine killing Palestinians is an essential part of the war-making\ninstitutions of the US empire, which includes not only universities and\nweapons contractors, but the economy itself. All of these are interconnected\nwith other governments and colonial projects around the world. Stopping the\ngenocide of the Palestinians means challenging every aspect of the prevailing\nworld order.\n\nThe voices of most of those who suffer as a consequence of that order are\nrarely heard within the walls of universities.\n\n### This is about you, too.\n\nAs the struggle against Cop City in Atlanta has made clear, the oppression of\nthe Palestinian people represents a blueprint for a possible future for all of\nus. In fighting for a free Palestine, we are fighting for our own future, as\nwell. Acknowledging this should strengthen our resolve to put an immediate\nstop to the genocide.\n\nPalestinians have been steadfast in their solidarity with struggles in\nAmerica, from Ferguson to the uprising of 2020 and beyond. Students at\nColumbia University articulated these connections when they began chanting\n\u201cStop Cop City\u201d during the police raid on April 30. Cop City is everywhere,\nthe roots of the genocide in Gaza are everywhere, resistance is everywhere.\n\n### Those concerned with their personal safety should not deny others the\nfreedom to take risks that they are willing to accept.\n\nThere is no shame in being afraid for your safety. This is an increasingly\nfrightening situation. The question is how we can build the collective\ncapacity to take the risks\u2014and endure the consequences\u2014necessary to create a\nworld without state terror. One of the minimum conditions for this undertaking\nis that we must not attempt to dictate to others what actions should be\npossible or acceptable.\n\nIf you are not prepared for the risks that you perceive to be associated with\na particular tactic or strategy, do not attempt to prevent others from\nemploying or pursuing it. Simply look for another role you could play or a\ncomplementary strategy you could pursue.\n\n> \u201cWhat I mean by \u2018daring\u2019 is a readiness to walk into terrain which none of\n> us explored before. What I mean by \u2018caution\u2019 is the perception that our\n> ability to approach this terrain grows only to the extent that all those\n> like us approach it with equal daring. We\u2019re reaching for a field of\n> possibilities that can be reached only if we move together as we\u2019ve never\n> moved before; we proceed with caution because those who move too far ahead\n> will be caught without a lifeline to the rest. What I think is taking place\n> around me is an advance consisting of small steps taken by all\n> simultaneously. Each small step creates the conditions for taking the next.\n> Any move that prevents the continued advance of all cuts off the possibility\n> of further advance by any.\u201d\n>\n> -Fredy Perlman\n\nThis risk assessment matrix might assist you in making decisions about risk\nand consequence.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, genocide has been understood as the\nclearest example of absolute evil. \u201cNever again!\u201d has been held up as a moral\nimperative. Although the United States has used this narrative cynically on\nnumerous occasions to justify military intervention, it nonetheless expressed\nthe laudable judgment of people of conscience everywhere.\n\nThe current conflict amounts to this: either the United States empire must be\ndismantled or the conscience of a whole generation will be destroyed.\n\nIn view of these stakes, the participants in every encampment and\noccupation\u2014including the ones that have been forcibly evicted\u2014should consider\nthe following strategic questions.\n\nWhat is the next step in escalation? How will you respond to a raid, an\neviction, or slow death by committee? What is your plan if Israel begins a\nground invasion of Rafah? Will you take a building, march downtown and impose\neconomic consequences, blockade highways and ports, or something entirely new?\nIf the encampments become impossible to defend, what is the next step that\nallows people to continue struggling together?\n\nHow do we keep growing after the semester ends? How can on-campus struggles\nbenefit from non-student support? Can the power built on campuses overflow\ninto the communities that surround them?\n\nHow do we shift antagonism away from university administrators, whom\npoliticians are currently using as sacrificial shields, towards the\nadversaries whose defeat would actually impede the war machine? Divesting from\nwar profiteers is a good first step; occupying factories and blockading ports\nwould be a logical escalation. Who are the billionaires and vested money\ninterests forcing the crackdown on campuses? Who has the most to lose from\nputting an end to unconditional US support for the Israeli military\u2019s colonial\nviolence?\n\nHow can we act now in ways that will prepare us to confront the likely return\nof Donald Trump to power in January 2025? We will need every tactical\ninnovation, every new relationship, every network and form of infrastructure\nthat we can build to confront the full force of right-wing fascism that looms\nin our future. We are in a moment when history cracks open and countless new\npossibilities and dangers emerge as the old order crumbles.\n\nWhat comes next could be terrifying. But our part in the story is up to us.\n\n  1. While anti-Semitic fascists have sought to spread the narrative that Israel controls the United States, it is the other way around: Israel is the junior partner in the relationship, serving a purpose for the United States government, just as Christian nationalists in the US treat Israelis as pawns within their agenda. \u21a9\n\n## Share this article\n\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Tumblr\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Analysis\n  * Current Events\n\nTags:\n\n  * gaza solidarity\n  * palestine\n  * student movement\n  * occupation\n  * encampment\n\n  * \u2039 Previous: Defending the Camp\n  * The Encampments Spread to Mexico: Next \u203a\n\n# Related Articles\n\n## Analysis\n\n##\n\nSteal Something from Work Day 2024\n\n###\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Even the Score!\n\n##\n\n2023 in Chile: 50 Years of the Military Coup\n\n###\n\nNeoliberal Consolidation after the Revolt of 2019\n\n##\n\n\u201cThis Is What Our Ruling Class Has Decided Will Be Normal\u201d\n\n###\n\nOn Aaron Bushnell\u2019s Action in Solidarity with Gaza\n\n## Current Events\n\n##\n\nThe Encampments Spread to Mexico\n\n###\n\nThe Palestine Solidarity Camp at UNAM in Mexico City: An Interview\n\n##\n\nDefending the Camp\n\n###\n\nA Report from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Gaza Solidarity\nEncampment\n\n##\n\nFrom Redwood Trees to Olive Groves, the Commune Grows\n\n###\n\nA Statement from the Tree Occupation at Cal Poly Humboldt\n\n# About CrimethInc.\n\nCrimethInc. is a rebel alliance\u2014a decentralized network pledged to anonymous\ncollective action\u2014a breakout from the prisons of our age.
