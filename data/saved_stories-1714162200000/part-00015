It sits there, starting off in the morning\nin a certain state. The sun comes out and proceeds to warm it up. Its\ntemperature climbs through the day until the sun sets, whereupon it cools\nthrough the night. The cycle starts again the next morning. The rock is going\nthrough a series of states throughout the day.\n\nWe can model the changing states of the rock with a computational model, which\nwe\u2019ll call R. However, if we can model the rock with that computation, then we\ncan regard the rock to be implementing that computation. In other words, the\nrock can be seen as a computational system implementing the algorithm R.\n\nSuppose we want to consider the rock to be implementing something other than\nR? In truth, there are probably numerous computational models that would\ndescribe what is happening in the rock, depending on the level of detail we\nwant to work at and perspective that we want to take. But suppose we want to\ninterpret the rock to be doing something non-rockish.\n\nWell, we can create a new model, which we\u2019ll call R+M (rock + mapping). Let\u2019s\nimplement a clock algorithm with R+M. Naively, this might seem\nstraightforward. The rock\u2019s temperature will vary throughout the day, so all\nwe need to do is map each temperature to a specific time. That\u2019s what M adds\nto the model. Viola, we\u2019ve interpreted a rock to be implementing a clock.\n\nBut is the rock really implementing a clock algorithm? Before you answer,\nconsider that if you ran a clock algorithm on your computer, the actual\nsequence of states inside your computer could be modeled at a much more primal\nphysical level involving transistor voltage states, which might bear limited\nresemblance to a high level clock model. We\u2019ll call this primal model C. Your\ncomputer has an I/O (input/output) system, which maps C into presenting all\nthe things a clock would present. We\u2019ll call the overall model of this C+M\n(computer+mapping).\n\nIt\u2019s not C by itself which provides the clock, but C+M. What\u2019s the functional\ndifference between R+M and C+M? Certainly R and C are radically different, but\naren\u2019t we compensating for those differences by their respective versions of\nM?\n\nIf we can do this to consider the rock to be implementing a clock, can\u2019t we do\nit with more sophisticated algorithms? Suppose we want to consider the rock to\nbe running Microsoft Word. So we implement a new R+M model, but this time M\nadds everything to map the rock temperature states to the computational states\nof Word.\n\nBut if we can do that, is there then any computation, any algorithm we can\u2019t\nconsider the rock to be implementing?\n\nIf the mind is computation, couldn\u2019t we then extend R+M to be a conscious\nmind? In other words, with the right perspective, isn\u2019t every rock\nimplementing a conscious mind? Not just one mind, but every conceivable mind?\nIn other words, if the computational theory of mind is correct, and we can map\nthe sequence of states for any complex object, isn\u2019t the universe teeming with\nconsciousness?\n\nBefore you start having any concern about the way you might have treated the\nlast rock you encountered, let\u2019s back up a bit. In the first scenario of R+M\nabove, we mapped the states of the rock to a clock. But this is problematic\nbecause the rock has variances in its inputs that the clock model doesn\u2019t. For\nexample, cloud cover and other weather conditions may affect exactly how warm\nthe rock becomes and there may be other environmental factors. When these come\ninto play, we may find our R+M clock being a bit unreliable.\n\nNo problem. We\u2019ll just put in some adjustments into the mapping M. When the\nweather is overcast, or if it\u2019s raining, or windy, we\u2019ll adjust which\ntemperature maps to which time to take into account the weather.\n\nExcept now, is our mapping still just a mapping? It\u2019s taking in its own\ninputs, performing its own logic, and essentially dynamically adjusting as\nneeded to insure that the states of the rock map to the states of a clock. Of\ncourse, to have implemented Word or a mind, we would have to take similar\nalbeit much more aggressive steps in the mappings for those algorithms. Does\nit still make sense to say the rock is implementing a clock, or Word, or a\nmind?\n\nIf two implementations of a piece of functionality are not physically\nidentical, then isn\u2019t it a judgment call whether they are functionally the\nsame? Algorithm X executing on a desktop PC is not physically identical to\nalgorithm X executing on an iPhone. Both implementations may have originated\nfrom the same source code, the same action plan in essence, but we would still\nneed a mapping between the physical processes is necessary to consider them to\nbe the same. Run algorithm X on a quantum processor, and the mapping might\nbecome extremely complex.\n\nSo our rock is implementing every algorithm? There have been a number of\nproposals to explain why this isn\u2019t true.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s been pointed out that, in the case of something like a rock, the\nmappings are created after the fact, observing what happens in the rock and\ncreating a framework to map it to a meaningful algorithm. This certainly makes\nthe rock unusable as a computing tool. But does that mean it isn\u2019t actually\nimplementing the algorithm?\n\nAnother criticism, related to the first, is that the mapped algorithms are\nfragile, falling into incoherence if the rock\u2019s state transitions don\u2019t flow\nin just the right way. In other words, the algorithm isn\u2019t just one of many\nthe rock could be implementing, but the only one it could be implementing with\nthe given interpretation.\n\nThat leads to challenges involving causality and dispositional states. The\nreasons why the rock moves from one state to another have no relation to why\nthe (reliable) clock, or Word, or a mind move from one state to another. Each\nstate has a dispositional nature, that together with inputs into the system,\ncausally lead to the next state. If the physical state\u2019s dispositions don\u2019t\nhave some logical resemblance to the disposition of the computational model\u2019s\nstate, then the mappings are arbitrary.\n\nThere are other criticisms. Is the rock really a computational system? We\nspend a lot of money to purchase computational devices which are only created\nwith a lot of engineering. If the mind is a computational system, evolution\ninvested a lot of resources developing its computational substrate in the\nbrain. We don\u2019t run Word on just any matter. Minds can\u2019t exist in just any\npiece of biological matter. In both cases, it takes a very specialized\nstructure. Regarding the rock as equivalent to a brain or silicon chip seems\nto ignore these important facts.\n\nSo, how complex can the mapping become before it is invalid? What specifically\nmakes it invalid? Do the objections laid out above resolve the issue?\n\nMy own answer is that I think the mapping become invalid when it crosses into\nbecoming part of the implementation. Due to the absurd work required of the\nmappings, I\u2019m not inclined to view the rock as implementing Word or conscious\nminds. It seems to me that the mapping is implementing these things and\nblaming it on the rock.\n\nBut as my friend and fellow blogger Disagreeable Me pointed out in our\ndiscussions, attempting to objectively nail down exactly where it crosses this\nline may be a lost cause. Every mapping, including the ones we use for our\ncomputational devices, have some degree of implementation. Ultimately, it may\nbe that whether a particular physical system is implementing a particular\nalgorithm is subjective, which implies that whether a system is conscious is\nalso subjective.\n\nNow, I think the idea of a rock being conscious requires a perverse\ninterpretation, a ridiculous mapping, so I\u2019m not going to be worried about the\nnext rock I break apart or throw. But this becomes a more difficult matter for\nsimulated beings, whose internals might be just close enough to those of a\nconventional conscious being to give us moral quandaries.\n\nMany people see this is as a problem with the computational theory of mind.\nWhile the consequence is profound, I don\u2019t see it as a problem, but simply a\nstark fact of reality. To understand why, let\u2019s back up and consider exactly\nwhat the computational theory of mind is. It\u2019s the belief that the mind is\nwhat the brain does, as opposed to some separate substance. In other words,\nthe mind is the function of the brain, and that function can be mathematically\nmodeled.\n\nBut isn\u2019t the purpose of any functional system always open to interpretation?\nTo say otherwise is to veer into natural teleology, the belief that natural\nthings have intrinsic purpose. Pursuit of teleology was abandoned by\nscientists centuries ago, because it could never be objectively established. I\nfear we might be discovering that the existence of a mind might lie on the far\nside of that divide.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong sentiment that consciousness must be a fundamental aspect of\nreality. While it certainly is a fundamental aspect of the subjective reality\nof any conscious being, reality doesn\u2019t appear to be telling us that\nconsciousness is objectively fundamental, at least not in the way of a\nfundamental force like gravitation, electromagnetism, etc.\n\nUnless, of course, I\u2019m missing something?\n\nFurther reading\n\nThis post was inspired by a lengthy conversation with Disagreeable Me (and\nothers). He has posted a much more rigorous and philosophically termed entry\non it. If you\u2019re feeling particularly energetic, there is a Stanford\nencyclopedia of philosophy article that covers this issue in pretty good\ndepth. If you\u2019re feeling truly masochistic, check out the papers cited by\nDisagreeable Me or the Stanford article.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nPanpsychism and definitions of \u201cconsciousness\u201dFebruary 4, 2016In \"Mind and AI\"\n\nInformation, computation, and realityFebruary 20, 2022In \"Philosophy\"\n\nSMBC: Chinese roomOctober 22, 2015In \"Zeitgeist\"\n\n  * Tagged\n  * Brain\n  * Computational theory of mind\n  * computationalism\n  * Mind\n  * pancomputationalism\n  * panpsychism\n  * Philosophy\n  * Philosophy of Mind\n\nPublished March 2, 2016November 7, 2020\n\n## 22 thoughts on \u201cAre rocks conscious?\u201d\n\n  1.

Pre-\nevidential thinking had our minds being created by a metaphysical \u201cspirit\u201d\ncalled a soul. (Metaphysical means imaginary, by definition.) Then our brain\nprocesses were likened to telegraph systems, then telephone networks, then\nthey were consider to be computers, today it is in vogue to liken them to\ncomputer networks and/or computational algorithms.\n\nEventually, I suspect, we will reverse engineer our mental process and\ndiscover how they function (we are just now getting evidence regarding\nunconscious processing) and then we will \u201cknow.\u201d I just wish that people would\nstop grasping at \u201canswers\u201d when we aren\u2019t even sure what the questions are.\nJumping to conclusions is not a very effective mode of traveling anywhere.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1.

People have speculated about consciousness for\nmillenia, but until the last century or so, it\u2019s pretty much been speculation\nfloating in mid-air. Rene Descartes couldn\u2019t conceive of how the mind could\nwork physically, which is why he formulated substance dualism, although in\nreality what he formulated matched intuitions people have had since the dawn\nof humanity.\n\nBut I think implying modern theories are just as wrong as ancient ones is\nitself wrong.\n\n> when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong.

I\u2019m \u201cmapping\u201d relative to the rock in my hand. If I use the rock\u2019s\ntemperature as a way to infer the time of day, the rock is implementing or\nprocessing my internal clock model, right?\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1. SelfAwarePatterns says:\n\nMarch 7, 2016 at 10:08 am\n\nThat\u2019s one way to look at it. In truth, considering a system in isolation is\nartificial. Every system is a nexus of inputs from other systems and outputs\nto others. Exactly where we draw the boundary and say \u201chere is system X\u201d can\nbe a complicated question. Every system is integrated with others.\n\nIn the case of consciousness, consider that we have a theory of mind about\nother people. Who that person is to us, subjectively, is as much about our\ninternal model of them as it is about the objective person themselves. That\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s so easy for us to project our own level of consciousness on animals,\nor on things that we objectively can\u2019t say are conscious, such as the rivers,\noceans, volcanoes, or nature overall.\n\nIn the case of computation, if my computer is running a clock, what that means\nto me is as much about my internal model as it is about the states of\nelectrons inside silicon chips. In the case of commercial computers, it\u2019s a\nsystem engineered to make that model as minimal as possible. A rock-clock\nrequires a more developed internal model. A rock MS Word requires a model\nprobably far more complicated than the original ostensible pattern in the\nrock.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n\n  5.

How can it be that there\nis no objective fact of the matter regarding whether I, as a conscious mind,\nexist? I\u2019m not saying there is no answer, but this is too much of a weird\npoint of view to be a satisfying conclusion in its own right. It points the\nway to further investigation rather than being much of an answer.\n\nI\u2019ve just posted my own exploration of what this means.\n\nhttp://disagreeableme.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/rescuing-computationalism-with-\nplatonism.html#more\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n\n    1. SelfAwarePatterns says:\n\nMarch 8, 2016 at 5:30 pm\n\nThanks DM. I\u2019m going to comment at your blog post, but wanted to address one\npoint here. There\u2019s been a lot of material written in recent years from\nneuroscientists and philosophers about how the self is an illusion, or that\nconsciousness is an illusion. I\u2019ve been a bit impatient with that wording,\nfeeling like it was hyperbole to garner attention.\n\nBut this line of discussion, along with the conversations we had with Wyrd\nSmyth a few months ago, has made me realize what the illusion is. It\u2019s this\nobjective fact-of-the-matter existence for these things, that consciousness is\na thing, an indivisible fundamental aspect of reality.\n\nPart of the problem is the ambiguity associated with terms like\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201cself\u201d, or \u201cmind.\u201d In truth, these things include a hazy\ncollection of attributes that we draw a boundary around and apply these labels\nto.\n\nI\u2019d say that you are (or possess) these things because, as a mentally\ncompetent human adult, you fit the only category where everyone (at least\nevery human) agrees is a conscious mind. There are debates whether newborns,\nanimals, and many other entities are conscious, but not your category. Your\ncategory is the reference example every definition of consciousness needs to\ninclude. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s pretty pointless.\n\nOf course, we all have a strong feeling that we are conscious, and that\nsystems like us are conscious. But as we move away from systems that resemble\nus, the farther we get away, the more controversial assertions of\nconsciousness become.\n\nI think any entity with an I/O system that allows them to have an objective\nphysical presence in the world is at an advantage in this discussion over,\nsay, a simulated entity in a self contained simulation. Is this physical bias?\nProbably. But for us physical beings, it\u2019s probably where we are.\n\nUltimately, I think the intuition that consciousness must be an absolute fact\nof the matter is one we should question. I think it\u2019s an anachronism, a\nholdback from the innate intuition of substance dualism, part of a lingering\nsentiment that we are something special in the universe.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n      1. Disagreeable Me (@Disagreeable_I) says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 4:25 am\n\nHi Mike,\n\nAgain, I think you\u2019re answering the wrong question. I\u2019m not asking whether I\ncan objectively be regarded as conscious (we are agreed that there is no magic\nobjective threshold where a structure passes from unconscious to conscious),\nI\u2019m asking whether a mind which is somewhere towards the conscious end of the\nspectrum can objectively be said to be sustained by my brain.\n\nSo: the mind has to exist objectively, it seems. What is fuzzy is whether we\ndescribe particular \u201cminds\u201d as conscious or not.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n        1. SelfAwarePatterns says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 8:45 am\n\nHi DM, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m grasping the distinction you\u2019re making here.\nPreviously, I had understood a distinction you made between whether a system\nis implementing an algorithm (for consciousness or otherwise) versus whether\nan agent is conscious. That distinction is nuanced and difficult to get at\nwith language and, at least under computationalism, I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d\nagree it\u2019s real. But with the language you use here, I\u2019m beginning to doubt I\nhave understood the actual distinction you\u2019ve been making.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n          1. Disagreeable Me (@Disagreeable_I) says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 9:34 am\n\nHi Mike,\n\nConsider the following questions:\n\n1) Whether, or to what extent, a given algorithm is conscious (or\nconsciousness-producing) 2) Whether a given algorithm is instantiated by a\nphysical system 3) Whether a given supposedly fully conscious mind such as\nyours or mine really/objectively exists and is experiencing consciousness from\nits point of view.\n\nThe difficulty in categorising things is question 1. That\u2019s what you appear\nmost keen to answer, apparently because it\u2019s the easiest, least controversial\nquestion of the lot. We are agreed that there are no objective criteria to\nmeasure whether or to what extent an algorithm produces consciousness.\n\n2 and 3 are tied together for physicalist computationalists if the algorithm\nof 2 corresponds to the mind of 3. If 2 is a yes, then 3 is a yes. If 2 is a\nno, then 3 is a no.\n\nI am not a physicalist computationalist so I think that 2 has no objective\nanswer. But I do think that 3 has an objective answer in the affirmative for\nany possible mind.\n\nAny answer which posits a subjective answer for question 3 is immediately\nsuspect and requires further explanation. It\u2019s not clear how a fully conscious\nmind (i.e. a mind corresponding to that produced by an algorithm from the\nconscious end of the spectrum) can kind of exist and kind of experience\nconsciousness from its own point of view. It seems to require an all or\nnothing answer. Either it exists or it doesn\u2019t. Either it is experiencing or\nit isn\u2019t.\n\nLikeLike\n\n    2. SelfAwarePatterns says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 10:55 am\n\nHi DM, Thanks for the clarification. It turns out I did understand the\ndistinction.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d add a new question to your lineup for your consideration.\n\n2a) Whether a given algorithm is instantiated by another algorithm\n\nI add that to point out why I can\u2019t see that abandoning physicalism really\nsolves this issue. It just causes a redefinition of words. If everything is\ncomputation, the question moves from whether a physical system is implementing\nan algorithm to whether an algorithm is implementing another algorithm, or\nperhaps more precisely, whether there is something embedded in algorithm ROCK\nthat is isomorphic with algorithm CONSCIOUS-MIND.\n\nIt seems to me that whatever issues you see 2) causing for 3), 2a) has the\nsame problems.\n\nThe only way I can see to have an absolutely pure objective existence of minds\nis some form of either substance dualism or a unique physics that only applies\nto minds. We have to remove minds from the regular workings of the universe in\norder to eliminate any chance of something we don\u2019t intuitively consider a\nmind to be interpreted in some way or another as a mind.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n      1. Disagreeable Me (@Disagreeable_I) says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 11:35 am\n\nHi Mike,\n\n2a can be treated just the same as 2, as far as I\u2019m concerned. There isn\u2019t a\nfact of the matter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. The mind exists in its own\nright whether or not it is embedded in another algorithm.\n\nSo, we can in principle trace out according to some intuitive mapping an\nalgorithm that seems to capture what it is our brains are doing. As long as we\nhave done this correctly, then the algorithm we have identified IS the mind\nand it does exist objectively.\n\nIn other words, the mind is just the algorithm that the brain seems to be\nimplementing. It doesn\u2019t matter that we can have no objective criteria by\nwhich we can prove the brain to be implementing the algorithm. Similarly, it\u2019s\nhard to prove objectively that the individual \u201cBarack Obama\u201d is the person\ndepicted in the famous \u201cHOPE\u201d poster (it could be someone who looks like him\nor it could be the product of random splashes of ink), but I can still say\nthat Barack Obama is the person that we agree the poster seems to be\ndepicting.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n        1. SelfAwarePatterns says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 1:38 pm\n\nHi DM, I agree. In principle, for all practical purposes, we should be able to\nfigure out the information processing architecture of the human mind, and once\nwe\u2019ve done that, determine with enough objectivity (to satisfy the vast\nmajority of observers) whether another system is implementing it.\n\nTo me, the issue we\u2019ve been discussing falls into the category of the problem\nof induction, or the unobservability of causation. These are issues we should\nbe aware of, but we shouldn\u2019t conclude that they\u2019re intractable obstacles to\nprogress.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n  6. amanimal says:\n\nMarch 9, 2016 at 1:33 pm\n\nHaving nothing of value to offer:\n\nI had a Pet Rock once.
