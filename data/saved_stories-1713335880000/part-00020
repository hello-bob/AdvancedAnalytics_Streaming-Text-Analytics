Consumer apps are\nsoftware applications designed and developed for use by the general public,\ntypically available for download or purchase on mobile devices or computers.\nThese apps serve various purposes, from entertainment and social networking to\nproductivity and utility. They are intended to meet the needs and preferences\nof individual users rather than businesses or enterprises.\n\nConsumer software, especially on mobile, is the toughest category. There are\nso many things that need to happen to sustain and be successful. Enterprise\nisn\u2019t \u201ceasy\u201d per se, but there is a more predictable adoption path than\nbuilding software for everyday consumer use.\n\nDefining success in consumer is subjective. I\u2019m not going to define an\nindustry standard. Instead, let\u2019s define success for consumer mobile software\nhaving sustaining usage and adoption for over a year. In this case, Clubhouse\nin the height of 2021, the year when everyone joined a16z or the cast of Dune,\nas successful.\n\nThe audio-first social app went from 600,000 users in December of 2020 to\nabout 2 million two months later. Clubhouse continued to grow in users but\nusage began to decline later in 2021. Clubhouse had 3.5 million active users\nin September 2021, a decline of more than 60% on its peak in March. There are\nobvious pandemic factors that skew this as a use case. Regardless, you have to\nrespect the 12-month run the app had in terms of its growth.\n\nWith this success framing in mind, let\u2019s look at factors that work (and\ndon\u2019t).\n\n##\n\nConsumer app clones don\u2019t last long\n\nX/Twitter, whatever you call it, is the prime example of where clones don\u2019t\nwork. Even prior to the Elon acquisition there were many attempts at a Twitter\nclone. Mastodon, the decentralized social network was started eight years ago.\nWhen Twitter locked down its developer platform (the first time), App.net\nemerged as a developer-friendly alternative to Twitter\u2014also offering 256\ncharacters to Twitter\u2019s (then) 140 character limit. There was some\ndifferentiation, but as different as Harland Williams\u2019 character in There\u2019s\nSomething About Mary pitching 7 Minute Abs\u2014a product he proclaimed was\nsuperior to 8 minute abs because it only takes 7 minutes. App.net was Twitter\nwith more characters.\n\nSince Elon owning Twitter, many proclaimed leaving the platform forever in\nfavor of Bluesky, Instagram Threads, T21, and others, the same people are\nstill on the platform. Leaving Twitter is an American saying they\u2019ll move to\nCanada if their presidential candidate of choice does not get elected. Few\nactually do it. The common reason is whether we like it or not, competing with\nexisting behaviors and infrastructure is difficult. I personally don\u2019t love\nthe direction of Twitter, but I also can\u2019t mentally invest in adoption several\nalternatives.\n\nThe existing infrastructure challenge is so difficult even those who have\nlarge scale struggle to compete. Instagram Threads were able to use the\nmassive scale of being a Meta company to turn on scale overnight. However,\nafter a month, usage dropped 85%. If it\u2019s this tough for Meta, imaging how\nhard it is for app clones to make it.\n\n###\n\nNiche apps can sustain, but scale is tough\n\nOne way to compete with large scale is going after a niche of users; going\ndeeper in an offering they cannot get it anywhere else. Letterboxd is a social\nnetwork focused on cataloging films\u2014the Goodreads for movies. This consumer\nmobile app works because it\u2019s loaded with movie nerds who are highly engaged2.\nThey love films so much they\u2019re willing to spend time writing a long-form\nreview and share it with their followers. The app is niche but since September\nof 2023 they have 10 million users, which is impressive.\n\nThere are many other examples like Letterboxd in different categories\ntargeting niche groups. Are.na3 is Pinterest for research-oriented\nindividuals.\n\n###\n\nCombine experiences to make something interesting\n\nThe aforementioned Airchat is described as a dinner party in your pocket. It\ntakes the voice emphasis of Clubhouse, asynchronous communication of Marco\nPolo, and transcriptions from podcasts, and infuses it all together in a\nmobile app. Airchat is the Cronut of consumer mobile software.\n\nBefore you think combining existing things is unoriginal, remember that mor\nethan 57% of mobile phones used in the United States were combining an iPod, a\nphone, and an internet communicator\u2014are you getting it? The experience is\ndifferentiating enough that feels new and fresh, resulting in people willing\nto adopt it.\n\nIf Airchat is the Cronut, Descript is the Arnold Palmer. There are loads of\nexamples of combining experiences to create a unique consumer software\nexperience. It\u2019s too early deem Airchat\u2019s fate, but I appreciate the team\u2019s\nwillingness to explore an experience that feels new.\n\n##\n\nDelightful design\n\nIn the early 2010s, the best designers worked on consumer software. There were\ntwo simple reasons:\n\n  1. The bar for quality and usability in Enterprise software was embarrassingly low, and fortunately it\u2019s changed since.\n\n  2. Delightful interactions in consumer apps were often the sticking point for people to try it and continue using it\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? There is a history of people downloading an app simply to\ncheck out an interaction:\n\n  * Letterpress had the haptic feedback when you typed on the keyboard\n\n  * Tinder popularized deciding \u201cyes or no\u201d simply by swiping\n\n  * Path had the exploding button to choose different types of posts that in many ways was the predecessor to the Floating Action Button (FAB)\n\n  * Tumblr had the tab bar that hid as you scrolled, then reappearing when you stopped\n\nThese may not be the first but examples of what gained popularity.\n\n##\n\nTrends are cyclical and generational\n\nLike Normcore making a trend in 2008 in fashion, trends come and go, then\nreturn. There are generational differences in usage of consumer software.\nOnce, The Facebook and the hottest social network on campuses, now it\u2019s where\ngeriatric millennials go look for stroller deals on Facebook Marketplace. Gen\nZ won\u2019t adopt Facebook and forge their own consumer experiences. TikTok is the\nnew Vine, BeReal is the new FrontBack, Letterboxd is the new Getglue, and the\nlitany of apps will continue..\n\n##\n\nRespect to those working in consumer\n\nConsumer is high risk. The majority of them will shut down, get acquired, or\ninevitably pivot to B2B. However, they have a chance to live in infamy in a\nmoment of history when they shined. They live on as a stardust of inspiration\nfor those creating software. To all the founders working on consumer, I have\nso much respect for what you\u2019re building and wish you the best of luck.\n\n##\n\nHype links\n\n  * A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)\n\n  * Brie Wolfson: An Hour on Early Stage Hiring\n\n##\n\nJob opportunities\n\n  * We're hiring at Replit\n\n    * Product Designer, Growth\n\n    * Product Designer, AI\n\n  * Edition 161: Ali Rohde Jobs\n\n1\n\nNot Terminator 2, BTW\n\n2\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd\n\n3\n\nFollow me on Are.na\n\n### Subscribe to Proof of Concept\n\nBy David Hoang \u00b7 Launched 4 years ago\n\nProof of Concept is a digital publication about creativity and experimentation\nfor designers, builders, and entrepreneurs.\n\n12 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n12\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Success for consumer mobile software\n\nwww.proofofconcept.pub\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nDaniel FillerApr 14Appreciate the point on trends being cyclical. Whether we\nlike it or not, people like \u201cnew.\u201d While I agree it\u2019s generational, I think\nthis cycle has gotten shorter as we become more connected as a society. It\u2019s\neasier to see what others are doing (and decide to carve your own path).\nDesign and tech debt make changing or keeping software fresh difficult.Target\ndoes a great job of this with their own sub-brands in store, they cycle\nthrough them based on design trends to keep things fresh. Universal Thread,\nArt Class, Project 67, Opal House, etc. these will continue to cycle as new\ntrends come and go. I\u2019m sure the data suggests this strategy works.As for\ngenerational shifts, kids don\u2019t want to be like their parents (until they grow\nolder and realize they are their parents). I often think of the Social Network\nquote (but change it), \u201cFacebook isn\u2019t cool, you know what\u2019s cool?\nTikTok.\u201dExpand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nTyler NishidaApr 14This was a nice Sunday read while I wait for my haircut, as\nI just got invited to AirChat yesterday and had been thinking about how to\ndescribe it\u2019s design and utility.
