In other unsurprising developments, water remains wet.\n\nThe announcement was made on Tuesday ahead of quarterly reports from Google\nand the ever-watchful U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), keeping\ntabs on how this whole situation unfolds.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling\ndivergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will\ncontinue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem,\u201d according to a\nstatement Google posted on its website for the Privacy Sandbox. \u201cIt\u2019s also\ncritical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including\nresults from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to\nprovide by the end of June. Given both of these significant considerations, we\nwill not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of\nQ4.\u201d\n\nRelated Insights\n\nSpecial Projects\n\nSpecial report: The third-party cookie primer Read More\n\nGoogle did not outline a more specific timetable beyond hoping for 2025.\n\nThis is the third time Google has pushed back its original deadline set in\nJanuary 2020. Back then, the tech behemoth promised to phase out third-party\ncookies \u201cwithin two years\u201d to beef up security for users while surfing the\nweb. But since then, Google\u2019s hit the brakes twice already. And every time,\nit\u2019s been to give the ad industry more prep time for something that\u2019s been\nsurrounded by a lot of ifs, buts, and maybes. Even at the start of the year,\nas Google phased out cookies for one percent of browser traffic, questions\nloomed over when more significant changes would occur.\n\nWith this track record, Google\u2019s latest delay won\u2019t shock many. And even those\ncaught off guard might get a pass. After all, Google had been preaching for\nmonths that third-party cookies would vanish from Chrome by the end of 2024.\n\nDespite their assurances, hitting the deadline seemed increasingly unlikely.\nEspecially after the CMA raised 39 \u201cconcerns\u201d to be addressed before the plan\ncould proceed back in January. And with the U.K. data watchdog, the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), voicing its own reservations earlier\nthis month, the plot thickened. Toss in the fact that Google\u2019s own\nalternatives to third-party cookies (aforementioned Sandbox) left a lot to be\ndesired, and another delay seemed inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Google\u2019s announcement clarifying the timing of third-party cookie\ndeprecation. This will allow time to assess the results of industry tests and\nresolve remaining issues,\u201d said a spokesperson from the CMA. \u201cUnder the\ncommitments, Google has agreed to resolve our remaining competition concerns\nbefore going ahead with third-party cookie deprecation. Working closely with\nthe ICO we expect to conclude this process by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\nFor now, Google seems to have next year in mind as the latest end date for its\nplan to eliminate third-party cookies.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to\nconclude that process this year,\u201d Google\u2019s statement read. \u201cAssuming we can\nreach an agreement, we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation\nstarting early next year.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the ad industry isn\u2019t holding its breath.\n\nThat was certainly true of the 46 marketers who responded to the latest survey\nfor Digiday+ Research, which asked them for their thoughts on the third-party\ncookie timeline. Of those who responded, 39% said they believe it would be at\nsome point in Q2 2025 or beyond while 26% said they believed Google will get\nrid of third-party cookies in the Chrome browser before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising news given the magnitude of what is happening and the\ninvolvement of the CMA, but ultimately still frustrating,\u201d said Wayne\nBlodwell, founder and CEO of Impact Media, an AI powered attention platform.\n\u201cHowever, smart measurement is comfortably the largest way advertisers can\ncreate competitive advantage by leaning into durable/non cookie methods such\nas attention, MMM and econometrics and connecting that to media buying so it\nreally shouldn\u2019t slow down the sophisticated & progressive advertisers\nanyway.\u201d\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nhttps://digiday.com/?p=542257\n\nTrending in Life Beyond the Cookie\n\n  * 01\n\nWTF Series\n\nWTF is the CMA \u2014 the Competition and Markets Authority\n\n  * 02\n\nSponsored\n\nHow data clean rooms are enhancing retail media transparency and effectiveness\n\n  * Sponsored\n\nRetail media\u2019s evolution: How retailers are finding a way to break in and\nstand out\n\n  * 03\n\nSponsored\n\nWhy connectivity is critical for clean rooms to turn signal loss into signal\ngain\n\nMost Read\n\n  * 01\n\nLife Beyond the Cookie\n\nGoogle delays third-party cookie demise yet again\n\n  * 02\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nWhy B2B marketers are advertising more like consumer brands to break through a\ncrowded marketplace\n\n  * 03\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nMeta\u2019s Threads expected to have ads this year\n\n  * 04\n\nPublishing in the Platform Era\n\nPublishers test new TikTok feature that adds links to organic videos\n\n  * 05\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nInside X\u2019s latest, desperate attempt to beguile advertisers\n\n### More in Marketing\n\nView More\n\nAgency Culture\n\n#### With the rise of the chief AI officer, it\u2019s time to examine \u2018czar\u2019\nculture\n\nApril 24, 2024 \u2022 5 min read\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nEven if it\u2019s a familiar pattern \u2014 hot new thing, new C-Suite exec to tackle\nsaid thing, a few years go by and that C-Suite position no longer exists as\neveryone is now doing said thing (or it was a fad that has since faded away) \u2014\ndoes it make sense for businesses to continue to appoint new czars with every\nnew trend?\n\nBeyond Ads\n\n#### Why Cava\u2019s bid for brand awareness means prioritizing streaming ads\n\nApril 24, 2024 \u2022 5 min read\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nFast-casual restaurant chain Cava has been in growth mode over the past year\nand is leaning into streaming ads in an effort to boost brand awareness.\n\nDigiday Podcast: The Return\n\n#### A history of middle manager stress: The Return podcast, season 3, episode\n1\n\nApril 24, 2024 \u2022 2 min read\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nIn episode one, McKinsey partner Emily Field tells us more about why middle\nmanagement is critically important to the workforce.\n\n### DIGIDAY+\n\nGet access to tools and analysis to stay ahead of the trends transforming\nmedia and marketing\n\nSubscribe\n\n### My Account\n\nVisit your account page to make changes and renew.\n\nAccount\n\n### Newsletter\n\nGet Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox.\n\n### Connect\n\nFollow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more.\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Advertise\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Masthead\n  * Digiday Media\n\n\u00a9 2024.
