They are home to\nleading firms in many of the high-tech sectors powering global economic growth\nand usually rank near the top of innovation indexes. To get to where they are\ntoday, both countries harnessed the combined power of their public and private\nsectors for decades. The innovation strategies they used challenge the model\nmythologized by Silicon Valley: the individual genius who comes up with a\nbrilliant idea and receives funding from venture capitalists acting in a\nprivate capacity. In the United States, the perception is that startups should\nwork by themselves, often with the aim of disrupting existing companies and\nindustries.\n\nDespite rhetorical claims about their goals to build their own Silicon\nValleys, the governments and firms of Japan and South Korea believe that\ncooperation among new startups and existing conglomerates is crucial to\nboosting economic competitiveness, especially in frontier technologies, such\nas semiconductors, robotics, energy-efficient shipping, and electric\nbatteries. Japan and South Korea have created an open innovation ecosystem in\nwhich government agencies, large firms, and smaller startups all support one\nanother.\n\nAs competition between the United States and China heats up, the model pursued\nby Seoul and Tokyo suggests that startups are central to a competitive\neconomy, but their potential is limited if they are working on their own. A\nnational economy benefits more when startups work with government and existing\nbig companies. Today, the United States is not the paradise for maverick\nentrepreneurs depicted in television shows and Hollywood movies. Instead, it\nalready has traces of the approach found in Japan and South Korea. American\npolicymakers should acknowledge this reality and lean into it to increase the\nUnited States\u2019 economic and technological competitiveness.\n\n### Stay informed.\n\nIn-depth analysis delivered weekly.\n\n#### Thank you for signing up. Stay tuned for the latest from Foreign Affairs.\n\n### CHANGE FROM WITHIN\n\nJapan and South Korea publicly embrace the sentiment that startups are open\ninnovation resources for large conglomerates. Their national policies foster\nsmaller, more agile firms and encourage them to work with their bigger peers\nto support the innovativeness of the country as a whole. Startups inject new\nideas, talent, and ways of working into large Japanese and South Korean firms\nso that they can compete with American, Chinese, and European rivals. The\ndirector of a startup support center funded by the South Korean government put\nit to us this way: the government wants to inject \u201cinnovative DNA\u201d into the\ncountry\u2019s chaebol, or large industrial conglomerates, so that the countries\u2019\nlegacy firms do not go the way of Motorola or Nokia, two tech companies that\nwere known for their earlier pathbreaking products but lost their innovation\nmojo along the way and got left behind.\n\nTake the case of South Korea\u2019s K-Startup Grand Challenge, a government program\nproviding support for startups to become internationally competitive. Launched\nby the conservative government of Park Geun-hye in 2016, the program was\ncontinued by the liberal Moon Jae-in and continues to thrive today under the\nadministration of independent turned conservative Yoon Suk-yeol. Funded and\nmanaged by the government and based at Pangyo Techno Valley\u2014South Korea\u2019s\nversion of Silicon Valley, in the Seoul metropolis\u2014the program brings together\nstartups from across the world competing for the chance to join an accelerator\nin South Korea. This program serves as a springboard for these firms to expand\nin South Korea and across Asia thanks to a combination of funding, mentorship,\npeer learning, office space, and connections with the chaebol. A crucial\nmetric of the success of the program is to identify licensing and partnership\nagreements with the country\u2019s chaebol, which are also involved in mentoring.\nThat is, government largess is contingent on startups partnering with Samsung,\nHyundai, LG, or any other of the big South Korean firms.\n\n> Japan and South Korea don\u2019t see the point of undercutting their existing\n> large companies.\n\nJapan launched a nearly identical program in 2018. Under the J-Startup\nInitiative, Japan\u2019s postwar conglomerates, known as keiretsu, partner with the\ncountry\u2019s main banks to fund and support potential \u201cunicorns\u201d\u2014privately held\nstartups that achieve a valuation of $1 billion. The program was not construed\nas a vehicle for startups to displace incumbents but to encourage them to work\nhand in hand. Six years later and after two changes in government, the\ninitiative continues with the same ethos of large conglomerates providing\nsupport to new startups. Its initial goal was to help build 100 unicorns by\n2023. The J-Startup Initiative has yet to achieve this, although Japan has\nproduced 20 unicorns during that time (as well as what are called \u201chidden\nunicorns,\u201d companies that achieve valuations of more than $1 billion by way of\nacquisition). In 2022, the government of Fumio Kishida announced its goal to\nfoster 100 new unicorns by 2027 and spark the creation of 10,000 startups\nduring that time.\n\nThese are just two examples of the many ways in which Seoul and Tokyo bring\ntogether government, large legacy firms, and startups to promote innovation\nand economic growth. Similar startup initiatives in the United States, such as\nSmall Business Innovation Research, invest in startups directly but without\ninvolving large firms as collaborators, judges, or mentors. Silicon Valley\npromotes stories of David-sized startups defeating Goliath-like conglomerates,\nbut Japan and South Korea don\u2019t see the point of excluding, or even\nundercutting, their existing large companies. In this way, David works with\n(or even for) Goliath, fueling national capabilities at the world\u2019s\ntechnological frontier.\n\n### CALIFORNIA DREAMIN\u2019\n\nMost people think of Silicon Valley as a land where the invisible hand of the\nmarket ensures the survival of the fittest: startups steered by young minds\nwith brilliant ideas working out of garages while getting their funding from\nventure capitalists to develop the next big thing. These entrepreneurs will\none day become the next Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg.\nCentral to the myth of Silicon Valley is the idea that upstart entrepreneurs\nwill create new companies that will replace today\u2019s big firms, thus disrupting\nindustries when not creating entirely new ones. As PayPal co-founder Peter\nThiel\u2019s Zero to One book title suggests, many aspiring tech founders\nunderstand their mission as \u201cbuilding the future.\u201d On their minds are\nMicrosoft and Apple and the personal computer in the 1980s or Tesla and\nelectric vehicles today. Those without the imagination to come up with the\nnext world-changing product fear they won\u2019t receive funding or, worse, will\nlose millions, if not billions, of dollars and will have to leave Silicon\nValley to pursue other lines of work.\n\nAlthough this concept of Silicon Valley is based on truth, it does not exactly\nreflect reality. Today, the U.S. technology sector is dominated by only a\nhandful of companies that make some of the world\u2019s most valuable products.\nThese big firms, such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, also act as\ntechnology platforms for today\u2019s startups, hosting research campuses and\nrunning accelerators\u2014programs for coaching and mentoring fledgling startups.\nThey are also the key acquirers of new inventions. In the past, these young\ncompanies forced Altavista or Packard Bell into bankruptcy. Now, they are\nseeking to guard against others who could put them out of business. The big\ntech firms thwart any threat posed by co-opting startups as users of their\ntechnologies, as recipients of their investment, and as mentees.\n\nA ship at Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, May 2015\n\nKim Hong-Ji / Reuters\n\nThis integration of startups into industrial dynamics is part of what we call\n\u201cstartup capitalism,\u201d an economic model in which startups contribute to\nemployment, innovation, and growth. Startup capitalism is increasingly\nubiquitous globally, with policymakers around the world striving to create\ntheir own high-tech cluster, often signaled by the use of a local Silicon\nValley (such as the Chilecon Valley in Santiago or Silicon Roundabout in\nLondon). Though startups are often hailed as crucial innovation agents, as the\nreality of today\u2019s Silicon Valley shows, they are more often open innovation\ntools for incumbent firms to boost their own competitiveness. Big firms invest\nin new potential unicorns that, in turn, leverage the distribution channels\nand talent pools of the big firms.\n\nDespite these changes to how Silicon Valley functions, U.S. policy remains in\nan antagonistic relationship with today\u2019s tech giants. On the one hand, small\nstartups continue to be celebrated, while large firms, especially technology\nfirms, are summoned to congressional hearings for aggressive questioning, and\nthey are increasingly the targets of antitrust lawsuits. On the other hand,\nthe U.S. government is a huge technology customer and is actively limiting\nrival countries\u2019 access to the country\u2019s cutting-edge technologies, especially\nsemiconductors. The U.S. government tries to keep Big Tech in check but also\nunderstands its importance to U.S. national security. Government support is\nnot given, for fear of being seen as wasting taxpayers\u2019 money on companies\nthat are already among the world\u2019s most valuable.\n\nAmerican policy therefore misses out on the power that an open innovation\nmodel could bring. U.S. policymakers do not actively engage their country\u2019s\nlarge firms as partners in startup policy. This helps explain why the Biden\nadministration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are spending billions\nof dollars in grants and rebates to attract foreign semiconductor, electric\nbattery, and electric car firms to the United States. Simply put, American\nfirms cannot compete with their foreign peers in some areas of hardware and\nmanufacturing that demand long-term thinking and huge upfront investment. The\ngovernments of Japan and South Korea have not made this same mistake.\n\n### INNOVATE OR DIE\n\nJapanese and South Korean policymakers realized much earlier the role startups\ncan play in their countries\u2019 national security strategies. Startups fuel\nJapan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s prowess in technologies that are critical to\nnational security\u2014such as semiconductors, AI, and advanced materials. Defense\ncontractors are no longer the main drivers behind a country\u2019s competitive\nedge. Instead, getting ahead also hinges on national supplies of cutting-edge\ntechnologies and the inventive people behind them. The United States\u2019\nconsideration of banning or forcing the sale of TikTok\u2014and China\u2019s opposition\nto the move\u2014underscores the centrality of technology competition today.\nAlthough full-blown war between the superpowers remains unlikely, the United\nStates and China know they can inflict pain on each other when it comes to\nachieving technological superiority.\n\nStartup capitalism\u2019s ability to boost technological supremacy therefore gives\na country a competitive edge over friends and foes alike. Government support\nallows startups and especially big conglomerates with large financial and\nhuman resources to take a long-term approach toward economic planning, aware\nthat funding will continue even if there are short-term economic disruptions\nsuch as a financial crisis or a pandemic. This approach also means that the\ngovernment will underpin research and firms moving into new sectors where\nsuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed, a risk that often stifles private-sector innovation\nin other countries.\n\nAs a case in point, South Korea and Japan are world leaders in energy-\nefficient shipping because their governments bet on the long-term importance\nof this sector, while the United States and Europe gave up on a competitive\nshipping industry decades ago. In late February, U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos\nDel Toro toured Japanese and South Korean shipyards, promoting the\ncollaboration taking place with their American counterparts to revive the U.S.\nshipbuilding and maintenance industry. South Korea and Japan produce a large\nshare of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced vessels, such as the ships\nthat carry liquefied natural gas and ammonia. Their strength in this sector is\nat least partly driven by government-conglomerate-startup cooperation. In the\ncase of South Korea, startups developing new technologies are paired with\nlarge conglomerates via a network of government-funded Creative Economy\nInnovation Centers, where they can gain access to mentoring, space, and\nfunding while sharing their ideas and products. The center in Ulsan focuses on\nshipbuilding specifically, with Hyundai Heavy Industries as the anchor\npartner. Meanwhile, graduates from the national university in Busan, a\ntraditional feeder of engineers for the shipping industry, have close links\nwith shipbuilding conglomerates throughout their studies, even if they want to\ndevelop their own projects and launch their own firms. As for Japan, the\ngovernment recently announced plans to promote collaboration between startups\nand large incumbents to create a national champion for next-generation\nshipbuilding. The United States does not have similar programs that encourage\nspecialized training cohorts at specific universities.\n\n### EMBRACE REALITY\n\nU.S. policymakers need to help facilitate this marriage between big firms and\nnew startups. Because, although appealing, the Silicon Valley myth is, well, a\nmyth. Startups are already providing solutions to problems that keep incumbent\nfirms up at night rather than posing an existential threat to them. The origin\nstory of Silicon Valley was also never fully true. The government has long\nbeen a key protagonist in Silicon Valley\u2019s success. Billions of dollars in\nfederal and state funding\u2014including Small Business Innovation Research\u2014were\ncrucial in developing Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem as early as\nthe 1950s. Government largess in support of American entrepreneurs has\ncontinued over the decades. As a case in point, Tesla has dramatically\nbenefited from federal tax credits offered consumers for the purchase of\nelectric cars. It is estimated that the firm has received almost $3 billion in\nstate and local subsidies and incentives since its launch. And last year, when\nSilicon Valley Bank\u2014favored by startups\u2014was about to go bust, the U.S.\nTreasury Department, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, came to its customers\u2019 rescue.\n\nSimilar to Japan and South Korea, the United States has a fairly high\nindustrial concentration. This means that different industries are dominated\nby a small number of large firms. This truth is widely accepted in Japan and\nSouth Korea, even if politicians and the public sometimes decry this state of\naffairs. The United States should also accept reality and embrace the value of\nlarge firms, particularly in high-tech sectors. As Robert Atkinson and Michael\nLind argued in their 2018 book, Big Is Beautiful, the U.S. government should\naccept that big companies are driving American prosperity. Although antitrust\noversight is necessary, market-power concerns should not preclude cooperation\nwith big firms when beneficial for the U.S. economy, innovation, and national\nsecurity. The relationship between the U.S. government and its leading tech\nfirms is now largely one of apprehension and mistrust. And there are good\nreasons for this, such as threats to the health of the country\u2019s democracy or\nthe harm that tech can do to children and teenagers. Government regulators and\nlawmakers should rightly hold monopolistic and competition-busting firms and\nbusinesspeople to account.\n\n> Silicon Valley promotes stories of David-sized startups defeating Goliath-\n> like conglomerates.\n\nAt the same time, there should be a more open approach toward the role of\nlarge firms in the modern startup-fueled economy. To begin with, U.S.\npolicymakers should be unafraid of pairing innovative startups with large\nincumbents. After all, startups can have more innovative thinking, and many\nentrepreneurs welcome rather than reject stronger ties with big firms from\nwhich they feel they can learn and partner to achieve scale. This could take\nthe form of government-sponsored competitions in which successful startup\napplicants, whether American or foreign, are paired with selected big firms\nwilling to support their growth. The government would act as the matchmaker\nand also provide the funding for startups to be able to work together with\ntheir larger peers. The U.S. government should also consider launching a\nprogram to provide long-term support for startups in sectors that may be\ncrucial to the country\u2019s future growth and prosperity\u2014but which could prove to\nbe a bust. Take the case of robotics. A U.S. government body could set up a\nten-to-20-year strategy to support startups that may or may not produce the\nnext generation of, say, humanoid robots. The bet may fail, but if successful,\nit could make the United States one of the leaders in this industry for\ndecades to come. This strategy should not avoid working with big firms already\nfocusing on this sector but rather welcome them as partners with government\nand startups themselves. And the Biden government seems to be moving in this\ndirection. The recently launched CHIPS Women in Construction Framework counts\nIntel and Micron as anchor partners in U.S. efforts to boost the number of\nwomen in the construction sector, with special focus on the semiconductor\nindustry.\n\nThe Silicon Valley myth fuels the idea that large firms should not be viewed\nas sources for innovation and therefore should not work with government and\nstartups. The United States, as a result, is inhibiting its own productive\npotential. It supports startups directly while challenging its own lead firms\nand investing billions in foreign companies to operate in the United States.\nIn Japan and South Korea, the cooperation between startups and large firms is\nopenly pursued because the national benefits are apparent to all.\n\nLoading...\n\n### You are reading a free article.\n\n#### Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n\n  * Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n  * Unlock access to iOS/Android apps to save editions for offline reading\n  * Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n  * RAMON PACHECO PARDO is Professor of International Relations at King\u2019s College London and the KF-VUB Korea Chair at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n  * ROBYN KLINGLER-VIDRA is Associate Professor in Entrepreneurship and Sustainability at King\u2019s Business School.\n\n  * They are the authors of the forthcoming book Startup Capitalism: Northeast Asia\u2019s Startup-Fueled Innovation Strategies.\n\n  * More By Ramon Pacheco Pardo\n  * More By Robyn Klingler-Vidra\n\nMore:\n\nJapan South Korea Science & Technology U.S. Foreign Policy Big Tech Automation\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n## Most-Read Articles\n\n### Will Saudi Arabia Get the Bomb?\n\nHow to Rein in Riyadh\u2019s Nuclear Ambitions\n\n#### Daniel Byman, Doreen Horschig, and Elizabeth Kos\n\n### Biden\u2019s Incomplete Industrial Policy\n\nHow to Finish Building an Economy That Works for Everyone\n\n#### Mariana Mazzucato and Sarah Doyle\n\n### China\u2019s Alternative Order\n\nAnd What America Should Learn From It\n\n#### Elizabeth Economy\n\n### The Real Motives for China\u2019s Nuclear Expansion\n\nBeijing Seeks Geopolitical Leverage More Than Military Advantage\n\n#### Tong Zhao\n\n### Recommended Articles\n\n### Why the Military Can\u2019t Trust AI\n\nLarge Language Models Can Make Bad Decisions\u2014and Could Trigger Nuclear War\n\n#### Max Lamparth and Jacquelyn Schneider\n\n### America Can\u2019t Win the Tech Race Alone\n\nKeeping Its Edge Over China Will Require U.S. Investment in Innovation Abroad\n\n#### Christopher Thomas and Sarah Kreps\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n#### Save up to 55%\n\n##### on Foreign Affairs!\n\nSubscribe\n\nForeign Affairs\n\n#### Weekly Newsletter\n\n##### Get in-depth analysis delivered right to your inbox\n\nGraduate School Forum\n\nFrom the publishers of Foreign Affairs\n\nA Conversation with Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta, Ambassador-at-Large for Global\nWomen\u2019s Issues, U.S. Department of State\n\nLinda Robinson\n\nRealEcon: Reimagining American Economic Leadership\n\nCyber Week in Review: May 3, 2024\n\nKat Duffy\n\nPublished by the Council on Foreign Relations\n\n\u00a92024 Council on Foreign Relations, Inc.
