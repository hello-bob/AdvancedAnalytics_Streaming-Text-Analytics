We are excited to announce the first major version update of\nCascadia Code since the 2111.01 release three years ago! (Wow, time sure\nflies!)\n\nIn this new 2404.03 release, we have added support for Quadrants, Sextants,\nOctants, Large Type Pieces, more legacy computing symbols, and Nerd Fonts to\nCascadia Code. Huge shoutouts to Philippe Majerus (@PhMajerus), Aaron Bell\n(@aaronbell), and Fini (@Finii) for contributing to this release!\n\nYou can download the latest version of the font from the GitHub releases page\nand it will be shipped in the latest update of the Windows Terminal.\n\n# Quadrants and Sextants\n\nQuadrants are block mosaics divided into four parts. Sextants are block\nmosaics divided into six parts. This Cascadia Code update adds new quadrants\nand sextants characters from the Symbols for Legacy Computing block.\n\n# Octants\n\nCascadia Code now supports all 256 octants! Octants are block mosaics divided\ninto eight parts.\n\nMany modern command-line apps use Braille characters as pseudo-pixels to\nrender graphics in the terminal. However, Braille is not the best solution\nbecause the symbols are using discrete dots, which makes the on-and-off\npseudo-pixels unbalanced. They will always have space between symbols and\nbetween lines, so when a group of cells are used to render a graphic, the grid\nof pseudo-pixels is not a regular grid. Some terminals modify the Braille\ncharacters to space the dots evenly and avoid spaces between characters and\nlines, but that breaks their original intended use.\n\nOctants will provide the highest resolution that can be achieved currently\nwithout using graphical extensions such as Sixels or ReGIS. Octants can also\nbe combined with VT control sequences to generate color images\n\nShoutout to Philippe (@PhMajerus) for providing these Octant ANSI art examples\nin his ANSI-art repo!\n\n# Large Type Pieces\n\nLarge type pieces are 55 characters designed to be combined to create large\ntext. Because these are characters and not terminal effects (like DECDHL and\nDECDWL), they are not only limited to a terminal. The same large type text can\nbe used in Unicode plain-text files. The only requirement is to use a font\nthat includes those characters (like Cascadia Code version 2404.03!)\n\n# More legacy computing symbols!\n\nWe added more legacy computing symbols to Cascadia Code. This includes eights,\ncheckboards, diagonals, and digits!\n\n# Nerd Fonts\n\nWe are adding \u201cCascadia Code NF\u201d and \u201cCascadia Mono NF\u201d to the Cascadia Code\nfont family. Cascadia Code NF and Cascadia Mono NF are a native \u201cNerd Font\u201d\nvariant of Cascadia Code that includes the latest Nerd Font glyphs (as of\nApril 2024.) Every glyph is metrics-compatible with the rest of Cascadia Code.\nHuge shoutouts to Aaron (@aaronbell) and Fini (@Finii) for their help with the\nNerd Fonts release!\n\nYou can combine the Nerd Font variants of Cascadia Code with Oh My Posh to\nmake your own cool looking prompt! Look at all these glyphs! (Nerd Fonts has\n9209 of them!)\n\n# Thank you for reading!\n\nIf you are interested any updates coming to Cascadia Code, feel free to keep\nan eye on the Cascadia Code repo or follow Christopher Nguyen (@nguyen_dows),\nDustin Howett (@DHowett), and Aaron Bell (@aaronbell) on X.\n\nAgain, we would like to extend a huge thank you to Philippe Majerus\n(@PhMajerus) for contributing Quadrants, Sextants, Octants, Large Type Pieces,\nand additional legacy computing symbols to this release. We also want to give\nanother huge thank you to Aaron Bell (@aaronbell) and Fini (@Finii) for their\nwork on the Nerd Fonts project.\n\nWe hope you folks like this new update to Cascadia Code. If you have\ndiscovered a bug, would like to file a feature request, or even contribute\n(we\u2019re open source!) then please do so on the Cascadia Code repo! We have more\ncoming to Cascadia Code this year so stay tuned!\n\n### Christopher Nguyen Product Manager II, Windows Terminal\n\nFollow\n\nPosted in Cmd Command Line Command-Line Open-Source Windows Console Windows\nTerminal\n\n### Read next\n\nIntroducing Sudo for Windows!\n\nIntroducing Sudo for Windows We're excited to announce the release of Sudo for\nWindows in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052!
