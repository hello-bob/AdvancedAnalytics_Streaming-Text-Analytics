Google Threat Intelligence includes Gemini in\nThreat Intelligence, our AI-powered agent that provides conversational search\nacross our vast repository of threat intelligence, enabling customers to gain\ninsights and protect themselves from threats faster than ever before.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no shortage of threat intelligence available, the challenge\nfor most is to contextualize and operationalize intelligence relevant to their\nspecific organization,\u201d said Dave Gruber, principal analyst, Enterprise\nStrategy Group. \u201cUnarguably, Google provides two of the most important pillars\nof threat intelligence in the industry today with VirusTotal and Mandiant.\nIntegrating both into a single offering, enhanced with AI and Google threat\ninsights, offers security teams a new means to operationalize actionable\nthreat intelligence to better protect their organizations.\u201d\n\n### Unmatched visibility into threats\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence provides unparalleled visibility into the global\nthreat landscape. We offer deep insights from Mandiant\u2019s leading incident\nresponse and threat research team, and combine them with our massive user and\ndevice footprint and VirusTotal\u2019s broad crowdsourced malware database.\n\n  * Google threat insights: Google protects 4 billion devices and 1.5 billion email accounts, and blocks 100 million phishing attempts per day. This provides us with a vast sensor array and a unique perspective on internet and email-borne threats that allow us to connect the dots back to attack campaigns.\n\n  * Frontline intelligence: Mandiant's eIite incident responders and security consultants dissect attacker tactics and techniques, using their experience to help customers defend against sophisticated and relentless threat actors across the globe in over 1,100 investigations annually.\n\n  * Human-curated threat intelligence: Mandiant\u2019s global threat experts meticulously monitor threat actor groups for activity and changes in their behavior to contextualize ongoing investigations and provide the insights you need to respond.\n\n  * Crowdsourced threat intelligence: VirusTotal's global community of over 1 million users continuously contributes potential threat indicators, including files and URLs, to offer real-time insight into emerging attacks.\n\n  * Open-source threat intelligence: We use open-source threat intelligence to enrich our knowledge base with current discoveries from the security community.\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence boasts a diverse set of sources that provide a\npanoramic view of the global threat landscape and the granular details needed\nto make informed decisions.\n\nThis comprehensive view allows Google Threat Intelligence to help protect your\norganization in a variety of ways, including external threat monitoring,\nattack surface management, digital risk protection, Indicators of Compromise\n(IOC) analysis, and expertise.\n\n### AI-driven operationalization\n\nTraditional approaches to operationalizing threat intelligence are labor-\nintensive and can slow down your ability to respond to evolving threats,\npotentially taking days or weeks to respond.\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence uses Gemini to analyze potentially malicious code\nand provides a summary of its findings.\n\nBy combining our comprehensive view of the threat landscape with Gemini, we\nhave supercharged the threat research processes, augmented defense\ncapabilities, and reduced the time it takes to identify and protect against\nnovel threats. Customers now have the ability to condense large data sets in\nseconds, quickly analyze suspicious files, and simplify challenging manual\nthreat intelligence tasks.\n\n### How Gemini helps simplify and assist with threat intelligence\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro is a valuable part of Google Threat Intelligence, and we\u2019ve\nintegrated it so that it can more efficiently and effectively assist security\nprofessionals in combating malware.\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro offers the world\u2019s longest context window, with support for up\nto 1 million tokens. It can dramatically simplify the technical and labor-\nintensive process of reverse engineering malware \u2014 one of the most advanced\nmalware-analysis techniques available to cybersecurity professionals. In fact,\nit was able to process the entire decompiled code of the malware file for\nWannaCry in a single pass, taking 34 seconds to deliver its analysis and\nidentify the killswitch.\n\nWe also offer a Gemini-driven entity extraction tool to automate data fusion\nand enrichment. It can automatically crawl the web for relevant open source\nintelligence (OSINT), and classify online industry threat reporting. It then\nconverts this information to knowledge collections, with corresponding hunting\nand response packs pulled from motivations, targets, tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs), actors, toolkits, and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence can distill more than a decade of threat reports to\nproduce comprehensive, custom summaries in seconds.\n\n### Make Google part of your security team\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence is just one way we can help you in your threat\nintelligence journey. Whether you need cyber threat intelligence training for\nyour staff, assistance with prioritizing complex threats, or even a dedicated\nthreat analyst embedded in your team, our experts can act as an extension of\nyour own team.\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence is part of Google Cloud Security\u2019s comprehensive\nsecurity portfolio, which includes Google Security Operations, Mandiant\nConsulting, Security Command Center Enterprise, and Chrome Enterprise. With\nour offerings, organizations can address security challenges with the same\ncapabilities Google uses to keep more people and organizations safe online\nthan anyone else in the world.\n\nTo learn more about Google Threat Intelligence and the rest of Google Cloud\nSecurity\u2019s comprehensive portfolio, come meet us in person at our RSA\nConference booth (N5644), and catch us at our keynotes, presentations, and\nmeetups. You can also register for our upcoming Google Threat Intelligence\nuse-cases webinar series, and read our expert analysis and in-depth research\nat the Google Cloud Threat Intelligence blog.\n\nPosted in\n\n  * Security & Identity\n\n##### Related articles\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Introducing Google Security Operations: Intel-driven, AI-powered SecOps\n\nBy Chris Corde \u2022 5-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Advancing the art of AI-driven security with Google Cloud\n\nBy Steph Hay \u2022 6-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Chrome Enterprise expands ecosystem to strengthen endpoint security and\nZero Trust access\n\nBy Kiran Nair \u2022 3-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Cloud CISO Perspectives: Tour the new Security Command Center Enterprise\n\nBy Phil Venables \u2022 5-minute read\n\n### Footer Links\n\n#### Follow us\n\n  * Google Cloud\n  * Google Cloud Products\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * Cookies management controls\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
