We think we know why and that's being discussed in the\nmailing lists of LibrePlanet. Any demands from the people who want to destroy\nhim need to be ignored.\n\nSomeone in IRC has just told us that \"Rms' last talk and the whole conference\ngot canceled\", as per the page in Stallman's site.\n\nThis is what it looks like right now:\n\nAutomated translation from Spanish:\n\n> This conference has been cancelled.\n>\n> If you are participating in the event of which my conference would have been\n> a part, and if you would like to attend it, please tell the event organizers\n> that the cancellation has made you sad, and ask them to take this into\n> account. Knowing this will help them in the future.\n\nBased on Google Cache, it has been like that since the day of the talk (this\npast Friday).\n\nSo it seems to have been canceled very fast.\n\nNo further talks, says his site:\n\n\"No upcoming talks.\"\n\nWhy? \u2588\n\n# Other Recent Techrights' Posts\n\nFrans Pop suicide and Ubuntu grievances\n\n    Reprinted with permission from disguised.work\nWorkers' Right to Disconnect Won't Matter If Such a Right Isn't Properly\nEnforced\n\n    I was always \"on-call\" and my main role or function was being \"on-call\" in case of incidents\nA Discussion About Suicides in Science and Technology (Including Debian and\nthe European Patent Office)\n\n    In Debian, there is a long history of deaths, suicides, and mysterious disappearances\nFederal News Network is Corrupt, It Runs Propaganda Pieces for Microsoft\n\n    Federal News Network used to be OK some years ago\nHard Evidence Reinforces Suspicion That Mark Shuttleworth May Have Worked\nVolunteers to Death\n\n    Today we start re-publishing articles that contain unaltered E-mails\n[Meme] Sometimes Torvalds and RMS Agree on Things\n\n    hype around chatbots\n[Video] Linus Torvalds on 'Hilarious' AI Hype: \"I Hate the Hype\" and \"I Don't\nWant to be Part of the Hype\", \"You Need to Be a Bit Cynical About This Whole\nHype Cycle\"\n\n    Linus Torvalds on LLMs\nColin Watson, Steve McIntyre & Debian, Ubuntu cover-up mission after Frans Pop\nsuicide\n\n    Reprinted with permission from disguised.work\nLinks 30/04/2024: Wireless Carriers Selling Customer Location Data, Facebook\nPosts Causing Trouble\n\n    Links for the day\nLinks 30/04/2024: More Google Layoffs (Wide-Ranging)\n\n    Links for the day\nFresh Rumours of Impending Mass Layoffs at IBM Red Hat\n\n    \"IBM filed a W.A.R.N with the state of North Carolina.
