Each\nincludes X-ray data collected by Chandra over about two decades. They show\ndramatic changes in the debris and radiation remaining after the explosion of\ntwo massive stars in our galaxy.\n\nThe Crab Nebula, the result of a bright supernova explosion seen by Chinese\nand other astronomers in the year 1054, is 6,500 light-years from Earth. At\nits center is a neutron star, a super-dense compact object produced by the\nsupernova. As it rotates at about 30 times per second, its beam of radiation\npasses over the Earth every rotation, like a cosmic lighthouse.\n\nAs the young pulsar slows down, large amounts of energy are injected into its\nsurroundings. In particular, a high-speed wind of matter and anti-matter\nparticles plows into the surrounding nebula, creating a shock wave that forms\nthe ring seen in the movie. Jets from the poles of the pulsar spew X-ray\nemitting matter and antimatter particles in a direction perpendicular to the\nring.\n\nOver 22 years, Chandra has taken many observations of the Crab Nebula. With\nthis long runtime, astronomers see clear changes in both the ring and the jets\nin the new movie. Previous Chandra movies showed images taken from much\nshorter time periods \u2014 a 5-month period between 2000 and 2001 and over 7\nmonths between 2010 and 2011 for another. The longer timeframe highlights\nmesmerizing fluctuations, including whip-like variations in the X-ray jet that\nare only seen in this much longer movie. A new set of Chandra observations\nwill be conducted later this year to follow changes in the jet since the last\nChandra data was obtained in early 2022.\n\nCrab Nebula Timelapse:\n\nThe second billing in this doubleheader is just as spectacular. Cassiopeia A\n(Cas A for short) is the remains of a supernova that is estimated to have\nexploded about 340 years ago in Earth\u2019s sky. While other Chandra movies of Cas\nA have previously been released, including one with data extending from 2000\nto 2013, this new movie is substantially longer featuring data from 2000\nthrough to 2019.\n\nThe outer region of Cas A shows the expanding blast wave of the explosion. The\nblast wave is composed of shock waves, similar to the sonic booms generated by\na supersonic aircraft. These expanding shock waves are sites where particles\nare being accelerated to energies that are higher than those achieved by the\nmost powerful accelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider. As the blast\nwave travels outwards it encounters surrounding material and slows down,\ngenerating a second shock wave that travels backwards relative to the blast\nwave, analogous to a traffic jam travelling backwards from the scene of an\naccident on a highway.\n\nCas A has been one of the most highly observed targets and publicly released\nimages from the Chandra mission. It was Chandra's official first-light image\nin 1999. After the Space Shuttle Columbia launched into orbit, the observatory\nquickly discovered a point source of X-rays in Cas A\u2019s center for the first\ntime, later confirmed to be a neutron star. Over the years, astronomers have\nused Chandra to discover evidence for a \u201csuperfluid\u201d inside Cas A\u2019s neutron\nstar, to reveal that the original massive star may have turned inside out as\nit exploded, and to take an important step in pinpointing how giant stars\nexplode. Chandra has also mapped the elements forged inside the star, which\nare now moving into space to help seed the next generation of stars and\nplanets. More recently, Chandra data was combined with data from NASA\u2019s James\nWebb Space Telescope to help determine the origin of mysterious structures\nwithin the remnant.\n\nCassiopeia A Timelapse:\n\nThe images used in the latest Cas A movie have been created using a state-of-\nthe-art processing technique, led by Yusuke from Rikkyo University in Japan,\nto fully capitalize on Chandra's sharp X-ray vision. The paper describing\ntheir work was published in The Astrophysical Journal and is available online.\n\nThese two movies show Chandra\u2019s capabilities of documenting changes in\nastronomical objects over human timeframes. Such movies would not be possible\nwithout Chandra\u2019s archives that serve as public repositories for the data\ncollected over Chandra\u2019s nearly 25 years of operations.\n\nNASA's Marshall Space Flight Center manages the Chandra program. The\nSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center controls science\nfrom Cambridge Massachusetts and flight operations from Burlington,\nMassachusetts.\n\nVisual Description:\n\nThis is a still image from a split-screen video showing the change of two\nobjects in space over time. The Cassiopeia A supernova remnant is on the left\nand the Crab Nebula is on the right, divided by a white vertical line.\n\nCassiopeia A resembles a disk of electric blue light with glowing white\nstreaks. X-rays from Chandra reveal hot gas, mostly from supernova debris from\nthe destroyed star, and include elements like silicon and iron. Brilliant\nstars in white and gold, seen in optical light from Hubble, permeate the field\nof view.\n\nThe Crab Nebula resembles the shape of a spinning toy top, made of white wispy\nclouds, resting on its side. The top-like shape is outlined by feathery\nshrouds of electric blue light. In the center, where the point of the toy top\nshape meets its flared body, is a ball of brilliant white light. This is the\npulsar, a rapidly rotating neutron star, at the heart of the Crab Nebula.\nConcentric circles surround the pulsar, as if the pulsar was a small pebble\nthat was dropped into a puddle of water. From the bottom of the neutron star,\na jet of matter is rushing downward, like scalding hot steam being released\nfrom a valve.\n\n| Fast Facts for Cassiopeia A Timelapse:  \n---  \nCredit| X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO; Optical: NASA/STScI; Image Processing:\nNASA/CXC/SAO/J.
