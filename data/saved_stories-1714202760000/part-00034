Yet in recent months his company, Tesla,\nhas struggled to maintain its momentum: sales have dropped this year, and so\nhas its share price.\n\nThose struggles have become emblematic of a broader reckoning facing the\nelectric vehicle (EV) industry. After the soaring demand and valuations of the\ncoronavirus pandemic years, the pace of sales growth has slowed. The industry\nhas entered a new phase, with questions over whether the switch from petrol\nand diesel to cleaner electric is facing a troublesome stall or a temporary\nspeed bump.\n\nMusk acknowledged the difficulties this week, telling investors: \u201cThe EV\nadoption rate globally is under pressure, and a lot of other auto\nmanufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.\u201d\nMusk, of course, insisted that was the wrong decision.\n\nA charging station for electric cars in Norway, where EVs make up 90% of the\nmarket.

Across\nEurope, battery electric cars slipped to a 13% share of all sales, down from\nlast year\u2019s 13.9%, while sales of hybrids \u2013 which combine a battery with an\ninternal combustion engine \u2013 rose to 29% from 24.4%. In the UK, electric cars\naccounted for 15.5% of total car sales in the first three months of 2024, only\nmarginally up from the same time last year.\n\nIn recent years electric car manufacturers have been able easily to sell every\nelectric car they have made. Yet now, businesses across much of the world are\nstruggling with the end of the era of rock-bottom interest rates, which has\nleft less money in household pockets.\n\n\u201cThe economic headwinds are quite ugly in general, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me\nthat we\u2019re having a slowdown,\u201d said Ian Henry, whose AutoAnalysis consultancy\nworks with several carmakers.\n\nBuyers must still pay more upfront for battery cars (although most would save\nmoney by owning an electric vehicle because of cheaper energy). And electric\ncar repair costs and insurance costs can be higher in some places because of a\nshortage of mechanics. Another important factor is the very patchy\nintroduction of public electric chargers, which is giving some potential\nbuyers cause to pause. All of that has been leapt upon by sceptics of the EV\nindustry \u2013 and made them a battleground in the culture wars.\n\n## The hand of government\n\nRico Luman, a senior sector economist covering automotive at ING, an\ninvestment bank, said that EV sales had hit a \u201cplateau\u201d, and that it would get\nharder to sell electric cars after the initial rush of early adopters\ncomfortable with switching from petrol and diesel.\n\nHowever, there is more going on with the showdown than purely economic\nfactors. Governments are also a playing a major role. That is particularly\nevident across Europe, where EV sales are taking diverging paths even though\nbuyers face similar pressures. Norway is an outlier. With heavily subsidised\nelectric car sales, EVs now make up 90% of the market. The EV market share has\nalso increased this year in Denmark, Belgium and France.\n\nHowever, it has declined in Germany, once the biggest electric car market, for\none simple reason: the government has withdrawn subsidies.\n\nAs well as affecting demand, regulation is also playing a big role in what\ncars are on offer. Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric cars analyst, has\nlong expected European electric sales growth to slump during 2024. That is\nbecause 1 January 2025 is the date on which the EU takes its next big step\ntowards zero-emissions vehicles: the average carbon dioxide emissions of cars\nsold by each manufacturer must fall by 15% compared with 2021.\n\nThe Ford Puma.

Schmidt argues that the European industry\nis going through a \u201creplication\u201d of the situation experienced in 2019, when\nmanufacturers held back their electric cars, before launching a barrage of new\nmodels in 2020.\n\nSure enough, carmakers are releasing new mass-market models just in time.\nRenault\u2019s electric 5 hatchback will cost less than \u20ac25,000 (\u00a321,430) when\nsales begin this autumn, while Ford is due to launch an electric version of\nthe UK\u2019s bestselling car, the Ford Puma, later this year.\n\n## Moaning manufacturers\n\nA man helps assemble an Opel Grandland X SUV car at Opel\u2019s plant in Eisenach,\neastern Germany. Photograph: Martin Schutt/dpa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot Fiat and Chrysler brands, is\nalso joining the rush: it unveiled its electric Vauxhall/Opel Grandland SUV on\nTuesday. But that has not stopped its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, from\ncomplaining bitterly about how regulations are enforcing the pace of the\nswitch to electric.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

He then claimed to\njournalists that the mandate was a \u201cterrible\u201d policy because it was forcing\ncarmakers to introduce electric models too quickly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe consequence of this is that everybody will start pushing the BEV\n[battery electric vehicle], pushing the metal into the market, which then\ntotally destroys profitability, which then destroys the companies.\u201d\n\nChart showing car registrations\n\nSchmidt said carmakers\u2019 complaints may have an ulterior motive. The EU rules\nwill ban most internal combustion sales by 2035, but they are due for review\nin 2026.\n\n\u201cLots of manufacturers complaining now that it\u2019s unrealistic to meet those\ntargets is a lobbying message by stealth,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done it so\noften it\u2019s almost a case of the boy that cried wolf. There\u2019s definitely a\nhidden agenda in their moaning.\u201d\n\nBut other manufacturers have already slowed their shift, which will mean\nselling petrol models \u2013 which are still more profitable \u2013 for longer. In the\nUS, General Motors last year delayed production from a factory in Michigan,\nwhile Ford postponed construction of a plant in Kentucky. And in the UK, the\nluxury carmaker Bentley last month said it would delay its first battery car\nfor a year to 2026.\n\n\u201cManufacturers are definitely struggling at the moment strategically,\u201d said\nLuman. \u201cThey\u2019re now playing around with the timing of models, but not\npostponing it too far. Otherwise they\u2019ll miss the boat in terms of market\nshare.\u201d\n\nChart showing battery car sales by percentage\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason European and US carmakers are unlikely to reverse\ncourse on EVs is China. Growth in Chinese sales may have slowed in the first\nquarter of 2024 compared with last year, but they still topped a million,\naccording to industry data cited by Reuters. A host of Chinese carmakers \u2013\nincluding the leader BYD and new, well-funded entrants such as phone maker\nXiaomi \u2013 are battling to dominate their home market and win a new role as the\nworld\u2019s biggest car exporter.\n\nThe German chancelllor, Olaf Scholz, on his recent trip to China, argued\nagainst protectionism and said Chinese manufacturers must still have access to\nthe European market \u2013 acutely aware that penalising Chinese EVs would meet\nswift retaliation against Germany\u2019s carmakers.\n\nFor electric carmakers, the huge competition is biting \u2013 forcing even Tesla to\ncut prices to keep selling its cars. That competition will cause car\nexecutives sleepless nights \u2013 and could force some to merge or face\nbankruptcy, which could cause job losses. But it could also push prices down\nfurther, making electric cars cheaper than petrol equivalents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s potentially a good thing for consumers,\u201d said Ian Henry. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a\ngood thing for manufacturers who are trying to make money is a different\nquestion.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Automotive industry\n  * Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars\n  * Automotive emissions\n  * Stellantis\n  * Ford\n  * Chinese economy\n  * China\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Fashion\n  * Food\n  * Recipes\n  * Travel\n  * Health & fitness\n  * Women\n  * Men\n  * Love & sex\n  * Beauty\n  * Home & garden\n  * Money\n  * Cars\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
