Find open positions via Google\n\n## About\n\nWhy Google? \u2014 It has all the data and allows searching several companies job\nportals at once, leveraging its other powerful tools (e.g. date filter,\nexcluding words, highlighting visited links).\n\nSome time ago it became apparent to me that most job boards I know became\naggregators \u2014 most companies have their own job portals or at least pages on\ntheir sites, and those aggregators most of the time just collect postings. Of\ncourse they try to add value to it, but sometimes they try too much (adding\ncomplex interface), they choose what companies to show to you and postings\nbecome stale.\n\nSo I tried searching on companies' job boards directly with Google \u2014 as those\nportals often don't have search features \u2014 excluding middleman, and found my\ncurrent position!\n\nAt that time I stored queries in my notebook. But recently I've realized that\nGoogle is even more powerful \u2014 it allows searching on several portals at once.\nWith this, complexity of queries starts to grow and managing queries in the\nnotebook becomes difficult \u2014 queries are too long and hard to edit (add or\nexclude portals).\n\nInitially I thought that it was too simple to be shared with others (anyone\ncan Google), but when complexity started to grow I made this page and it looks\nlike now it may be useful to others.\n\nHope it helps you!\n\n## Upcoming\n\nTo get notified about new features, tools and advices (e.g. \"search history\"),\ndrop me a line and I will let you know when there are updates:\ninbox@joseef.com\n\nIf it helps you, please consider buying me an apple\n\n2024, Joseef\n\n", "frontpage": false}
