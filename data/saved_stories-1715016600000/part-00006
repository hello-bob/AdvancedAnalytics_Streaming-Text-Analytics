Regardless of the\nalgorithm you\u2019ll use, real numbers are naturally ordered. Mathematically\nspeaking, they have a total order, in the sense that you can always decide if\na number is greater than another one. There is no ambiguity in this, meaning\nyou can actually sort them, and (excluding duplicates) this sort is unique.\nThere are other fields which are not that lucky: colour, for instance, are\nvery unlucky. Supposing you\u2019re representing colours with their RGB values,\nthere is no standard way to order triples in a line, since they are naturally\nnot organised in a line fashion. The problem is even more complicated since\ncolours have a meaning in the real world. How can we sort colours so that they\nlook as continuous as possible? Which parameters affects the sorting order? Is\nazure closer to blue (similar hue) or to cyan (similar luminosity)? I can stop\nyou all here and say that there is no solution to this problem. You can sort\ncolours, but the overall result depends on what you are trying to achieve.\nThis post will explore how colours can be sorted, and how this can lead to\nvery different results.\n\n### Part 1: Colour sorting\n\nLet\u2019s start by creating a bunch of random colours, sampling them from the RGB\nspace.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\nimport random\n\ncolours_length = 1000\n\ncolours = []\n\nfor i in range(1, colours_length):\n\ncolours.append (\n\n[\n\nrandom.random(),\n\nrandom.random(),\n\nrandom.random()\n\n]\n\n)\n\nimport random colours_length = 1000 colours = [] for i in range(1,\ncolours_length): colours.append ( [ random.random(), random.random(),\nrandom.random() ] )\n\n    \n    \n    import random colours_length = 1000 colours = [] for i in range(1, colours_length): colours.append ( [ random.random(), random.random(), random.random() ] )\n\nAll the examples in this post will refer to this very list of random colours.\n\n#### RGB sorting\n\nThe most trivial way in which we can sort colours is by directing sort its RGB\nvalues. Python has a very naive way of doing this: it sorts the first\ncomponent, then the second and finally the third one. If two colours have the\nsame quantity of red, the green channel will be used to determine which one is\n\u201cbigger\u201d.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ncolours.sort()\n\ncolours.sort()\n\n    \n    \n    colours.sort()\n\nThe result looks indeed very poor.\n\n#### HSV sorting\n\nThe RGB colour space works very well for monitors, but it does not represent\nhow similar colours are. The HSV space attempts to overcome to this problem by\nintroducing a parameter called hue. The hue is the base colour, made more\nintense or washed away by its saturation. The third component, simply called\nvalue, determined how \u201cdark\u201d the colour is. Since the hue has been arranged,\nby definition, in a rainbow fashion, sorting directly on the HSV values is\nlikely to produce somehow visually pleasant results.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(*rgb) )\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(*rgb) )\n\n    \n    \n    colours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(*rgb) )\n\nSorting using the HLS space, which organises colours in a similar fashion,\nproduces seemingly indistinguishable results.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*rgb) )\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*rgb) )\n\n    \n    \n    colours.sort(key=lambda rgb: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*rgb) )\n\nBoth these solutions, however, looks very noisy.\n\n#### Luminosity sorting\n\nThe reason why sorting in HSV and HLS colour spaces produces noisy result is\ncaused by a single factor. HSV believes that hue is more important than\nluminosity. Two visually different shades of blue are closer, compared two two\ndifferent colours with the similar intensity. An attempt to compensate for\nthis is by sorting directly for the perceived luminosity of a colour.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ndef lum (r,g,b):\n\nreturn math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b )\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: lum(*rgb) )\n\ndef lum (r,g,b): return math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b )\ncolours.sort(key=lambda rgb: lum(*rgb) )\n\n    \n    \n    def lum (r,g,b): return math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b ) colours.sort(key=lambda rgb: lum(*rgb) )\n\nBut this, unfortunately, still yields a very poor result.\n\n#### Step sorting\n\nIf we want to sort colours in a visually pleasant way, we need to do something\nmore complicated. We can, for instance, merge hue and luminosity information\nto obtain a smoother result. Another problem we encounter, however, is\ndetermined by how tuples are sorted in Python. To dampen the impact that\nsorting on the first component has, we can reduce the colour space from a\nfloat value between 0 to 1, to an integer from 0 to 7. By doing this, much of\nthe noise is removed.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ndef step (r,g,b, repetitions=1):\n\nlum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b )\n\nh, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b)\n\nh2 = int(h * repetitions)\n\nlum2 = int(lum * repetitions)\n\nv2 = int(v * repetitions)\n\nreturn (h2, lum, v2)\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\ndef step (r,g,b, repetitions=1): lum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 *\nb ) h, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b) h2 = int(h * repetitions) lum2 =\nint(lum * repetitions) v2 = int(v * repetitions) return (h2, lum, v2)\ncolours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\n    \n    \n    def step (r,g,b, repetitions=1): lum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b ) h, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b) h2 = int(h * repetitions) lum2 = int(lum * repetitions) v2 = int(v * repetitions) return (h2, lum, v2) colours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\nMost of the noise is not removed, but the segments don\u2019t look continuous any\nmore. To fix this, we can invert the luminosity of every other segment.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\ndef step (r,g,b, repetitions=1):\n\nlum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b )\n\nh, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b)\n\nh2 = int(h * repetitions)\n\nlum2 = int(lum * repetitions)\n\nv2 = int(v * repetitions)\n\nif h2 % 2 == 1:\n\nv2 = repetitions - v2\n\nlum = repetitions - lum\n\nreturn (h2, lum, v2)\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\ndef step (r,g,b, repetitions=1): lum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 *\nb ) h, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b) h2 = int(h * repetitions) lum2 =\nint(lum * repetitions) v2 = int(v * repetitions) if h2 % 2 == 1: v2 =\nrepetitions - v2 lum = repetitions - lum return (h2, lum, v2)\ncolours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\n    \n    \n    def step (r,g,b, repetitions=1): lum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b ) h, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b) h2 = int(h * repetitions) lum2 = int(lum * repetitions) v2 = int(v * repetitions) if h2 % 2 == 1: v2 = repetitions - v2 lum = repetitions - lum return (h2, lum, v2) colours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b): step(r,g,b,8) )\n\nColours looks now organised in a neater way. They are mostly continuous, with\nvery little noise compared to the native HSV sorting. This, however, came at\nthe expense of a monotonic luminosity. When it comes to colour sorting, we\ncan\u2019t have it all.\n\n#### Hilbert sorting\n\nThere is another way to sort colours which looks rather interesting. It is\nbased on the concept of Hilbert curve. You can image a Hilbert curve as a way\nof mapping every point in a 2D space by using a 1D curve.\n\nThis is possible because the Hilbert curve is a fractal space-filling object.\nWe can extend the same concept of space-filling to our three dimensional\ncolour space. What if we use a Hilbert curve to connect all the colours in\ntheir RGB space? For this example I am using Steve Witham\u2018s implementation of\na Hilbert walk, as suggested by Jan P\u00f6schko.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\nimport hilbert\n\ncolours.sort(key=lambda\n(r,g,b):hilbert.Hilbert_to_int([int(r*255),int(g*255),int(b*255)]) )\n\nimport hilbert colours.sort(key=lambda\n(r,g,b):hilbert.Hilbert_to_int([int(r*255),int(g*255),int(b*255)]) )\n\n    \n    \n    import hilbert colours.sort(key=lambda (r,g,b):hilbert.Hilbert_to_int([int(r*255),int(g*255),int(b*255)]) )\n\nThe result is indeed intriguing and, despite not following any intuitive\ncolour distribution, it looks very homogeneous. It\u2019s interesting to notice\nthat while all the above mentioned technique would sort greyscale colours\ncorrectly, Hilbert sorting rearranges them in a very different way.\n\n#### Travelling Salesman sorting\n\nThe travelling salesman problem refers to a very practical issues: visiting a\ncertain number of cities minimising the overall distance and visiting each\ncity only once. This sounds exactly what we want: visiting each colours only\nonce, minimising the overall distance. Despite being such a critical issue,\nthe travelling salesman problem is NP-complete, which is a fancy way of saying\nthat is too computationally expensive to run over thousands of colours. The\nalgorithm I\u2019ll be using instead is a suboptimal version, called nearest\nneighbour. Without going too much into its details, it often finds solutions\nto the travelling salesman problem which are, on average, 25% worse. Which is\nnot that bad, after all. I have used this version of the algorithm.\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nOpen code in new window\n\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import distance\n\n# Distance matrix\n\nA = np.zeros([colours_length,colours_length])\n\nfor x in range(0, colours_length-1):\n\nfor y in range(0, colours_length-1):\n\nA[x,y] = distance.euclidean(colours[x],colours[y])\n\n# Nearest neighbour algorithm\n\npath, _ = NN(A, 0)\n\n# Final array\n\ncolours_nn = []\n\nfor i in path:\n\ncolours_nn.append( colours[i] )\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import distance # Distance matrix A =\nnp.zeros([colours_length,colours_length]) for x in range(0, colours_length-1):\nfor y in range(0, colours_length-1): A[x,y] =\ndistance.euclidean(colours[x],colours[y]) # Nearest neighbour algorithm path,\n_ = NN(A, 0) # Final array colours_nn = [] for i in path: colours_nn.append(\ncolours[i] )\n\n    \n    \n    from scipy.spatial import distance # Distance matrix A = np.zeros([colours_length,colours_length]) for x in range(0, colours_length-1): for y in range(0, colours_length-1): A[x,y] = distance.euclidean(colours[x],colours[y]) # Nearest neighbour algorithm path, _ = NN(A, 0) # Final array colours_nn = [] for i in path: colours_nn.append( colours[i] )\n\nIts result is very smooth, even though the colours are all over the place.\nThis solution, however, should be the one that really minimises the distances\nbetween them.\n\nWe can also use other colour spaces to calculate distance, such as the HSV\n(top) and the Lab (bottom) ones, although they all yields similar results:\n\n### Part 2: Colour distance\n\nColour sorting is deeply connected to another problem. Given two different\ncolours, how distant are they? The concept of distance strongly depends on the\nspace we are analysing them. Just to give you an indication, here there are\nsome charts which will help you understand how distance is perceived in\nseveral colour space.\n\nIn the following diagrams, every (x,y) pixel indicates how distant the\nrespective colours in the X and Y axes are. The X and Y axes arrange colours\naccording to their hue value. White pixels indicate a perfect match: the\ncolours have zero distance, meaning they are are identical. Dark pixels,\ninstead, indicate a high distance. You can click on the charts to expand them.\n\nHSV (& HSL)| RGB  \n---|---  \nYIQ| LAB  \n  \nThe next diagrams replace the rainbow colours on the horizontal axis with a\ngreyscale gradient. There won\u2019t be any white pixels since no two colours are\nthe same now.\n\nHSV & HSL| RGB  \n---|---  \nYIQ| LAB  \n  \n### Conclusion\n\nSorting by colours is a very common practice, especially in advertising and\nother form of media which requires to be visually pleasant. In a previous post\nI explained how I collected all the screenshots from #ScreenshotSaturday and\nsorted them, showing some interesting results over the predominant hues found\nin indie games. These mosaics are done using over 30.000 images, weighting\nalmost 9Gb. You can download the full-size moisacs (16Mb, 71Mb, 40Mb, 13Mb)\nhere on Patreon. Sceen size mosaics are also available in the tweet below.\n\n> Have you ever wondered what ALL the #ScreenshotSaturday submissions would\n> look like together? @ScreenshotSat #gamedev pic.twitter.com/rnzd2PkP2c\n>\n> \u2014 Alan Zucconi (@AlanZucconi) May 9, 2015\n\nSorting colours is a pain. There isn\u2019t a magic function which will order them\nnicely, simply because the way we perceived them is based on three different\ncomponents. Any attempt to flatten them onto one single dimension will\ninevitably collapse some of the complexity. When it comes to sort colours, you\nshould understand which features you want to highlight. Is it the hue? Is it\nthe luminosity? Start from there, and create your own function.\n\n#### Other resources\n\n  * Sorting colours with Hilbert curves: the post which inspired the Hilbert sorting;\n  * Sorting colours in Mathematica: an interesting discussion on how colours can be sorted in Mathematica;\n  * A Visit to Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom: how colour clustering and sorting can be used to identify emotions in Disney\u2019s movies;\n  * Using PCA to sort high dimensional objects: how to use Principal Component Analysis to sort colours;\n  * TSPPixelSort: how genetics algorithms can be used to sort colours;\n  * Rainbow Smoke: all the RGB colours sorted in a single image.

Julie Rymer\n\nJanuary 24, 2020\n\nInteresting article, in case anyone is interested, I wrote a script\nimplementing the step sorting using numpy, complete with color array and final\nimage generation:\n\nimport itertools import warnings\n\nimport numpy as np import cv2 from skimage.color import deltaE_ciede2000,\nrgb2lab, lab2rgb, rgb2hsv from skimage import img_as_ubyte, img_as_float32\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nh, w = (20, 5)\n\n# # produce all possible colors all_colors = [color for color in\nitertools.product(range(256), repeat=3)] # # equivalent but ~8% slower on my\ncomputer # all_colors = [(r, g, b) for r in range(256) for g in range(256) for\nb in range(256)]\n\nall_colors = img_as_float32(np.expand_dims(np.array(all_colors,\ndtype=np.uint8), axis=0)) # # equivalent but ~5% slower on my computer #\nall_colors = np.expand_dims(np.array(all_colors, dtype=np.float32) / 255,\naxis=0)\n\nall_colors = cv2.cvtColor(all_colors, cv2.COLOR_RGB2Lab)[0] # # equivalent but\n~2400% slower on my computer # all_colors = rgb2lab(all_colors)[0]\n\n# select only sufficiently dissimilar colors final_colors = [] while\nall_colors.size > 0: color = all_colors[np.random.choice(all_colors.shape[0])]\nfinal_colors.append(color) similarity = deltaE_ciede2000(color, all_colors)\nall_colors = all_colors[similarity > 10]\n\n# # deltaE_ciede2000 distance: # # <= 1.0 Not perceptible by human eyes. # # 1\n\u2013 2 Perceptible through close observation. # # 2 \u2013 10 Perceptible at a glance.\n# # 11 \u2013 49 Colors are more similar than opposite # # 100 Colors are exact\nopposite\n\n# # If you want all color instead, but beware of memory errors # final_colors\n= all_colors\n\ndef transform_to_sorting_color_space(hsv_arr, hue_nb): arr = hsv_arr.copy()\nsat = arr[:, :, 1] grey_threshold = 0.15\n\narr[:, :, 0] = (arr[:, :, 0] * (hue_nb \u2013 2)).round() + 1\n\n# # personal remix, to regroup color that are really a shade of grey to the\nleft indexes_greys = (sat < grey_threshold) arr[:, :, 0][indexes_greys] = 0\n\n# invert the luminosity of every other segment indexes_odd_hue = (arr[:, :, 0]\n% 2 == 1) arr[:, :, 1:][indexes_odd_hue] = 1 \u2013 arr[:, :, 1:][indexes_odd_hue]\n\narr[:, :, 1:] = arr[:, :, [2, 1]]\n\nreturn arr\n\nfinal_colors = np.expand_dims(np.array(final_colors, dtype=np.float32),\naxis=0) final_colors = lab2rgb(final_colors) hsv_colors =\nrgb2hsv(final_colors)\n\n# Step sorting sorting_colors = transform_to_sorting_color_space(hsv_colors,\n12)[0] sort_indices = np.lexsort(sorting_colors[:, ::-1].T) final_colors[0] =\nfinal_colors[0, sort_indices]\n\n# # If you prefer Hue sort # final_colors[0] =\nfinal_colors[0][np.lexsort(hsv_colors[0][:, ::-1].T)]\n\nwith warnings.catch_warnings(): warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\") final_colors =\nimg_as_ubyte(final_colors)[0]\n\nprint(f'nb_colors : {final_colors.shape[0]}')\n\n# produce image color_img = Image.new('RGB', (w * final_colors.shape[0], h))\nfinal_colors = sum([[tuple(color)] * w for color in final_colors] * h, [])\ncolor_img.putdata(final_colors) color_img.save('./all_colors.png')\n\nReply to Julie\n\n     * Alan Zucconi\n\nJanuary 26, 2020\n\nThank you!\n\nReply to Alan\n\n  13.

Rombout Versluijs\n\nFebruary 18, 2020\n\nOkay looked at your repo and your code is actually different than this articel\n\nin your colour-sort.py the line is like this; colors.sort(key=lambda rgb:\nstep(rgb,8))\n\ninstead of colors.sort(key=lambda (r, g, b): step(r, g, b,8))\n\nReply to Rombout\n\n  15. Rombout Versluijs\n\nMarch 13, 2020\n\nIs there a reason lum2 is not used and also in the HSV the saturation is not\nused?\n\nReply to Rombout\n\n  16. William Thompson\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\nAlan, let me start by thanking you for the absolutely brilliant article. I\nspent a long time trying to figure out where your brightness formula and\nnumbers originated and finally came to understand it\u2019s a composite of two\nthings that aren\u2019t totally accurate (but pretty close). You use this:\n\nlum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 * b )\n\nbut this has 2 parts that can be corrected for better calculation. First part,\nthe numbers come from calculating luminescence in the YIQ color space (ITU\nBT.601 standard). The numbers should be:\n\nY = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B\n\nUsing the square root of this creates a linear scale approximation accounting\nfor gamma correction (should actually take the 2.2 root instead of 2). You can\nuse the raw brightness formula (much less processor intensive and still\naccurate)\n\nIf you really want the gamma corrected formula you can write it like this:\n\nlum = math.pow((0.299 * r + 0.587 * g + 0.114 * b), 1/2.2)\n\nhttps://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.601/\n\nReply to William\n\n     * Alan Zucconi\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\nHi! Thank you so much for your input on this! I\u2019ll need to have a look and\nupdate the article at some point!\n\nReply to Alan\n\n  17. james\n\nAugust 10, 2020\n\nvery bad at this (sorting colors and computers), if i let you the hex value of\nmy amount of colors would you (anyone) sort for me.\n\nReply to james\n\n  18. Paul\n\nOctober 8, 2021\n\nThese visualisations are very helpful, thanks! They confirmed that sorting by\nluminosity was primarily what I wanted for my purpose, but that I needed to do\nsome secondary sorting to make it look nicer. Arrange the colours sorted by\nluminosity in a square image, and then sort each horizontal line by hue.\n\nReply to Paul\n\n  19. Jens\n\nMarch 25, 2022\n\nThanks for this! Sorting by HSV used to be my solution, except I sorted\ndesaturated colours into a separate band, so you don\u2019t have greys mixed with\ncolours. I finally tried TSP as well, after thinking about it a few times over\nthe years, and for the non-random palettes I\u2019m using it seems to be the most\nusable result. I used python-tsp, and set the distances in the first column to\n0 as path doesn\u2019t need to return.\n\nReply to Jens\n\n  20. yl\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\ndef step (r,g,b, repetitions=1): lum = math.sqrt( .241 * r + .691 * g + .068 *\nb )\n\nh, s, v = colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(r,g,b)\n\nh2 = int(h * repetitions) lum2 = int(lum * repetitions) v2 = int(v *\nrepetitions)\n\nif h2 % 2 == 1: v2 = repetitions \u2013 v2 lum = repetitions \u2013 lum\n\nreturn (h2, lum, v2) Hello!
