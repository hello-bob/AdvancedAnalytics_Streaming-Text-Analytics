A new paper describing this work is co-authored with researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.\n\n  * A deep learning model is used to successfully identify proceeds of crime deposited at a crypto exchange, new money laundering transaction patterns and previously-unknown illicit wallets. These outputs are already being used to enhance Elliptic\u2019s products.\n\n  * Elliptic has also made the underlying data publicly available. Containing over 200 million transactions, it will enable the wider community to develop new AI techniques for the detection of illicit cryptocurrency activity.\n\nAt Elliptic we have always pushed the boundaries of blockchain analytics, to\nenable our customers to more accurately and efficiently assess risk in\ncryptoassets. Part of this innovation has been exploring how artificial\nintelligence can be leveraged to improve the detection of money laundering and\nother financial crime on blockchains.\n\nBlockchains provide fertile ground for machine learning techniques, thanks to\nthe availability of both transaction data and information on the types of\nentities that are transacting, collected by us and others. This is in contrast\nto traditional finance where transaction data is typically siloed, making it\nchallenging to apply these techniques.\n\n## Machine learning on the blockchain\n\nWe first published research on this topic in 2019, co-authored with\nresearchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. A machine learning model was\ntrained to identify Bitcoin transactions made by illicit actors, such as\nransomware groups or darknet marketplaces. The training data, compiled by\nElliptic and containing over 200,000 bitcoin transactions, was made publicly\navailable to encourage further experimentation and collaboration within this\nemerging field. That paper has now been cited nearly 400 times by researchers\naround the world, which demonstrates the impact it has had and continues to\nhave in the fields of machine learning and anti-money laundering.\n\nA new preprint article describing the details of our research is available at:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19109.\n\nWe have now released further research, applying new techniques to a much\nlarger dataset, containing nearly 200 million transactions. This work is again\nco-authored by researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. Rather than\nidentifying transactions made by illicit actors, a machine learning model is\ntrained to identify \u201csubgraphs\u201d, chains of transactions that represent bitcoin\nbeing laundered. By identifying these subgraphs rather than illicit wallets,\nthis approach allows us to focus on the \u201cmulti-hop\u201d laundering process more\ngenerally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors.\n\nThe training data contains \"subgraphs\": chains of transactions, some of which\nare known to represent money laundering.\n\n## Testing our results\n\nWe worked with a cryptocurrency exchange to test whether this technique could\nbe used to identify money laundering attempts through that business. Of 52\n\u201cmoney laundering\u201d subgraphs predicted by the model and which ended with\ndeposits to this exchange, the exchange confirmed that 14 had been received by\nusers who had already been flagged as being linked to money laundering. On\naverage less than one in 10,000 of these accounts are flagged as such,\nsuggesting that the model performs very well^*. Importantly, the exchange\u2019s\ninsights were based on off-chain information, suggesting that the model can\nidentify money laundering that would not be identifiable using traditional\nblockchain analytical techniques alone.\n\nWe also investigated the types of money laundering patterns that the trained\nmodel was identifying. This revealed known money laundering patterns such as\n\u201cpeeling chains\u201d, which can already be automatically detected in Elliptic\u2019s\ntransaction and wallet screening tools. However it also identified novel\npatterns such as the use of intermediary \u201cnested services\u201d in specific ways.\nKnowledge of these money laundering behaviors is of value to AML\npractitioners, and can be added to the suite of behaviours that can be\ndetected with Elliptic\u2019s tools.\n\nSimplified illustrations of two examples of the money laundering patterns that\nwere identified by the model.\n\nThe machine learning model can also be used to help identify previously-\nunknown illicit wallets. When the model predicts that a given subgraph is an\ninstance of money laundering, it implies that the funds have potentially\noriginated from some type of illicit activity. Directed research can then be\nperformed on these wallets to try to identify them. This approach has already\nenabled us to identify a number of previously unknown wallets used by illicit\nactors including ponzi schemes and darknet markets.\n\n## Sharing our data with the community\n\nAs well as releasing our research, we have also made the underlying data\npublicly available. The largest public dataset of its kind, \u201cElliptic2\u201d will\nenable the development of new techniques for the detection of illicit\ncryptocurrency transactions by the wider community. It will also aid the\ndevelopment of the underlying graph neural network methods, used in\napplications including drug discovery, physics and computer vision.\n\nThis novel work demonstrates that AI methods can be applied to blockchain data\nto identify illicit wallets and money laundering patterns, which were\npreviously hidden from view. This is made possible by the inherent\ntransparency of blockchains and demonstrates that cryptoassets, far from being\na haven for criminals, are far more amenable to AI-based financial crime\ndetection than traditional financial assets. We have barely scratched the\nsurface of what is possible in this domain, but this work has already led to\nbenefits for Elliptic\u2019s users. Further collaboration and data-sharing will be\nkey to advancing these techniques further and combating financial crime in\ncryptoassets.\n\nYou can read the research paper in full here, and the Elliptic2 dataset is now\navailable to access. To discuss the research, and find out more about how we\nare applying these new techniques to enhance our products, get in touch.\n\n^*If 52 random subgraphs were chosen, on average none of them would be\nexpected to involve flagged exchange users.\n\nFeatured Articles\n\nFound this interesting?
