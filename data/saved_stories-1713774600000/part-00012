MADNICK\n\nJohn Norris Maguire Professor of Information Technology, Sloan School of\nManagement\n\n& Professor of Engineering Systems, School of Engineering\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nProfessor Stuart Madnick has been a faculty member at M.I.T. since 1972. He\nhas served as the head of MIT's Information Technologies Group for more than\ntwenty years. During that time the group has been consistently rated #1 in the\nnation among business school information technology programs (U.S. News &\nWorld Reports, BusinessWeek, and ComputerWorld). He has also been an affiliate\nmember of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, a member of the research\nadvisory committee of the International Financial Services Research Center,\nand a member of the executive committee of the Center for Information Systems\nResearch.\n\nDr. Madnick is a prolific writer and is the author or co-author of over 380\nbooks, articles, or technical reports including the classic textbook,\nOperating Systems (McGraw-Hill), and the book, The Dynamics of Software\nDevelopment (Prentice-Hall). He has also contributed chapters to other books,\nsuch as Information Technology in Action (Prentice-Hall).\n\nHis current research interests include connectivity among disparate\ndistributed information systems, database technology, software project\nmanagement, and the strategic use of information technology. He is presently\nco-Director of the PROductivity From Information Technology (PROFIT)\nInitiative and co-Heads the Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) research\nprogram.\n\nHe has been the Principal Investigator of a large-scale DARPA-funded research\neffort on Context Interchange which involves the development of technology\nthat helps organizations to work more cooperatively, coordinated, and\ncollaboratively. As part of this effort, he is the co-inventor on the patents\n\"Querying Heterogeneous Data Sources over a Network Using Context Interchange\"\nand \"Data Extraction from World Wide Web Pages.\"\n\nHe has been active in industry, making significant contributions as a key\ndesigner and developer of projects such as IBM's VM/370 operating system and\nLockheed's DIALOG information retrieval system. He has served as a consultant\nto many major corporations, such as IBM, AT&T, and Citicorp. He has also been\nthe founder or co-founder of several high-tech firms, including Intercomp\n(acquired by Logicon), Mitrol (acquired by General Electric's Information\nSystems Company), Cambridge Institute for Information Systems (subsequently\nre-named Cambridge Technology Group), iAggregate (acquired by ArsDigita which\nwas subsequently acquired by Red Hat), and currently operates a hotel in the\n14th century Langley Castle in England.\n\nDr. Madnick has degrees in Electrical Engineering (B.S. and M.S.), Management\n(M.S.), and Computer Science (Ph.D.) from MIT. He has been a Visiting\nProfessor/Scholar at Harvard University, Nanyang Technological University\n(Singapore), University of Newcastle (England), Technion (Israel), Victoria\nUniversity (New Zealand), University of Edinburgh (Scotland), Conservatoire\nNational des Arts et M\u00e9tiers (Paris, France), and the European Research\nConsortium for Informatics and Mathematics (Nice, France)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
