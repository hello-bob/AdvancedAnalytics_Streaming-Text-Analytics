With the iPhone 15 models, the non-pro models have 6 GB and the Pro\nmodels 8 GB. If true, one incongruity will be that new iPhones will have the\nsame amount of RAM as most base-model Macs.\n\nThis came up on the most recent episode of ATP, and their show notes include\nthese two charts posted to Mastodon by David Schaub, showing (a) the base RAM\nfor all-in-one Mac desktops from 1984 onward; and (b) the base RAM in consumer\nMac laptops from 1999 onward. It has always been the case that Apple has been\nopen to criticism for base-model RAM being \u201cone click\u201d too low. E.g. when base\nRAM was 1 GB, it should have been 2 GB; when it was 2 GB it should have been 4\nGB; etc. But it was also always the case that Apple increased the base RAM\nevery two years or so. Not anymore. iMacs have been stuck at 8 GB of base RAM\nsince the 27-inch iMac from late 2012. MacBook Airs have been stuck at 8 GB\nbase RAM since 2017.\n\nI do think it\u2019s true that Apple silicon changed this equation. Perhaps even,\nas a rule of thumb, by a factor of 2 \u2014 that an Apple silicon Mac with 8 GB RAM\nperforms as well under memory constraints as an Intel-based Mac with 16 GB.\nBut base model consumer Macs have been stuck at 8 GB for a long time, and it\u2019s\nimpossible to look at Schaub\u2019s charts and not see that regular increases in\nbase RAM effectively stopped when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Apple silicon\nefficiency notwithstanding, more RAM is better, and certainly more future-\nproof. And it\u2019s downright bizarre to think that come this fall, all iPhone 16\nmodels will sport as much RAM as base model Macs. (Supercomputer pioneer\nSeymour Cray on virtual memory: \u201cMemory is like an orgasm. It\u2019s a lot better\nif you don\u2019t have to fake it.\u201d)\n\nPrevious:| Making a Mountain Out of Molehill-Sized M4 News  \n---|---  \n  \nDisplay Preferences\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002\u20132024 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
