I made two small edits to generalize his actual\nstatement. He referred specifically to the application of the inclusion-\nexclusion principle to problems in combinatorics. Here is his actual quote\nfrom [1].\n\n> One frequently notices, however, a wide gap between the bare statement of\n> the principle and the skill required in recognizing that it applies to a\n> particular combinatorial problem.\n\nThis post will expand a little on Rota\u2019s original statement and a couple\napplications of the more general version of his statement.\n\n## The inclusion-exclusion principle\n\nI don\u2019t think Rota would have disagreed with my edited version of his\nstatement, but it\u2019s interesting to think of his original context. The\ninclusion-exclusion principle seems like a simple problem solving strategy:\nyou may count a set of things by first over-counting, then correcting for the\nover-counting.\n\nFor example, a few days ago I wrote about a graph created by turning left at\nthe nth step if n is divisible by 7 or contains a digit 7. Suppose you wanted\nto count how many times you turn in the first 100 steps. You could count the\nnumber of positive integers up to 100 that are divisible by 7, then the number\nthat contain the digit 7, then subtract the number that both are divisible by\n7 and contain a 7.\n\nYou can carry this a step further by over-counting, then over-correcting for\nyour over-counting, then correcting for your over-correction. This is the\nessence of the following probability theorem.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle a clever idea, but not that clever. And yet\nRota discusses how this idea was developed over decades into the M\u00f6bius\ninversion principle, which has diverse applications, including Euler\ncharacteristic and the calculus of finite differences.\n\n## Bayes\u2019 theorem\n\nBayesian statistics is a direct application of Bayes\u2019 theorem. Bayes\u2019 theorem\nis a fairly simple idea, and yet people make careers out of applying it.\n\nWhen I started working in the Biostatistics Department at MD Anderson, a\nbastion of Bayesian statistics, I was surprised how subtle Bayesian statistics\nis. I probably first saw Bayes\u2019 theorem as a teenager, and yet it was not easy\nto wrap my head around Bayesian statistics. I would think \u201cThis is simple. Why\nis this hard?\u201d The core principle was simple, but the application was not\ntrivial.\n\n## Newtonian mechanics\n\nWhen I took introductory physics, we would get stuck on homework problems and\nask our professor for help. He would almost always begin by saying \u201cWell, F =\nma.\u201d\n\nThis was infuriating. Yes, we know F = ma. But how does that let us solve this\nproblem?!\n\nThere\u2019s more to Newtonian mechanics than Newton\u2019s laws, a lot more. And most\nof it is never made explicit. You pick it up by osmosis after you\u2019ve worked\nhundreds of exercises.\n\n## Related posts\n\n  *     * There\u2019s more going on here\n    * Applied abstraction\n\nCategories : Uncategorized\n\nBookmark the permalink\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nJohn D.
