Dozens of people have died of\nheatstroke.\n\nThe region is already hard-hit by climate change. Extreme heat is common in\nMay. But not in April and March, both of which were the hottest across much of\nIndia for more than a century.\n\n\"It's smoldering hot! It's also humid, which is making it very difficult,\"\nChrisell Rebello, 37, told NPR in line outside a Mumbai ice cream parlor at 11\np.m. \"We need a lot of cold drinks, air conditioning \u2013 and multiple baths a\nday.\"\n\nOnly a fraction of Indians \u2014 mostly, the wealthy \u2014 have air conditioning.\nInstead people soak rags in water and hang them in doors and windows.\n\nStill, electric fans and AC have pushed India's electricity demand to a record\nhigh.\n\nThe problem is that 70% of India's electricity comes from coal. So the\ngovernment is converting passenger trains to cargo service, to rush coal\nsupplies to beleaguered power plants, and also importing more coal from\nabroad.\n\nAnd rolling blackouts are hurting industrial output.\n\nIn the short term, experts say India has no choice but to burn coal to keep\nfans and ACs on. But in the long term, it must transition to renewables, to\navoid a vicious circle of warming, says Ulka Kelkar, a Bengaluru-based\neconomist and climate change expert with the World Resources Institute.\n\n\"[With] heat plus humidity, at some stage [it] becomes almost impossible for\nthe human body's organs to function normally,\" Kelkar explains. \"Basically the\nbody just cannot cool itself, and a large fraction of our population in India\nstill works outside in the fields, on building construction, in factories\nwhich are not cooled.\"\n\nMore than a billion people are at risk of heat-related illness across South\nAsia. Hospitals are preparing special wards.\n\nThis heat wave has also hit at a critical time for the region's wheat harvest.\nIn the Indian state of Punjab \u2014 the country's breadbasket \u2014 farmers complain\nof reduced crop yields, and lower profits.\n\n\"Due to intense heat, the grain we're harvesting is shriveled,\" a Punjabi\nfarmer named Major Singh told local TV.\n\nThis is exactly when India was hoping to boost wheat exports to help make up\nfor a shortfall in global grain supplies, from the war in Ukraine.\n\nSuruchi Bhadwal, director of earth science and climate change at The Energy\nand Resources Institute (TERI), says the disappointing wheat harvest may be an\nomen of what's to come, if countries don't do everything within their power to\ncut carbon emissions and limit warming to below 2-degrees Celsius, in line\nwith United Nations recommendations.\n\n\"India is already giving us a warning bell,\" Bhadwal says. \"And each country\nneeds to realize that the warning signs will not be given to us forever.\"\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": true}
