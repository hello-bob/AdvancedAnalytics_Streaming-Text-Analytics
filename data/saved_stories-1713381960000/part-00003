The\nNational Conservatism (NatCon) conference, attended by 500 delegates over two\ndays, features speeches from former UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman and\nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, among others. Originally slated for\nConcert Noble, the venue was changed due to pressure from Brussels Mayor\nPhilippe Close.

They were letting people\nexit, but they were not letting them come back in.\n\nThe National Conservatism Conference was full of famous conservative political\nleaders in Europe, including UK Brexit leader Nigel Farage, former UK\ngovernment Home Secretary Suella Braverman, and French presidential candidate\nEric Zemmour, who police blocked from entering.\n\nBRUSSELS, BELGIUM - APRIL 16: Leader of the nationalist political party\nReconqu\u00eate (Reconquest) Eric Zemmour talks to media as he arrives for a\ndiscussion on Day 1 of The National Conservatism Conference at the Claridge on\nApril 16, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium.

Suella\nBraverman, the UK\u2019s former Home Secretary, denounced the \u201cthought police\u201d Said\nFarage, \"This is like the old Soviet Union. No alternative view allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a siege,\u201d said the Chairman of the National Conservatism\nconference, Yoram Hazony. \u201cWe have here representatives of the leading\nnationalist, conservative, and right of center parties. And not just\npoliticians but also academics, journalists. These are prominent people. These\nare not inflammatory people.\u201d\n\nBelgian Police block the entrance of the Claridge hotel in Brussesl where is\nheld the \"NatCon\" national conservatism conference gathering hard-right\npoliticians on April 16, 2024 as Brussels authorities ordered its shutdown,\nafter it was targeted by online protesters and bumped from its first two\nchoices of venue.

It reads, \"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of\npeaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others.\"\n\nHazony described how the police attempted to shut down the event before\nrealizing they were undermanned. \u201cThere are 300-400 people here, including 120\njournalists and 7-8 camera crews,\u201d said Hazony on a Spaces on X that I hosted\nat 5:30 pm Belgium time. \u201cIt was proceeding normally when, around 2 pm, three\npolice walked into the front door.\n\n\u201cAt the moment they walked in, the 7-8 camera crews who had been focusing on\n[former UK politician and Brexit leader] Nigel Farage, turned to film them,\u201d\nsaid Hazony. \u201cThen, they saw they were being filmed and ran outside and called\nfor reinforcements. They knew that the three of them were not able to shut\ndown this event.\u201d\n\nHazony said the police appeared to be using \u201cpublic disturbance\u201d as cause for\nthe crackdown.\n\n\u201cWe received a document from the municipality,\u201d said Hazony. \u201cOne concern was\n\u2018public disturbance.\u2019 But the only disturbance is the police trying to present\nour conference.\u201d\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
