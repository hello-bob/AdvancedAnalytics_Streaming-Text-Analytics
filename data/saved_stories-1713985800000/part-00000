Critics worry it\u2019ll make cops lazy and potentially introduce errors\ninto crucial evidence.\n\nThomas Brewster\n\nForbes Staff\n\nSenior writer at Forbes covering cybercrime, privacy and surveillance.\n\nRichard Nieva\n\nForbes Staff\n\nI'm a senior writer covering technology companies.\n\nClick to save this article.\n\nYou'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account.\n\nApr 23, 2024,09:30am EDT\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nAxon launched an tool that generates police reports using an AI language\nmodel.\n\nCourtesy Axon\n\nAmerican cops are increasingly leaning on artificial intelligence to assist\nwith policing, from AI models that analyze criminal patterns to drones that\ncan fly themselves. Now, a GPT-4 powered AI can do one of their less appealing\njobs: filing paperwork.\n\nOn Tuesday, Axon, the $22 billion police contractor best known for\nmanufacturing the Taser electric weapon, launched a new tool called Draft One\nthat it says can transcribe audio from body cameras and automatically turn it\ninto a police report. Cops can then review the document to ensure accuracy,\nAxon CEO Rick Smith told Forbes. Axon claims one early tester of the tool,\nFort Collins Colorado Police Department, has seen an 82% decrease in time\nspent writing reports. \u201cIf an officer spends half their day reporting, and we\ncan cut that in half, we have an opportunity to potentially free up 25% of an\nofficer's time to be back out policing,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThese reports, though, are often used as evidence in criminal trials, and\ncritics are concerned that relying on AI could put people at risk by depending\non language models that are known to \u201challucinate,\u201d or make things up, as well\nas display racial bias, either blatantly or unconsciously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a nightmare,\u201d said Dave Maass, surveillance technologies\ninvestigations director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cPolice, who\naren't specialists in AI, and aren\u2019t going to be specialists in recognizing\nthe problems with AI, are going to use these systems to generate language that\ncould affect millions of people in their involvement with the criminal justice\nsystem. What could go wrong?\u201d\n\nSmith acknowledged there are dangers. \u201cWhen people talk about bias in AI, it\nreally is: Is this going to exacerbate racism by taking training data that's\ngoing to treat people differently?\u201d he told Forbes. \u201cThat was the main risk.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWhen people talk about bias in AI, it really is: Is this going to\n> exacerbate racism by taking training data that's going to treat people\n> differently?\u201d\n>\n> Rick Smith, CEO, Axon\n\nSmith said Axon is recommending police don\u2019t use the AI to write reports for\nincidents as serious as a police shooting, where vital information could be\nmissed. \u201cAn officer-involved shooting is likely a scenario where it would not\nbe used, and I'd probably advise people against it, just because there's so\nmuch complexity, the stakes are so high.\u201d He said some early customers are\nonly using Draft One for misdemeanours, though others are writing up \u201cmore\nsignificant incidents,\u201d including use-of-force cases. Axon, however, won\u2019t\nhave control over how individual police departments use the tools.\n\nAxon senior principal AI product manager Noah Spitzer-Williams told Forbes\nthat to counter racial or other biases, the company has configured its AI,\nbased on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo model, so it sticks to the facts of what\u2019s being\nrecorded. \u201cThe simplest way to think about it is that we have turned off the\ncreativity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat dramatically reduces the number of hallucinations\nand mistakes... Everything that it's produced is just based on that transcript\nand that transcript alone.\u201d\n\nSpitzer-Williams added that Axon also ran a test where the company took\nexisting body cam transcripts, and in each scenario only changed the suspect\u2019s\nrace \u2014 for example swapping out the word \u201cwhite\u201d for \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cLatino\u201d \u2014 and\nran it through the AI model. In testing, the generated police reports showed\nno \u201cstatistically significant differences across races,\u201d for hundreds of\nsamples, Spitzer-Williams said.\n\nIn demos shown to Forbes, Spitzer-Williams uploaded sample body cam footage.\nIn the video, an officer is talking to a bystander named Marcus at a\nplayground, who is describing a suspect harassing a family. The man describes\nthe suspect as wearing a green jacket, and says he\u2019s about \u201cmy height.\u201d The\nsoftware then generates a short 5-paragraph narrative describing the\nsituation. \u201cMarcus stated that the incident occurred roughly 20 minutes prior\nto our conversation and that the suspect was last seen hiding behind the slide\nat the park,\u201d reads part of the generated text. The AI model also flagged\nareas where the officer needed to add more context to the report, such as\nMarcus\u2019 height for reference.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a nightmare.\u201d\n>\n> Dave Maass, Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nSpitzer-Williams said that the AI tool will come with an audit trail that\nlists out all the actions that any user took, so police agencies can ensure a\nreport has been reviewed and validated. All of the information is stored and\nprocessed on Microsoft Azure cloud servers, he added.\n\nDaniel Linskey, a former Boston Police Department Superintendent-in-Chief and\nnow head of financial and risk consultancy Kroll\u2019s Boston division, said if\npolice are going to use artificial intelligence for drafting reports,\ndepartments will need clearly defined policies, procedures and supervision.\n\u201cMake sure the audit process is real,\u201d he said. If those rules are followed,\nAI could be a real time saver, Linskey added, and get more police on the\nstreet, rather than in an office doing admin.\n\n\u201cHopefully it makes cops more proactive and not lazy. Cops in police stations\naren't keeping people safe,\u201d he added.\n\nTuesday\u2019s product launch comes after a year in which reports have raised\nquestions about Axon\u2019s company culture. Reuters reported some staff felt\npressured to be tasered in front of other employees and get corporate tattoos\nas a way of proving their commitment to the company. \u201cThe things they were\ncriticizing us for are generally things we are proud of,\u201d Smith said of the\nculture criticisms. \u201cOur recruiting numbers went up when they ran those recent\nstories.\u201d\n\nReuters also reported that Smith\u2019s origin story, in which he was inspired to\nfound a police tech company after some high school friends were shot and\nkilled, was largely a myth, claiming that he wasn\u2019t, in fact, close to the\nvictims. He admitted to Forbes he wasn\u2019t close to the victims, but did know\nthem.\n\nThe reports haven\u2019t dampened Axon\u2019s stock, which hit a record high of over\n$316 per share in March. In February, it reported $1.5 billion in revenue for\n2023 and a net income of $174 million.\n\nForbes reported this week that a group of cities, including Baltimore and\nAugusta, believe Axon\u2019s growth has come via market abuses. In a lawsuit filed\nearlier this month, they claim Axon came to dominate the body cam market and\nthen increased the prices unfairly. Axon believes the allegations are\nunfounded and should be dismissed.\n\n### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBESWhy Baltimore And 2 Other Cities Sued America's Largest Body\nCamera MakerBy Cyrus FarivarMORE FROM FORBESTaser-Drone Developer Axon Faces\nNewly Published Criticism From Ethics AdvisorsBy Sarah EmersonMORE FROM\nFORBESFeds Ordered Google To Unmask Certain YouTube Users.
