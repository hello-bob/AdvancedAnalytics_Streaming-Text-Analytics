This code holds an important place in history and is a fascinating\nread of an operating system that was written entirely in 8086 assembly code\nnearly 45 years ago.\n\nToday, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we're\nreleasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There's a\nsomewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as\nMicrosoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a\nbranch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS\n\nA young English researcher named Connor \"Starfrost\" Hyde recently corresponded\nwith former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie about some of the\nsoftware in his collection. Amongst the floppies, Ray found unreleased beta\nbinaries of DOS 4.0 that he was sent while he was at Lotus. Starfrost reached\nout to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) to explore releasing\nDOS 4 source, as he is working on documenting the relationship between DOS 4,\nMT-DOS, and what would eventually become OS/2. Some later versions of these\nMultitasking DOS binaries can be found around the internet, but these new\nOzzie beta binaries appear to be much earlier, unreleased, and also include\nthe ibmbio.com source.\n\nScott Hanselman, with the help of internet archivist and enthusiast Jeff\nSponaugle, has imaged these original disks and carefully scanned the original\nprinted documents from this \"Ozzie Drop\". Microsoft, along with our friends at\nIBM, think this is a fascinating piece of operating system history worth\nsharing.\n\nJeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were\nunable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00,\nwhich we're releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs of\nthe documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the archives\nand may update this release if more is discovered.\n\nThank you to Ray Ozzie, Starfrost, Jeff Sponaugle, Larry Osterman, our friends\nat the IBM OSPO, as well as the makers of such digital archeology software\nincluding, but not limited to Greaseweazle, Fluxengine, Aaru Data Preservation\nSuite, and the HxC Floppy Emulator. Above all, thank you to the original\nauthors of this code, some of whom still work at Microsoft and IBM today!\n\nIf you'd like to run this software yourself and explore, we have successfully\nrun it directly on an original IBM PC XT, a newer Pentium, and within the open\nsource PCem and 86box emulators.\n\n#### About Scott\n\nScott Hanselman is a former professor, former Chief Architect in finance, now\nspeaker, consultant, father, diabetic, and Microsoft employee.
