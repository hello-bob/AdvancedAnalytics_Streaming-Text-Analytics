For the past three years, IEEE Spectrum has read the whole\ndamn thing and pulled out a selection of charts that sum up the current state\nof AI (see our coverage from 2021, 2022, and 2023).\n\nThis year\u2019s report, published by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered\nArtificial Intelligence (HAI), has an expanded chapter on responsible AI and\nnew chapters on AI in science and medicine, as well as its usual roundups of\nR&D, technical performance, the economy, education, policy and governance,\ndiversity, and public opinion. This year is also the first time that Spectrum\nhas figured into the report, with a citation of an article published here\nabout generative AI\u2019s visual plagiarism problem.\n\n### 1\\. Generative AI investment skyrockets\n\nWhile corporate investment was down overall last year, investment in\ngenerative AI went through the roof. Nestor Maslej, editor-in-chief of this\nyear\u2019s report, tells Spectrum that the boom is indicative of a broader trend\nin 2023, as the world grappled with the new capabilities and risks of\ngenerative AI systems like ChatGPT and the image-generating DALL-E 2. \u201cThe\nstory in the last year has been about people responding [to generative AI],\u201d\nsays Maslej, \u201cwhether it\u2019s in policy, whether it\u2019s in public opinion, or\nwhether it\u2019s in industry with a lot more investment.\u201d Another chart in the\nreport shows that most of that private investment in generative AI is\nhappening in the United States.\n\n### 2\\. Google is dominating the foundation model race\n\nFoundation models are big multipurpose models\u2014for example, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and\nGPT-4 are the foundation model that enable ChatGPT users to write code or\nShakespearean sonnets. Since training these models typically requires vast\nresources, Industry now makes most of them, with academia only putting out a\nfew. Companies release foundation models both to push the state-of-the-art\nforward and to give developers a foundation on which to build products and\nservices. Google released the most in 2023.\n\n### 3\\. Closed models outperform open ones\n\nOne of the hot debates in AI right now is whether foundation models should be\nopen or closed, with some arguing passionately that open models are dangerous\nand others maintaining that open models drive innovation. The AI Index doesn\u2019t\nwade into that debate, but instead looks at trends such as how many open and\nclosed models have been released (another chart, not included here, shows that\nof the 149 foundation models released in 2023, 98 were open, 23 gave partial\naccess through an API, and 28 were closed).\n\nThe chart above reveals another aspect: Closed models outperform open ones on\na host of commonly used benchmarks. Maslej says the debate about open versus\nclosed \u201cusually centers around risk concerns, but there\u2019s less discussion\nabout whether there are meaningful performance trade-offs.\u201d\n\n### 4\\. Foundation models have gotten super expensive\n\nHere\u2019s why industry is dominating the foundation model scene: Training a big\none takes very deep pockets. But exactly how deep? AI companies rarely reveal\nthe expenses involved in training their models, but the AI Index went beyond\nthe typical speculation by collaborating with the AI research organization\nEpoch AI. To come up with their cost estimates, the report explains, the Epoch\nteam \u201canalyzed training duration, as well as the type, quantity, and\nutilization rate of the training hardware\u201d using information gleaned from\npublications, press releases, and technical reports.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Google\u2019s 2017 transformer model, which\nintroduced the architecture that underpins almost all of today\u2019s large\nlanguage models, was trained for only US $930.\n\n### 5\\. And they have a hefty carbon footprint\n\nThe AI Index team also estimated the carbon footprint of certain large\nlanguage models. The report notes that the variance between models is due to\nfactors including model size, data center energy efficiency, and the carbon\nintensity of energy grids. Another chart in the report (not included here)\nshows a first guess at emissions related to inference\u2014when a model is doing\nthe work it was trained for\u2014and calls for more disclosures on this topic. As\nthe report notes: \u201cWhile the per-query emissions of inference may be\nrelatively low, the total impact can surpass that of training when models are\nqueried thousands, if not millions, of times daily.\u201d\n\n### 6\\. The United States leads in foundation models\n\nWhile Maslej says the report isn\u2019t trying to \u201cdeclare a winner to this race,\u201d\nhe does note that the United States is leading in several categories,\nincluding number of foundation models released (above) and number of AI\nsystems deemed significant technical advances. However, he notes that China\nleads in other categories including AI patents granted and installation of\nindustrial robots.\n\n### 7\\. Industry calls new PhDs\n\nThis one is hardly a surprise, given the previously discussed data about\nindustry getting lots of investment for generative AI and releasing lots of\nexciting models. In 2022 (the most recent year for which the Index has data),\n70 precent of new AI PhDs in North America took jobs in industry. It\u2019s a\ncontinuation of a trend that\u2019s been playing out over the last few years.\n\n### 8\\. Some progress on diversity\n\nFor years, there\u2019s been little progress on making AI less white and less male.\nBut this year\u2019s report offers a few hopeful signs. For example, the number of\nnon-white and female students taking the AP computer science exam is on the\nrise. The graph above shows the trends for ethnicity, while another graph, not\nincluded here, shows that 30 percent of the students taking the exam are now\ngirls.\n\nAnother graph in the report shows that at the undergraduate level, there\u2019s\nalso a positive trend in increasing ethnic diversity among North American\nstudents earning bachelor degrees in computer science, although the number of\nwomen earning CS bachelor degrees has barely budged over the last five years.\nSays Maslej, \u201cit\u2019s important to know that there\u2019s still a lot of work to be\ndone here.\u201d\n\n### 9\\. Chatter in earnings calls\n\nBusinesses are awake to the possibilities of AI. The Index got data about\nFortune 500 companies\u2019 earnings calls from Quid, a market intelligence firm\nthat used natural language processing tools to scan for all mentions of\n\u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d and \u201cdeep\nlearning.\u201d Nearly 80 percent of the companies included discussion of AI in\ntheir calls. \u201cI think there\u2019s a fear in business leaders that if they don\u2019t\nuse this technology, they\u2019re going to miss out,\u201d Maslej says.\n\nAnd while some of that chatter is likely just CEOs bandying about buzzwords,\nanother graph in the report shows that 55 percent of companies included in a\nMcKinsey survey have implemented AI in at least one business unit.\n\n### 10\\. Costs go down, revenues go up\n\nAnd here\u2019s why AI isn\u2019t just a corporate buzzword: The same McKinsey survey\nshowed that the integration of AI has caused companies\u2019 costs to go down and\ntheir revenues go up. Overall, 42 percent of respondents said they\u2019d seen\nreduced costs, and 59 percent claimed increased revenue.\n\nOther charts in the report suggest that this impact on the bottom line\nreflects efficiency gains and better worker productivity. In 2023, a number of\nstudies in different fields showed that AI enabled workers to complete tasks\nmore quickly and produce better quality work. One study looked at coders using\nCopilot, while others looked at consultants, call center agents, and law\nstudents. \u201cThese studies also show that although every worker benefits, AI\nhelps lower-skilled workers more than it does high-skilled workers,\u201d says\nMaslej.\n\n### 11\\. Corporations do perceive risks\n\nThis year, the AI Index team ran a global survey of 1,000 corporations with\nrevenues of at least $500 million to understand how businesses are thinking\nabout responsible AI. The results showed that privacy and data governance is\nperceived as the greatest risk across the globe, while fairness (often\ndiscussed in terms of algorithmic bias) still hasn\u2019t registered with most\ncompanies. Another chart in the report shows that companies are taking action\non their perceived risks: The majority of organizations across regions have\nimplemented at least one responsible AI measure in response to relevant risks.\n\n### 12\\. AI can\u2019t beat humans at everything... yet\n\nIn recent years, AI systems have outperformed humans on a range of tasks,\nincluding reading comprehension and visual reasoning, and Maslej notes that\nthe pace of AI performance improvement has also picked up. \u201cA decade ago, with\na benchmark like ImageNet, you could rely on that to challenge AI researchers\nfor for five or six years,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, a new benchmark is introduced for\ncompetition-level mathematics and the AI starts at 30 percent, and then in a\nyear it gets to 90 percent.\u201d While there are still complex cognitive tasks\nwhere humans outperform AI systems, let\u2019s check in next year to see how that\u2019s\ngoing.\n\n### 13\\. Developing norms of AI responsibility\n\nWhen an AI company is preparing to release a big model, it\u2019s standard practice\nto test it against popular benchmarks in the field, thus giving the AI\ncommunity a sense of how models stack up against each other in terms of\ntechnical performance. However, it has been less common to test models against\nresponsible AI benchmarks that assess such things as toxic language output\n(RealToxicityPrompts and ToxiGen), harmful bias in responses (BOLD and BBQ),\nand a model\u2019s degree of truthfulness (TruthfulQA). That\u2019s starting to change,\nas there\u2019s a growing sense that checking one\u2019s model against theses benchmarks\nis, well, the responsible thing to do. However, another chart in the report\nshows that consistency is lacking: Developers are testing their models against\ndifferent benchmarks, making comparisons harder.\n\n### 14\\. Laws both boost and constrain AI\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023, the AI Index found that 33 countries had passed at\nleast one law related to AI, with most of the action occurring in the United\nStates and Europe; in total, 148 AI-related bills have been passed in that\ntimeframe. The Index researchers also classified bills as either expansive\nlaws that aim to enhance a country\u2019s AI capabilities or restrictive laws that\nplace limits on AI applications and usage. While many bills continue to boost\nAI, the researchers found a global trend toward restrictive legislation.\n\n### 15\\. AI makes people nervous\n\nThe Index\u2019s public opinion data comes from a global survey on attitudes toward\nAI, with responses from 22,816 adults (ages 16 to 74) in 31 countries. More\nthan half of respondents said that AI makes them nervous, up from 39 percent\nthe year before. And two-thirds of people now expect AI to profoundly change\ntheir daily lives in the next few years.\n\nMaslej notes that other charts in the index show significant differences in\nopinion among different demographics, with young people being more inclined\ntoward an optimistic view of how AI will change their lives. Interestingly, \u201ca\nlot of this kind of AI pessimism comes from Western, well-developed nations,\u201d\nhe says, while respondents in places like Indonesia and Thailand said they\nexpect AI\u2019s benefits to outweigh its harms.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * 10 Graphs That Sum Up the State of AI in 2023 \u203a\n  * 12 Graphs That Explain the State of AI in 2022 \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * AI Index Report 2024 \u2013 Artificial Intelligence Index \u203a\n  * AI Index Report | Stanford HAI \u203a\n\nmachine learningdeep learningfoundation modelsstanford haiartificial\nintelligenceTechnology & ComputingBusiness and FinanceEducationNews and\nPoliticsHealth and Medical ServicesCareersFamily and RelationshipsArtificial\nIntelligenceComputingBusinessEconomyIndustriesHealth & PharmaInternational\nNewsTechnology IndustryInternetIT and Internet SupportWeb DevelopmentCloud\nComputing\n\nEliza Strickland\n\nis a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum, where she covers AI, biomedical\nengineering, and other topics.

The company\nwent on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cunicorns,\u201d valued at over US $1\nbillion. This article is adapted from an excerpt of the author\u2019s new book,\nBehind the Startup: How Venture Capital Shapes Work, Innovation, and\nInequality (University of California Press, 2024). The names of staff members\nand the company have been changed to preserve privacy.\n\nWhen I began my research, AllDone had just secured its first round of venture\ncapital funding to fuel its quest to build an \u201cAmazon for local services.\u201d The\ncompany had built a digital platform connecting buyers and sellers of local\nservices\u2014housecleaners, plumbers, math tutors, and everything in\nbetween\u2014across the United States. Although the influx of $4.5 million was\ncause for celebration, it also incited a sense of urgency among employees in\nthe San Francisco office. As Carter, AllDone\u2019s president, intoned in an all-\nstaff email:\n\n> We know what the future of local services is. But we\u2019re not the only people\n> that know this is the future. And, more importantly, there\u2019s lots of\n> people\u2014smart, scrappy, and well-funded people\u2014building our vision. Someone\n> is going to do it. And it looks like it\u2019s going to happen soon. We just have\n> to finish building faster than anyone else and we will win.\n\nDemonstrating AllDone\u2019s potential for explosive growth was the founders\u2019\nhighest priority\u2014and that priority shaped the company\u2019s strategy and\nstructure. AllDone faced extraordinary pressure from venture capital investors\nto grow as quickly as possible, which required finding new ways to attract\nusers and increase their activity on the platform. At the same time, AllDone\u2019s\nleaders knew the firm would be worthless if it couldn\u2019t keep its product\nfunctioning properly and provide services to its ever-expanding user base.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nRobotics News Humanoid Robots\n\n## Video Friday: Robot Dog Can\u2019t Fall\n\n###\n\nYour weekly selection of awesome robot videos\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nEvan Ackerman is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

But there\u2019s no reason why aerial robots can\u2019t approach hopping\nfrom the other direction, by adding a hopping ground phase to flight.\nHopcopter is the first robot that I\u2019ve ever seen give this a try, and it\u2019s\nremarkably effective, combining a tiny quadrotor with a springy leg to hop hop\nhop all over the place.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\nArtificial Intelligence Computing Sponsored Article\n\n## Deploying Data Science and AI to Fight Wildlife Trafficking\n\n###\n\nNYU Tandon\u2019s Juliana Freire is leading a team aimed at using data science to\nbring down criminals trafficking humans and exotic animals\n\nMichael W.

Animals and their parts are traded much like\nfirearms or narcotics \u2014 through complex networks of suppliers, dealers, and\nbuyers, who leave a bloody path in their wake.

Several recently\npublished deep-dive analyses commissioned by NASA and the European Space\nAgency have thrown cold water on the hope that space solar power could\naffordably generate many gigawatts of clean energy in the near future. And yet\nthe dream lives on.\n\nThe dream achieved a kind of lift-off in January 2023. That\u2019s when SSPD-1, a\nsolar space-power demonstrator satellite carrying a bevy of new technologies\ndesigned at the California Institute of Technology, blasted into low Earth\norbit for a year-long mission. Mindful of concerns about the technical\nfeasibility of robotic in-space assembly of satellites, each an order of\nmagnitude larger than the International Space Station, the Caltech team has\nbeen looking at very different approaches to space solar power.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\n", "frontpage": false}
