This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3\nreleases. It follows after 7.3.15 release on Jan 15, 2024\n\nWe recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.16 releases\nhere:\n\n> https://pypy.org/download.html\n\nWe would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy\nproject. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for\ndirect consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear\nabout it and encourage submissions to our blog via a pull request to\nhttps://github.com/pypy/pypy.org\n\nWe would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join\nthe project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug\nfixes, PyPy and RPython documentation improvements, or general help with\nmaking RPython's JIT even better.\n\nIf you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider\nmaking a HPy / CFFI / cppyy version of your library that would be performant\non PyPy. In any case, both cibuildwheel and the multibuild system support\nbuilding wheels for PyPy.\n\n### What is PyPy?\u00b6\n\nPyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython It's fast\n(PyPy and CPython 3.7.4 performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing\nJIT compiler.\n\nWe also welcome developers of other dynamic languages to see what RPython can\ndo for them.\n\nWe provide binary builds for:\n\n>   * x86 machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS\n> 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)\n>\n>   * 64-bit ARM machines running Linux (aarch64).\n>\n>   * Apple M1 arm64 machines (macos_arm64).\n>\n>   * s390x running Linux\n>\n>\n\nPyPy support Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, and Linux ARM\n32 bit, but does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to\nsponsor binary releases for those platforms. Downstream packagers provide\nbinary builds for debian, Fedora, conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.\n\n### What else is new?\u00b6\n\nFor more information about the 7.3.16 release, see the full changelog.\n\nPlease update, and continue to help us make pypy better.\n\nCheers, The PyPy Team\n\n## Comments\n\n## The PyPy blogposts\n\nCreate a guest post via a PR to the source repo\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * PyPy v7.3.16 release\n  * Fixing a Bug in PyPy's Incremental GC\n  * PyPy v7.3.15 release\n  * PyPy has moved to Git, GitHub\n  * PyPy v7.3.14 release\n  * PyPy v7.3.13 release\n  * PyPy v7.3.12 release\n  * RPython-based emulator speeds up RISC-V simulation over 15x\n  * Repeated string concatenation is quadratic in PyPy (and CPython)\n  * PyPy v7.3.11 release\n\n## Archives\n\n  * 2007 (19)\n  * 2008 (62)\n  * 2009 (38)\n  * 2010 (44)\n  * 2011 (43)\n  * 2012 (44)\n  * 2013 (46)\n  * 2014 (22)\n  * 2015 (20)\n  * 2016 (20)\n  * 2017 (13)\n  * 2018 (12)\n  * 2019 (12)\n  * 2020 (9)\n  * 2021 (10)\n  * 2022 (13)\n  * 2023 (6)\n  * 2024 (3)\n\n## Tags\n\n  * arm (2)\n  * casestudy (2)\n  * cli (1)\n  * compiler (1)\n  * cpyext (4)\n  * CPython (3)\n  * ep2008 (1)\n  * extension modules (3)\n  * gc (1)\n  * GraalPython (1)\n  * hpy (1)\n  * Heptapod (1)\n  * jit (20)\n  * jython (1)\n  * kcachegrind (1)\n  * meta (1)\n  * numpy (24)\n  * parser (1)\n  * performance (2)\n  * profiling (4)\n  * pypy (6)\n  * pypy3 (16)\n  * PyQt4 (1)\n  * release (61)\n  * releasecffi (3)\n  * releaserevdb (1)\n  * releasestm (1)\n  * revdb (1)\n  * roadmap (2)\n  * RPyC (1)\n  * speed (6)\n  * sponsors (7)\n  * sprint (3)\n  * sprints (1)\n  * stm (14)\n  * sun (1)\n  * Smalltalk (1)\n  * Squeak (1)\n  * testing (1)\n  * unicode (1)\n  * valgrind (1)\n\n\u00a9 2024 The PyPy Team Built with Nikola Last built 2024-04-23T22:44\n\nRSS feed\n\n", "frontpage": true}
