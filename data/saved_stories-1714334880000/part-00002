Ostensible breakthroughs in large language models\nand machine learning methods, as well as staggering improvements in compute\ncapabilities, have made the power and potential of AI demonstrably clear.\n\nWhile companies and institutions are racing to monetize the power of AI, the\nprospect of its full potential is also giving pause to governments around the\nworld. Much uncertainty centers on how to balance AI\u2019s power to solve a range\nof economic and social problems with curtailing the downsides of its\npotential.\n\nBut what\u2019s certain is that a large chunk of the tech world\u2019s capital and\ntalent will be deployed toward bringing AI applications to the real world. If\nanything, the competition among countries in this arena will be fiercer than\never\u2014and much of that competition will be over the indispensable input of an\nAI ecosystem: talent.\n\nTalent also happens to be one of the most clearly quantifiable inputs, which\nis why we are assessing the global balance and flow of top AI researchers and\nscientists. Now, after three years of a pandemic and amid geopolitical\nructions, how has that balance of talent changed?\n\nTo compare apples to apples, this 2023 update, like the previous version, uses\nthe Neural Information Processing Systems conference (NeurIPS) as our sample.\nFor its December 2022 conference, NeurIPS accepted a record-breaking 2,671\npapers with an acceptance rate of 25.6%, compared with 1,428 papers and an\nacceptance rate of 21.6% in 2019.\n\nWhile the conference has expanded in numbers, it is still considered one of\nthe most selective AI conferences on record, meaning that it is a good proxy\nfor the top-tier (top ~20%) of AI research talent. Rather than examining a\nbroader slice of AI talent, we choose to focus on the top-tier because we\nbelieve this cohort is the most likely to lead the way on research\nbreakthroughs as well as on determining novel use cases in the commercial\ndomain.\n\nExplore below key takeaways and view insights on what has changed since 2019\n(see detailed methodology).\n\n## What are the career paths of top-tier AI researchers?\n\nSee top AI talent\u2019s movements from their studies to where they work today.\nClick on the country blocks to see the flows into and out of each block and\nhover over each country block to see the path\u2019s share of the total.\n\nparticles: on\n\npaths: on\n\nUndergraduate Graduate School Post-Grad Work\n\nData sample of paper authors accepted at NeurIPS 2022. Country affiliations\nare based on the geographic location of the researchers, not their\ninstitution\u2019s headquarters. For \u201cGraduate School\u201d column, all current and\nformer graduate students are included. For \u201cPost-Grad Work\u201d column, only\nresearchers who have completed their graduate studies are included. Creating\nthis chart required excluding a small number of researchers for whom complete\ndata was not available. Where there are differences in the percentages listed\nhere from other statistics in the study, that exclusion is the reason.\n\n## Key Takeaways of 2023 Update\n\n1\\. The United States remains the top destination for top-tier AI talent to\nwork. Within US institutions, researchers of American and Chinese origin\n(based on undergraduate degrees) comprise 75% of the top-tier AI talent, up\nfrom 58% in 2019. Moreover, the United States remains far and away the leading\ndestination for the world\u2019s most elite AI talent (top ~2%) and remains home to\n60% of top AI institutions.\n\n2\\. Beyond the United States and China, the United Kingdom and South Korea,\nalong with continental Europe, have slightly raised their game as destinations\nfor top AI researchers to work. When it comes to AI researcher origin (based\non undergraduate degrees), India and Canada have seen relative declines.\n\n3\\. Meanwhile, China has expanded its domestic AI talent pool over the last\nfew years to meet the demands of its own growing AI industry. Because China\nproduces a sizable portion of the world\u2019s top AI researchers\u2014rising from 29%\nin 2019 to 47% in 2022\u2014it is no surprise that more Chinese talent are working\nin domestic industry.\n\n4\\. A similar dynamic appears to be taking place in India. While India remains\na significant exporter of top-tier AI researchers, its ability to retain\ntalent is growing. In 2019, nearly all Indian AI researchers (based on\nundergraduate degrees) opted to pursue opportunities abroad. But in 2022, one-\nfifth of Indian AI researchers ended up staying to work in India.\n\n5\\. These developments in China and India seem to reflect a broader pattern\nover the last few years: top-tier AI researchers appear to exhibit less\nmobility overall. Just 42% of top-tier AI researchers in 2022 are foreign\nnationals currently working in a different country, down 13 percentage points\nfrom 2019\u2014meaning more top-tier talent are staying put in their home\ncountries.\n\n## Key Insights in Eight Charts\n\n1\\. Leading countries where the most elite AI researchers work (top ~2%)\n\nThe \u201cmost elite AI researchers\u201d are defined as authors of papers selected for\nOral Presentations at NeurIPS, which represent the most prestigious class of\npapers. The Oral Presentations acceptance rate was 1.8% in 2022.\n\n2\\. Leading countries of origin of the most elite AI researchers (top ~2%,\nbased on undergraduate degrees)\n\n3\\. Top 25 Institutions for Top-Tier AI Research\n\nRankings based on fractional count of authors. For a fuller explanation, see\nthe detailed methodology.\n\n4\\. Leading countries of origin of top-tier AI researchers (top ~20%) working\nin US institutions\n\n5\\. Countries of origin of top-tier AI researchers (top ~20%, based on\nundergraduate degrees)\n\n6\\. Leading countries where top-tier AI researchers (top ~20%) work\n\nCountry affiliation based on the headquarters of institutions in which the\nresearchers currently work.\n\n7\\.
