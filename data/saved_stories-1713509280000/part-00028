In\nhis orders, de Moraes had prohibited X from making them public.\n\n\u201cTo comply with its obligations under U.S. law, X Corp. has responded to the\nCommittee,\u201d the company said in a statement on X on April 15.\n\nThe disclosure comes amid a battle Musk has waged against de Moraes.\n\nMusk, a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist, had vowed to publish de\nMoraes\u2019 orders, which he equated to censorship. His crusade has been cheered\non by supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, who allege they\nare being targeted by political persecution, and have found common cause with\ntheir ideological allies in the U.S.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBrazil\u2019s president creates two new Indigenous territories, bringing total in\nhis term to 10\n\nArgentina asks to join NATO as President Milei seeks a more prominent role for\nhis nation\n\nPanama\u2019s presidential frontrunner skips third and final debate ahead of May 5\nelection\n\nDe Moraes has overseen a five-year probe of so-called \u201cdigital militias,\u201d who\nallegedly spread defamatory fake news and threats to Supreme Court justices.\nThe investigation expanded to include those inciting demonstrations across the\ncountry, seeking to overturn Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 election loss. Those protests\nculminated in the Jan. 8 uprising in Brazil\u2019s capital, with Bolsonaro\nsupporters storming government buildings, including the Supreme Court, in an\nattempt to oust President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from office.\n\nDe Moraes\u2019 critics claim he has abused his powers and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to\nunilaterally ban social media accounts, including those of democratically\nelected legislators. But most legal experts see his brash tactics as legally\nsound and furthermore justified by extraordinary circumstances of democracy\nimperiled. They note his decisions have been either upheld by his fellow\njustices or gone unchallenged.\n\nThe secret orders disclosed by the congressional committee had been issued\nboth by Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court and its top electoral court, over which de\nMoraes currently presides.\n\nThe press office of the Supreme Court declined to comment on the potential\nramifications of their release when contacted by The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cMusk is indeed a very innovative businessman; he innovated with electric\ncars, he innovated with rockets and now he invented a new form of non-\ncompliance of a court order, through an intermediary,\u201d said Carlos Affonso,\ndirector of the nonprofit Institute of Technology and Society. \u201cHe said he\nwould reveal the documents and he found someone to do this for him.\u201d\n\nAffonso, also a professor of civil rights at the State University of Rio de\nJaneiro, said that the orders are legal but do merit debate, given users were\nnot informed why their accounts were suspended and whether the action was\ntaken by the platform or at the behest of a court. The orders to X included in\nthe report rarely provide justification, either.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s press office said in a statement Thursday afternoon that\nthe orders do not contain justifications, but said the company and people with\nsuspended accounts can gain access by requesting the decisions from the court.\n\nWhile Musk has repeatedly decried de Moraes\u2019 orders as suppressing \u201cfree\nspeech\u201d principles and amounting to \u201caggressive censorship,\u201d the company under\nhis ownership has bowed to government requests from around the world.\n\nLast year, for instance, X blocked posts critical of Turkish President Recep\nTayyip Erdogan and, in February, it blocked accounts and posts in India at the\nbehest of the country\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThe Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on\nspecific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including\nsignificant fines and imprisonment,\u201d X\u2019s global affairs account posted on Feb.\n21. \u201cIn compliance with the orders, we will withhold these accounts and posts\nin India alone; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that\nfreedom of expression should extend to these posts.\u201d\n\nBrazil is a key market for X and other social media platforms. About 40\nmillion Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per\nmonth, according to market research group eMarketer.\n\nX has followed suspension orders under threat of hefty fines. De Moraes\ntypically required compliance within two hours, and established a daily fine\nof 100,000-reais ($20,000) for noncompliance.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the 150 suspended accounts represent the entirety of\nthose de Moraes ordered suspended. Until the committee report, it wasn\u2019t known\nwhether the total was a handful, a few dozen or more. Some of the suspended\naccounts in the report have since been reactivated.\n\nOn April 6, Musk took to X to challenge de Moraes, questioning why he was\n\u201cdemanding so much censorship in Brazil\u201d. The following day, the tech mogul\nsaid he would cease to comply with court orders to block accounts \u2014 and that\nde Moraes should either resign or be impeached. Predicting that X could be\nshut down in Brazil, he instructed Brazilians to use a VPN to retain their\naccess.\n\nDe Moraes swiftly included Musk in the ongoing investigation of digital\nmilitias, and launched a separate investigation into whether Musk engaged in\nobstruction, criminal organization and incitement. On April 13, X\u2019s legal\nrepresentative in Brazil wrote to de Moraes that it will comply with all court\norders, according to the letter, seen by the AP.\n\nAffonso said the committee\u2019s release of de Moraes\u2019 orders were aimed less at\nBrazil than at the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. The report\ncites Brazil \u201cas a stark warning to Americans about the threats posed by\ngovernment censorship here at home.\u201d\n\nTerms like \u201ccensorship\u201d and \u201cfree speech\u201d have turned into political rallying\ncries for U.S. conservatives since at least the 2016 presidential election,\nfrustrated at seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican\nofficials booted off Facebook and Twitter in its pre-Musk version for\nviolating rules.\n\n\u201cThe reason why the far-right needs him (Musk) is because they need a\nplatform, they need a place to promote themselves. And Elon Musk needs far-\nright politicians because they will keep his platform protected from\nregulations,\u201d said David Nemer, a Brazil native and University of Virginia\nprofessor who studies social media.\n\nIn the U.S., free speech is a constitutional right that\u2019s much more permissive\nthan in other countries, including Brazil. Still, the report\u2019s release seemed\nto invigorate Bolsonaro and his far-right supporters.\n\nLate Wednesday, soon after the court orders were released, Bolsonaro capped\noff a speech at a public event by calling for a round of applause for Musk.\n\nHis audience eagerly complied.\n\n## ___\n\nAP writer Barbara Ortutay contributed from San Francisco\n\n## ___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
