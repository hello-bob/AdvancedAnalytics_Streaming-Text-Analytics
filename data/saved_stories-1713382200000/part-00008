One major challenge lies in translating quantum algorithms from abstract\nmathematical concepts into concrete code that can run on a quantum computer.\nWhereas programmers for regular computers have access to myriad languages such\nas Python and C++ with constructs that align with standard classical computing\nabstractions, quantum programmers have no such luxury; few quantum programming\nlanguages exist today, and they are comparatively difficult to use because\nquantum computing abstractions are still in flux. In their recent work, MIT\nresearchers highlight that this disparity exists because quantum computers\ndon\u2019t follow the same rules for how to complete each step of a program in\norder \u2014 an essential process for all computers called control flow \u2014 and\npresent a new abstract model for a quantum computer that could be easier to\nprogram.\n\nIn a paper soon to be presented at the ACM Conference on Object-oriented\nProgramming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, the group outlines a new\nconceptual model for a quantum computer, called a quantum control machine,\nthat could bring us closer to making programs as easy to write as those for\nregular classical computers. Such an achievement would help turbocharge tasks\nthat are impossible for regular computers to efficiently complete, like\nfactoring large numbers, retrieving information in databases, and simulating\nhow molecules interact for drug discoveries.\n\n\u201cOur work presents the principles that govern how you can and cannot correctly\nprogram a quantum computer,\u201d says lead author and CSAIL PhD student Charles\nYuan SM \u201922. \u201cOne of these laws implies that if you try to program a quantum\ncomputer using the same basic instructions as a regular classical computer,\nyou\u2019ll end up turning that quantum computer into a classical computer and lose\nits performance advantage. These laws explain why quantum programming\nlanguages are tricky to design and point us to a way to make them better.\u201d\n\nOld school vs. new school computing\n\nOne reason why classical computers are relatively easier to program today is\nthat their control flow is fairly straightforward. The basic ingredients of a\nclassical computer are simple: binary digits or bits, a simple collection of\nzeros and ones. These ingredients assemble into the instructions and\ncomponents of the computer\u2019s architecture. One important component is the\nprogram counter, which locates the next instruction in a program much like a\nchef following a recipe, by recalling the next direction from memory. As the\nalgorithm sequentially navigates through the program, a control flow\ninstruction called a conditional jump updates the program counter to make the\ncomputer either advance forward to the next instruction or deviate from its\ncurrent steps.\n\nBy contrast, the basic ingredient of a quantum computer is a qubit, which is a\nquantum version of a bit. This quantum data exists in a state of zero and one\nat the same time, known as a superposition. Building on this idea, a quantum\nalgorithm can choose to execute a superposition of two instructions at the\nsame time \u2014 a concept called quantum control flow.\n\nThe problem is that existing designs of quantum computers don\u2019t include an\nequivalent of the program counter or a conditional jump. In practice, that\nmeans programmers typically implement control flow by manually arranging\nlogical gates that describe the computer\u2019s hardware, which is a tedious and\nerror-prone procedure. To provide these features and close the gap with\nclassical computers, Yuan and his coauthors created the quantum control\nmachine \u2014 an instruction set for a quantum computer that works like the\nclassical idea of a virtual machine. In their paper, the researchers envision\nhow programmers could use this instruction set to implement quantum algorithms\nfor problems such as factoring numbers and simulating chemical interactions.\n\nAs the technical crux of this work, the researchers prove that a quantum\ncomputer cannot support the same conditional jump instruction as a classical\ncomputer, and show how to modify it to work correctly on a quantum computer.\nSpecifically, the quantum control machine features instructions that are all\nreversible \u2014 they can run both forward and backward in time. A quantum\nalgorithm needs all instructions, including those for control flow, to be\nreversible so that it can process quantum information without accidentally\ndestroying its superposition and producing a wrong answer.\n\nThe hidden simplicity of quantum computers\n\nAccording to Yuan, you don\u2019t need to be a physicist or mathematician to\nunderstand how this futuristic technology works. Quantum computers don\u2019t\nnecessarily have to be arcane machines, he says, that require scary equations\nto understand. With the quantum control machine, the CSAIL team aims to lower\nthe barrier to entry for people to interact with a quantum computer by raising\nthe unfamiliar concept of quantum control flow to a level that mirrors the\nfamiliar concept of control flow in classical computers. By highlighting the\ndos and don\u2019ts of building and programming quantum computers, they hope to\neducate people outside of the field about the power of quantum technology and\nits ultimate limits.\n\nStill, the researchers caution that as is the case for many other designs,\nit\u2019s not yet possible to directly turn their work into a practical hardware\nquantum computer due to the limitations of today\u2019s qubit technology. Their\ngoal is to develop ways of implementing more kinds of quantum algorithms as\nprograms that make efficient use of a limited number of qubits and logic\ngates. Doing so would bring us closer to running these algorithms on the\nquantum computers that could come online in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental capabilities of models of quantum computation has been a\ncentral discussion in quantum computation theory since its inception,\u201d says\nMIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researcher Patrick Rall, who was not involved in the\npaper. \u201cAmong the earliest of these models are quantum Turing machines which\nare capable of quantum control flow. However, the field has largely moved on\nto the simpler and more convenient circuit model, for which quantum lacks\ncontrol flow. Yuan, Villanyi, and Carbin successfully capture the underlying\nreason for this transition using the perspective of programming languages.\nWhile control flow is central to our understanding of classical computation,\nquantum is completely different! I expect this observation to be critical for\nthe design of modern quantum software frameworks as hardware platforms become\nmore mature.\u201d\n\nThe paper lists two additional CSAIL members as authors: PhD student \u00c1gi\nVill\u00e1nyi \u201921 and Associate Professor Michael Carbin.
