Ten literary translators from across the\nworld weigh in\n\n## Editor and translator Katy Derbyshire poses the question to ten\npractitioners and stresses why we need to be talking about it.\n\nKaty Derbyshire\n\nApr 30, 2018 \u00b7 08:30 am\n\nSt Jerome, patron saint of translators\n\nTo the outside world, literary translators are famously invisible. Being a\ntight-knit community of solitary home workers, though, we talk a lot amongst\nourselves. Recently, one big thing we\u2019ve been talking about is reviews of our\nwork. As critics come to notice our existence, we garner both praise and \u2013 in\nwhat feels like greater depth \u2013 criticism. So I thought it might be useful to\nask other literary translators what they aim for, what positive criteria we\nhave for judging the outcome of our work. I was not disappointed.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say what a bad translation is. The ones that are accidentally\njagged like the person wielding the scissors was drunk. The ones where someone\nhas misunderstood the original, or perhaps misinterpreted it. The ones where\nall individuality has been smoothed out. But how do we identify a successful\ntranslation? When have we done our job well? What is it we want to achieve,\nbeyond mere fluidity?\n\nWhat is a good translation?\n\n### David Colmer (translates from Dutch to English)\n\nFluidity is not to be sneezed at, and is often difficult to accomplish, but a\ngood translation goes further and achieves the self-evidence and urgency of\nthe original. It sings, whispers and swears like the original and leaves the\nreader thrilled, disturbed and amused in the same ways too. A sensitive\nmonolingual reviewer describes the style of a good translation in terms that\nunknowingly echo the reviews of the original novel or poetry. A good\ntranslation does not have to be impeccably starched and ironed, but dares to\nbe ragged and frantic when appropriate. When presented with a few lines of\noriginal and translation, a bilingual reader might not be sure which is which.\nThe voice of a good translation is as distinctive in English as the author\u2019s\nvoice in the original language, also when compared to other authors translated\nby the same translator. A good translation accepts the gifts English offers\nand is not an endless procession of compromise and loss. A good translation is\nsomething to aspire to and, in this perfectionist\u2019s profession, a good\ntranslation is never good enough.\n\n### Alex Zucker (translates from Czech to English)\n\nTo write a good translation, at a certain point I have to forget the text I\u2019m\ntranslating exists. Only then can I read my translation without \u201cseeing\nthrough it\u201d the foreign-language text \u201cunderneath\u201d \u2013 that is, the way\nvirtually everyone else who reads my translation is going to read (and assess)\nit. Beyond that, I don\u2019t agree that fluidity is necessarily always a goal. A\ngood translation respects and, therefore, reflects the author\u2019s style and\nvocabulary: Where the author\u2019s writing is choppy, mine should also be. Where\nit\u2019s harsh or stilted or opaque, or lyrical and flowing, or unambiguous, my\nwriting should be too. When the author conforms to convention, so should I;\nwhen they bend or break it, I need to do the same. This assumes the author\nintended these effects. On the other hand, it can happen that an author\u2019s\nwriting comes across as awkward when in fact it was a result of poor (or non-\nexistent) editing, rather than a deliberate style. This is where it can get\ntricky. We all know by now, I hope, that this doesn\u2019t mean every single word\nor phrase in my translation must precisely correspond in style and effect to a\ncounterpart in the author\u2019s text. But it does mean that I don\u2019t have the\nliberty to write a \u201cstrange\u201d work when the author\u2019s was \u201cnormal\u201d, or\n\u201cnormalise\u201d the writing when the author meant to be unorthodox. If I do, the\nresult may still be \u201cgood\u201d, but rather than a translation, it might be more\naccurate to call it an adaptation.\n\n### Ros Schwartz (translates from French to English)\n\nA good translation captures the spirit of a text without slavishly following\nit to the letter. It captures the energy and texture and voice of the source\ntext and replicates them in the translation, drawing on all the resources of\nthe target language. A good translation conveys what is written between the\nlines. A good translation exudes empathy. A good translation elicits the same\nemotional response in the reader as the source text does in its readers. A\ngood translation doesn\u2019t colonise the work but preserves the joys and beauties\nof its \u201cotherness\u201d without resorting to weird foreignisation. A good\ntranslation perfectly resolves the tension between meaning and music, and that\nof being source-text oriented and target-reader oriented. A good translation\nis bold and creative, a good translation sings.\n\n### Antonia Lloyd-Jones (translates from Polish to English)\n\nA good translation is imperceptible. It reads as if the book were written in\nthe language into which it has been translated. Within the text, the\ntranslator is invisible. A good translation removes the barrier imposed by an\nunfamiliar language and allows the writer to communicate directly with the\nforeign reader.\n\nA good translation doesn\u2019t simply reproduce the correct meaning of the\noriginal text. It also captures the voice and music of the original as the\nwriter intended it to be heard, and reproduces it in a way that is audible to\nthe new, foreign reader. It is sensitive to the meaning, effects and\nintentions of the original, but also to the best ways to render them in the\ntarget language.\n\nIn some instances, achieving that aim can mean moving away from the literal\nmeaning of the original. This is probably truer for translation from some\nlanguages than others; perhaps for translators into English, languages outside\nthe Indo-European group will need a different approach from languages that\nbelong to it. Different genres or translating for children can also have\ndifferent requirements. So while a good translation is true to the original\nmeaning the author wants to convey, it isn\u2019t straitjacketed by the literal\nmeaning of the original text.\n\nA good translation also recognises the original writer\u2019s style and voice, but\nto convey them to the foreign reader in keeping with the writer\u2019s intentions,\nthe translator might need to retune them slightly, using different techniques.\nThis is particularly true of poetry, or of prose that is lyrical and dependent\non rhythm or sound.\n\n### Sandra Hetzl (translates from Arabic to German)\n\nTo me a good translation is one where you almost can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re\nreading was translated, from something into something, from somewhere to\nsomewhere \u2013 is language a place, or is it rather a thing? One where you almost\ncan\u2019t believe it was brought from somewhere to somewhere. That it was unboxed,\nthen hastily transported, a shapeless, unprotected something, and carefully\nput into new boxes. Which makes it sound like I sustain the theory that a good\ntranslation is some sort of a hoax.\n\n### Saskia Vogel (translated from Swedish to English)\n\nI suppose a good translation is a good piece of writing and should have all\nthe markers of those. Personally, I appreciate musicality in a text and an\nability to carry through the feeling of each line: those subtle shifts, for\nexample, when at the end of a paragraph a well-placed word or phrase elicits a\nlaugh, a note of tragedy or irony. If texts aren\u2019t musical in some way\n(cacophonous and melodic alike), I find that I am more critical of the\ntranslation. I wonder to what extent a good translation isn\u2019t also about a\nbeing good fit with the translator. I think about texts where I\u2019ve had to\nlabour perhaps too much to make the voice feel authentic to the author\u2019s, and\nI can think that perhaps I wasn\u2019t a good fit for that text. I think (hope)\nthis has something to do with experience. The texts I\u2019m thinking of were early\non in my career, which might bring me to my answer for what a good translation\nis: When the translator feels comfortable enough with the text to treat it as\ntheir own \u2013 all the while keeping the author\u2019s music, tone, emotion, voice,\netc., in sight \u2013 and is able to create (or transcreate?) a piece of writing\nthat feels like the original and carries the original through to the reader,\nhowever much the translator has stayed faithful to or departed from the\noriginal text. When translations don\u2019t feel like they have been written \u2013\nwhere the reader becomes too aware of the mechanics of the writing \u2013 and\nsimply \u2018are\u2019 that\u2019s when they\u2019re good. I fear this all sounds terribly vague,\nand so I think of dancing and return to what you brought up first: when you\nsee someone competently doing the steps but not bridging technique and\nfeeling, versus the dancer just being in the flow. Flow is captivating and\ngenerous in that it allows for all sorts of imperfections as we are being\nswept along in the moment and movement.\n\n### Julia Sherwood (translates from Slovak to English)\n\nFor me a good translation is one that is on the same wavelength as the\noriginal text \u2013 a piece of music that has been arranged for different\ninstruments but evokes an emotional response as close to the effect of the\noriginal as possible given a different cultural background and references. Or\na goulash or a souffl\u00e9 prepared from locally available ingredients that comes\nout with a texture as stodgy or fluffy and that burns your palate or tickles\nyour taste buds in the same way as the original.\n\n### Sam Bett (translates from Japanese to English)\n\nA good translation wants to be read. Its clever solutions will keep to the\nsurface, no more conspicuous than the slippery things they venture to\napproximate. The strengths and curiosities of the source will dare to be\npresent alongside its duller points and weaknesses, but all will have been\nreimagined, naturally and effectively, at a remove from the rules of the\noriginal style.\n\n### Sophie Lewis (translates from French and Portuguese to English)\n\nI think it\u2019s about a near-magical balance being struck between channelling the\ntranslator\u2019s perceived idea of the text\u2019s original sound and intention and its\nre-enactment through the translator\u2019s own voice, the way they personally would\nexpress these styles and ideas. It\u2019s about the careful and always considerate\nmingling of these two impulses or perceptions \u2013 which means you can\u2019t always\ntell that you\u2019re reading a good translation! The nature of the animal is that\nyou can\u2019t be sure to identify it as such, though you may have a good feeling\nabout it.\n\n### David Boyd (translates from Japanese to English)\n\nA good translation hums. It lives in the ear. It shatters our expectations,\nredefining what translation can do in the first place.\n\nWhen you read a good translation, the usual labels (literal vs liberal, etc.)\nquickly lose their value. Great translations make it painfully clear that we\nlack the critical language necessary to talk about translation as an art, on\nits own terms.\n\nThis lack of critical clarity is exactly what makes your question such a hard\none. To borrow from Potter Stewart, we know a good translation when we see it,\nright? Complicating matters further, each good translation is good in its own\nway. I hope that doesn\u2019t read like a cop-out. I think it\u2019s true. The good ones\nmake us see translation in a new way.\n\n### Why Does It Matter?\n\nRecently, Chad Post wrote an entertaining piece about reviewing translations,\narguing with himself in the roles of translation advocate and reviewer. What\nmade me sit up and think was this passage, in the voice of Post\u2019s inner\nunderpaid critic:\n\n> Deep dives into translation theory and how to reproduce a language\u2019s syntax\n> in English are 100% guarantees of boring the piss out of a general reader.\n> [...] There are, what?, 20,000 readers of literary fiction out there? And,\n> let\u2019s be honest, the translations we\u2019re talking about are works of\n> literature, not spy novels or romances or whatever. Of those 20,000 readers,\n> probably 500 or so read actual book reviews. If you want these reviews to be\n> promotional tools for international literature, we need to up that number.\n> And to up that number, we have to focus on what readers want: plot\n> descriptions, information about what makes a book unique, why it\u2019s worth\n> reading and what about it might not work for everyone.\n\nAnd you know what? He\u2019s got a point. Just like translators, critics work under\nconstraints. I genuinely believe it is possible to identify hallmarks of\nsuccessful translations \u2013 like transferring humour and wordplay, recreating\ncadence and rhythm, preserving a strong sense of place, and all the things my\ncolleagues have pointed out above. But maybe doing that requires an extra\nmental shift, an extra layer of thought to work out what exactly the\ntranslator has done here, and which aspects are entirely the author\u2019s doing.\nAnd maybe if you\u2019re being paid a pittance and all you want to do is encourage\nreaders to buy a book, or tell them why you think they shouldn\u2019t bother, that\nshift isn\u2019t worth the effort. I can see that.\n\nFor us as translators, though, I think it\u2019s extremely important. We need role\nmodels, we need something to strive for \u2013 and we need to find ways to define\ngood work that go beyond the negative. As David Boyd puts it, good\ntranslations make us see translation in a new way; they can shake us out of\ncomplacency, encourage us to try new things. One of the things I love about\nliterary translation is, as David Colmer points out, that it\u2019s a job for\nperfectionists, forever reaching for the impossible, or the \u201choax\u201d as Sandra\nHetzl calls it. It\u2019s a profession for optimists.\n\nMuch of our work takes place on an intuitive level, reading very deeply and\nthen writing our own version of a text, sometimes less conscious of the\nchoices we make than close readers might be, at least in our first draft.\nHence, I suspect, some of the language we use to explain what we\u2019re trying\nfor: dancing, cooking, music, something near-magical and near-invisible. These\nare all useful metaphors. But if we\u2019re to continue our striving and pass it on\nto new generations, I think it\u2019s also helpful to find examples of good\ntranslations and investigate what it is they do well.\n\nLet me tell you about a couple of my role models. Christina MacSweeney\u2019s\nEnglish version of The Story of My Teeth by Valeria Luiselli absolutely\nsparkles with wit. She gives us a strong, consistent and funny voice and finds\ntruly innovative ways to help her readers understand the novel\u2019s context,\nadding a whole extra chapter of her own. Breon Mitchell\u2019s translation of The\nTin Drum by G\u00fcnter Grass does, what David Colmer mentions, embrace the gifts\nof the English language\u2019s huge vocabulary, while deftly wrangling Grass\u2019\nwinding sentences. I recently admired Susan Bernofsky\u2019s English translation of\nMemoirs of a Polar Bear by Yoko Tawada, which really captures the strangeness\nof a Soviet polar bear writing her life story, using a mix of slightly stilted\nand colloquial language and again choosing her words with great joy. For me,\nthis is also an example of a translator well suited to her writer, who has\nbeen working with her for years and feels comfortable \u2013 as Saskia Vogel\nwrites, treating Tawada\u2019s writing as her own.\n\nAnd to give an example of a writer not yet translated into English, I\u2019m bowled\nover by Silke Kleemann\u2019s German translation of El que mueve las piezas (una\nnovela b\u00e9lica) by Ariel Magnus, a tale of a Jewish German in 1939 Buenos Aires\nthat plays with language and literature, fact and fiction. Kleemann really\nenters into the spirit of the thing, goes along with so many jokes and adds a\nwhole new layer of understanding to our reading, tackling the tricky feat of\nessentially back-translating a semi-German book written in Spanish. Without,\nhowever, resorting to \u201ccolonising\u201d, as Ros Schwartz puts it \u2013 it is still a\nvery Argentinian novel. An English translation might be even more difficult,\ncome to think of it, with a third linguistic factor to it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice I\u2019m foregrounding humour, which confirms to me that taste in\ntranslations varies. I like funny books and I know it\u2019s hard to rescue humour\nacross languages, requires a lot of struggling out of the straitjacket of\nliteral meaning that Antonia Lloyd-Jones mentions. As Boyd points out, good\ntranslations are all good in different ways. Incidentally, I speak only two\nlanguages, German and English, but as I work on recognising good translation I\nfind I can identify examples where I don\u2019t understand the original, like the\ntwo Spanish-language books above.\n\nPerhaps it is indeed utopian to expect critics to hone that sensitivity, if\neven we translators are still working on it. But I\u2019m glad we are working on\nit, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re reading each other\u2019s work and appreciating it and moving\ntowards critiquing it fairly, within a community I have always experienced as\nmutually supportive. Perhaps, with time, we\u2019ll develop the clarity we need to\ntalk about our work as an art, and by doing so make it better.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Seagull newsletter.\n\nKaty Derbyshire co-edits no man\u2019s land, an online magazine of contemporary\nGerman writing in English, and co-hosts a monthly translation lab in Berlin.\nFor Seagull Books, she has translated books by Jan Brandt, Dorothee Elmiger,\nJo Lendle, Sybille Lewitscharoff, Inka Parei, Tilman Rammstedt and Christa\nWolf.\n\nBuy an annual Scroll Membership to support independent journalism and get\nspecial benefits.\n\nPick An Amount\n\nNo ads\n\nEvening Edition newsletter\n\nMembers-only events\n\nWeekly Edition newsletter\n\nMerchandise\n\nHelp design new products\n\nEditorial meet-up invitation\n\nWe welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.\n\n  * Translation\n  * literature\n\n### Related\n\n#### Writer Sharanya Manivannan on her picture book being translated into\nTamil, her mother tongue\n\n### Trending\n\n  1. #### \u2018Knowing we\u2019re mortal gives us purpose\u2019: Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan on his new book\n\n  2. #### \u2018We are living in perpetual fear\u2019: Prajwal Revanna video leaks spark panic among women in Hassan\n\n  3. #### In Amit Shah\u2019s Gandhinagar, three Lok Sabha candidates allege they faced pressure to withdraw\n\n  4. #### Gen Zers and millennials are still big fans of books \u2013 even if they don\u2019t call themselves \u2018readers\u2019\n\n  5. #### What explains reports of infighting within the BJP during the elections?\n\nAd\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
