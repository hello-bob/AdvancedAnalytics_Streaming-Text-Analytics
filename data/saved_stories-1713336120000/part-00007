In\n1984 the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) introduced strict rules to be\nfollowed which authenticated the accuracy of such evidence, before it could be\nput to a court in a trial. Section 69(1)(a) required \u2018that there are no\nreasonable grounds for believing that the statement is inaccurate because of\nimproper use of the computer\u2019 and section 69(1)(b) required \u2018that at all\nmaterial times the computer was operating properly.\u2019\n\nIn 1999 these provisions were repealed. Reports in the media stated a\npresumption was introduced into law on how courts should consider electronic\nevidence. The new rule introduced in 1999 followed a Law Commission\nrecommendation for courts to presume that a computer system has operated\ncorrectly unless there is explicit evidence to the contrary (Karl Flinders,\nComputer Weekly, 20 January 2021).\n\nAlex Hern, writing in the Guardian (12 January 2024), quoted Stephen Mason, a\nbarrister and expert on electronic evidence, who said: \u2018It says, for the\nperson who\u2019s saying \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with this computer\u201d, that they\nhave to prove it. Even if it\u2019s the person accusing them who has the\ninformation.\u2019 Is this a correct interpretation of the law? The Crown\nProsecution Service\u2019s online legal guidance (always an authoritative and\nuseful source) states that since the 1999 change in the law, computer evidence\nmust follow the common law rule, that a presumption will exist that the\ncomputer producing the evidential record was working properly at the material\ntime and that the record is therefore admissible as real evidence.\n\nJust like any other evidence that is not subject to special admissibility\nrules. But common law admissibility rules include rebuttal provisions, the CPS\nreminds us. That presumption can, however, be rebutted if evidence to the\ncontrary is adduced (the \u2018rebuttable presumption\u2019). In that event it will be\nfor the party seeking to produce the computer record in evidence to satisfy\nthe court that the computer was working properly at the material time (for\ndetailed guidance as to the law, see Archbold 9-11 9-15).\n\nIn other words, if computer generated material is introduced in criminal\nproceedings by the prosecution, the defence is entitled to adduce evidence\nshowing that the material is demonstrably different from normal material\nroutinely produced in similar circumstances, and that there is no evidence to\nsupport the accuracy of the computer generated material (such as records of\nindividual transactions). Defendants (all of them of good character) were\nentitled to rebut allegations of fraud or false accounting when giving\nevidence in a trial.\n\nAccording to the CPS\u2019s Disclosure Manual, material should normally be\ndisclosed if it is relevant to the nature of the case against the accused,\n\n  * the essential elements of the offence alleged,\n  * the evidence upon which the prosecution relies, and\n  * any explanation offered by the accused [rebuttal], whether in formal interview or otherwise.\n\nAnd so \u2018the party seeking to produce the computer record in evidence\u2019 would\nneed \u2018to satisfy the court that the computer was working properly.\u2019 Not the\ndefendant. The burden of proof should not have been reversed. The law does not\nprivilege computer generated evidence over other kinds of evidence. For\nexample, if a person is prosecuted for committing a violent crime on the basis\nof identification evidence, they are entitled to require proof that CCTV\nequipment was functioning properly, that they really are the person shown in\nimages, that eyewitnesses have not made a mistake, and so on.\n\nThe change in the law relating to computer generated evidence made it easier\nfor the Post Office to mount prosecutions against subpostmasters, but it did\nnot change common law evidence rules. Making a certain type of prosecution\nevidence admissible is not the same as proving its authenticity and accuracy.\n\nSo, what went wrong? Why did lawyers acting for these defendants fail to mount\nsuccessful challenges to what are now accepted (universally, it appears) to be\ncompletely false allegations and gross injustices? Why was evidence which\ncould have been challenged, not challenged? Why are the lawyers so silent on\nthis issue?\n\nWhen Computer Weekly claimed \u2018IT scandal exposes legal rule that made it easy\nfor Post Office to prosecute the innocent\u2019, they were right \u2013 it was easier to\nstart a prosecution, because the correct functioning of the computer did not\nhave to be proved in order to charge a suspect on the basis of the computer\ngenerated evidence. But they did have to come up with proof that the system\nconcerned was operating properly.\n\nSo were reporters and lawyers pointing the finger at the rules that really\nwere to blame \u2013 or do other rules exist, far more disturbing rules which hide\nsuch abuses? And so permit and encourage unjust prosecutions?\n\nDisclosure basics When the police investigate a case, they are legally\nrequired to follow up all reasonable lines of inquiry, whether they point to,\nor away from, the guilt of a suspect. Any evidence they have or obtain (called\nmaterial) which points towards the innocence of a suspect, or which undermines\nthe prosecution case, in all normal circumstances, must be disclosed to a\nsuspect when they are charged with a crime and become a defendant, and at any\ntime until criminal proceedings are completed.\n\nThe disclosure officer should:\n\n  * copy that material to the prosecutor to include:\n  * material which in the opinion of the disclosure officer satisfies the disclosure test (para 7.3 & 7.4 of the Code)...\n  * any material which falls within the categories for the rebuttable presumption (para 7.5 of the Code), and;\n  * allow the prosecutor to inspect material.\n\nCertifications by the disclosure officer\n\nThe OIC must ensure that all relevant material that has been retained is\neither revealed to the disclosure officer, or in exceptional circumstances,\nrevealed on a highly sensitive schedule directly to the prosecutor.\n\nThe disclosure officer must provide different certifications in the course of\nthe disclosure process, to cover:\n\n  * revelation of all relevant retained material;\n  * confirmation that no material falls within the categories to which the rebuttable presumption applies (if appropriate);\n  * whether material satisfies the disclosure test; and\n  * whether material satisfies the disclosure test following a defence statement as part of continuing duty.\n\nThe actual disclosure procedure is complex. In practice it is wholly under the\ncontrol of the prosecutors. Part of that procedure can include granting public\ninterest immunity to some of material is a secret part of the disclosure\nprocedure, which is used in some cases. How often is this procedure used? We\ndon\u2019t know. It\u2019s secret. (See the note below on the standard police disclosure\nduties. Although the Post Office prosecutions were private prosecutions,\ndisclosure requirements are the same as those that apply to the police and the\nCPS \u2013 all Post Office investigators had previously been police officers and\nknew what the criminal justice system rules and procedures were.)\n\nPublic Interest Immunity (PII) The rules governing the granting of PII to\nevidence, which can have the effect of hiding the evidential material\nconcerned and excluding it from trials, are contained in the Criminal\nProcedure Rules (CPR; the most recent 2020 version is cited here. PII acquired\nlegislative status in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996).\n\nThe Criminal Procedure Rules have the status of secondary legislation, the\nnext best thing to statutes, which are debated and voted on in parliament. Any\nupdates are laid before parliament for members to inspect and comment on. They\nare published in full online. Readers not yet familiar with this law may like\nto know:\n\n1.1.\u2014(1) The overriding objective of this procedural code is that criminal\ncases be dealt with justly.\n\n(2) Dealing with a criminal case justly includes\u2015 (a) acquitting the innocent\nand convicting the guilty; (b) dealing with the prosecution and the defence\nfairly; (c) recognising the rights of a defendant, particularly those under\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nSo far so good. CPR section 15.3 covers the procedure for granting PII to\nevidence.\n\nThis rule applies where, without a court order, the prosecutor would have to\ndisclose material; and the prosecutor wants the court to decide whether it\nwould be in the public interest to disclose it.\n\n\u2018Having to disclose material\u2019 refers to material which would benefit the\ndefence and so should be disclosed under the normal disclosure rules. This\nprocedure is used when the prosecution does not want the defence to know about\nthis material, because then it would become known to the public. The\nprosecution wants the court to rule that the prosecution does not have to\ndisclose the material in question.\n\nThe application for PII to be granted to an item of evidence is decided at a\nhearing which must be in private (unless the court otherwise directs) and (if\nthe court so directs) may take place, wholly or in part, in the defendant\u2019s\nabsence.\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs, the court officer must not give notice to\nanyone other than the prosecutor of the hearing of an application under this\nrule ... or of the court\u2019s decision on the application.\n\nTo summarise: PII may be granted to material held by the prosecution, and\nwhich would benefit the defence case, without the defence knowing anything\nabout it \u2013 not knowing that the material exists, not knowing that a court\nhearing about it has taken place, not being able to challenge the ruling; that\nis, in complete secrecy. The judge presiding over a PII hearing must make\ntheir decision entirely on the evidence supplied by the prosecution. They can\ntake defence statements into account, but in stating their defendants\u2019 cases,\ndefence lawyers have no knowledge of the secret evidence to be put before a\ncourt hearing a PII application, or of the possibility that a PII hearing\nmight be held. Prosecutors and investigators are free to tell judges anything\nthey like, without fear of contradiction. They could assure judges that the\nHorizon program is \u2018robust\u2019 \u2013 a word which appears to be a synonym for\ninfallible in their usage \u2013 that it\u2019s tried and tested and reviewed, and that\nthere is no access to the data it holds by Post Office or Fujitsu staff.\n\nA record of the hearing and the decision is kept in a securely locked cupboard\nsomewhere in the court building. Where? Well, that\u2019s a secret. Who can see the\nrecord? We don\u2019t know. But the Court of Appeal Criminal Division (CACD) can\nsee it \u2013 as long as the court follows the PII rules.\n\nSince the secrecy of a PII hearing and everything about it is determined by a\ncourt, any breach of the secrecy rules may constitute a contempt of court,\nwhich is subject to severe sanctions. Who is subject to the rules of the\ncourt? The CPR says: \u2018[a]nyone involved in any way with a criminal case is a\nparticipant in its conduct...\u2019. So that includes the defence lawyers and the\ndefendants themselves. But not the rest of us.\n\nWhat sort of material is subject to PII rulings? The Code of Practice issued\nunder the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (section 23(1)) 2021\nedition states:\n\n\u2018[A]ny material the disclosure of which [prosecutors] believe would give rise\nto a real risk of serious prejudice to an important public interest, and the\nreason for that belief. This \u2018sensitive material\u2019 typically includes \u2018material\nrelating to national security, ... the identity or activities of informants,\nor undercover police officers, or witnesses, or other persons supplying\ninformation to the police who may be in danger if their identities are\nrevealed.\u2019\n\nBut other categories exist which would directly cover Horizon material.\nMaterial revealing, either directly or indirectly, techniques and methods\nrelied upon by a police officer in the course of a criminal investigation.\nUnder this heading could be included how they gathered and analysed (or failed\nto analyse) Horizon material.\n\nMaterial whose disclosure might facilitate the commission of other offences or\nhinder the prevention and detection of crime.\n\nIf this subpostmasters knew precisely how Horizon worked, they might use such\nknowledge in order to commit crimes or hide the crimes they were already\ncommitting, in the view of the Post Office and its investigators. If our\nsuppositions are correct, and a PII ruling was indeed obtained, then this\nwould probably be the main reason for it.\n\nAnother reason for not disclosing Horizon material is likely to have been\ncommercial confidentiality (worth a lot to Fujitsu, who were being paid a lot\nfor the computer system and its maintenance, and who stood to lose contracts\nif their incompetence was exposed. The government was also heavily committed\nto using Fujitsu computerised system, and that would have been seen as giving\n\u2018rise to a real risk of serious prejudice to an important public interest.\u2019\nThe UK state was concerned at the highest level (Prime Minister Tony Blair)\nthat Horizon should be brought into use, and paid very large sums to Fujitsu.\n(See also Rowena Mason and Russell Scott, \u2018Kemi Badenoch failed to raise\nHorizon scandal when she met Fujitsu at Davos,\u2019 Observer 11 February 2024:\n\u2018Exclusive: FoI request shows [Business Secretary] was warned by civil\nservants of \u201crisk\u201d but focused instead on tech firm\u2019s investment in UK.\u2019)\n\nBut the CPR also state that\n\nThe court may only determine [i.e. grant] the application if it is satisfied\nthat it has been able to take adequate account of ... the defendant\u2019s right to\na fair trial.\n\nCould defendants have a fair trial without disclosure of Horizon material? The\njudges would have ruled that a fair trial would be possible because the\nHorizon material would add nothing to the defence case, because they had been\nfirmly reassured that Horizon is \u2018robust\u2019. The prosecution would have\nintroduced the argument that it was the defence\u2019s responsibility to prove\notherwise, and the defence had not produced any evidence to show that Horizon\nhad major and relevant faults. The defence was excluded from PII hearings, so\nthey were not able to argue against this claim. Hence the widespread\nacceptance of this view, and the repeated refusal of the Post Office to\ndisclose Horizon material.\n\nHow we can deduce that PII hearings have taken place?\n\n  * 1\\. The logic of the Post Office argument \u2013 that many subpostmasters are dishonest \u2013 would mean that to disclose detailed information about the working of Horizon would facilitate the commission of crimes in future, which might be made harder to detect. A PII ruling would prevent fraud and theft, Post Office lawyers would have argued.\n  * 2\\. If Horizon was appearing to expose fraud and theft, then it would remain a valuable system. A PII ruling would protect a valuable asset belonging to Fujitsu, to the UK state and its relationship with Japan.\n  * 3\\. Judges trying the Post Office cases appear to have confidence in the \u2018robustness\u2019 (or infallibility) of Horizon than has been stated in open court \u2013 a matter on which they could be reassured without fear of defence challenges which could have been made in open court.\n  * 4\\. If judges trying these cases appear to know more about individual defendants (eg for sentencing purposes) than has been stated in open court or agreed evidence, then this is attributable to information given in the absence of defendants, such as a PII hearing (analysis of sentencing remarks would be necessary in order to confirm this proposition).\n  * 5\\. Defence lawyers appear to have been generally silent about the issues concerning non-disclosure of material which is subject to PII, indicating they are bound by the secrecy required by the PII procedure.\n  * 6\\. The Court of Appeal could probably cope with the burden of overturning the wrongful convictions, given the similar nature of all the cases and the collapse of the prosecution. But appeal procedures might expose how PII hearings were abused to cover up Horizon system defects and failures to remedy them. The proposed exceptional legislation would remove the exposure of embarrassments to the state, the Post Office and Fujitsu. It would remove the legal problem which would be caused by appeal courts being forced to admit evidence which had been concealed by other courts. No doubt the legislative solution would adopt the \u2018faulty program\u2019 explanation, thus foreclosing investigation of other explanations, such as the tampering with Horizon data featured in the ITV drama, which was factual, not fictional.\n  * 7\\. Perhaps most importantly, many (possibly all) suspects raised issues concerning Horizon as part of their defences. These were rational explanations in terms of obvious system defects and possible manipulations of data by the staff at the Post Office and Fujitsu who had access to Horizon data, and opportunities to change it. In an investigation following the rules laid down in the CPIA 1996 and its associated Code of Practice, these explanations constituted reasonable lines of inquiry, which investigators were legally obliged to follow. The Post Office\u2019s own investigators were former police officers who were aware of the responsibilities of criminal investigators.\n\nEither the private investigators did not bother to investigate defences that\nwere put to them, or they followed the Code of Practice and did investigate in\nresponse to suspects\u2019 rebuttal evidence. In the latter case, they would have\nobtained relevant material which should have been disclosed to defendants, but\nwere absolved from their disclosure duties by PII rulings.\n\nThe Disclosure Officer\u2019s Report MG6E\n\nRefreshed: 21 October 2021|Legal Guidance. Form MG6E is a standard form\ncompleted by police investigators in preparation for all criminal\nprosecutions. The completed forms are sent to CPS prosecutors. The following\ntext is on the CPS web site, but all emphases have been added.\n\nThe disclosure officer should use the MG6E to bring to the prosecutor\u2019s\nattention any material that could reasonably be considered capable of\nundermining the prosecution case against the accused or of assisting the case\nfor the accused. This also applies to sensitive material.\n\nThe disclosure officer should also explain on form MG6E (by referring to the\nrelevant item\u2019s number on the schedule) why he or she has come to that view.\nThe MG6E schedule should be completed in accordance with the National\nStandards of Disclosure.\n\nAny material that supports or is consistent with a defence put forward in\ninterview or before charge or which is apparent from the prosecution papers,\nshould be included. It also includes anything that points away from the\naccused, such as information about a possible alibi. Items of material viewed\nin isolation may not satisfy the test; however, several items together can\nhave that effect. In applying the disclosure test, disclosure officers and\nprosecutors should not be judgmental about the merits of a defence and any\ndoubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure.\n\n... The disclosure officer should consult with the prosecutor where necessary\nto help identify material that may require disclosure, and must specifically\ndraw material to the attention of the prosecutor where the disclosure officer\nhas any doubt as to whether it might satisfy the disclosure test.... [Material\nclassed as \u2018sensitive\u2019 and which could be considered as needing Public\nInterest Immunity]\n\nTo assist the prosecutor to decide how to deal with sensitive material which\nthe investigator believes may meet the disclosure test, the investigator\nshould provide detailed information dealing with the following issues:\n\n  * the reasons why the material is said to be sensitive;\n  * the degree of sensitivity said to attach to the material, in other words, why it is considered that disclosure will create a real risk of serious prejudice to an important public interest;\n  * the consequences of revealing to the defence7\n\n1\\. the material itself 2. the category of the material 3. the fact that an\napplication may be made\n\n  * the apparent significance of the material to the issues in the trial;\n  * the involvement of any third parties in bringing the material to the attention of the police;\n  * where the material is likely to be the subject of an order for disclosure, what the police view is regarding continuance of the prosecution, and;\n  * whether it is possible to disclose the material or information, whether redacted or in another form, without compromising its sensitivity.\n\nTo assist in determining the degree of sensitivity as above, consideration\nshould be given to the fact that the public interest may be prejudiced either\ndirectly or indirectly through incremental or cumulative harm. Examples of\ndirect harm are:...\n\n  * \u2022exposure of a secret investigative technique.\n\nExamples of incremental or cumulative harm include:\n\n  * exposure of an investigative technique that makes the criminal community more aware and therefore better able to avoid detection;\n  * exposure of material given in confidence, or for intelligence purposes, that may make the source of the material, or others, reluctant to cooperate in the future; and\n  * an active denial that a source was used in the instant case, leading to the inability to deny it in future cases where one was used, thereby impliedly exposing the use of a source. The Crown should neither confirm nor deny the use of a source.\n\nRevelation of the material to the prosecutor Revealing material to the\nprosecutor does not mean automatic disclosure to the defence. The prosecutor\nwill only disclose material to the defence if it satisfies the disclosure\ntest. If the material is sensitive, and satisfies the disclosure test, the\nprosecutor will either disclose the material after consultation with police,\napply to the court for a ruling as to whether the public interest requires\ndisclosure or withdraw the prosecution.\n\nThe disclosure officer should:\n\ncopy that material to the prosecutor to include:\n\n  * material which in the opinion of the disclosure officer satisfies the disclosure test (para 7.3 & 7.4 of the Code)...\n  * any material which falls within the categories for the rebuttable presumption (para 7.5 of the Code), and;\n  * allow the prosecutor to inspect material.\n\nCertifications by the disclosure officer\n\nThe OIC must ensure that all relevant material that has been retained is\neither revealed to the disclosure officer, or in exceptional circumstances,\nrevealed on a highly sensitive schedule directly to the prosecutor. If the\ndisclosure officer is uncertain whether all the relevant retained material has\nbeen revealed, enquiries should be made of the OIC to resolve the matter.\n\nThe disclosure officer must provide different certifications in the course of\nthe disclosure process, to cover:\n\n  * revelation of all relevant retained material;\n  * confirmation that no material falls within the categories to which the rebuttable presumption applies (if appropriate);\n  * whether material satisfies the disclosure test; and\n  * whether material satisfies the disclosure test following a defence statement as part of continuing duty.\n\n  * Author: Andrew Green\n\nAndrew has a doctorate in criminology.
