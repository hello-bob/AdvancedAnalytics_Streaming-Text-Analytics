The regulator\u2019s staff have made a \u201cpreliminary\ndetermination\u201d to recommend enforcement action against the company, which\ncould lead to civil litigation, monetary penalties and limits on business\nactivities.\n\nThe SEC has taken a hard line on crypto enforcement, arguing many tokens\nconstitute securities and should be regulated as such.\n\nRobinhood, founded in 2013, says it has a customer base of more than 23mn\ninvestors and $119bn in assets under custody. While also brokering equities\nand options, it offers commission-free trading of 15 cryptocurrencies in most\nUS states, according to its most recent annual report. Cryptocurrencies\naccounted for $135mn of its $785mn in transaction-based revenues last year.\n\nThe company on Monday said it had \u201cmade difficult choices not to list certain\ntokens or provide products, such as lending or staking\u201d, to avoid falling foul\nof the SEC\u2019s policy stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cAfter years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory\nclarity including our well-known attempt to \u2018come in and register,\u2019 we are\ndisappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells notice related to\nour US crypto business,\u201d said Dan Gallagher, Robinhood\u2019s chief legal,\ncompliance and corporate affairs officer.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities\nand we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any\ncase against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law.\u201d\n\nThe SEC said it \u201cdoes not comment on the existence or non-existence of a\npossible investigation\u201d.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s efforts to exert control over the growing digital assets industry\nhave intensified after the failure of FTX in 2022, which culminated this year\nwith founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s 25-year prison sentence on fraud charges. The\nagency has also sued leading crypto platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and\nKraken.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a policy note that the SEC\u2019s warning to\nRobinhood should not come as a surprise and noted the broker had little\nincentive to settle such a lawsuit given that the term of SEC chair Gary\nGensler was due to expire within two years. His departure could lead to a\nchange in the regulator\u2019s position on cryptocurrency enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe see this as consistent with the SEC\u2019s approach of forcing crypto fights to\nthe courts,\u201d Seiberg said in the note. \u201cWe also see little reason for\nRobinhood to settle given the political and legal changes that are possible in\nthe coming years.\u201d\n\nRobinhood\u2019s stock price was unchanged on Monday and is up about 47 per cent\nsince the start of 2024. The company is set to report its first quarter\nfinancial results on Wednesday.\n\nThe company has previously paid out large sums to resolve regulatory cases,\nincluding a $65mn settlement with the SEC in 2020 over charges that it had\nfailed to provide its customers with the best prices for trades, and more than\n$70mn in penalties in 2021 from industry regulator Finra over alleged harm to\ncustomers.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
