Rodriguez Carrillo with Issam Ahmed in Washington\n\nNASA's Vehicle Assembly building (L) and a screen showing Boeing, Crew Flight\nTest and Starliner logos are seen after the Starliner crew flight test was\nscrubbed.\n\nThe first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically\ncalled off just two hours before launch after a new safety issue was\nidentified, officials said Monday, pushing back a high-stakes test mission to\nthe International Space Station.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped into their seats\npreparing for liftoff when the call for a \"scrub\" came because engineers\nnoticed audible buzzing from a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V\nrocket meant to propel the capsule into orbit.\n\nIn a late-night press conference, Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United\nLaunch Alliance (ULA) that built the rocket, told reporters the unusual\nvibrations were a sign the valve parts might be wearing down to the point of\nfailure, but insisted \"the crew was never in any danger.\"\n\nEngineers will now work through the night to determine the degree of\ndeterioration and decide whether to re-fit the same part on the launchpad, or\nwheel the rocket back to its assembly building to install a new valve, he\nadded.\n\nULA, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, later said the next launch\nattempt would be Friday at the earliest.\n\n\"The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are\ntargeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10,\" ULA said on\nsocial media platform X.\n\nThe mission has already faced years of delays and comes at a challenging time\nfor Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs the century-old manufacturer's\ncommercial aviation division.\n\nNASA is banking on a successful test for Starliner so it can certify a second\ncommercial vehicle to carry crews to the ISS.\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a\nnearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the\nSpace Shuttle program.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were set to blast off and had waved\ngoodbye to their families before boarding a van to the launch tower.\n\nHistory of setbacks\n\nFollowing the decision to abort the launch, the astronauts, clad in blue\nspacesuits, were helped out of Starliner then boarded a van back to their\nquarters.\n\nWilmore and Williams, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans,\nhave each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a\nRussian Soyuz vessel.\n\nTheir new mission will see them put Starliner through its paces, piloting the\ncraft manually to test its capabilities.\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV is set to\nrendezvous with the ISS for a weeklong stay, before returning to Earth for a\nparachute-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous\nsetbacks in the Starliner program.\n\nIn 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the\ncapsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching\nthe ISS. \"Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle,\" said NASA in the\naftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked\nvalves forced another postponement.\n\nThe vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But\nother problems that came to light\u2014including weak parachutes and flammable tape\nin the cabin that needed to be removed\u2014caused further delays to the crewed\ntest flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular\nISS missions.\n\nGraphic on the Boeing Starliner, which will make its first crewed mission to\nthe International Space Station on the Atlas V rocket.\n\nExclusive club\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following\nthe Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.\n\nIn 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of $4.2 billion to Boeing\nand $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew\nProgram.\n\nThis marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to\ninstead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX\nand Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.\n\nEven though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner\nand Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several\ncompanies are developing.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP\n\nCitation: Boeing Starliner crewed mission postponed shortly before launch\n(2024, May 7) retrieved 7 May 2024 from https://phys.org/news/2024-05-boeing-\nstarliner-crewed-mission-postponed.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
