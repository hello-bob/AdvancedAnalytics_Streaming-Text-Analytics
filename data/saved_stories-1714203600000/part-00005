We seem to be at a kind of crossroads.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to be appalled by, so much to be worried about, and I worry\nthat not saying something might be considered to be acquiescence or approval.\n\nSo, in this moment, I thought I\u2019d actually take a step back and explain what\nmy worldview actually is. It\u2019s perhaps overly ambitious, but I want to declare\nI think is important, and what drives me to say the sorts of things I do. And,\nyes, these same factors also drive the decisions I make about where I work and\nhow I build software.\n\nAs always, I would like to read yours.\n\nMy view on the world \u2014 as is true of yours, and of everybody\u2019s \u2014 is a function\nof my lived experiences, and the lived experiences of the people I care about.\n\n### It\u2019s not about leading the world; it\u2019s about living in a peaceful one\n\nI was born in the Netherlands, grew up in England, spent time in Austria, went\nto school in Scotland, and have been in the United States since my early\nthirties. My dad is Swiss-Dutch-Indonesian; my mother was American on one side\nand Ukrainian on the other. They met in Berkeley in the early seventies and\nwere heavily active in various progressive causes as activists. My dad in\nparticular, who was drafted into the US Army after his family moved to America\nas a teenager, organized Vietnam War protests in the Bay Area, and was often\nharassed by the police.\n\nMy parents intentionally left the US to raise me. The closest thing I have to\na hometown is Oxford, famous for its universities, where academic families are\nconstantly coming through. My peers at school came from all over the world \u2014\nincluding from behind the iron curtain \u2014 and experiencing the different smells\nand tastes of peoples\u2019 homes was completely normal.\n\nAt the same time, I was a third culture kid for almost all of my childhood and\nearly adulthood, and identified with no national identity. I never felt any\nreal ties to any particular geographic place for its own sake. I was raised an\natheist and have never felt religious ties (even though, as a child in\nEngland, I went to a Church of England school where we were made to pray every\nday). What I did identify with, very strongly, was family.\n\nMy dad is one of the youngest concentration camp survivors: he spent his early\nyears in a Japanese-run camp in Indonesia, which still colors the way he sees\nthe world. His mother had nightmares every single night for the rest of her\nlife; I will remember hearing her screams though the walls forever. His\nfather, who I never got to meet, was a resistance leader who was forced to dig\nhis own grave multiple times. I\u2019ve heard stories about the camps and what\nhappened afterwards for my entire life. Even when they returned to the\nNetherlands, Indo people like my dad\u2019s family were an ethnic minority and\ntreated poorly. They eventually moved to California, thanks to a local\nsponsor, where they ran a gas station on highway 12 in Sebastopol. My uncle\nwas severely beaten up for daring to serve Black people. The gas station\nitself was routinely shot at \u2014 once killing the family dog \u2014 simply because it\nwas run by immigrants.\n\nMy great grandfather escaped Ukraine twice. His village was destroyed by the\nWhite Army as part of vicious Pogroms. When he emigrated to the US, he\nsecularized, changing his name in the process in order to sound less Jewish.\nEventually he became the General Manager of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of\nthe Amalgamated Shirt Workers. I\u2019ve previously posted excerpts from my\ngrandfather\u2019s obituary that discuss that experience as well as my\ngrandfather\u2019s experience as a Jewish POW in Germany during WWII.\n\nMy grandfather, by the way, ended up translating Crime and Punishment into\nEnglish, and taught in the Slavic and Eurasian Studies and History departments\nat the University of Texas at Austin for forty years. He met Albert Einstein,\nhad coffee with Sylvia Plath, discussed philosophy with Hannah Arendt, and\nnever quite realized his dream of being a poet. In the end, he married into an\ninstitutional American family: my great grandfather was a WWI test pilot and\neventually became a diplomat who negotiated the US withdrawal from Haiti.\n(This fact of my family history is, I want to be clear, not an endorsement of\nthe US\u2019s behavior overseas, including in Haiti.)\n\nSo, all of this is to say: I have no interest in patriotism, let alone\nnationalism. It\u2019s not a value I hold, and I\u2019m not excited by any country\nhaving a leadership position in the world. I find flag-waving to be petty.\nWhat I care about are values: the democracy, inclusion, and co-operation that\ncan lead to a lasting peace. I\u2019m repelled by military strength, because I\u2019ve\nseen what various militaries did to my family. I\u2019m repelled by anti-immigrant\nsentiment, because I come from refugees and immigrants. I don\u2019t like the idea\nof assimilation, because I\u2019ve seen the richness inherent in lots of cultures.\nForced assimilation \u2014 which is usually into a conquering culture \u2014 is\ntantamount to subjugation.\n\nNational exceptionalism \u2014 American exceptionalism, or European exceptionalism,\ncome to that \u2014 is ridiculous on its face. Cold wars and imperialist foreign\npolicies are things to avoid, not things to perpetuate. No country is the\n\u201cbest\u201d, and even the idea of \u201ca best country\u201d is narrow-minded. No religion is\nthe \u201cbest\u201d; please enjoy practicing yours, but please don\u2019t impose it on\nanyone else. There are definitely people who think McCarthy\u2019s witch hunt\nagainst communism was right in spirit, even if they condemn the historical\nevent itself \u2014 let\u2019s just say they and I harbor some very different ideas\nabout what an open, democratic society should look like.\n\nNations aren\u2019t what\u2019s important. Principles are. Specifically, the principles\nof openness, inclusion, fairness, peace, equity, and democracy.\n\nWhat matters is that everyone can live a good life, wherever they are, whoever\nthey are, and however they identify, free from threat of violence or\nexploitation. Ideological or national superiority aren\u2019t useful values. What\nmatters is the experience of being a human, everywhere. What matters is\navoiding the killing and horror of war. What matters is honoring the beautiful\ndiversity of the world.\n\n### A strong operating system for all\n\nI was only half-joking when I compared governments to operating systems. While\nthey certainly don\u2019t map perfectly to actual software operating systems, I do\nthink they provide a very similar purpose: to create a bedrock of services and\ninfrastructure in order to ensure society runs smoothly.\n\nWhat does \u201csociety runs smoothly\u201d really mean? I\u2019ll return to my definition\nabove. What matters is that everyone can live a good life, wherever they are,\nwhoever they are, and however they identify, free from threat of violence or\nexploitation. Freedom of expression, association, and to pursue one\u2019s best\ninterests are important here: what John Locke called the pursuit of happiness.\nTo ensure the safety of that pursuit, I think John Locke\u2019s version of a social\ncontract \u2014 the idea that we surrender a little personal liberty in order to\nmake evolving common agreements in the best interests of everyone \u2014 is\nimportant.\n\nI can\u2019t be a libertarian because I see the importance of the trade-offs here.\nOne role of the operating system is to prevent the vulnerable from\nexploitation: public goods like universal healthcare, public education, and\nintegrated public transit ensure that people who are not wealthy have the\nopportunity to build a great life. One of the most visceral reactions I\u2019ve\never had in my life was discovering Ayn Rand, and then, to my horror,\ndiscovering that beyond just getting into her novels, some people actually\nbelieved in her ideology of everyone for themselves.\n\nHealthy communities are an important part of all of our well-being. Once\nagain: every person deserves to live a good life. We all live in a complex,\ninterconnected network of people, and what happens to someone else also\naffects us. Caring for the whole network is also in our own best interests. It\ncan\u2019t be everyone for themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hopefully obvious from my definition, but I don\u2019t think GDP (or money at\nall) is a great way to measure a society, either. It doesn\u2019t say much about\nwhat an ordinary person\u2019s experience actually is. It doesn\u2019t measure human\nwell-being, and that\u2019s how we should be thinking about how well we\u2019re doing.\nI\u2019m less interested in is the stock market going up? than is being poor a\ndeath sentence? as a question \u2014 and I don\u2019t think the first necessarily leads\nto a reduction in the second. More and more people agree.\n\nOne important function of the social operating system is welfare, which\nensures that people don\u2019t fall though the cracks. There are others, some of\nwhich I\u2019ve already mentioned: education, transit, and healthcare.\n\nI couldn\u2019t have founded my first startup if I hadn\u2019t had the benefit of the\nexcellent National Health Service. Millions of PR dollars have been spent in\nthe US to paint social infrastructure as being a bad thing, but I never once\nhad to worry about going to the doctor under universal healthcare. I didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about losing health insurance when I quit my job. I could just\ndo it. Say what you want about free markets, but I think that freedom of\noptionality \u2014 having broad choices regardless of income or personal net worth\n\u2014 comes closer to real personal freedom than a world without that kind of\nsocial infrastructure.\n\nHere in the United States, it doesn\u2019t come automatically: you need people to\nfight for you. I\u2019ve lost five members of my family to an incurable genetic\ndisease. One of them was my mother, who I helped care for over the course of a\ndecade \u2014 which was, in fact, the reason I moved to the US to begin with. She\nwas a teacher, and the great medical care she received was only possible\nbecause of the incredible negotiating power of her teacher\u2019s union. While\nthere should have simply been universal healthcare to look after her, their\nincredible negotiating power literally lengthened her life by eight years.\nUnions can be amazing institutions; while not every union is great, the\nconcept of them is. And in a world without the social infrastructure to care\nfor the vulnerable, they are vital.\n\nThis should be the purpose of the law, too: to prevent harm and exploitation,\nparticularly of the vulnerable, in service of maintaining the ability to have\na good quality of life. But the law itself, alongside tradition and the twin\nideas of unity and stability, often does the opposite. It has often used as a\nway to maintain a status quo where vulnerable people are exploited for other\npeoples\u2019 benefit.\n\nThis runs deep: some of the earliest police forces in America were slave\npatrols. A law that only benefits the powerful or upholds an unjust status quo\nis, in itself, unjust. Unity that depends on adherence to the values of the\npowerful (and on the silence or silencing of the vulnerable) is a sham.\nStability based on prioritizing the needs of an in-group to the exclusion of\nothers is definitionally fascism. A claim that moderate values are more\nreasonable only makes sense to people who don\u2019t need more radical change in\norder to achieve equity.\n\nBeing awake to those injustices is not a binary: it\u2019s not something you either\nare or not. It\u2019s an ongoing, uncomfortable process of education and coming to\nterms. There are lots of ways to deal with and redress them, the comparative\nmerits of which are up for discussion. What\u2019s clear to me, though, is that\ndismissing their existence outright, and painting them with a reductionist\nbrush in order to rob them of importance, is in itself a perpetuation of those\ninjustices.\n\nWhen people started talking about being \u201cwoke\u201d and taking to the streets to\ndemand restorative justice, I was relieved and excited. This is what moving\nforward looks like. In contrast, I see people harping on about the harms of\n\u201cwoke-ism\u201d as being part of the dying gasps of the twentieth century: that\nadherence to tradition and unity and stability in service of the same old\ninequalities. Change is good; particularly here.\n\nChange can also be easy. Using a preferred pronoun costs you nothing except\nfor letting go of a tradition. The tradition, in other words, gets in the way\nof someone\u2019s chosen identity being recognized. Same-sex marriage costs you\nnothing except for letting go of a tradition. The tradition once again gets in\nthe way of someone being able to realize their needs. Your religious beliefs\nmight forbid same-sex marriage; then simply don\u2019t get same-sex married.\nPractice your own religion to your heart\u2019s content, but don\u2019t enforce your\ntraditions on anyone else. Refer to someone as they would like to be referred;\ntreat everybody with respect. It seems foundational. A fear of change or\nadherence to a tradition should not be a barrier to making the world more just\nor treating our fellow humans with respect.\n\nLet\u2019s return again to the core idea: every person deserves to live a good\nlife. Of course, who we consider to be a \u201cperson\u201d is important. Thomas\nJefferson incorporated Locke\u2019s version of a social contract into the\nDeclaration of Independence, even going so far as to say that \u201call men are\ncreated equal,\u201d but he famously kept slaves. These days, we might ask about\nour spheres of concern: do we care about people in our families? Our\nneighborhoods? Our towns and cities? Our churches? Our ethnicities? Our value\nstructures? Our states? Our countries? Our regions? The world? How do we\nrelate to people outside of those spheres?\n\nFor reasons I\u2019ve tried to explain above, I\u2019d love it if we considered the\nworld to be what we care about; the welfare of a person in Gaza is just as\nimportant as the welfare of a person next door, even if we might not share a\nreligion or care for the regime they live under. In fact, depending on their\ncontext, their welfare might be more important, because they need more help to\nbring them to that reasonable standard of living, free from violence and\nexploitation.\n\nBecause our definitions of what a good life is vary, and because no government\ncan possibly claim to represent or understand the complete set of needs and\nlived experiences in its populace, participative democracy is the only\nequitable model for government. What\u2019s important here: everyone can vote\nwithout hindrance, votes are fair, anyone can become a representative,\ndecisions are actually made at the ballot box rather than in court, and there\nis real choice. (If there\u2019s a candidate whose values you hate, do what you can\nto persuade your fellow voters to vote for someone else. That\u2019s what democracy\nis.)\n\nThose principles are core. It might surprise you to learn that I\u2019m not\ninherently against the idea of billionaires, and certainly not against the\nidea of starting businesses and finding success in doing so. But it must be\ndone without exploiting other people and preventing them from being able to\nlive a good life. It must be done without perpetuating injustices, for example\nby eroding workers\u2019 rights, forcing a minimum wage that is too low to live\nwell on, lobbying for unequal laws, or fighting against their ability to\nnegotiate for better working conditions. Can it be done without those things?\nI don\u2019t know. But if it can\u2019t, then it shouldn\u2019t happen.\n\n### So what does this have to do with the internet?\n\nI see the web as a platform as being rooted in the kind of internationalism I\nbelieve in. The internet itself is a physical manifestation of the idea that\nwe are all connected.\n\nAnyone can publish, anywhere, and be read by anyone, anywhere. That\u2019s amazing!\nAnyone can start a business and find users all over the world. That\u2019s also\namazing! It\u2019s the most borderless, open platform we\u2019ve ever created. The\npotential to learn about the lives of people we would never otherwise meet, in\nplaces we would never otherwise visit, is colossal. We can share ideas and,\neven more importantly, build empathy globally. I couldn\u2019t be more excited\nabout that. That\u2019s what keeps me building.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to dehumanize someone you don\u2019t know. The internet has the\npotential to allow everybody to become knowable. I see that as a route to\npeace, and to a better world where exploitation can no longer happen in the\nshadows.\n\nWhat I\u2019m not enthused by is the idea that the internet is here as an exercise\nin furthering any one country\u2019s interests: that one nation\u2019s worldview should\ntrump another\u2019s. At its best, it\u2019s an international commons: an overtly\nprogressive space by design.\n\nI support the indieweb and the fediverse because those technologies harness\nfor the benefit of the public, rather than for the profit and entrenched power\nof a tiny few. I see silos and centralized services as being anti-democracy,\nbecause the whims of a monarch-like figure can have a profound impact on which\ninformation we\u2019re allowed to see. We\u2019ve seen that most obviously recently with\nElon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, but it was previously also true of\nFacebook, and of every large service that aimed to intermediate peoples\u2019\nconnections with each other. If one entity controls what we see and can learn\nabout, they will abuse it, always.\n\nI\u2019m imperfect. Of course I am. I\u2019ve made terrible mistakes and, from time to\ntime, I\u2019ve hurt people. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t try.\n\nI\u2019ve built open source platforms for organizing educational institutions and\nnon-profits; I\u2019ve supported newsrooms that help to create a more informed\nvoting population; I\u2019ve worked in newsrooms that help speak truth to power.\nIt\u2019s not because I love social networking in itself, or because I want to get\nrich by building software.\n\nIt\u2019s because I remember the sound of my Oma having nightmares through the\nwalls. I see the nationalists and isolationists as trying to divide people\ninto in-groups and out-groups. I see hoarding wealth as akin to building\nwalls. I see conservatism as being a way to preserve the kind of bigotry that\ncan grow and explode into the kinds of hatred that swallow whole families.\nQuixotic as it might be, I see connecting people as a way to help prevent it\nall from ever happening again.\n\nApril 27, 2024 \u00b7 Posts \u00b7 Share this post\n\nShare this post on social media.\n\nI\u2019m writing about the intersection of the internet, media, and society.
