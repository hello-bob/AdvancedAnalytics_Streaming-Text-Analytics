These days, if she sees several other shoppers\nwaiting for too few frenzied workers, the 30-year-old video editor typically\nskips items on her list and later does something she doesn\u2019t feel great about:\nbuys more home essentials on Amazon.\n\n\u201cRather than go to Target and wait,\u201d she said, shrugging, \u201cI\u2019ll just give\nDaddy Bezos my hard-earned cash.\u201d\n\nShoplifting is as old as shopping itself. And retailers have long played a\ngame of cat and mouse with thieves, searching for ways to thwart them while\nstill giving paying customers easy access to merchandise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe true severity and scope of the problem remain an enduring mystery of the\nfree market, as national chains eagerly point to retail theft as a key drag on\nprofits, but are reticent to publicly discuss internal numbers on shrink \u2014 the\nindustry term for theft and other types of loss \u2014 or specifics of new anti-\ntheft measures. Adding to the murkiness, the issue has become more politicized\nin recent years as some voters and elected officials in Los Angeles, San\nFrancisco and other city centers clamor for a response to what they see as a\nworsening problem.\n\nBut what is clear to anyone who has shopped at a drug, grocery or home\nimprovement store in L.A. in recent years is that retailers are increasingly\nresorting to the drastic step of barricading entire swaths of their stores\nbehind lock and key.\n\nBusiness\n\n### Does your drugstore lock up more products than other L.A. stores? We ran\nthe numbers\n\nDrugstores are locking up more products, frustrating shoppers. The Times\nsurveyed stores and found vastly different approaches to preventing theft.\n\nNov. 21, 2022\n\nUsing a tactic once reserved for a few pricey, high-demand items \u2014 cold\nmedication, electronics, baby formula and razors to name a few \u2014 big chains\nnow routinely lock up almost every type of merchandise. A shopper looking to\ngrab a box of condoms or a $1.99 set of crayons, ointment to remove calluses\nor a container of instant coffee, now often has no choice but to hit a button\nto summon a store employee with a key and wait.\n\nExecutives focused on their companies\u2019 bottom lines are no happier about\ntaking the drastic step to deter shoplifters. Although they\u2019re in the business\nof selling as much as possible, they\u2019ve been left to make the seemingly\nbackward calculation that thefts require them to make it harder for paying\ncustomers to buy things.\n\n\u201cLocking a product,\u201d a spokesperson for CVS said in an email, \u201cis a measure of\nlast resort.\u201d\n\nRetail theft has become a priority for California leaders in recent years.\n\nIn September, Gov. Gavin Newsom sent $267 million to cities and counties to\nincrease arrests and prosecutions of organized retail crimes. A few weeks\nearlier, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass announced a task force focused on such crimes,\nfollowing a string of robberies at high-end stores such as Gucci and Yves\nSaint Laurent that garnered a flurry of media attention and helped further\ncement a new phrase into the zeitgeist: A smash-and-grab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta filed criminal charges against a\nwoman he called the ringleader of a retail theft group prosecutors say stole\nnearly $8 million in beauty products to resell on her Amazon storefront. And\nlast week, the coalition behind a tough-on-crime ballot initiative that would\nroll back the landmark Proposition 47 by stiffening penalties for some retail\nthefts in California submitted enough signatures that it appears the measure\nwill go before voters in November.\n\nThe initiative was bankrolled largely by big chains, including Walmart, Target\nand Home Depot.\n\nWhile the companies work publicly to change California law, they are taciturn\nabout discussing their efforts to stop shoplifters, making it hard to quantify\nhow much more merchandise is now locked up and which stores have embraced the\nstrategy.\n\nRepresentatives for several of the region\u2019s largest retailers \u2014 Target, Vons,\nRite Aid and CVS \u2014 either didn\u2019t respond to requests to discuss internal\ndeliberations on stemming theft or sent brief statements about their anti-\ntheft measures.\n\nDavid Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at\nthe National Retail Federation, said that locking up more merchandise is \u201can\nunfortunate necessity\u201d to combat theft and what he characterized as a rise in\norganized retail crime and violent incidents in stores.\n\nToothbrushes are among the many products now locked behing security glass at a\nTarget in Pasadena.\n\n(Ryan Fonseca / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRetailers know that the additional supplies and labor needed to lock up more\nmerchandise cut into their bottom line and frustrate customers, Johnston said,\nbut some have decided it\u2019s a necessary trade-off to keep shelves stocked with\noften-stolen items such as baby formula and medications.\n\n\u201cRight now, the best approach in many instances is putting it behind lock and\nkey,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThese measures are last-ditch efforts.\u201d\n\nOpinion\n\n### Opinion: Grocery stores used to be my happy place. Then they started\nlocking up the detergent\n\nLocked cabinets safeguarding merchandise are now ubiquitous in retailers.\nAnti-theft measures like these erode customers\u2019 spirits and our social fabric,\neven though it\u2019s unclear whether shoplifting has become the national crisis\nsome claim.\n\nAug. 9, 2023\n\nJoe Budano, the chief executive of Indyme, a San Diego-based company that\nmakes buttons to beckon sales associates to specific aisles, estimated that\nfrustration over waiting for locked merchandise leads to a 10% to 25%\nreduction in sales, calling the cages \u201cthe bane of retail.\u201d\n\nHis company also has developed technology \u2014 the Freedom Case, they call it \u2014\nthat allows shoppers to open cases themselves using personal information such\nas their cellphone number or by scanning their face.\n\nThe Freedom Case, technology developed by a San Diego-based company called\nIndyme, allows shoppers to open locked merchandise themselves using personal\ninformation such as their cellphone number.\n\n(Joseph Budano)\n\nMore than 40 retailers are testing the Freedom Case in stores, Budano said,\nincluding a national chain he declined to name.\n\nTo combat theft, Budano said, companies often scrutinize missing merchandise\nusing individual SKUs, the most granular data possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey know all the way down to which flavor of Oil of Olay is most stolen,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe pace at which things have gotten locked up tells you the magnitude\nof the problem.\u201d\n\nBut that magnitude \u2014 which retail industry groups say has reached\n\u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cepidemic\u201d levels, despite data showing such\ncharacterizations are overblown \u2014 varies by city.\n\nThe Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan research organization, tracked\nshoplifting trends in 24 cities from 2019 to the middle of 2023 and found that\nrates were down in more than two-thirds of the cities. New York City and L.A.\nwere the two biggest exceptions, logging increases of 64% and 61%,\nrespectively.\n\nEven in light of the recent surge in L.A., the rate of reported shoplifting\nincidents in L.A. County in late 2022 was slightly lower than it had been\n2014, according to a report from the Public Policy Institute of California, a\nnonpartisan think tank that analyzed state Department of Justice statistics.\nDuring that eight-year period, only three of the state\u2019s 15 most populous\ncounties \u2014 all in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 saw increased rates of\nshoplifting, a misdemeanor crime defined as stealing goods valued at less than\n$950.\n\nThe report\u2019s author, Magnus Lofstrom, said that rates of reported shoplifting\ndropped in much of the state, including L.A. County, when stores emptied out\nduring the 2020 shutdowns. But the region saw a steady rise in the summer of\n2021, he said, and by late 2022, the most recent data at the time of his\nreport, the rate was at least 10% above the pre-pandemic level.\n\nIn recent months, several companies, including the 99 Cents Only chain and\nTarget, have cited theft or shrink as a reason that factored into their\ndecisions to shutter locations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharis Kubrin, a professor of criminology at UC Irvine who studies retail\ntheft, said that although some stores lock up lots of merchandise, others cage\nalmost nothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an uneven distribution,\u201d she said. \u201cA mixed bag.\u201d\n\nA Times analysis from 2022 found that stores in higher-income areas locked up\nfewer items even in places where property crime rates were higher, creating an\nadditional burden for shoppers in certain neighborhoods. And inconsistencies\nin how locked merchandise is released to customers \u2014 sometimes workers hand\nyou items to put in your cart, other times they escort merchandise to the\nregister \u2014 raise the same questions of racial profiling that have long plagued\nretail establishments.\n\n\u201cThe owners and employees have wide-scale discretion,\u201d Kubrin noted.\n\nSecurity devices at Walgreens are designed to slow down shoplifters.\n\n(Hugo Martin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe scale of merchandise theft, Kubrin added, is sometimes overblown by a\nretail industry happy to pin its problems, which include market forces such as\ninflation and a shift to online shopping, on stolen merchandise.\n\nCrime, she acknowledged, is part of the equation. As a consumer, Kubrin\ndistilled her frustration with locked merchandise down to the same word many\nother shoppers used: \u201cAnnoying.\u201d\n\nA man posted on TikTok recently that CVS was treating a bag of Werther\u2019s\nOriginal caramel candies like a controlled substance and on Reddit someone\nsaid the anti-theft measures should force an entire genre of retailer to\nrebrand themselves:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInconvenience store.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with five employees at retail locations across the Southland,\nworkers said rushing to unlock merchandise for often-peeved customers has made\ntheir slammed shifts more hectic.\n\n\u201cI apologize a lot and I get yelled at a lot,\u201d said a supervisor at a Vons in\nPasadena.\n\nBut several workers said they understood their employers\u2019 decisions, noting\nthat around late 2021 or early 2022, they\u2019d noticed an uptick in people\nputting multiples of a single piece of merchandise into big bags and walking\nout \u2014 boosters, as they call shoplifters they suspect will resell the\nmerchandise.\n\nThe criminal complaint filed by Bonta\u2019s office this year included text\nmessages suggesting that the defendants, who prosecutors say targeted beauty\nretailers Ulta and Sephora, used that method.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not stealing regular I\u2019m going to start filling up my bag quick,\u201d one\ndefendant wrote. \u201cI want to know stuff I can grab.\u201d\n\nRogelio Madrigal, a shift supervisor at a CVS in San Pedro, started 16 years\nago and has noticed changes through the years.\n\nThere was a time, he said, when the main thing they locked up was Sudafed.\nEventually, items such as Plan B and razors got added and then, a couple years\nago, he noticed more people swiping Tide Pods. Now, he mainly sees people walk\nout with boxes of diapers and cosmetics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaundry detergent items are stored in the Freedom Case.\n\n(Joseph Budano)\n\n\u201cIt was happening before,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not as bad as now.\u201d\n\nOn a recent morning at a Rite Aid in East Hollywood, the lone cashier greeted\ncustomers who walked through a doorway lined with security alarm panels.\n\n\u201cWelcome in,\u201d he said.\n\nMany of the aisles were lined with anti-theft mechanisms, including red\nmagnets at the end of metal prongs holding items like eyelash curlers and an\nindividual plastic cage around a $22 box of lice treatment. Some sections,\nincluding all the toothpaste and most of the detergent, were locked behind\nlong, clear cages.\n\nA customer steadying himself with a cane peeked through a cage at a bottle of\nTide and shrugged, settling instead on a small container of Persil, one of the\nfew non-caged detergents, before walking to the register.\n\nAt a nearby Vons, the greeting cards and candy were out on shelves, but an\nassortment of school supplies, including a ruler for $1.47, was locked up.\n\nIn the medication aisle, a woman with a full cart sighed when she realized\nthat one of the last items she needed \u2014 a small bottle of Claritin, an allergy\nmedication \u2014 was locked up. She pressed the button and an automated refrain\nthat, during busy hours, rings out like the store\u2019s soundtrack played: \u201cThank\nyou, someone will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nLess than a minute later, when a worker with a key ring rounded the corner,\nher eyes widened in surprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat was fast!\u201d she told him.\n\n\u201cWe try,\u201d he said.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * For Subscribers\n\n### How the Birkin bag, the ultimate fashion trophy, became criminal currency\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * ### Why would anyone steal $300,000 in Lego sets?
