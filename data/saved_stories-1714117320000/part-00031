The simplest method is to scrape the webpage and feed the\nraw HTML. However, scraping can be complex and often blocked, and raw HTML is\ncluttered with extraneous elements like markups and scripts. The Reader API\naddresses these issues by extracting the core content from a URL and\nconverting it into clean, LLM-friendly text, ensuring high-quality input for\nyour agent and RAG systems.\n\n### Reader also reads images!\n\nImages on the webpage are automatically captioned using a vision language\nmodel in the reader and formatted as image alt tags in the output. This gives\nyour downstream LLM just enough hints to incorporate those images into its\nreasoning and summarizing processes. This means you can ask questions about\nthe images, select specific ones, or even forward their URLs to a more\npowerful VLM for deeper analysis!\n\n### The best part? It's free!\n\nThe Reader API is available at no cost and does not require an API key. Built\non a scalable infrastructure, it offers high accessibility, concurrency, and\nreliability. We strive to be your preferred solution for all your LLM input\nrequirements.\n\n## Try the demo\n\nRaw HTML\n\nFailed to fetch\n\nReader Output\n\n## Reader API\n\nConvert any URL to an LLM-friendly input with a simple prefix\nhttps://r.jina.ai.

It will not\nconsume your token quota.\n\nStandard Usage\n\nUsing the Reader API is straightforward. Simply prepend 'https://r.jina.ai/'\nto any URL in your code or tool where LLM access is needed.\n\nStream Mode\n\nStreaming mode is useful when you find that the standard mode provides an\nincomplete result. This is because streaming mode will wait a bit longer until\nthe page is fully rendered. Use the accept-header to toggle the streaming\nmode:\n\n    \n    \n    curl -H \"Accept: text/event-stream\" https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com\n\n## FAQ\n\nAt any time, press\n\n/\n\nto open search bar\n\nReader-related common questions\n\nWhat are the costs associated with using the Reader API?\n\nThe Reader API is free of charge and does not require an API key. Simply\nprepend 'https://r.jina.ai/' to your URL.\n\nHow does the Reader API function?\n\nThe Reader API uses a proxy to fetch any URL, rendering its content in a\nbrowser to extract high-quality main content.\n\nIs the Reader API open source?\n\nYes, the Reader API is open source and available on the Jina AI GitHub\nrepository.\n\nWhat is the typical latency for the Reader API?\n\nThe Reader API generally processes URLs and returns content within 2 seconds,\nalthough complex or dynamic pages might require more time.\n\nWhy should I use the Reader API instead of scraping the page myself?\n\nScraping can be complicated and unreliable, particularly with complex or\ndynamic pages. The Reader API provides a streamlined, reliable output of\nclean, LLM-ready text.\n\nDoes the Reader API support multiple languages?\n\nThe Reader API returns content in the original language of the URL. It does\nnot provide translation services.\n\nWhat should I do if a website blocks the Reader API?\n\nIf you experience blocking issues, please contact our support team for\nassistance and resolution.\n\nCan the Reader API extract content from PDF files?\n\nWhile primarily designed for web pages, the Reader API can extract content\nfrom PDFs viewed in HTML format on websites like arXiv, but it is not\noptimized for general PDF extraction.\n\nCan the Reader API process media content from web pages?\n\nCurrently, the Reader API does not process media content, but future\nenhancements will include image captioning and video summarization.\n\nIs it possible to use the Reader API on local HTML files?\n\nNo, the Reader API can only process content from publicly accessible URLs.\n\nDoes Reader API cache the content?\n\nIf you request the same URL within 5 minutes, the Reader API will return the\ncached content.\n\nCan I use the Reader API to access content behind a login?\n\nUnfortunately not.\n\nCan I use the Reader API to access PDF on arXiv?\n\nYes, but not directly access the PDF file but via the HTML version of the PDF\nfile. For example, try https://r.jina.ai/https://arxiv.org/html/2310.19923v4\n\nHow does image caption work in Reader?\n\nReader captions all images at the specified URL and adds `Image [idx]:\n[caption]` as an alt tag (if they initially lack one). This enables downstream\nLLMs to interact with the images in reasoning, summarizing etc.\n\nWhat is the scalability of the Reader? Can I use it in production?\n\nThe Reader API is designed to be highly scalable. It is auto-scaled based on\nthe real-time traffic and the maximum concurrency requests is now around 4000.\nWe are maintaining it actively as one of the core products of Jina AI. So feel\nfree to use it in production.\n\nOffices\n\nlocation_on\n\nBerlin, Germany (HQ)\n\nOhlauer Str. 43 (1st floor), zone A, 10999 Berlin, Germany\n\nGesch\u00e4ftsanschrift: Leipziger str. 96, 10117 Berlin, Germany\n\nlocation_on\n\nBeijing, China\n\nLevel 5, Building 6, No.48 Haidian West St. Beijing Haidian, China\n\nlocation_on\n\nShenzhen, China\n\n402, Floor 4, Fu'an Technology Building, Shenzhen Nanshan, China\n\n\u00a9 Jina AI GmbH 2020-2024.
