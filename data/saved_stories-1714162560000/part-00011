To lower its environmental\nfootprint, by-products may be reclaimed or valorized in agro-food, cosmetic,\nmaterial, chemical industries, etc. According to most recent research,\nbreweries have the potential to become biorefineries, as they can extract\ndiverse valuable plant-based compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins,\nlipids, phenolic compounds, platform chemicals, and biopolymers. These\nbiomolecules possess bioactive and physicochemical properties, which can be\nenhanced through recovery processes. Brewery by-products may be utilized in\nvarious industries within the bioeconomy frame. In agro-food systems, extracts\ncan increase final products\u2019 techno-functionalities. Such additives can also\nhelp in creating marketing labels such as clean-label healthy, which can\nfurther attract potential customers. Businesses can gain economic and socio-\nenvironmental benefits by implementing sustainable practices, which can also\nimprove their corporate image. This article outlines recent advancements in\nthe processing and valorization of brewery by-products, ultimately defining an\nup-to-date, sustainable strategy for clean beer production.\n\nKeywords:\n\nantioxidant; biorefinery; application; sustainability; waste; bioactive\ncompounds\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn the future, the food supply chain is likely to come under strain due to the\neffects of climate change, growth in population, and the subsequent surge in\ndemand [1]. Furthermore, humanity will have to deal with resource shortages,\nincluding water, raw materials, and energy. Thus, a more sustainable industry,\ntaking account of the water\u2013energy\u2013food nexus and its scarcity dimension [2],\nis required to meet the needs of future generations.\n\nFossil-based resources are widely used in the industrial world to provide\nenergy and chemical products. These have proven to be relatively cheap and\nconvenient but also, as a drawback, to have significant side impacts on human\nhealth and the environment [3]. Furthermore, the depletion of fossil resources\nis threatening the oil-dependent global economy. In contrast to conventional\nlinear economy, the circular economy attempts to increase the eco-\neffectiveness of products [4]. The environmental damage here is minimized and\neven a positive impact is possible. In this model, the reuse and recycling of\nby-products would minimize waste production and stimulate their derivation\ninto high-value products, enhancing environmental performance and creating\nadditional business profits [5]. As an alternative to fossil-based economy,\nbioeconomy is a new model based on exploiting the resources of plant origin\nand related products. Renewable feedstock can contribute to a lower\nenvironmental footprint, e.g., resource depletion and global warming [6].\nWithin the circular economy, chemicals can be extracted from agro-food waste\nand replace fossil-based compounds to supply the needs of the emerging\nbioeconomy.\n\nLiquid and solid wastes produced by food industries, including brewing, pose\nboth economic and environmental concerns [7,8]. Brewery solid by-products are\nmainly used as animal fodder, which is a positive alternative to incineration\nor disposal. However, this approach does not reflect technological\npossibilities identified by research and the true potential of waste\nvalorization, such as human feed, bioactive compounds recovery, bioconversion,\netc. [9,10,11]. Regarding the wastewater produced, it is mainly treated and\nreleased into the environment, resulting in the loss of freshwater [7].\n\nDue to the large volumes of beer produced, with a global production of 190\nmillion m^3 in 2022 [12], the brewery industry consumes large quantities of\nraw materials, water and energy and produces significant amounts of liquid and\nsolid by-products. Hence, the beer industry may represent an adequate system\nfor applying a circular bioeconomy model. Brewery by-products were extensively\nstudied for their valorization and application in diverse industrial sectors.\nFigure 1 displays the number of research articles published over the years\nthat feature solid by-products, in combination with the term \u201capplication\u201d,\nand liquid by-products, along with the terms \u201creuse\u201d, \u201cbiogas\u201d, or\n\u201capplication\u201d. Interestingly, the proportion of studies dealing with brewery\nby-products that include the application of extracts has increased more than\nthe number of articles solely on brewery by-products.\n\nFigure 1. Evolution of the article number related to brewers\u2019 spent grain,\nbrewers\u2019 spent yeast and brewers\u2019 spent hop or trub with the proportion of the\n\u201capplication\u201d term and brewery wastewater with the proportion of the \u201creuse\u201d,\n\u201cbiogas\u201d or \u201capplication\u201d terms, according to the Web of Science database. The\nmentioned percentages indicate the proportion of articles that focus on the\npractical application aspect.\n\nSome articles reviewed the brewery industry liquid and solid by-product\nmanagement and valorization [13,14,15,16,17]. These contributions are valuable\nfor the valorization of brewing by-products research; however, they tend to\nfocus on specific by-products and do not take a global and systematic approach\nto brewing industry sustainability, e.g., beer production conservation\nefforts, benefits for the brewing industry and strategies for by-product\nvalorization.\n\nThis article seeks to address these issues by exploring the potential for\nbreweries to engage in the multi-valorization of their by-products. It\nsummarizes the opportunity for the brewing industry to lower its environmental\nfootprint through by-product valorization, raw material substitution, energy\nrecovery and water reclamation. This review aims to cover the main solid by-\nproducts of the beer industry, including brewers\u2019 spent grain (BSG), brewers\u2019\nspent yeast (BSY), and brewers\u2019 spent hop (BSH), as well as brewery wastewater\n(BWW). The objective is to focus on the biomolecules extracted from specific\nby-products but also to provide an overview of the potential for biorefining\nin the brewing industry. Additionally, the benefits of implementing\nsustainable practices in brewing businesses are addressed.\n\nAfter describing the generation of by-products from the brewing industry, the\nrecent advances in reusing raw materials, energy and water for further beer\nproduction are detailed. The sustainability benefits of these practices for\nthe industry are also discussed. Brewing by-products may be applied directly\nto other systems, yet many techniques have demonstrated their ability to\nextract biomolecules in a biorefinery paradigm. The impact of these processes\non recovered compound properties are discussed in view of application. There\nare several sustainable paths and technologies available for the brewing\nindustry. As the choice of solution may vary depending on the size of the\nbrewery and economic background, decision-making strategies are also addressed\nin the manuscript. Strategies to accelerate the transition to a sustainable\nbrewery, with potential economic and socio-environmental benefits, are also\nexplored. Finally, a detailed scheme that outlines the paths to the\nvalorization of brewery by-products is presented, along with recommendations\nfor further research.\n\n## 2\\. Raw Materials, Beer Production Process and Related By-Products\n\n#### 2.1. Main Constituents for Beer Production\n\nThe primary raw materials needed to brew beer are water, malt, hops and yeast.\nWater is used in the brewing industry not only for extracting carbohydrates\nfrom malt, but also for various requirements, such as equipment cleaning,\nbottle rinsing, etc. Water must be potable, free from microbiological\ncontamination and with a controlled chemical composition. Malt is a cereal\nthat underwent germination and thermal transformation during an operation\nknown as malting. The cereal is first moistened to initiate germination,\nreleasing enzymes, such as \u03b1-amylase, \u03b2-amylase and dextrinase, and then\nheated to develop its aromas. The temperature and duration of malting are\ndecisive parameters for the organoleptic characteristics of beer [18]. Barley\nis the prominent grain used for malting. Other cereals, such as wheat and rye,\ncan be added depending on the beer recipe. As regards the hops used, there are\ntwo types: bittering and aromatic. Bittering hops bring \u03b1-acids, responsible\nfor beer\u2019s bitterness after the isomerization performed during wort boiling.\nAromatic hops have a lower \u03b1-acid content and are richer in essential oils. In\naddition to their bittering and aromatic properties, hops provide phenolic\ncompounds, which are essential for the microbiological stability of beer, and\nterpenes [19]. They are traditionally packaged in cones and are gradually\nreplaced by pellets or concentrated extracts. Yeasts are unicellular organisms\nthat transform monomeric carbohydrates into ethanol via alcoholic\nfermentation. Brewers\u2019 yeasts can be divided into lager-type and ale-type\nbrewers\u2019 yeasts, fermenting at low (4\u201312 \u00b0C) and high (14\u201325 \u00b0C) temperatures,\nrespectively. Their choice is decisive for the organoleptic properties of\nbeer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus yeast strains are\nused for ale and lager beers, respectively [20].\n\n#### 2.2. Beer Production and By-Product Generation\n\nBeer is derived from plant-based materials, generating solid and liquid by-\nproducts during the process. The general scheme of beer production is shown in\nFigure 2. The milling stage involves malted cereal grinding. After the milling\nstage, starch and enzymes contained in the malt are available for extraction\nduring the brewing process. The first step in the brewing process is the\nmashing stage, where milled malt is mixed with hot water, i.e., in the range\nof 62 to 75 \u00b0C, at a single- or multi-temperature heating stage of various\ndurations to maximize the activation of the different enzymes responsible for\nthe hydrolysis of starch in fermentable and non-fermentable sugars.\nFermentable sugars come in monomeric form, namely glucose or fructose, or in\ndimeric form, such as maltose. Non-fermentable sugars, called dextrins, result\nfrom the incomplete hydrolysis of starch and are low-molecular-weight\npolysaccharides. Dextrins, however, contribute to beer softness [21]. During\nthis stage, proteins are also released and will play a role in foam formation\nand stability. During the lautering step, beer wort is separated from the\nsolid residue, known as BSG. During this step, BSG is rinsed with hot water to\nincrease the recovery of fermentable and non-fermentable sugars in the beer\nwort. Bittering and aromatic hops are added at the beginning and end of the\nboiling step, respectively. The liquid matrix is boiled until 100 \u00b0C to\nisomerize the \u03b1-acids, as previously mentioned, but also to promote protein\ncoagulation, remove the volatile undesirable compounds such as aldehydes and\ndimethyl sulfide, and sterilize the beer wort. After boiling, the whirlpool\nstep separates the wort from the solid residues, i.e., trub and BSH. Yeasts\ncarry out alcoholic fermentation. The Saccharomyces species are mainly used in\nthe industry [22]. Yeast type, temperature and fermentation time are decisive\nparameters for the organoleptic characteristics of the finished product.\nPrimary fermentation, where ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced, lasts\nfrom 2 to 10 days, after which beer is transferred to low-temperature storage\ntanks for one to several weeks to finish fermentation and refine the beer. The\nyeast is cropped from fermenters after the end of fermentation. Several\ntechnologies are available to remove residual yeasts and suspended solids,\nincluding centrifugation, frontal filtration performance with diatomaceous\nearth, or tangential filtration. Fermented beer includes compounds that can\nmake it naturally cloudy [23]. Unlike in craft microbreweries and most beer\nstyles, turbidity is undesirable for marketing reasons in the brewing\nindustry. After removing suspended solids and yeasts, a colloidal\nstabilization step can also be carried out, for instance, with\npolyvinylpolypyrrolidone filters. Conditioning is the final production step\nand produces wastewater and solid wastes, such as glass bottles, labels, and\nmetal products. All production steps produce BWW.\n\nBeer production is extensively water consumptive, with a water-to-beer ratio\nmid-percentile of 2.79\u20134.11 L\u00b7L_beer^\u22121 in 2020 [24]. According to the most\nrecent environmental, social and governance report of the Carlsberg group, for\na water use to beer ratio of 2.53 L\u00b7L_beer^\u22121, the breweries produced 144\ng\u00b7L_beer^\u22121 of solid waste and by-products and 1.45 L\u00b7L_beer^\u22121 of wastewater\nin 2022 [25].\n\nFigure 2. General processing of beer production with consumed raw materials,\ngenerated by-products and associated mass balance [25,26,27].\n\nFigure 2. General processing of beer production with consumed raw materials,\ngenerated by-products and associated mass balance [25,26,27].\n\n## 3\\. Resource Conservation: Closing the Loop\n\nThe release of by-products can have a significant impact on the environment,\nwhich, in turn, represents a cost for industries. One of the ways to deal with\nthis issue is to reduce the amount of waste generated. Moreover, the\nincreasing demand for raw materials, water, and energy has a negative impact\non the environment and is threatening the resilience of the food supply\nsystem. In this context, one potential solution is to reclaim waste streams\nfrom breweries either in the manufacturing process or by treating them to\ngenerate energy, which promotes sustainability.\n\n#### 3.1. Raw Materials Substitution or Reuse\n\nYeast is an easy-to-reclaim waste. At the end of fermentation, BSY cells are\nharvested and added to the next ferment [28]. This process is called\nrepitching. However, yeast performances seem to deteriorate with repitching.\nTherefore, serial repitching affects cell viability, physiology and oxidation,\nthus affecting fermentation performances and beer quality [29]. Performance\nloss is likely higher in the case of S. cerevisiae compared to S. pastorianus.\nThis was recently explained with cell-wall modification induced by repitching\nstress; unlike S. cerevisiae, S. pastorianus can create a resistant cell-wall\nstructure composed of \u03b21,4- and \u03b11,4-Glucan linkages [30]. This practice\nreduces yeast brewery needs.\n\nBSG carbohydrate composition is likely too low for direct reuse for the next\nmashing batch. However, malted grain consumption may be lowered using\nsubstitute material, as shown in Figure 3. One of the most promising materials\nis bread residue. According to a recent study, up to 50% of malt may be\nreplaced by bread with similar physicochemical properties of ale beer compared\nto the control, a 100% malt ale beer. Furthermore, the whole wheat bread\ndisplayed higher antioxidant capacity, phenolic compounds concentration and\nbetter organoleptic sensorial characteristics than the control [31]. Replacing\nmalt with bread has also been tested with lager beer. A small adjunct of\nresidue bread, i.e., up to 30% of the malt ratio, showed higher organoleptic\nratings than the control, whereas a ratio higher than 30% showed lower\nratings, with some taste flaws as salt, yeast and diacetyl feelings [32].\nUsing bread surplus can reduce breweries\u2019 malt consumption and improve the\nenvironmental performance of classic bread waste treatment systems, mainly\nincineration, anaerobic digestion (AD) or disposal [33]. A life cycle analysis\nshowed that using surplus bread in brewing may save 0.46 kg_CO2eq\u00b7kg_bread^\u22121\nemission in the global warming category. Replacing malt with bread had an\nenvironmental savings score, which was calculated considering all\nenvironmental factors, of \u221224 mPt per kg of bread. This score was lower than\nthe savings achieved through source reduction (\u221249), animal feed (\u221230), and\ndonation (\u221228). However, it was higher than the savings from ethanol\nproduction (\u221217), incineration (\u22123), and AD (0) [34]. Some fruits could also\nbe used as a carbohydrates source due to their high fermentable sugar content,\nsuch as cocoa [35].\n\nFigure 3. By-product recovery to mitigate brewery raw materials, water and\nenergy consumption.\n\nDry hopping is a technique that has gained popularity over the last years. In\ncontrast to addition at the end of the boiling step, dry hopping is a cold\nextraction of hop at the end of fermentation or during maturation. This\ntechnique improves aroma-related compounds extraction, but also the oxidative\nstability of beer [36,37], making it a valuable tool for breweries to increase\nresource conservation, e.g., enhancing the efficiency in the use of hops. Hop\npellets used for dry hopping may be reused for further hopping. Gasinski and\nco-workers showed that beers with a hop from a previous dry hopping process\ncontained lower concentrations of some volatile compounds such as\naromadendrene, \u03b1-terpineol, methyl geranate, and \u03b1-caryophyllene, but similar\ntotal volatile compounds, phenolics compound concentration, and antioxidant\ncapacity, compared to the control, composed of fresh hop pellets. In addition,\npanelists described beer with recycled hops as tasting better [38].\nOptimization of dry hopping was also reported with several extraction\ntechniques. For instance, supercritical CO_2 extraction reduces energy and\nsolvent consumption during hop extract production [39]. Alternatively,\nfractional condensation under vacuum allowed hop amount and energy consumption\nreduction. Several fractions with different volatile profiles were obtained,\nproving the versatility of this technology [40].\n\n#### 3.2. Energy Recovery\n\nEnergy, in biogas or in electricity form, can be recovered from solid and\nliquid residue matrices (Figure 3). Solid by-products, such as BSG and BSY,\ncan be processed through AD to produce methane (CH_4), hydrogen (H_2), or a\nmix of these two gases, called biohythane. Hydrogen production may be realized\neither with dark fermentation [41] or photo-fermentation [42]. Fermentation\nprocess parameters, such as pH, culture type or time, must be carefully\noptimized, as they influence biogas production and composition, as well as by-\nproducts generation [43]. The optimization of operating conditions may be\nperformed with the help of statistical tools. For example, central composite\ndesign and response surface methodology were successfully achieved in the AD\nof BSG, resulting in optimal temperature (35 \u00b0C) and substrate concentration\n(18 g_BSG\u00b7L^\u22121) determination [44]. This energy flux can be sold to generate\nextra revenues or used directly on a brewery plant to lower its consumption.\nSganzerla and co-workers optimized dry BSG in AD to produce methane, and\nobtained a yield of 10.53 L_CH4\u00b7kg_total volatile solids^\u22121. According to the\nlatter results, purified methane could generate electric and thermal energies\nin industrial heat and power unit, which covers 7.38 and 6.86% of the\nelectricity and heat required for beer production, respectively. Thus,\nbreweries may reduce their energy consumption and mitigate greenhouse gas\nthrough the AD of by-products [45]. Other brewery high-organic-load by-\nproducts were tested for methane production with AD, such as whirlpool residue\nand end-of-fermentation beer [46]. Results showed that BSG and BSY, with the\naddition of biochar and granular activated carbon, yielded 486.9\nL_CH4\u00b7kg_volatile solids added^\u22121, and spent grain, up to 356.2\nL_CH4\u00b7kg_volatile solids added^\u22121, respectively. The co-digestion of 70% BSY\nand 30% BSG was tested and produced 447.7 L_CH4\u00b7kg_volatile solids added^\u22121\nwith a synergistic effect. With such productivity performance, this process\nwould cover, respectively, 53.9 and 64.4% of the electric and thermal\nconsumption of the brewery [46]. Second-generation ethanol can be produced\nthrough micro-aerobic or anaerobic fermentation. Carbohydrates can be released\nthrough acid hydrolysis with an average yield of 81\u201394% and ethanol production\nof 0.227\u20130.251 L_ethanol\u00b7kg_BSG^\u22121 [47,48,49]. Other pretreatments exist, such\nas subcritical water, enzymatic hydrolysis, etc. Subcritical water resulted in\nhigher productivity and a lower amount of ethanol, namely 0.067\u20130.87\nL_ethanol\u00b7kg_BSG^\u22121 [50]. Biofuel production through algal cultivation and\npyrolysis from BWW was also reported [51].\n\nMost BWW is treated on-site with aerobic biological treatment and rejected to\nlakes or rivers. BWW is mostly treated with aerated sludge processes,\nconsuming a large quantity of energy because of aeration [52]. Biogas\nproduction was also reported during BWW AD treatment. This practice is\nemerging at an industrial scale, with 18 out of 84 sites in the Carlsberg\ngroup [25]. Performances may be optimized with innovative processes such as\nutilizing low voltage during fermentation. Adding 0.10 V appears to improve\nthe performance of anaerobic digestion by increasing the conductivity of the\nsludge and extracellular polymeric substances of cells, resulting in enhanced\norganic load degradation and methane production [53]. The co-digestion of BWW\nand BSG for hydrogen production was recently tested. A hydrogen productivity\ndecrease was observed when 17.5% of BSG was added to the matrix. This result\nwas explained by the increase in nitrogen content, which promoted ammonia\ninhibition [41]. This increase in nitrogen was also observed during BSY and\nBSG co-digestion [46]. Apart from biogas production with AD, another promising\ntechnique for low-energy sustainable wastewater treatment is microbial fuel\ncell (MFC). This system uses microorganisms to degrade organic load while\ngenerating electrical current and has gained attention in the last decades for\nreal wastewater treatment [54]. MFC was applied to BWW treatment, with\nchemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total nitrogen and total\nphosphorous removal of 79\u201387, 76\u201378, 66 and 75%, respectively [55,56]. Other\nworks obtained similar chemical oxygen demand removal performances during a\none-year run. The techno-economic assessment was realized, and the cost of the\nstudied system was two orders lower than conventional activated sludge\nsystems. Authors suggested upcoming research developments such as higher flow\nrate study, low-cost cathodic catalyst material or MFC connection in parallel\nor series [57]. The energy consumption of MFC systems was 3 to 10 times lower\nthan that of conventional aerobic treatment systems [56,57]. According to a\nrecent study, algal biomass may also treat BWW with reduced energy\nconsumption, up to 3-fold less [52]. In addition, algal processes may allow\nfor nutrient recovery, as discussed in Section 5.\n\n#### 3.3. Water Reclamation\n\nWater reuse was performed for years in some breweries (Figure 3). Multiple\npieces of research focus on BWW treatment performance maximization with novel\ntechniques, yet few studies really consider water reuse in their process. The\nmost promising techniques are the coupling of anaerobic membrane bioreactor\n(AnMBR) and cross-flow filtration processes, whose most classical technologies\nare microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse\nosmosis (RO), or the coupling of techniques. AnMBR-treated-BWW processing with\ndirect contact membrane distillation, NF and RO were compared for water\nreclamation. RO and membrane distillation showed similar total organic carbon,\nchemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorous rejection.\nMembrane distillation performed an 86% recovery of high-quality water [58].\nBiologically treated BWW has also been processed with ozone/coagulation/MF/RO\nor UF/RO. As a result, the MF and UF permeate complied with the requirements\nfor industrial reuse, and RO permeate met the requirement of national drinking\nwater regulation [59]. As 30% of brewery water is used for operations without\nproduct contact, wastewater may be recycled with industrial use quality [60].\nVerhuelsdonk and co-workers studied AnMBR/UF/RO system performances with an\neconomic study [61]. A combination of these technologies allowed for the\nproduction of drinking water in compliance with the set of drinking water\nrequirements, with a recovery yield of 63.3%. These performances were obtained\nat a pilot scale on a process operating for two years at a flow rate of\n0.5\u20131.0 m^3\u00b7h^\u22121. The techno-economic assessment was realized with a\nMonte\u2013Carlo analysis with varying operating parameters, i.e., membrane\nlifespan, RO recovery, and electrical energy, wastewater disposal, freshwater\nand sludge disposal costs. Hence, 77.2% of the cases resulted in the economic\nviability of the studied process, with a positive median value of 0.61 \u20ac\u00b7m^\u22123\n[61]. Techno-economic analysis of a wastewater reuse project can be realized\nby brewing industries with its own cost with such studies.\n\n## 4\\. Direct Applications of Brewery By-Products\n\n#### 4.1. Current Use of Brewery By-Products\n\nAmong the by-products of the brewing industry, a large part is used for animal\nfeed. According to Carlsberg group figures, in 2022, approximately 83% of the\ntotal solid waste consisted of BSG and BSY, with 97% used as animal fodder and\n3% as fertilizer [17]. Those practices seem to have environmental and economic\nbenefits that could be increased with human consumption [26]. The current use\nof brewery solid wastes as animal feed does not reflect the technical\npossibilities of the more valuable valorization of these by-products [51].\nSimilarly, BWW contains bioactive compounds that enable alternative methods of\nvalorization with greater value [62]. To understand brewers\u2019 waste management\npractices, 11 craft brewery businesses were surveyed in Brazil. BWW was mainly\ntreated and rejected. Ten out of 11 brewers utilized their solid waste for the\nagricultural sector, and more interestingly, 4 out of 11 were not aware of\nalternative routes apart from using it as animal feed [63]. Besides\nmisinformation, the motivation of producers to embrace sustainable approaches\nwas identified as another factor limiting the emergence of a green industry.\nDue to the various business and financial challenges that are inherent in the\nbeer-specific economic context, brewers seem to be facing difficulties in\nfinding the motivation to embrace environmentally friendly practices [64].\nThus, the brewing sector would benefit from exploring more valuable ways to\nvalorize its waste. Alternative paths to current brewing by-products\u2019 end of\nlife, with innovative direct application and without major modification, were\nrecently investigated by researchers.\n\n#### 4.2. Solid By-Products\n\nBSY is used as animal feed due to its high protein content or as flavoring\nproducts and in human food products [65]. BSY possesses several\nphysicochemical properties enabling applications outside conventional\nvalorization research fields, as displayed in Figure 4. For instance, the BSY\nsurface was characterized as \u201cspindle and pointed egg-shaped\u201d, promoting the\norganic and inorganic pollutants adsorption from wastewater. As a result, BSY\nwas used as a biosorbent of Remazol Red F3B [66]. Another group successfully\nrealized the adsorption of another textile dye, Congo Red, with BSY. The use\nof ultrasound in the desorption process yielded a 100% dye desorption with\nNaOH as the desorption solvent [67]. Besides textile dye, brewery sludge was\nused for the removal of metal compounds from wastewater [68]. Likewise,\nZeolite was functionalized with spent yeast from a microbrewery to recover\nplatinum group metals from an aqueous solution. Authors showed that operating\nparameters, such as flow rate, pH and column height, allowed different\nadsorption behaviors, and thus, different performances in the separation and\nrecovery of Pd(III), Ir(III) and Rh(III) [69].\n\nFigure 4. Novel applications of brewers\u2019 spent yeast and brewers\u2019 spent yeast\nextract.\n\nAnother application of BSY is valorization as carrier material to encapsulate\nbioactive compounds, like carotenoids from pumpkin peel extract [70] or\ncurcumin [71]. Encapsulation increased compounds\u2019 stability and enhanced\nbioaccessibility with gradual release during simulated gastrointestinal\ndigestion [70]. BSY cell wall components such as \u03b2-glucans and mannoproteins\nwere the main compounds which encapsulated compounds interacted with [71].\nBrewery by-products can be used as feed for insect farming, an alternative to\ncattle fodder. Brewery solid waste was investigated as black soldier fly\nlarvae feed, compared to chicken feed. The authors concluded that the solid\nwaste that was examined showed similar characteristics to other starch-rich\nmaterials in terms of how insects metabolize them [72]. This suggests that\nbrewing by-products could be a viable option for producing insect-based\nproteins, which could potentially help address environmental challenges\nrelated to food production [73]. Brewery by-products were also studied for raw\nmaterials substitution. In this framework, BSG use in formulation may add\nnutritional values to noodles [74], candies [75], etc.\n\n#### 4.3. Brewery Wastewater\n\nAs described in Section 3, a major part of treated BWW is rejected in the\nenvironment. Closing the water cycle with recycling and reuse is in accordance\nwith the third target of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6,\nclean water and sanitation. Water reclamation in brewery plants has been\ndiscussed earlier; nonetheless, recycling can be achieved in other sectors,\nespecially the agricultural sector. Indeed, AD-treated BWW demonstrated\nfertilizing action on mustard greens, basil and lettuce crops [76]. Alayu and\nco-workers investigated irrigation effects on tomato cultivation with two\nBWWs: AD-treated BWW with and without additional constructed wetland treatment\n[77]. Both treated wastewaters affected tomato growth, i.e., plant height,\nnumber of leaves, biomass and fruit yield. These findings suggest that brewery\noutput water stream may bring nutrients and water to agricultural fields, a\nprocess called fertigation. Fertigation reduces both synthetic fertilizers and\nfreshwater needs. However, soil irrigated with AD-treated BWW showed an\nincrease in pH and exchangeable cation (Ca^2+, Mg ^2+, K^+ and Na^+)\nconcentration. This negative impact was lowered with additional constructed\nwetland treatment [77]. In another study, soil modification was linked to a\nhigh salt concentration, or conductivity of around 3\u20134 mS\u00b7cm^\u22121 [78]. To\nmitigate this negative impact, Beta vulgaris, a salt-tolerant crop, and\nTrichoderma asperellum, a fungus, were respectively used as cultivation\nspecies and as soil amendments. This strategy decreased BWW impact on most\nsalt accumulation on soil, but to a lesser extent for Na^+ [78].\n\nBy-products may be valorized in various fields. Functionality brought by\nbrewery by-products is often correlated to their organic content, i.e.,\ncarbohydrates, proteins, phenolic compounds, etc. Hence, to suit their\npotential application framework even more, valuable biomolecules from brewery\nby-products may be extracted, selected and modulated with various processes in\na biorefinery paradigm, as discussed in Section 5.\n\n## 5\\. Brewery as Biorefinery\n\nBrewery by-products, i.e., BSG, BSY, BSH and BWW, are a great source of\nbiomolecules, such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, lignin, etc. and other\nbioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds. The chemical composition\ndiffers for each by-product and is depicted in Figure 5. Adequate extraction\ntechnologies allow for the recovery of targeted biomolecules that can be used\nin various applications in food and biotechnology. Recently, novel approaches\nhave emerged where the extraction process may eventually be used to modify the\nproperties of the extract to suit specific applications better.\n\nFigure 5. General composition of main brewery by-products: brewers\u2019 spent\ngrain [79,80], brewers\u2019 spent yeast [81], brewers\u2019 spent hop [14], brewery\nwastewater [13].\n\nA literature survey has been carried out on bioactive compounds and\nbiopolymers recovery from brewery waste streams, and the most recent advances\nare summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Recent advances in brewery by-product processing with the aim of\nbiomolecules or biopolymers recovery.\n\n#### 5.1. Non-Starch Polysaccharides\n\nMajor components of brewery waste matrices are carbohydrate polymers:\narabinoxylan, \u03b2-glucans, pectin, cellulose, etc. Those constituents are non-\nstarch polysaccharides, also known as resistant starch or dietary fibers.\nRecovery of these compounds needs depolymerization, which can be realized with\ncommercial or self-produced enzymes [10], or through fermentation. \u03b2-glucans\nare glucose polymers with \u03b2-(1\u20133), \u03b2-(1\u20134) and \u03b2-(1\u20136) linkages, which are\nprimarily present in the BSY cell wall, and are in low proportion in BSG.\nThese chemicals were reported as prebiotic, immunomodulating, antitumoral and\nantioxidant. These properties allow for the agro-food sector application of\n\u03b2\u2013glucans to develop healthier food [117]; nevertheless, BSY components\nextraction remains difficult. For example, BSY \u03b2-glucan polymers can be\nfractionated from other compounds with pulsed-field extraction, yielding\n275\u2013300 mg\u00b7g_dryBSY^\u22121 [103].\n\nArabinoxylan is a major compound of the BSG cell wall, composed of \u03b2-(1\u20134)\nlinkage xylose and pentose. Outeiri\u00f1o and co-workers focused on the\ndeconstruction of BSG polysaccharides. Solid-state fermentation and the\nfurther use of produced enzymes were applied to BSG with the Aspergillus\nbrasiliensis strain. The developed procedure yielded 57.04 \u00b1 2.22% of\narabinan, 54.37 \u00b1 2.34% of xylan, and 24.12 \u00b1 2.07% of glucan recovery [82].\nThe separation of non-starch polysaccharides and depolymerization is\nchallenging due to the complexity of plant and yeast matrices. Another\nstrategy is to separate dietary fibers from other compounds, namely proteins\nand lipids, without further purification of each polymer. Enzymatic hydrolysis\nand sieving procedures showed protein separation from fibers in BSG with an\n84% efficiency, resulting in an 80.8% (w:w) fiber fraction with a 56.4% yield\n[99]. Subcritical water was recently used for the treatment of biopolymer from\nBSG. This treatment improved extract functionality and gut fermentability,\nincreasing its potential for food and nutraceutical applications [118].\n\n#### 5.2. Proteins and Peptides\n\nProteins are essential components for biological system construction, function\nand maintenance. The plant-based diet proved to have lower adverse effects on\nhuman health and the environment than meat-based products [73]. Brewery by-\nproducts that are rich in protein, such as BSG, BSH, or BSY, can be used as a\nsubstitute for the amino acids found in meats. Furthermore, these protein\nextracts may have additional bioactive properties, making them attractive for\nfood application. Protein extraction from the brewing industry has been\nextensively studied in recent years. Another review paper demonstrated that\nthe appropriate pretreatment and development of new methods, such as deep\neutectic solvent (DES), microwaves or ultrasound-assisted extraction, improved\nprotein quality and yield [119]. BSG ultrasound-assisted extraction achieved\nsuccessful protein extraction (82 \u00b1 1 mg_protein\u00b7g_dryBSG^\u22121), along with\nphenolic compounds (3.28 \u00b1 0.12 mg_GAE\u00b7g_dryBSG^\u22121) [50]. DES extraction was\nused on BSH with water antisolvent precipitation. According to the authors,\nthis yielded a fraction with both proteins and xanthohumol, a \u201cdual function\u201d\nproduct. A second methanol precipitation followed this to produce a high-\ncontent protein fraction (64%) [120]. Naibaho and co-workers investigated the\neffect of enzyme hydrolysis on the antioxidant capacity and techno-\nfunctionality of a protein extract. BSG was treated with and without protease\nenzymes at pH 8.5 and 50 \u00b0C for 3 h, followed by 90 \u00b0C heating. Protease\ntreatment enhanced the ORAC and ABTS antioxidant capacity of BSG protein\nextract and phenolic compounds in the second sediment fraction. The recovered\nprotein fraction with 0.5% protemex contained 37.5% of protein and\ndemonstrated improved techno-functionality with higher oil holding capacity,\nfoaming formation capability and foaming stability and a lower emulsion\nactivity index [121]. BSG proteins were also recovered with alkaline\nextraction. Changes in operation conditions, namely temperature and pH, were\ndemonstrated to modulate protein content and the techno-functionality of these\nproteins, with varying solubility, emulsifying and gelling properties [97].\nFurthermore, based on a recent study, protein can be extracted from BSG\nwithout affecting its fermentative potential for volatile fatty acid (VFA)\nbioproduction. This dual valorization of protein and VFA maximized the\npotential revenue ($37,909.00 per ton of BSG), compared to a VFA-only model\n($258.80 per ton of BSG) [98].\n\nThe main source of BSY proteins are mannoproteins, which are glycoproteins and\nrepresent 35\u201340% of cell walls [117]. Mannoproteins appeal to food\napplications due to bioactive properties, such as angiotensin-converting\nenzyme-inhibitory (ACE-I) effects [107]. Still, serial repitching seems to be\na process that influences BSY characteristics, with increasing protein content\nand diminishing values of ACE-I and protease activities. Hence, repitching\nmust be considered in the valorization strategy [9]. Mannoproteins can be\nrecovered through hydrolysis processes [107,109]. Level ACE-I activity can be\nmodulated with operating parameters, such as hydrolysis time and\nenzyme\u2013substrate ratio [107]. The nutritional quality of BSY could also be\nenhanced with an appropriate fermentation process. The use of\nPropionibacterium freudenreichii improved essential amino acids, vitamin B_12,\nand the short-chain fatty acid content of BSY [122]. Hence, protein properties\ncan be tailored with innovative and versatile technology development to fit\nfood industry applications. The adequate fractionation of proteins with\nenhanced techno-function and health-benefit properties would ultimately lead\nto an attractive final product, facilitating valorization.\n\n#### 5.3. Lipids and Fatty Acids\n\nFatty acids and lipids are recovered from brewery by-products, mainly with\nbioconversion techniques. As for proteins, the structure and properties of\nextracted lipids influence their techno-functions and determine industrial\napplication potential [123]. Boukid and co-workers produced an unsaturated\nfatty acid-rich extract with the fungal fermentation of BSG. The fungal\nbioconversion process reduced cholesterol compared to the initial matrix.\nFurthermore, bioactive molecules like ergosterol were present in the extract.\nWith high concentrations of unsaturated fatty acid, low cholesterol and\nbioactive compounds, the derived product showed potential health-promoting\neffects [106]. Lipid production capacity from BWW with various algal species\nduring 10 d was investigated. Chlorella sp. UTEX1602 showed the best\nperformance with a productivity lipid of 42.5 mg\u00b7L^\u22121\u00b7d^\u22121 and 46.5% dry cell\nweight [124]. Brewery waste may be used as a nitrogen source for media\nelaboration with other food waste, as demonstrated with BSG [113] and BWW\n[105]. A mix of mozzarella-stretching wastewater and BWW was used to\ninvestigate the polyunsaturated fatty acid production during 96 h with\nmicroalgae (Aurantiochytrium mangrovei), with central composite design\noptimization. The optimized condition process resulted in 10.14\ng_dryweight\u00b7L^\u22121 production with 38.9% lipids and 29.8% docosahexaenoic acid,\na polyunsaturated fatty acid [105].\n\n#### 5.4. Phenolic Compounds\n\nPhenolic compounds are specialized metabolites widely found in the vegetal\nworld, which are synthesized for plant defense against oxidation, micro-\norganisms, etc. [125]. These compounds are in a polymeric form, such as\nlignin, and can be found bound to plant cell walls or in a free form. Phenolic\ncompounds were extensively studied for their antioxidant effects and related\nhealth benefits with action against inflammation [126], tumor [127],\ncardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders [128], etc. The clever use of\nby-product valorization processes likely represents a factor for product\nquality enhancement. Phenolic compounds were extracted from phenolic-rich\nsolid by-products, especially for BSG with microwave or ultrasound-assisted\nextraction [88,89,90]. BSY and BSH phenolic compounds were studied to a lesser\nextent as these by-products seem to show lower concentrations of phenolic\ncompounds, limiting economically viable extraction process development. Based\non an analysis of 20 phenolic compounds using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, Cortese and co-\nworkers reported a barley husk (BSG) phenolic concentration of 340.0\u2013969.2\n\u03bcg\u00b7L^\u22121; in comparison, the concentrations were 8.0\u201322.0 and 12.5\u201356.7 \u03bcg\u00b7L^\u22121\nfor BSH and BSY, respectively [129]. The recovery of phenolic compounds from\nBSY and BSH should be integrated with a comprehensive valorization process\nwith other valuable compounds such as nitrogenous compounds, essential oils,\netc.\n\nBWW was identified as an attractive medium for the recovery of phenolic\ncompounds, which are mostly flavonoids and display antioxidant, antibacterial\nand antitumor activity [62]. These compounds can, for instance, be recovered\nthrough algal phytoremediation. Ferreira and co-workers grew microalgae in BWW\nand extracted bioactive compounds with a subcritical water process, i.e.,\n1.016 mg_GAE\u00b7mL^\u22121 of TPC and 0.167 mg_CE\u00b7mL^\u22121 of total flavonoids. After\npyrolysis, algal biomass was also yielded in energy streams, biohydrogen, bio-\noil and biogas, and biochar, which can be used as fertilizer [51]. These\noutputs were identified as valuable products that could sustain the\nimplementation of the subcritical water extraction process. Further research\nshowed that using CO_2 during subcritical water extraction increases the\nextraction of phenolic compounds to 1.767 mg_GAE\u00b7mL^\u22121 and highlights the\nmicrobial safety of extracts [130]. A more efficient strategy may be phenolic\ncompound recovery through a phenolic-rich stream screening. Specific brewery\ncleaning-in-place residue was identified as a phenolic-rich waste stream\n[111]. This brewery wastewater was processed with UF and NF as clarification\nand concentration steps, respectively. Phenolic compounds mostly passed\nthrough the UF membrane and were rejected by the NF membrane. Phenolic\ncompounds were retained according to their chemical structure and affinity\nwith membranes. Some phenolic classes, such as flavonoids, were selected among\nother compounds as single hydroxyl group phenolic acids. Thus, the designed\nUF/NF process allowed for tuning the NF retentate antioxidant profile. In\naddition, permeate was an alkaline-clarified water that could be reused for\nfurther cleaning in place operations [111].\n\nVarious methods have been developed to extract phenolic compounds from brewery\nwaste streams. The suitability of these compounds for specific application\nfields, such as the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries, may necessitate\ntheir purification, thus requiring further downstream processing. However, in\ncases where unpurified high antioxidant extracts are expected, such as in the\nfood or material sectors, phenolic compounds obtained from brewery by-products\nmay be applied directly without any additional processing.\n\n#### 5.5. PHA and Related Biopolymers\n\nPlastic has negative environmental impacts. Biopolymers are bio-based\nmaterials that are promising alternatives to petroleum-based products, aiming\nto be biodegradable and have similar mechanical and physicochemical properties\n[131]. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and related biopolymers, such as\npoly-3-hydroxybutyrate, are types of polyester that are produced by various\nmicroorganisms. These substances are accumulated inside cells when the\nmicroorganisms experience a nutrient stress condition, which is typically\ncaused by feast/famine cycles [132]. These microorganisms can grow on\nsynthetic media or carbon-rich by-products, such as food-processing waste\nstreams. Two strategies are commonly used during brewery waste processing:\npure culture [95,114] and mixed-microbial culture (MMC) [96,115]. Amini and\nco-workers produced PHA from BWW with an added carbon source (maltose) with\nthe commonly used Cupriavidus necator strain. Operating conditions, especially\nthe nutrient C/N/P ratio, were optimized to modulate the biopolymer\nproduction. Indeed, it was demonstrated that an optimal nutrient ratio of\n100:2:15 C/N/P led to a high production of PHA, including a\nPoly(3-hidroxybutyrate)-3-co-(hydroxyvalerate) copolymer [114]. This copolymer\nseems to possess interesting physicochemical properties, which suggests its\napplication as a packaging material, such as a food packaging film [133].\n\nBiobased plastics can be produced from food waste, including beer production\nby-products. However, the bottleneck in this technology lies in the downstream\nprocesses required to have low- or high-grade biopolymers before their\napplication. The conventional use of organic solvents in these processes\ndecreases their environmental and economic performances. Thankfully,\nsustainable extraction technologies have been developed recently, such as\nusing surfactants or fusel alcohols, a by-product of ethanol biorefinery, to\naddress these issues [134].\n\n#### 5.6. Other Biomolecules\n\nAs an alternative to petroleum-based chemical products, innovation\ndemonstrated that a plant-based equivalent can technically be used as a\nsubstitute. However, the cost of such sustainable solutions is often higher\nthan the cost of oil-based solutions. To overcome this limitation, using by-\nproducts as a cheap source may be a way forward. The gap between waste stream\nvalorization and green chemistry applications can be filled with platform\nchemicals, or \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d. Platform chemicals are primary compounds used\nin chemical and related industries for multiple operations. VFAs are two- to\nsix-carbon fatty acids, which are fermentable to produce PHA or biogas. Due to\ntheir chemical function, VFAs are the starting base for the production of\nvarious organic compounds, making them essential building blocks. VFAs were\nproduced through biological routes with the fed-batch co-fermentation of\ncheese whey and BWW, resulting in 30 g_VFA\u00b7L^\u22121 [113]. Short-chain fatty acids\nproduced from BWW can be converted to medium-chain fatty acids with extended\nfermentation time and biogas production [43]. Lactic acid was recently\nproduced from BSG with a maximum concentration of 59.3 \u00b1 1.0 g\u00b7L^\u22121 with a\nsimultaneous saccharification and fermentation strategy [94]. Amraoui and co-\nworkers pretreated BSG with a microwave-assisted alkaline process followed by\nenzymatic hydrolysis. A mutant Enterobacter ludwigii strain was grown on BSG\nhydrolysate, and yielded 118.5 g\u00b7L^\u22121 2,3-Butanediol with the productivity and\nyield of 1.65 g\u00b7L^\u22121\u00b7h^\u22121 and 0.43 g\u00b7g_glucose^\u22121, respectively [91].\n2,3-Butanediol and its derivatives have great potential in the cosmetic, agro-\nfood, material and chemical industries [135]. Other platform chemicals were\nrecently produced or extracted from brewery wastes, such as\n5-hydroxymethylfurfural [92], itaconate [93], etc. Although bioconversion\ntechniques are adaptable and can produce various compounds, downstream\nprocesses for purifying the produced chemicals are rarely investigated.\nSystems that can simultaneously produce and separate platform chemicals should\nbe developed.\n\nIn addition to phenolic compounds, various bioactive and functional compounds\nwere recovered from waste streams. BSH and hot trub seem to be rich sources\nfor biomolecule extraction. Xanthohumol recovery was successfully achieved\nfrom BSH with DES extraction [100] and supercritical fluid extraction [101].\nMembrane processes were used to fractionate bitter substances, such as\nlupulones, iso-\u03b1-acid and humulones [11]. In addition, glutathione was\nextracted from BSY at 7.08 \u00b1 0.64 mg\u00b7g_dryweight^\u22121 with a pulsed electric\nfield, along with proteins and amino acid [103]. BWW bioconversion processes\nrepresent ways to recover bioactive compounds such as carotenoids, chlorophyll\nor enzymes [105,116,124].\n\n## 6\\. By-Product Extract Applications\n\nResearchers recently developed processes to increase the applicability of the\nbeer industry by-products, especially in the food sector. As an example, it\nhas been demonstrated that BSY is a by-product rich in compounds, with\npotential application in food products [136]. A common use is in the form of\nBSY-derived products for salads, e.g., yeast powder. Taking advantage of their\nproperties, recovered biomolecules can enhance application matrices\u2019 techno-\nfunctionality even more than direct application (Figure 4). A salad dressing\nwas prepared with BSY mannoproteins and compared with a dressing formed with\nsoy lecithin. Results showed that the dressing created with BSY exhibited\nenhanced flavor, color and taste scores after 28 d of storage [137] due to the\npreservative power of the BSY extract. Reis and co-workers investigated\n\u03b2-glucans and mannoproteins in the formulation of clean-label mayonnaise with\nthe following different extractions from BSY: alkaline hydrolysis with 1\u20134\nmol\u00b7L^\u22121 KOH during 2 h or subcritical water extraction at 200 \u00b0C during 2 min\nusing microwaves. These two treatments yielded fractions rich in N-linked and\nO-linked type mannoproteins, respectively. Mannoprotein conformations\nconditioned emulsion performances. The BSY extract from the 4 mol\u00b7L^\u22121\nalkaline hydrolysis procedure was incorporated in a mayonnaise formulation at\na 1% (w:w) concentration, which resulted in firmness, consistency,\ncohesiveness and the work of cohesion values of 66, 64, 55 and 51% compared to\nthe standard formulation with 3% egg yolk and modified starch [30]. In another\nstudy, mannoproteins and \u03b2-glucans extracted from BSY with enzymatic\nhydrolysis and alkaline/acid hydrolysis, respectively, were added to bread\nformulation. \u03b2-glucan-fortified bread showed 39% higher dietary fiber content,\nenhancing nutritional value, whereas mannoprotein-fortified bread showed a\nslight increase in protein but with lower volume [138].\n\nSolid-state fermented BSG was studied for sourdough bread baking. Sourdough\nbread with 10% fermented BSG scored better in color, structure and taste\naccording to 17 panelists; however, it scored lower in aroma compared to the\ncontrol, namely bread without BSG [139]. BSG was also valorized in various\nfood products, improving nutritional values of high-fiber content beverages\n[140] and fish burgers through encapsulation [141]. In order to improve\nbioactive and nutritive compounds from brewery by-products, further processes,\nsuch as extrusion, may be implemented before formulation. The effects of this\nprocess on the physicochemical properties of BSG were determined with\noptimized operating conditions. Extrusion yielded an increase of 61% of\nsoluble dietary fiber, protein quality comparable to egg, soy or milk, lower\nsugars and digestible starch. It was considered microbiologically safe, making\nextruded BSG an even more attractive substitution product [142]. The latter\nwas incorporated in the sweet biscuits recipe and commercial fructo-\noligosaccharides with respective 17 and 15.2% (w:w) ratios. This addition\nbrought multiple nutritional claims, such as reduced sugar reduction, high\ndietary fiber and protein source, and health improvements, e.g., antioxidant,\nanti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and promoted intestinal health effects,\ncompared to traditional biscuits [143].\n\nIn order to achieve successful applications, some adaptation processes may be\nneeded for some brewing by-products, such as hot trub or BSH, whose bitter\ncharacteristics may be restrictive for food products. Hence, debittered trub\nsubstituted up to 10% (w:w) durum wheat semolina without significant change in\norganoleptic quality, with fortified protein and a lower glucose content in\nthe final product [144].\n\nActive film packaging prepared from phenolic compounds from brewery waste\nstream showed increased stability in edible products, with performances\nsimilar to those of commercial antioxidants [145]. Recently, a film material\nwas fabricated with BSG arabinoxylans and nanocomposite nanocellulose film.\nThe film demonstrated good mechanical and thermal properties and has been\nfunctionalized with feruloylated arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides or ferulic acid.\nThe final packaging material acted as a UV barrier, displaying significant\nactivity against bacteria and fungi, and represented a promising solution for\nactive packaging [146]. Besides food applications, brewery extracts showed\npotential in cosmetic industry applications due to their bioactive content. To\nmaximize its biological effects, the optimization of the operating conditions\nof BSH solid\u2013liquid extraction with water and plant-based propanediol mixture\nwas conducted. The extract showed antioxidant capacity and elastase inhibition\neffects, mainly due to hop-related compounds, i.e., cis-iso-\u03b1-cohumulone and\n8-prenylnaringenin [147]. BSG aqueous extract showed skin whitening,\ntyrosinase inhibition and antioxidant capacity activities [148]. As depicted\nin Figure 4, the BSY extract may also be used in cosmetic formulations with\nfavorable bioactivity characteristics such as antioxidant capacity, improved\nmitochondrial activity, keratinocyte oxidative stress prevention, healthy\nmetabolite production enhancement, and with no cytotoxic effects [149,150].\n\nBrewery by-products showed potential applications in various other sectors. A\nmass of 3 g of BSY was hydrolyzed in a 2 mol\u00b7L^\u22121 NaOH solution at 100 \u00b0C for\n1 h, and the supernatant was tested as flocculants after a 5 min\ncentrifugation at 500 rpm. As a result, 80% to 90% of recalcitrant rhodamine\nand flavin were removed from synthetic systems, enhancing biodegradability and\nrhodamine removal from wastewater [104]. In addition to irrigation use, the\nbiostimulant potential of BWW was investigated, like with the microalgae\nScenedesmus obliquus grown in this waste stream. Downstream-processed biomass\nyielded biostimulant effects, such as germination or root formation\nimprovement, on watercress seeds, mung bean and cucumber species [151].\nFinally, BSG was carbonized in microwaves to prepare carbon dots. This\nnanoparticle showed excellent optical properties and metal detection\ncapability, with potential in the water treatment and food control sector\n[152].\n\nFigure 6 presents a controlled and successful brewery by-product valorization\nprocess. Brewery by-products can be directly used in various sectors with\nadequate formulation and application (Section 4). The process of recovering\nbiomolecules through pretreatment and extraction can help the extracts better\nfit the application. As discussed in Section 5, the nature and operation of\nthe recovery process allow the tuning of the biomolecule composition of\nbrewery by-product extracts. With an appropriate formulation and application\ndevelopment, this tailored chemical composition affects bioactivity and\nphysicochemical properties, ultimately providing a healthy, sustainable and\nclean label for the final product. This is a crucial step of the valorization\nprocess, as it would bring a marketable message that is appealing to the\nconsumer, as highlighted in Section 7.\n\nFigure 6. Pretreatment, recovery and application steps enable the modulation\nof the biomolecule composition of a brewery by-product. The valorization leads\nto marketable, techno-functional and healthy features of the final product.\n\n## 7\\. Strategy for Efficient By-Product Management\n\n#### 7.1. Sustainable Economic Model Implementation Strategies\n\nSustainable practices in the brewing industry are unlikely to be implemented\nsolely through innovative and efficient process development. When selecting\nsustainable technologies for brewing businesses, it is critical to consider\nthe economic background of the company. The suitability of a given solution\nmay vary depending on the size of the brewery, ranging from small craft\nbreweries to large industries. In order to transition towards a circular\nbioeconomy, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the economic\ncontext of the brewing business. To facilitate sustainable practices, Bonato\nand coworkers developed a new conceptual model for beer production waste\nmanagement to facilitate sustainable practice based on literature surveys,\nbrewers and expert interviews [8]. This model displayed new BSG valorization\npossibilities and their integration into craft breweries\u2019 value chains. Such a\nmodel could be reused for the other types of by-products and help breweries\ndefine a sustainable waste management strategy in compliance with their\nbusiness plans. The authors stated that appropriate organizational adjustment\nin cultural and operational practices should support this transition [8]. A\nsustainable path must align with the business background and size to be\nsuccessfully implemented. Additionally, the sustainability value of by-product\nprocessing must be evaluated through tools such as life cycle analysis.\n\nIt is important to navigate tensions and tradeoffs among diverse stakeholders\nin sustainable development to create opportunities for win\u2013win outcomes and\nsynergies [153]. One way to achieve this is through a fruitful waste\nmanagement strategy that induces shared responsibilities among all actors\ninvolved. However, in some cases, implementing a sustainable waste management\nstrategy may not be seen as a win\u2013win situation by all the stakeholders. A\nrecent study established that a collaborative approach to waste management\ndecision-making was necessary for a brewery waste management strategy to be\nsuccessful [154]. Without a collective effort, the strategy was not seen as\nbeneficial for all parties involved. This collective approach yielded a\nsuccessful outcome as circular processes between actors emerged to handle\nbrewing waste correctly. The shared-responsibility methodology also enabled\nstakeholders to see that the benefits of sustainable waste management were not\nonly socio-environmental but also economic [154]. By-product valorization\nrepresents additional income for the producer but can also be economically\nadvantageous for the by-product user [155].\n\n#### 7.2. Sustainable Practices as a Marketing Tool\n\nBusiness images are positively affected by environmentally friendly actions\n[154]. A sample of 487 online participants was surveyed to investigate water\nconservation messages\u2019 influence on purchase intention. Both craft and\nindustrial beer consumers reacted positively when a company purchased offsets\nor reclaimed water with a purchase intention raise [156]. In another study,\n159 panelists evaluated a cereal bar formed with BSG against one without BSG.\nOrganoleptic and sensory attributes of the BSG bar were scored at a lower\nlevel compared to the commercial bar. However, the mention of \u201crich in fiber\u201d\nand \u201cproduced using byproducts\u201d increased the consumers\u2019 purchase intent. As a\nresult, the interference point considered the \u201cnormal price\u201d of BSG (1.36 \u20ac)\nas close to the well-known commercial bar (1.41 \u20ac), supposedly because of the\nperception of a BSG bar as a natural product [157]. Developing a sustainable\nproduction process contributes to lower environmental impacts of beer\nproduction. In addition, it is also likely to enhance the marketing\nperformance of companies, ultimately generating further income.\n\n#### 7.3. Global Strategy for an Environmentally Friendly Brewing Industry\n\nMany valuable compounds can be extracted from brewing industry by-products in\na biorefinery concept. The extraction process, formulation and application may\nmodulate extracts\u2019 physicochemical, bioactive and techno-functional\ncharacteristics and, ultimately, the final product. These by-products are\nlargely under-utilized and may enhance the social, economic, and environmental\nperformance of the beer sector. A proposed schematic representation of the\nmain findings of the present article is shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7. Valorization of brewery by-products for sustainable beer production.\n\n## 8\\. Concluding Remarks and Perspectives for Future Research\n\nIn order to fit the requirements of a sustainable industrial world needed for\nenvironmental transition, the brewing industry can modify its linear\nproduction method. Recent research demonstrated the technical feasibility of\nvarious processes for reclaiming biomolecules, energy and water. Food,\nmaterial, cosmetic, agriculture and chemical industries have been highlighted\nas output sectors for these recovered resources with diverse applications\nadapted to by-product processing. According to this literature review,\nenvironmentally friendly actions lower the corporate footprint, and are also\nbeneficial from an economic point of view.\n\nSome examples of the substitution of raw materials were demonstrated.\nIngredient reuse (yeast, bread, hop, etc.) for beer production has been\ndescribed. However, research on optimizing and modifying brewing processes and\nrecipes is needed to use new raw materials, i.e., residues from other\nindustries or reuse by-products, without altering the final product quality.\nResponses to water scarcity issues were given in the frame of the brewing\nindustry. The brewing process must be adapted to accept water reclamation with\nindustrial quality, and agricultural research is needed on fertigation with\nindustrial wastewater. Extensive research has been conducted on brewing by-\nproducts\u2019 bioconversion with microbial or microalgae to produce biomass\ncontaining valuable biomolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,\nbiopolymers (PHA) or phenolic compounds. Downstream processes must be\ndeveloped to fractionate and extract compounds. A wide range of applications\nwas reported in food sectors, with the ability to modulate the chemical\ncomposition and, thus, the physicochemical, techno-function and bioactive\nproperties of the final product through recovery. These direct or indirect\napplications have been implemented with food and beverage formulations and\nhave shown to be clean-label, healthy, functional and able to supply proteins\nof plant origin. Brewing by-products have also proven potential in the\ncosmetic industry, yet there needs to be more formulation and application in\nreal products. In addition, just as studies related to food promote their\nproducts using organoleptic tests carried out by panelists, cosmetics studies\nhave to prove that the materials developed with brewing by-products provide\nhealthy properties, are clean-label and attractive to the consumer.\n\nSome technologies were implemented directly in plants as membrane-based\nsystems to reuse water with an evaluation of their economic viability. The\nemerging technologies developed need scale-up and techno-economic assessment\nstudies to prove their viability. Facing the variety of recovery solutions,\nlife cycle analysis would allow for the evaluation of the environmental\nperformance of each process, and thus, be a decision-making tool development\nfor the design of brewing by-products\u2019 valorization strategy. To ensure the\nsustainability of breweries, a comprehensive waste management approach is\nnecessary. Such plans should involve the recovery, reuse, and valorization of\nevery aspect of by-products, including water, energy, sugar, protein and other\nbioactive compounds. The primary goal of this approach is to achieve the\nmaximum alignment of valorization processes with conservation, circular\nbioeconomy, green chemistry and economic viability paradigms. The by-product\nvalorization strategy enables new value chain creation and additional revenue\nfor the producers. More studies are expected on the implantation of circular\nalternatives, but also on its environmental footprint and financial income\nimpacts on businesses, compared to existing valorization ways.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, P.-L.P., M.V.-G. and D.T.; methodology, P.-L.P.; formal\nanalysis, P.-L.P.; investigation, P.-L.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nP.-L.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.V.-G. and D.T.; visualization, P.-L.P.;\nsupervision, D.T.
