Why was a need for it felt, and how would it differ from the existing\nfootwear sizing systems?\n\nWritten by Anjali Marar Bengaluru | Updated: April 23, 2024 11:49 IST\n\nFollow Us\n\nWith an Indian user now owning an average of 1.5 footwears each and India\nbeing the world\u2019s biggest population, it is one of the world\u2019s biggest markets\nand manufacturers of shoes. (Via Pixabay)\n\nA pan-India survey on the feet sizes of Indians was recently carried out as\npart of a larger project for developing an Indian sizing system for footwear.\nProposed to be named \u2018Bha\u2019 (\u092d ) to represent Bharat, it could form the basis\nfor manufacturing footwear in India. Upon its implementation, Bha will replace\nthe existing UK/European and the US sizing systems.\n\nWhat did the survey find?\n\nInitially, the hypothesis was that at least five footwear sizing systems would\nbe required for Indians to be inclusive of various ethnicities. Prior to the\nsurvey, it was thought that people from northeast India, on average, had\nsmaller feet sizes compared to the rest of India.\n\nA survey was conducted between December 2021 and March 2022, covering 1,01,880\npeople across 79 locations in five geographical zones. 3D foot scanning\nmachines were deployed for understanding the size, dimensions and structure of\nan average Indian foot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt found that the growth of the foot size of an average Indian woman peaked at\nthe age of 11 years whereas that of an Indian man peaked at about 15 or 16\nyears.\n\n3D foot scanners were used to obtain the dimensions, size and structure of\nover one lakh Indian users. (Photo via CLRI)\n\nOverall, Indians\u2019 feet were found to be wider than that of Europeans or\nAmericans. Due to the narrow footwear available under the UK/European/US\nsizing systems, Indians have been wearing footwear which are a size bigger\nthan required.\n\nMany Indians were found to be wearing extra-long, ill-fitted and tight\nfootwear. In the case of high-heeled women\u2019s footwear, wearing a bigger size\nwas both inconvenient and a cause for potential injuries.\n\nFor men, shoelaces were tightened much more than ideal to ensure the shoes\nwere not loose fitting. This affected the normal flow of blood for the wearer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy wearing footwear not designed according to their feet\u2019s specifications,\nIndians have been vulnerable to injuries, shoe bites and compromised foot\nhealth \u2013 especially among elderly women and diabetics.\n\nA statistical analysis of the massive data obtained from the survey concluded\nthat a single shoe sizing system could be devised.\n\nRead | What is Ola\u2019s Krutrim AI, dubbed as India\u2019s indigenous AI?\n\n## Why was the need for an Indian shoe sizing system felt?\n\nThe British introduced UK sizes in India before Indian independence. According\nto it, an average Indian woman wears footwear sizes between 4 and 6, and the\naverage man between 5 and 11.\n\nSince there existed no data on the feet structure, size, dimensions of\nIndians, developing an Indian system had been difficult and was never\nundertaken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith an Indian user now owning an average of 1.5 footwears each and India\nbeing the world\u2019s most populated country, it is one of the world\u2019s biggest\nmarkets and manufacturers of shoes. Industry stakeholders also said that an\nestimated 50 per cent of the footwear ordered online were rejected by\ncustomers. With Bha, both the users and the footwear manufacturers could\nbenefit.\n\nBest of Explained\n\n  * How the rupee has 'strengthened' under Modi government\n  * Why High Court upheld Karnataka\u2019s ban on hookah\n  * The UK govt's recent Bill, which could lead to some migrants being deported to Rwanda?\n\nClick here for more\n\nWhat are the survey\u2019s recommendations?\n\nBha proposes eight footwear sizes: I \u2013 infants (0 to 1 year), II \u2013 babies (1\nto 3 years), III \u2013 small children (4 to 6 years), IV \u2013 children (7 to 11\nyears), V \u2013 girls (12 to 13 years), VI \u2013 boys (12 to 14 years), VII \u2013 Women\n(14 years and above) and VIII \u2013 Men (15 years and above).\n\nFor commercial purposes, initially manufacturing of footwears ranging in sizes\nIII \u2013 VIII would be sufficient. Footwear manufactured as per Bha could give\nnearly 85 per cent of the country\u2019s population the right fitting and better\ncomfort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe biggest advantage of adopting Bha would be that footwear manufacturers\nwould need to develop only eight sizes as against the present 10 sizes\n(English system) and seven sizes (European system). In addition, half-sizes\nwould not be needed.\n\nThe shoe last size will have an additional 5mm foot length. The Bha system\nwill also be wider at its girth than the footwear currently available\ncommercially.\n\nWhat is the current status of Bha?\n\nThe Chennai-based Council of Scientific and Industrial Research\u2013Central\nLeather Research Institute (CSIR\u2013CLRI) conducted the survey. It submitted its\nrecommendations to the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade\n(DPIIT), which comes under the Union Ministry of Commerce. The DPIIT has\nforwarded them to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which is the Indian\nauthority to implement this sizing system, for approval.\n\nSince Bha will completely overhaul the existing sizing systems, the\ndepartments have suggested that footwear manufactured as per Bha size\nstandards should be given to users for trial, testing and feedback. Bha is\nexpected to be implemented sometime in 2025.\n\n\u00a9 The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\n\nFirst uploaded on: 22-04-2024 at 14:55 IST\n\n  * Tags:\n  * Express Explained\n\nHere\u2019s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories\n\nLatest Comment\n\nPost Comment\n\nRead Comments\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMP Board Result 2024 Class 5th, Class 8th: Websites to check RSKMP result\n\nEducationUpdated: April 23, 2024 15:14 IST\n\nMP Board will release the 5th and 8th class exam results on the official\nwebsite at 11:30 am.
