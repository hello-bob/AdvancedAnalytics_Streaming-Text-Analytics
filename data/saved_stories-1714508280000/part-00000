Choi\n\n22 hours ago\n\n2 min read\n\n1\n\nElectric charges can move more easily through cuprous oxide crystals\ndiagonally than along their facets or edges.\n\nLinfeng Pan\n\nSolar and wind power are the fastest growing sources of electricity. However,\nthey are both intermittent power sources\u2014nighttime, cloudy days, and windless\nperiods can all halt power generation. Scientists worldwide are investigating\nways to harness solar power to produce storable solar fuels, like hydrogen,\nthat can then be used when the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n\nOne way to produce solar fuels is with devices known as photoelectrodes, which\ncan absorb light to split apart water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.\nHowever, photoelectrodes are typically made using either expensive\nsemiconductors and catalysts that are efficient at generating solar fuels, or\nabundant and inexpensive materials that are inefficient.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Cambridge, in England, have found that\nby guiding an electric charge diagonally through a particular crystal called\ncuprous oxide\u2014instead of along its faces or edges\u2014they can boost the\nperformance of this cheap, abundant material.\n\nThe discovery is the latest advancement in a decade of progress researchers\nhave made in boosting the performance of photoelectrodes made of cuprous\noxide, which in addition to being cheap and plentiful is also nontoxic.\n\nA key problem that currently limits cuprous oxide photoelectrodes is how the\nelectric charges they generate upon exposure to light may recombine before\nthey can accomplish useful work. Much remains poorly understood about this\nrecombination in cuprous oxide, which limits attempts to improve its\nperformance.\n\n\u201cWe actually spent more time reproducing the synthesis process than in\nachieving the first good thin film.\u201d \u2014Linfeng Pan, University of Cambridge\n\nOne way to learn more about how electric charges move and recombine in cuprous\noxide is to analyze their behavior in detail in single-crystal thin films of\nthe material. However, making these kinds of thin films is normally a complex\nprocess involving high vacuum, high temperatures, and sophisticated\ninstruments.\n\nIn the new study, researchers at the University of Cambridge grew high-quality\nsingle-crystal thin films of cuprous oxide at ambient pressure and room\ntemperature. This greatly simplified the process of making them, which in turn\nmade it easier to research them. In addition, by precisely controlling acidity\nand other factors in the growth chamber, the scientists could adjust the ways\nin which the atoms that make up the crystals were oriented in space.\n\nThe cuprous oxide crystals consist of cubes.The researchers discovered that\nwhen electrons move through these cubes diagonally, rather than along the\nfaces or edges of the cubes, they can travel an order of magnitude farther.\n\nBased on these findings, the scientists developed a simple, low-cost method to\nmanufacture cuprous oxide photoelectrodes with a crystal orientation that\nfavored diagonal charge mobility.\n\n\u201cTo ensure the reproducibility of the method, we actually spent more time\nreproducing the synthesis process than in achieving the first good thin film,\u201d\nsays Linfeng Pan, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThese devices showed a current density 75 percent greater than existing state-\nof-the-art photoelectrodes that were also made using relatively cheap metal\noxides. That\u2019s a \u201chuge performance improvement,\u201d Pan says.\n\nIn addition, cuprous oxide photoelectrodes favoring diagonal mobility operated\nwithout degrading while splitting water for more than 120 hours. In\ncomparison, cuprous oxide photoelectrodes favoring other forms of mobility\ndegraded after 7 to 30 hours.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 next area of investigation is understanding why this diagonal\nmobility is better in terms of both current density and stability, Pan says.\nEventually, this work boosting the performance of oxides may find use not just\nin solar fuels but also in photovoltaics, transistors, and detectors, the\nscientists note.\n\nThe scientists detailed their findings online 24 April in the journal Nature.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * A Cheaper Option to Turn Carbon Dioxide Into Synthetic Fuel - IEEE ... \u203a\n  * Artificial Photosynthesis Moves on From Water Splitting to CO2 ... \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * DOE Explains...Solar Fuels | Department of Energy \u203a\n  * Solar fuel - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nhydrogenphotovoltaicsolar fuelclimate changeclimate tech\n\nCharles Q.
