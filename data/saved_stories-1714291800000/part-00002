The big difference with bottlenose dolphins is that these\ncommunications consist of whistles, not words.\n\nEarlier research found that bottlenose dolphins name themselves, with dolphins\nhaving a \u201csignature whistle\u201d that encodes other information. It would be\nsomewhat like a human shouting, \u201cHey everybody! I\u2019m an adult healthy male\nnamed George, and I mean you no harm!\u201d\n\nThe new finding is that bottlenose dolphins also say the names of certain\nother dolphins.\n\n\u201cAnimals produced copies when they were separated from a close associate and\nthis supports our belief that dolphins copy another animal\u2019s signature whistle\nwhen they want to reunite with that specific individual,\u201d lead author\nStephanie King of the University of St. Andrews Sea Mammal Research Unit told\nDiscovery News.\n\nKing and her colleagues collected acoustic data from wild bottlenose dolphins\naround Sarasota Bay, Fla., from 1984 to 2009. The researchers also intensely\nstudied four captive adult male dolphins housed at The Seas Aquarium, also in\nFlorida.\n\nThe captive males are adults that keepers named Calvin, Khyber, Malabar and\nRanier.\n\nBottlenose dolphins communicate through a series of whistles.Getty Images\n\nThese bottlenose dolphins, however, as well as all of the wild ones, developed\ntheir own signature whistles that serve as names in interactions with other\ndolphins.\n\n\u201cA dolphin emits its signature whistle to broadcast its identity and announce\nits presence, allowing animals to identify one another over large distances\nand for animals to recognize one another and to join up with each other,\u201d King\nexplained. \u201cDolphin whistles can be detected up to 20 km away (12.4 miles)\ndepending on water depth and whistle frequency.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said dolphins copy the signature whistles of loved ones, such\nas a mother or close male buddy, when the two are apart. These \u201cnames\u201d were\nnever emitted in aggressive or antagonistic situations and were only directed\ntoward loved ones.\n\n### Recommended\n\nHealth news\n\n### Health newsFDA approves Pfizer's first gene therapy for rare inherited\nbleeding disorder\n\nClimate in Crisis\n\n### Climate in CrisisNew EPA rules would force coal-fired power plants to\ncapture emissions or shut down\n\nThe whistle copies also always had a unique variation to them, so the dolphins\nweren\u2019t merely mimicking each other. The dolphins instead were adding their\nown \u201ctone of voice\u201d via unique whistling.\n\nWhile researchers often hesitate to apply the \u201cl word\u201d -- language -- to non-\nhuman communications, bottlenose dolphins and possibly other dolphin species\nclearly have a very complex and sophisticated communication system.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, captive dolphins can learn new signals and refer to objects\nand it may be that dolphins can use signature whistle copies to label or refer\nto an individual, which is a skill inherent in human language,\u201d King said.\n\nHeidi Harley, a professor of psychology at New College of Florida, is a\nleading expert on cognitive processes in dolphins. She agrees with the new\npaper\u2019s conclusions.\n\nHarley told Discovery News that it can be challenging to study dolphin\nsignature whistles, since it\u2019s difficult to identify which particular dolphin\nis emitting the sounds, and whether or not the sounds are just mimicked\ncopies.\n\n\u201cThis study provides evidence that copies of signature whistles include\nelements that differ from the whistles of the original whistler, while still\nmaintaining the changes in frequency over time that allow a listener to\nidentify the original whistler,\u201d Harley said. \u201cIn addition, that signature\nwhistle copying occurs between close associates, suggesting it is used\naffiliatively.\u201d\n\nKing and her team are now using sound playback experiments to see how wild,\nfree-ranging dolphins respond to hearing a copy of their own signature\nwhistle.\n\nMore from Discovery News:\n\n  * Photos: Sharks, marine mammals hang in paradise\n  * Dolphins create 'life raft' for one of their own\n  * How dolphins stay awake for two weeks\n\nCopyright 2013 Discovery Communications LLC.
