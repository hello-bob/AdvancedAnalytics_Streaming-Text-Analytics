Tried again. Now reading from disk with ATA PIO successfully\n  * Day 180: Took another break. lost motivation. Wanted to do other things(v8, embedded, etc.)\n  * Day 234: Planned on coming back but World War III just started (October 7th)\n  * Day 409: Announcing my return and set a goal - loading an init binary into memory as the first userland process.\n  * Day 417: FAT32 Driver and userland VM works! init process/shell is loaded successfully.\n  * Day 418: Learning about some GitHub Actions stuff because I\u2019m bored and I don\u2019t want to develop more syscalls.\n\nThere are many other things that are still not ready. Like writing to the\ndisk, networking drivers, basic syscalls like execv/fork, etc. I\u2019m not sure if\nI have the energy to get into it tho. This is why i\u2019m writing this blogpost:\nif you want to contribute & make a community out of this silly project, join\nmy discord server and we can try to set something up.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m glad I finally published it and didn\u2019t keep it as another\nproject in my archive. It\u2019s been a nice journey.\n\nTags: kernel dev osdev\n\nShare:\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nExploiting n-day in Home Security Camera\n\nBsidesTLV 2023 - 'Zen(d) Master' writeup (pwn)\n\nPwning mjs for fun and SBX\n\nPrevious \u23ea Exploiting n-day in Home Security Camera\n\n\u00a9 2024 io::pewpew().
