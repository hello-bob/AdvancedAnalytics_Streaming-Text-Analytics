In the Austrian\ncapital, people of all income levels live in subsidised housing \u2013 and more is\nbeing built\n\nKirsty Lang in Vienna\n\nTue 30 Apr 2024 16.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nImagine a beautiful city where a centrally located two-bedroom apartment can\ncost you as little as $600 a month. For many US policymakers, it\u2019s a pipe\ndream. And yet in Vienna, it\u2019s a reality.\n\nIn the past two years, at least four delegations of housing experts and\npolitical leaders from California have visited the Austrian capital, hoping to\nunlock the secrets of why Vienna regularly comes top in surveys of the world\u2019s\nmost livable cities.\n\n\u2018We just need a little help\u2019: how a safe parking plan for people living in\ncars split a US town\n\nRead more\n\nThey\u2019re struck by the absence of homeless encampments, and marvel at the sheer\nscale of the subsidised housing developments which include shared amenities\nsuch swimming pools, gyms, workshops, communal gardens and spacious roof\nterraces.\n\nAnd they wonder how they can bring some of it home to a region gripped by an\nunaffordability crisis that lands long-term residents out of state or on the\nstreets.\n\nLast year, California counted more than 180,000 people living on the streets,\na 40% rise in five years. Housing costs in the state are now double what they\nare in the rest of the US. Average monthly payments for a newly purchased mid-\ntier home are more than $5,500 a month and wages have not kept pace with\nrising rents. \u201cYou now need to earn $200,000 a year to have a comfortable\nmiddle-class life in California,\u201d said Jennifer LeSar of the Global Policy\nLeadership Academy, which organises the trips to Vienna.\n\nThe foundation of Vienna\u2019s success is a housing policy that ensures all people\nlive in dignified circumstances at affordable rents in homes they can keep for\ntheir lifetime and even pass on to their children. It\u2019s not just for the\npoorest but the middle class as well. Sixty per cent of people in Vienna live\nin subsidised housing, compared with just 5% of Californians.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. The US sucks man. Why can\u2019t we do this?\u201d said Ruben\nMendoza, a young activist from Uplift San Bernardino, shaking his head in\ndisbelief as he was shown around a mixed housing development near the city\ncentre with communal facilities and affordable rents. Mendoza said one of the\nreasons he became a housing advocate was because he feared never being able to\nown a home in the community he grew up in. Like most Californians, he spends\nmore than 50% of his disposable household income on rent. In Vienna, residents\non average spend 27% of their income on housing.\n\nThere are some obvious differences. Vienna is densely built, with the majority\nof residents living in relatively small apartments within easy distance of the\ncity centre. Most Viennese are renters, and use the well-connected public\ntransport system to move around. Most Californians live in owner-occupied\nsingle-family homes in the suburbs. Public transportation systems are\nunderfunded, and most residents use their car to travel.\n\n> Unfortunately, in my city, some people think finding room for cars is more\n> important than building homes for people\n\nGleam Davis, a Santa Monica councilmember\n\nBut the biggest difference is how much new affordable housing is going up in\nVienna. \u201cJust look at all the cranes,\u201d said Adam Briones from California\u2019s\nCommunity Builders, a research and advocacy organization working to close the\nracial wealth gap through housing. The city of Vienna builds about 6,000-7,000\nnew units of subsidised housing every year as it tries to keep up with rising\ndemand. \u201cThey\u2019re just building more housing than us. It\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d\nsaid Corey Smith of San Francisco\u2019s Housing Action Coalition.\n\nVienna is the fastest-growing capital in Europe. Half of its residents were\neither born outside Austria or have parents who were, so city planners are\nconstantly anticipating future demand. Until the 1990s, this once grand\nimperial capital was in the doldrums, stuck out on the edge of western Europe.\nIt was once the centre of the Habsburg empire and the cultural and\nintellectual capital of Europe. Two world wars, fascism and the brutal\ndestruction of the city\u2019s once-vibrant Jewish population put an end to that.\nThe artists and the intellectuals had left. It was an ageing city, full of\nghosts and the remnants of a fallen empire.\n\nTwo historic shifts at the end of the last millennium changed Vienna\u2019s\nfortunes. Communism collapsed in 1989, the iron curtain came down and Austria\njoined the European Union six years after that. Young people from across\ncentral and southern Europe moved to Vienna, attracted by the wide\navailability of housing, its relative affordability, job opportunities and its\nposition at the centre of a new enlarged European Union. Since then, its\npopulation has grown by 25%. Today 2 million people live there, and their\nnumber is growing year on year.\n\nNimbyism was a recurring topic during the week-long visit, with the\nCalifornians complaining that often when new developments are planned, small\ngroups of residents try to block them through the courts, which makes the\nconstruction process slower and more expensive. Gleam Davis, a Santa Monica\ncity councillor and former mayor, said that when her city tried to build\naffordable housing on parking lots, residents protested. \u201cUnfortunately, in my\ncity, some people think finding room for cars is more important than building\nhomes for people.\u201d Even within her own city council, there is strong\nopposition to building more housing, she said. \u201cSome of my colleagues think we\ncan police ourselves out of this or build our share of affordable housing in\nthe desert and move those people out there.\u201d\n\nVienna has a more top-down approach to tackling nimbyism. As the delegation\ntoured Seestadt Aspern, a new town built on a former military airfield outside\nVienna, the urban planner Kurt Hoftstetter explained that they had held up to\n20 meetings in the nearby villages before they began construction. \u201cWe did\nthis to inform residents of our plans and ask them how we could make it more\nacceptable to them. But we did not ask their permission.\u201d\n\nTech billionaires want to build a new city in rural California. Voters may get\na say on it\n\nRead more\n\nVienna\u2019s affordable housing system is supported by a 1% tax on all salaries\nwhich provides a permanent funding stream for new construction. This goes back\n100 years to the end of the first world war, when the city was overflowing\nwith refugees and homeless people. The Habsburg empire had collapsed, and\nVienna became a city state with its own tax-raising ability inside the new\nfederal Republic of Austria. \u201cRed Vienna\u201d, as it was known in the 1920s, has\nbeen a social democrat bastion within a largely conservative, Catholic country\never since (apart from 12 years under fascist rule) and providing permanently\naffordable housing became part of its DNA.\n\nThe housing tax currently generates about $250m annually and the city gets a\nfurther $200m in rental income and loan repayments. Since the 1990s, most new\ndevelopments are built by limited-profit housing associations, which benefit\nfrom 1% government loans. They also benefit from building on land sold to them\nby Vienna\u2019s landbank (Wohnfonds Wien), a quasi-governmental body that buys up\nland to build new neighbourhoods with a mix of private and subsidised housing.\n\nInspired by the Vienna model, Los Angeles launched its own landbank in 2022\naimed at setting aside city land for affordable housing construction. And the\ncity passed a new measure increasing property taxes on homes over $5m. The\nhope is that this \u201cmansion tax\u201d will create a permanent funding stream for\naffordable housing. \u201cA lot of people who worked on that measure visited\nVienna,\u201d says Jackson Loop from the Southern Californian Association of\nNonprofit Housing. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting push-back from the real estate lobby who\nare trying to overturn the tax increase in the courts, so it\u2019s in a legal\nlimbo right now.\u201d\n\n> The mayor likes to say that you cannot tell if a person is rich or poor in\n> Vienna from their address\n\nChristian Shantl\n\nProperty taxes, both residential and corporate, are comparatively low in\nCalifornia, said Loop. That\u2019s because of proposition 13, he explained \u2013 a\nprovision that passed back in the late 1970s and limited taxes to 1% of a\nproperty\u2019s value, including for large landowning corporations such as Disney.\n\nAnother key difference is the way Vienna chooses to spend its annual housing\nbudget. Most of it goes into subsidising construction, whereas in the US it\nmostly goes to directly subsidising residents through vouchers and housing\nbenefit schemes. In other words, Vienna focuses on supply whereas the US\nfocuses on demand. \u201cI\u2019d love someone to do a calculation of how much the US is\nspending on housing vouchers nationwide and see whether some of this money\ncould be transferred into building new homes instead,\u201d said Davis, the Santa\nMonica city councilmember.\n\nOne of the biggest cohorts in the delegation was from San Diego, where the\nnumber of unhoused residents has risen significantly in recent years. San\nDiego has seen dramatic increases in home and rent prices, making the county\nincreasingly unaffordable for longtime residents. The median home sale price\nfor an existing single-family home in the county clocked in at $980,000 in\nFebruary, according to the local NBC affiliate, up from $925,000 the previous\nmonth and $878,000 one year ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 10,000 people living on our streets\u201d says Elyse Lowe, director\nof development services. \u201cWe have families living in their cars, tented\ncommunities, and open drug use. This is impacting businesses downtown. People\ndon\u2019t want to see that. We also have many people living from paycheck to\npaycheck which means they are at high risk of homelessness.\u201d\n\nInspired by what she has learnt in Vienna, Lowe wants to start a discussion in\nSan Diego about \u201cre-evaluating\u201d city land. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anyone ask the\nquestion: is the small municipal airfield in the city centre that only serves\nsmall planes the best use of our land when we are trying to put people first?\u201d\nshe said.\n\nHeidi Vonblum, San Diego\u2019s planning director, said her biggest takeaway was\nthe cleanliness and sense of stability in a city like Vienna. \u201cLack of\naffordable housing isn\u2019t just an individual problem, it\u2019s a problem for the\nwhole community,\u201d she observed. \u201cWhat I notice here is that housing is seen as\na means of providing social stability for lower-income communities, and it is\nvery family-orientated. All their policies start from a base of how we best\nsupport children and families?\u201d\n\nWhy are women in California facing homelessness at an alarming rate?\n\nRead more\n\nAll the visitors were surprised by how the subsidised housing has been\ndispersed throughout the city. \u201cThe mayor likes to say that you cannot tell if\na person is rich or poor in Vienna from their address,\u201d says Christian Shantl\nfrom the Vienna housing department. He said the city focused on creating\nmixed-income neighbourhoods with all the necessary services for the poorest as\nwell as middle-class families. They\u2019re particularly keen on helping young\npeople, so those between 18 and 30 still living with their parents can get on\nthe housing list.\n\nThe last four California delegations were brought to Vienna by the Global\nPolicy Leadership Academy (GPLA), which aims to educate leaders who want to\ntackle deep-rooted societal problems. Its CEO, LeSar, said she wanted \u201cto get\na conversation going back home about building affordable homes on a large\nscale\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think that is happening,\u201d she added. \u201cWe had two legislators from\nCalifornia who came here in the first delegation and they\u2019re now sponsoring\nbills.\u201d\n\nHelmi Hisserich, a former GPLA executive who is now director of housing for\nPortland, Oregon, has accompanied all four delegations and says participants\noften get emotional. \u201cWe have had delegates weeping when they see what is on\noffer in Vienna. It tends to be the younger ones, the under 40s who can only\ndream of getting on the housing ladder in California.\u201d\n\nBeatriz Stambuk-Torres, a young GPLA researcher and city planner who moved to\nVienna a year ago, told the group how she used to spend over 50% of her income\non rent while living in Irvine, California. Now she has a nice apartment near\nVienna\u2019s city centre and spends 25% of her salary on rent and doesn\u2019t need a\ncar. \u201cI had a good job and a master\u2019s from one of our best universities, but I\ncouldn\u2019t save because of housing costs and my student loans. When I had a\nmedical bill, I had to borrow from friends and family. I did everything right\nand I still was struggling to make ends meet.\u201d As she spoke about doing\n\u201ceverything right\u201d her voice cracked, and her eyes filled with tears.\nDiscussing housing policy can be dry and technical but the impact on people\u2019s\nlives is profound.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Housing\n  * California\n  * Austria\n  * US house prices\n  * Social housing\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
