This installment is a\nlittle bit of a tangent, but I wanted to publish it now because I've gotten\ntired of having to correct people about these things all the time. I figured\nif I just wrote this out once and for all I could just point people here\nrather than having to repeat myself all the time.\n\nThere are a lot of myths and misconceptions about science out there in the\nworld, but these three keep coming up again and again. These myths are\npernicious because they sound plausible. Even some scientists believe them, or\nat least choose their words carelessly enough to reinforce them, which is just\nas bad. Even I am guilty of this sometimes. It is an easy trap to fall into,\nespecially when talking about \"scientific facts\". So here for the record are\nthree myths about the scientific method, and the corresponding truth (!) about\neach of them.\n\n## Myth #1: The scientific method relies on induction\n\nInduction is a form of reasoning that assumes that phenomena follow a pattern.\nThe classic example is looking at a bunch of crows, observing that every one\nof them is black, and concluding that therefore all crows are black because\nyou've never seen a non-black crow.\n\nIt is easy to see that induction doesn't work reliably: it is simply false\nthat all crows are black. Non-black crows are rare, but they do exist. So do\nnon-white swans. Philosophers make a big deal about this, with a lot of ink\nbeing spilled discussing the \"problem of induction\". It's all a waste of time\nbecause science doesn't rely on induction. Any criticism that anyone levels at\nscience that includes the word \"induction\" is a red herring.\n\nIt's easy to fall into this trap. The claim that all crows are black, or all\nswans are white, are wrong, but they're not that wrong. The vast majority of\ncrows are black, so \"all crows are black\" is a not-entirely-unreasonable\napproximation to the truth in this case, so it's tempting to think that\ninduction is the first step in a process that gets tweaked later to arrive at\nthe truth.\n\nThe problem is that most inductive conclusions are catastrophically wrong.\nTake for example the observation that, as I write this in April of 2024, Joe\nBiden is President of the United States. He was also President yesterday, and\nthe day before that, and the day before that, and so on for over 1000 days\nnow. The inductive conclusion is that Joe Biden will be President tomorrow,\nand the day after that, and the day after that... forever. Which is obviously\nwrong, barring some radical breakthrough in human longevity and the repeal of\nthe 22nd amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Neither of these is very likely,\nso we can be very confident that Joe Biden will no longer be President on\nJanuary 7, 2029, and possibly sooner than that depending on his health and the\noutcome of the 2024 election.\n\nHow do we know these things? Because we have a theory of what causes someone\nto become and remain President which predicts that Presidential terms are\nfinite, and that theory turns out to make reliable predictions. Induction has\nabsolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nInduction has absolutely nothing to do with any scientific theory. At best it\nmight be a source of ideas for hypotheses to advance, but the actual test of a\nhypothesis is how well it explains the known data and how reliable its\npredictions turn out to be. That's all.\n\n## Myth #2: The scientific method assumes naturalism/materialism/atheism\n\nThis is a myth promulgated mainly by religious apologists who want to imply\nthat the scientific bias against supernaturalism is some kind of prejudice, an\nunfair bias built in to the scientific method by assumption, and that this can\nblind those who follow the scientific method to deeper truths.\n\nThis is false. The scientific method contains no assumptions whatsoever. The\nscientific method is simply that: a method. It has no more prejudicial\nassumptions than a recipe for a souffl\u00e9.\n\nEven the gold-standard criterion for a scientific theory, namely, its ability\nto make reliable predictions, is not an assumption. It is an observation,\nspecifically, it is an observation about the scientific method: it just turns\nout that if you construct parsimonious explanations that account for all the\nobserved data, those explanations turn out to have more predictive power than\nanything else humans have ever tried. That is an observation that, it turns\nout (!) can also be explained, but that is a very long story, so it will have\nto wait.\n\nThe reason science is naturalistic and atheistic is not because these are\nprejudices built into the method by fiat, it is because it turns out that the\nbest explanations -- the most parsimonious ones that account for all the known\ndata and have the most predictive power -- are naturalistic. The supernatural\nis simply not needed to explain any known phenomena.\n\nNote that this is not at all obvious a priori. There are a lot of phenomena --\nnotably the existence of life and human intellect and consciousness -- that\ndon't seem like they would readily yield to naturalistic explanations when you\nfirst start to think about them. But it turns out that they do. Again, this is\na long story whose details will have to wait. For now I'll just point out that\npeople used to believe that the weather was a phenomenon that could not\npossibly have a naturalistic explanation.\n\nThe reason science is naturalistic is not that it takes naturalism as an\nassumption, but rather that there is no evidence of anything beyond the\nnatural. All it would take for science to accept the existence of deities or\ndemons or other supernatural entities is evidence -- some observable\nphenomenon that could not be parsimoniously explained without them.\n\n## Myth #3: \"Science can't prove X\" or \"scientists got X wrong\" is an\nindication that science is deficient\n\nI often see people say, \"Science can't prove X\" with the implication that this\npoints out some deficiency in science that only some other thing (usually\nreligion) can fill. This is a myth for two reasons. First, science never\nproves anything; instead it produces explanations of observations. And second,\nthis failure to prove things is not a bug, it's a feature, because it is not\nactually possible to prove anything about the real world. The only things that\ncan actually be proven are mathematical theorems.\n\nNow, you will occasionally hear people speak of \"scientific facts\" or \"the\nlaws of nature\" or even \"scientific proof\". These people either don't\nunderstand how the scientific method actually works, or, more likely, they are\njust using these phrases as a kind of shorthand for something like \"a theory\nwhich has been sufficiently well established that the odds of finding\nexperimental evidence to the contrary (within the domain in which the theory\nis applicable) are practically indistinguishable from zero.\" As you can see,\nbeing precise about this gets a little wordy.\n\nThe scientific method gives us no guidance on how to find good theories, only\non how to recognize bad ones: reject any theory that is at odds with\nobservation. This method has limits. We are finite beings with finite life\nspans and so we can only ever gather a finite amount of data. For any finite\namount of data there are an infinite number of theories all consistent with\nthat data, and so we can't reject any of them on the grounds of being\ninconsistent with observation. To whittle things down from there we have to\nrely on heuristics to select the \"best explanation\" from among the infinite\nnumber of possibilities that are consistent with the data.\n\nAgain, it just turns out that when we do this, the result of the process\ngenerally has a lot of predictive power. Some of our theories are so good that\nthey have never made a false prediction. Others do make false predictions, but\nto find observations that don't fit their predictions you have to go outside\nof our solar system. For theories like that we will sometimes say that those\ntheories are \"true\" or \"established scientific facts\" or something like that.\nBut that's just shorthand for, \"The best explanation we currently have, one\nwhich makes very reliable predictions.\" It is always possible that some\nobservation will be made that will falsify a theory no matter how well\nestablished it is.\n\nFinding observations that falsify well-established theories does happen on\noccasion, but it is very, very rare. The better established a theory is, the\nrarer it is to find observations that contradict it. For less-well-established\ntheories, finding contradictory data happens regularly. This is also often\ncited, especially by religious apologists, as a deficiency but it's not. It's\nhow science makes progress. In fact, the best established theory in the\nhistory of science is the Standard Model of particle physics. We know that the\nStandard Model is deficient, but not because it makes predictions that are at\nodds with experiment -- quite the opposite in fact. The Standard Model has\nnever (as of this writing) made a false prediction since it was finalized in\nthe 1970s. The reason we know it's deficient is not because it makes false\npredictions (it doesn't, or at least hasn't yet) but rather because it doesn't\ninclude gravity. We know gravity is a thing, but no one has been able to\nfigure out how to work it in to the Standard Model. And one of the reasons we\nhaven't been able to do it is because we have no experimental data to give us\nany hints as to where the Standard Model might be wrong. This is actually\nconsidered a major problem in physics.\n\nThat's it, my top three myths about science debunked. Henceforth anyone who\nraises any of these in my presence gets a dope slap (or at least a reference\nto this blog post).\n\nPosted by\n\nRon at\n\n4/21/2024 04:54:00 PM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to
