The term\n\"object-oriented philosophy\" was coined by Graham Harman, the movement's\nfounder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \"Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory\nof Objects\".^[7]^[8] In 2009, Levi Bryant rephrased Harman's original\ndesignation as \"object-oriented ontology\", giving the movement its current\nname.\n\n## Founding of the movement[edit]\n\nThe term \"object-oriented philosophy\" was used by speculative philosopher\nGraham Harman in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \"Tool-Being: Elements in a\nTheory of Objects\" (later revised and published as Tool-Being: Heidegger and\nthe Metaphysics of Objects).^[9] For Harman, Heideggerian Zuhandenheit, or\nreadiness-to-hand, refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception\ninto a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical\naction.^[10] Furthering this idea, Harman contends that when objects withdraw\nin this way, they distance themselves from other objects, as well as\nhumans.^[1] Resisting pragmatic interpretations of Heidegger's thought, then,\nHarman is able to propose an object-oriented account of metaphysical\nsubstances. Following the publication of Harman's early work, several scholars\nfrom varying fields began employing object-oriented principles in their own\nwork. Levi Bryant began what he describes as \"a very intense philosophical\nemail exchange\" with Harman, over the course of which Bryant became convinced\nof the credibility of object-oriented thought.^[1] Bryant subsequently used\nthe term \"object-oriented ontology\" in 2009 to distinguish those ontologies\ncommitted to an account of being composed of discrete beings from Harman's\nobject-oriented philosophy, in order to mark a difference between object-\noriented philosophy (OOP) and object-oriented ontology (OOO).^[11] Harman has\nwritten \"The term \"object-oriented philosophy\" was initially borrowed in jest\nfrom computer science, but took on a life of its own.\"^[12]\n\n## Basic principles[edit]\n\nWhile object-oriented philosophers reach different conclusions, they share\ncommon precepts, including a critique of anthropocentrism and correlationism,\npreservation of finitude, \"withdrawal\", and rejection of philosophies that\nundermine or \"overmine\" objects.\n\n### Rejection of anthropocentrism[edit]\n\nAnthropocentrism is the privileging of humans as \"subjects\" over and against\nnonhuman beings as \"objects\". Philosophical anthropocentrism tends to limit\ncertain attributes (e.g., mind, autonomy, moral agency, reason) to humans,\nwhile contrasting all other beings as variations of \"object\" (that is, things\nthat obey deterministic laws, impulses, stimuli, instincts, and so on).\nBeginning with Kant's epistemology, modern philosophers began articulating a\ntranscendental anthropocentrism, whereby the Kantian argument that objects are\nunknowable outside of the imposed, categories of the human mind, in turn,\nshores up discourses wherein objects frequently become effectively reduced to\nmere products of human cognition.^[3] In contrast to Kant's view, object-\noriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human\nperception, and that nonhuman object relations distort their related objects\nin the same fundamental manner as human consciousness. Thus, all object\nrelations, human and nonhuman, are said to exist on an equal ontological\nfooting with one another.^[5]\n\n### Critique of correlationism[edit]\n\nRelated to 'anthropocentrism', object-oriented thinkers reject speculative\nidealist correlationism, which the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux\ndefines as \"the idea according to which we only ever have access to the\ncorrelation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered\napart from the other\".^[13] Because object-oriented ontology is a realist\nphilosophy, it stands in contradistinction to the anti-realist trajectory of\ncorrelationism, which restricts philosophical understanding to the correlation\nof being with thought by disavowing any reality external to this correlation\nas inaccessible, and, in this way, fails to escape the ontological reification\nof human experience.^[14] Many take this to mean that object-oriented\nontologists see inert or inanimate objects as being equal to humans.^[15]\nObject-oriented ontologists, on the other hand, reject this understanding,\narguing that the claim of objects existing in the same way humans do is not\nsynonymous with the claim that all things are equal in terms of moral,\nethical, or aesthetic value.^[16]^[17]\n\n### Rejection of undermining, \"overmining\", and \"duomining\"[edit]\n\nObject-oriented ontology rejects both upward reduction (\"overmining\") and\ndownward reduction (\"undermining\") of objects.\n\nObject-oriented thought holds that there are two principal strategies for\ndevaluing the philosophical import of objects.^[18] First, one can undermine\nobjects by claiming that they are an effect or manifestation of a deeper,\nunderlying substance or force.^[19] Second, one can \"overmine\" objects by\neither an idealism which holds that there is nothing beneath what appears in\nthe mind or, as in social constructionism, by positing no independent reality\noutside of language, discourse or power.^[20]^[21] Object-oriented philosophy\nfundamentally rejects both undermining and \"overmining\", since both approaches\nhand-wave objects away by attributing their existence to other, more\nfundamental elements of reality.^[22]\n\nIn a 2013 paper, Graham Harman also discussed the concept of duomining.^[23]\nBorrowing the word from computing science, Harman uses \"duomining\" to refer to\nphilosophical or ontological approaches that both undermine and overmine\nobjects at the same time. Harman asserts that Quentin Meillassoux's ontology\nis based on \"a classic duomining position\", since \"he holds that the primary\nqualities of things are those which can be mathematized and denies that he is\na Pythagorean, insisting that numbers do not exhaust the world but simply\npoint to sort of \"dead matter\" whose exact metaphysical status is never\nclarified\".^[24]\n\n### Withdrawal[edit]\n\nObject-oriented ontology holds that objects are independent not only of other\nobjects but also from the qualities they animate at any specific\nspatiotemporal location. Accordingly, objects cannot be exhausted by their\nrelations with humans or other objects in theory or practice, meaning that the\nreality of objects is always ready-to-hand.^[10] The retention by an object of\nreality in excess of any relation is known as withdrawal.^[25] And since all\nobjects are, in their fullness, partially withdrawn from one another, every\nrelation is said to be an act of translation, meaning that no object can\nperfectly translate another object into its own nomenclature; Harman has\nreferred to this as the \"problem with paraphrase\".^[26]^[27]\n\n## Metaphysics of Graham Harman[edit]\n\nIn Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects, Graham Harman\ninterprets the tool-analysis contained in Martin Heidegger's Being and Time as\ninaugurating an ontology of objects themselves, rather than the valorization\nof practical action or networks of signification.^[10] According to Harman,\nHeideggerian Zuhandenheit, or readiness-to-hand, indicates the withdrawal of\nobjects from both practical and theoretical action, such that\nobjectal^[clarification needed] reality cannot be exhausted by either\npractical usage or theoretical investigation.^[28] Harman further contends\nthat objects withdraw not just from human interaction, but also from other\nobjects. He maintains:\n\n> If the human perception of a house or a tree is forever haunted by some\n> hidden surplus in the things that never become present, the same is true of\n> the sheer causal interaction between rocks or raindrops. Even inanimate\n> things only unlock each other's realities to a minimal extent, reducing one\n> another to caricatures...even if rocks are not sentient creatures, they\n> never encounter one another in their deepest being, but only as present-at-\n> hand; it is only Heidegger's confusion of two distinct senses of the as-\n> structure that prevents this strange result from being accepted.^[1]\n\nFrom this, Harman concludes that the primary site of ontological investigation\nis objects and relations, instead of the post-Kantian emphasis on the human-\nworld correlate. Moreover, this holds true for all entities, be they human,\nnonhuman, natural, or artificial, leading to the downplaying of Dasein as an\nontological priority. In its place, Harman proposes a concept of objects that\nare irreducible to both material particles and human perception, and \"exceed\nevery relation into which they might enter\".^[29]\n\nCoupling Heidegger's tool analysis with the phenomenological insights of\nEdmund Husserl, Harman introduces two types of objects: real objects and\nsensual objects. Real objects are objects that withdraw from all experience,\nwhereas sensual objects are those that exist only in experience.^[30]\nAdditionally, Harman suggests two kinds of qualities: sensual qualities, or\nthose found in experience, and real qualities, which are accessed through\nintellectual probing.^[30] Pairing sensual and real objects and qualities\nyields the following four \"tensions\":\n\n  * Real Object/Real Qualities (RO-RQ): This pairing grounds the capacity of real objects to differ from one another, without collapsing into indefinite substrata.^[31] This tension thus refers to \"a real or indescribable object\" encrusted with \"real properties\" that cannot be experientially understood.^[32] Harman refers to this as \"essence\".^[33]\n  * Real Object/Sensual Qualities (RO-SQ): As in the tool-analysis, a withdrawn object is translated into sensual apprehension via a \"surface\" accessed by thought and/or action.^[31] This tension thus refers to \"the multiple facets [an object] displays to the outer world, and whatever [real, withdrawn] organizing principle is able to hold together [those] features.\"^[34] Harman identifies this as \"space\".^[35]\n  * Sensual Object/Real Qualities (SO-RQ): The structure of conscious phenomena are forged from eidetic, or experientially interpretive, qualities intuited intellectually.^[31] This tension thus refers to \"a perfectly accessible [object] whose features are withdrawn from [total] scrutiny\",^[34] Harman dubs \"eidos\"^[36]\n  * Sensual Object/Sensual Qualities (SO-SQ): Sensual objects are present, but enmeshed within a \"mist of accidental features and profiles\".^[37] This tension thus refers to \"an enduring sensual object and its shifting parade of qualities from one moment to the next\", which Harman identifies as \"time\".^[38]\n\nTo explain how withdrawn objects make contact with and relate to one another,\nHarman submits the theory of vicarious causation, whereby two hypothetical\nentities meet in the interior of a third entity, existing side-by-side until\nsomething occurs to prompt interaction.^[39] Harman compares this idea to the\nclassical notion of formal causation, in which forms do not directly touch,\nbut influence one another in a common space \"from which all are partly\nabsent\". Causation, says Harman, is always vicarious, asymmetrical, and\nbuffered:\n\n> 'Vicarious' means that objects confront one another only by proxy, through\n> sensual profiles found only on the interior of some other entity.\n> 'Asymmetrical' means that the initial confrontation always unfolds between a\n> real object and a sensual one. And 'buffered' means that [real objects] do\n> not fuse into [sensual objects], nor [sensual objects] into their sensual\n> neighbors, since all are held at bay through unknown firewalls sustaining\n> the privacy of each. from the asymmetrical and buffered inner life of an\n> object, vicarious connections arise occasionally...giving birth to new\n> objects with their own interior spaces.^[40]\n\nThus, causation entails the connection between a real object residing within\nthe directionality of consciousness, or a unified \"intention,\" with another\nreal object residing outside of the intention, where the intention itself is\nalso classified as a real object.^[41] From here, Harman extrapolates five\ntypes of relations between objects. Containment describes a relation in which\nthe intention \"contains\" both the real object and the sensual object.\nContiguity connotes relations between sensual objects lying side-by-side\nwithin an intention, not affecting one another, such that a sensual object's\nbystanders can be rearranged without disrupting the object's identity.\nSincerity characterizes the absorption of a real object by a sensual object,\nin a manner that \"takes seriously\" the sensual object without containing or\nbeing contiguous to it. Connection conveys the vicarious generation of\nintention by real objects indirectly encountering one another. Finally, no\nrelation represents the typical condition of reality, since real objects are\nincapable of direct interaction and are limited in their causal influence upon\nand relation to other objects.^[42]\n\n## Expansion[edit]\n\nSince its inception by Graham Harman in 1999, many authors in a variety of\ndisciplines have adapted and expanded upon Harman's ideas.\n\n### Onticology (Bryant)[edit]\n\nLike Harman, Levi Bryant opposes post-Kantian anthropocentrism and\nphilosophies of access.^[3] From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention\nthat reality is accessible to human knowledge because it is structured by\nhuman cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the\nmechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He\nstates:\n\n> For, in effect, the Copernican Revolution will reduce philosophical\n> investigation to the interrogation of a single relation: the human-world\n> gap. And indeed, in the reduction of philosophy to the interrogation of this\n> single relation or gap, not only will there be excessive focus on how humans\n> relate to the world to the detriment of anything else, but this\n> interrogation will be profoundly asymmetrical. For the world or the object\n> related to through the agency of the human will becomes a mere prop or\n> vehicle for human cognition, language, and intentions without contributing\n> anything of its own.^[3]\n\nTo counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an\nobject-oriented philosophy called onticology, grounded in three principles.\nFirst, the Ontic Principle states that \"there is no difference that does not\nmake a difference\".^[43] Following from the premises that questions of\ndifference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to create\ndifferences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to\nengagement with difference.^[44] And so, for Bryant, the thesis that there is\na thing-in-itself that we cannot know is untenable because it presupposes\nforms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference\npredicated upon negation\u2014that which objects are not or lack when placed in\ncomparison with one another\u2014are dismissed as arising only from the perspective\nof consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms\nindependent being.^[45] Second, the Principle of the Inhuman asserts that the\nconcept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human,\nsociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of\ndifference as independent of knowledge and consciousness.^[46] Humans exist as\ndifference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore,\nwithout holding any special position with respect to other differences.^[47]\nThird, the Ontological Principle maintains that if there is no difference that\ndoes not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal\ncondition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, \"if a difference is\nmade, then the being is\".^[48] Bryant further contends that differences\nproduced by an object can be inter-ontic (made with respect to another object)\nor intra-ontic (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).^[48]^[49]\n\nOnticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: bright\nobjects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. Bright objects are\nobjects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects,\nsuch as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures.^[50] Dim objects\nlightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a\nneutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable\neffects.^[50] Dark objects are objects that are so completely withdrawn that\nthey produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects.^[51]\nRogue objects are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead\nwander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages\ninto which they enter.^[52] Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by\nbreaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in\norder to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior\nassemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness\nontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human\nprivilege.\n\n### Hyperobjects (Morton)[edit]\n\nTimothy Morton became involved with object-oriented ontology after their\necological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. In The\nEcological Thought (2010), Morton introduced the concept of hyperobjects to\ndescribe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to\ntranscend spatio-temporal specificities, such as global warming, styrofoam,\nand radioactive plutonium.^[53] In their follow-up book, Hyperobjects:\nPhilosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (2013),^[54] Morton argued\nthat the titular entities are defined by five key traits:\n\n  1. Viscous: Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes.^[55]\n  2. Molten: Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent.^[56]\n  3. Nonlocal: Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject that impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, objects do not feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations they produce.^[57]\n  4. Phased: Hyperobjects occupy a higher dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. This means that hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently to an observer with a higher multidimensional view.^[56]\n  5. Interobjective: Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, objects are only able to perceive the imprint, or \"footprint,\" of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the Sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet, global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predated its own measurement.^[56]\n\nAccording to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of\necological crisis but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age\nin which they live.^[58] Additionally, the existential capacity of\nhyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values,\ncoupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter, gives\nthem a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future\nsocieties may become indistinguishable from reverential care.^[59]\n\n### Alien phenomenology (Bogost)[edit]\n\nIan Bogost, a video game researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and\nfounding partner of Persuasive Games,^[60] has articulated an \"applied\"\nobject-oriented ontology, concerned more with the being of specific objects\nthan the exploration of foundational principles.^[61] Bogost calls his\napproach alien phenomenology, with the term \"alien\" designating the manner in\nwhich withdrawal accounts for the inviolability of objectal experience. From\nthis perspective, an object may not recognize the experience of other objects\nbecause objects relate to one another using metaphors of selfhood.^[62]\n\nAlien phenomenology is grounded in three \"modes\" of practice. First,\nontography entails the production of works that reveal the existence and\nrelation of objects.^[63] Second, metaphorism denotes the production of works\nthat speculate about the \"inner lives\" of objects, including how objects\ntranslate the experience of other objects into their own terms.^[64] Third,\ncarpentry indicates the creation of artifacts that illustrate the perspective\nof objects, or how objects construct their own worlds.^[65] Bogost sometimes\nrefers to his version of object-oriented thought as a tiny ontology to\nemphasize his rejection of rigid ontological categorization of forms of being,\nincluding distinctions between \"real\" and \"fictional\" objects.^[61] Bogost's\nobject-oriented phenomenology has helped shape the budding field of \"platform\nstudies\",^[66]^[67] which seeks to \"investigate the relationships between the\nhardware and software design of computing systems and the creative works\nproduced on those systems\".^[68]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nSome commentators contend that object-oriented ontology degrades meaning by\nplacing humans and objects on equal footing. Matthew David Segall has argued\nthat object-oriented philosophers should explore the theological and\nanthropological implications of their ideas in order to avoid \"slipping into\nthe nihilism of some speculative realists, where human values are a fluke in\nan uncaring and fundamentally entropic universe\".^[15]\n\nOther critical commentators such as David Berry and Alexander Galloway have\ncommented on the historical situatedness of an ontology that mirrors\ncomputational processes and even the metaphors and language of\ncomputation.^[69]^[70] Pancomputationalism and digital physics explore these\nideas further.\n\nJoshua Simon contextualized the rise of popularity of the theory in\ncontemporary art circles as a variation on commodity fetishism - a return to\nthe primacy of the object, in a post-2008 art market.^[71]\n\nRein Raud has argued that object-oriented ontology fails to attain one of its\nproclaimed goals, namely the rejection of anthropocentrism because the\n\"objects\" it discusses are always just those that the human cognitive\napparatus readily perceives or the human mind conceptualizes.^[72]\n\nCultural critic Steven Shaviro has criticized object-oriented ontology as too\ndismissive of process philosophy. According to Shaviro, the process\nphilosophies of Alfred North Whitehead, Gilbert Simondon, and Gilles Deleuze\naccount for how objects come into existence and endure over time, in contrast\nto the view that objects \"are already there\" taken by object-oriented\napproaches.^[73] Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that\nWhitehead, Simondon, and Iain Hamilton Grant undermine objects by positing\nobjects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the\nantecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the\n\"plurality of actually existing objects\", rather than a single substance of\nwhich objects are mere epiphenomena.^[73]\n\nPhilosopher Peter Wolfendale has a book-length criticism of object-oriented\nontology, arguing it is unable to deliver on its promise of non-correlationist\nphilosophy.^[74] \"Instead, Wolfendale claims, Harman is merely an eccentric\ncorrelationist, who promises the world but gives us only a panoply of\ngestures, a masquerade of allusions in which the possibility of making any\ntrue statement about the world is permanently withheld.\"^[75]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Harman (2002), p. 2.\n  2. ^ Harman (2017), p. 56.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Bryant, Levi (12 January 2010). \"Onticology\u2013A Manifesto for Object-Oriented Ontology, Part 1\".
