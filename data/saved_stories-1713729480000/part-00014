What's interesting\nis that he decided to become a developer at the age of 38. This post shares\nhis story and I hope you find it as inspiring as I did!\n\nInterview 11 min read Apr 19, 2024\n\nMost traditional interviews are focused on celebrities or popular\npersonalities. However, I am more interested in interviews with hidden gems,\nunknown figures doing solid work, folks overcoming challenges just to be on\nthe same playground as everyone else.\n\nHence, I wanted to start featuring some of them on this blog, providing a\nplatform for sharing their compelling stories and valuable lessons. While they\nmay not be on the covers of major publications or appearing on popular\npodcasts, their stories, backgrounds and experiences are nonetheless\nfascinating and worthy of a read.\n\nThis post shares the story of Pedro David Garcia Lopez, who switched careers\nfrom being a Lorry driver to a Ruby on Rails developer at the age of 38, an\nage that many folks in the software industry consider to be too old (which is\nnonsense!). I came across Pedro on LinkedIn and found his story really\ninspiring.\n\nThe main thing I want you to get from this post is: It's never too late to\npursue your dreams, especially to start learning to program. It can unlock\nhuge opportunities if done right.\n\nWith that, let's hear Pedro's story. I hope you find it as inspiring as I did.\n\nPedro David Garcia Lopez\n\n### Q. Can you tell us a little about yourself?\n\nI am a 42-year-old Spaniard who moved to the UK in 2015, but I am now\nreturning to my country to be closer to family, which I consider one of the\nmost important things in life.\n\nI came to the UK in 2015 as a lorry driver, which was a tough decision. As a\nlorry driver, I spent more time in the UK than at home. Typically, I would\nspend around 4-6 days at home each month, and the rest of the time, I was on\nthe road, travelling between the UK and other parts of Europe. I decided to\nmove to the UK to embrace new opportunities and allow my daughter to do the\nsame. Additionally, I wanted to learn English properly, which I'm still\nworking on.\n\nAs a professional driver, I have driven almost every type of vehicle on the\nroad, and I have travelled to all the EU countries on the continent at least\nonce. In fact, I cover enough KM in my lorry to circle the world several times\nover.\n\nAs a developer, I fell in love with Ruby and Ruby on Rails the first time I\nlearned about them. I plan to stick with them until it is still possible, as I\ndon\u2019t think anything similar is out there regarding developer happiness and\nproductivity (opinion from my small watchtower!); I worked with PHP for a\nsmall period as well as JS (many flavours), but nothing comes close to Rails\nand Ruby.\n\nI consider myself a full-stack developer as I have good skills in CSS, good\nattention to detail in the front end, and some notion of UI/UX, but there is\nalways room to improve in those areas. I also love working in the backend.\nBasically, I'm a Master of none \ud83d\ude1c.\n\n### Q. How did you get into programming?\n\nWell, this is an excellent question and quite long to answer.\n\nMy first interaction with a computer was when I was around 12 years old as\npart of a typing course that summer when we moved from more advanced setups to\na computer, sometimes working on MS-DOS or Windows 3.1. Since that day, I have\nbeen fascinated by those wizard machines.\n\nComing from a modest family, the chances of having a computer were low. Still,\nthe death of my father at the age of 14 and the need to start working to\nsupport my family at the same time as studying put them at the level of\nfinding a unicorn. Still, my love for computers never disappeared, and I never\nmissed an opportunity to play with them at school or the library.\n\nThat was until, at the age of 18, I went to full-time work, and with three\nmonths of saving, I bought my first computer, a Pentium II; having a computer\nin my hands now, I started to feel the need to know how to program it.\n\nPhoto Credits: Midnight Geek (YouTube)\n\nSo I bought a book to learn C++, which was a big mistake, as it was too\ntechnical and a deep book. I got really confused, and I could never do\nanything interesting at all. Then life took over. I never really went into\nprogramming, but years passed, and I became a lorry driver by need and came\nhere to the UK.\n\nBut, I still had a passion for computers and being good at them.\n\nWith my English skills improving and the easily accessible information out\nthere, at some point, my little child's dream called to the door again.\n\nI took a few YouTube courses here and there, HTML, CSS, JS, the typical course\nof \"Become a programmer in 7 days\" kind of things, then I discovered\nfreeCodeCamp, that was a bit more structured and serious, but still I found\nthat I was missing something. My long hours as a lorry driver and doing my\nduties as a dad and a husband didn\u2019t allow me real serious time and pace to\nbecome a developer.\n\nSo, after all those years of hard work and caring for my family, I decided to\npursue my childhood dream of becoming a developer. I quit my stable job and\ndecided to try one year to become a developer or return to my life and scrap\nthis idea forever.\n\nIn September 2019, I started my adventure, but what path should I follow?\nThere are too many: Python, JavaScript (which was trending), C#, PHP,\nfrontend, backend, DevOps, etc. There are way too many to pick just one if it\nis not right.\n\nSo, I decided to learn Python and buy some Udemy courses (there were too\nmany!) to learn the basics. It wasn't as bad as my C++ experience but didn't\nquite click. I could follow but not create, so quickly I realized that that\nwould not work for me.\n\nI was losing a bit of faith, but after doing some research, I came across the\nconcept of Coding Bootcamps. After some back and forth to make that decision\n(all options were expensive \ud83d\udcb0), I decided to join Flatiron School. If you\ncouldn't secure a job after completing their course, you didn't have to pay\nthem anything. It made me feel that I had little to lose in that sense.\n\nSo there I learned about Ruby and its basics. I also learned software\ndevelopment in a structured way, from Ruby and Sinatra, to Ruby on Rails and\nReact. All supported by teachers, colleges, and good assignments and exercises\nto make you not only follow, but also create new things.\n\nThe sense of pride and accomplishment I felt after completing my first\nprojects was unforgettable, so by the end of May 2020, I graduated from the\ncourse with a sense that I could actually do it. I felt like I knew things\nnow; I do not just know things; but I know how to figure things out and how to\nlearn new things on my own.\n\nBy the way, do you know what happened in 2020? Yes, it was COVID.\n\nI had to start finding a new job in those circumstances. The lockdown was\nstill around, so there was no interview or chance to connect with people; a\n38-year-old man with no experience and fresh for a Bootcamp doesn\u2019t seem like\nthe ideal hiring candidate companies were looking for...\n\nEven with post-graduate support from Flatiron, things were tough. Not a single\ninterview or call for months; I was feeling quite anxious about my CV,\nwondering if it was just going to end up in the bin, but I felt that I could\ndo it, and my passion was higher than ever. I didn\u2019t want to go back to\ndriving.\n\nFinally, the first opportunity arose in Manchester, two hours away from my\nhome by Train (no Work-From-Home policy) and a salary that was 1/3rd of my\nsalary as a lorry driver, most of which went to pay for the Train... working\nwith PHP and jQuery, but you know what, I didn\u2019t care about any of that as it\nwas my dream. I accepted that offer; I had to start somewhere, and if life has\ntaught me something, it is that with hard work, everything is possible.\n\n### Q. How and when did you come across Ruby and Rails? What do you most like\nabout them both?\n\nI first learned about Ruby and Rails through the Bootcamp, but working at\nSuperbyte, I gained more experience with them.\n\nAt Superbyte, we used a non-standard stack (Mongoid and some React), but I\nlearned a lot from the team and gained a lot of experience.\n\nMy passion for it grew stronger after gaining professional experience with\nRuby on Rails. Everything becomes much easier to handle once you get familiar\nwith its conventions. I find the community and the constantly evolving\necosystem to be the most appealing aspects of it.\n\nI am excited to move on from React and embrace the fresh air of the Hotwire\necosystem, which allows me to handle everything the Rails way.\n\n### Q. 5 programming books that meant most to you, and why?\n\nI didn\u2019t have the time or passion to read technical books until later in my\nsmall career, when I noticed all the gaps I had in many areas, so I haven\u2019t\nread many, to give a good list of the ones meant the most to me. Too many\nstill to read.\n\nBut my list with no specific order will be:\n\n  * Layered Design for Ruby on Rails Applications, by Vladimir Dementyev\n\n  * Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs\n\n  * Ruby Under a Microscope by Pat Shaughnessy\n\n  * Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz\n\nI should revisit some of them as my perspective and way of seeing things are\nstill in progress and constantly evolving. I am still on a learning adventure\nfor all these principles that other people from a more traditional background\nhave learned while I\u2019m still discovering them.\n\n### Q. Who are your programming heroes?\n\nI greatly admire individuals who possess the skill to program and a passion\nfor it. Those who go further by sharing their knowledge and experiences with\nthe world truly stand out as heroes. Their willingness to educate others and\ncontribute to the programming community's collective growth is commendable and\ninspiring.\n\nSpecial mention to Quincy Larson, freeCodeCamp and all the content creators\nlike you who put a lot of time and effort into sharing.\n\nOn the personal Avi Flombaum, one of my Teachers at Flatiron School. He shares\namazing content on his blog, and every person I have worked with has taken the\ntime not just to help me but also to help me grow as a developer and as a\nperson.\n\n### Q. What does your typical day look like as a developer? What do you like\nthe most about your current work?\n\nIn my short career, I have worked in all setups, from fully WFH to hybrid, to\nworking five days in the office.\n\nNow that I plan to return to Spain, my new job will be fully remote. I\u2019m\ntransitioning to a new Role in gocertify in mid-April, so I am unsure what my\nday will look like.\n\nIn my role at Superbyte, I transitioned from Junior Developer to a more semi-\nsenior role, where I was involved in writing code, conceptual designs, and\nsome R&D.\n\nMost of the time, I write code but also enjoy pair programming sometimes with\nothers and review PRs. I love to teach as I think it is the best way to learn\nany concept, so I am always keen to help my peers suggest new approaches or\nlearn from them.\n\n### Q. What resources and practices do you recommend for learning and keeping\nup to date?\n\n> Learn how to learn.\n\nEveryone is different and has different ways to learn and retain what has been\nlearned.\n\nI advise learning how to learn and find what works best for you. I learn by\ndoing or watching a tutorial and trying to replicate or go beyond the tutorial\nin the areas I want to learn. Like books, I read them first, no coding, and\nthen I read them again more like a guide than a following.\n\nOne important thing is to not feel like you must learn everything. Not\neveryone needs to know everything. Take something you like and focus on that\nthing. It will take you further than trying to learn too many things and\nending up just spending a lot of time fake-learning.\n\n### Q. What advice do you have for new programmers?\n\n> The silliest question is the one that is not asked.\n\nWork hard, be bold and ask questions. The silliest question is the one that is\nnot asked. Don\u2019t feel like you are not good enough or you know too little.\nEveryone eventually has been in the same situation at some point, so keep it\ngoing.\n\nLearn Ruby and Rails. You will find it not just easy, but also enjoyable, once\nyou get to the turning point.\n\nAnother good thing is to find a mentor or someone who is keen to help you\ngrow. There is a good possible resource for that: https://firstrubyfriend.org/\n\nFor me, it is all about passion; it was a hobby, but now it is my job.\n\n\"If you find a job you love, you\u2019ll never work again...\"\u2014 Winston Churchill\n\n### Q. Tools of the trade - What are some of your favourite software programs\nin your day-to-day work?\n\n  * Code editor: VS Code\n  * Database GUI: MongoDB Compass\n  * Terminal: iTerm with \u2018oh my zsh\u2019\n  * Browser: Chrome\n  * Notes and Project Management: Apple Notes, VScode markdown, Github projects/issues\n  * Communication: Microsoft Teams.\n\n### Q. What\u2019s the best way for people to connect with you?\n\nI\u2019m not really active in socials, but I always keep an eye on LinkedIn.\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter/X:\n\nI just found out that my old personal website, which I had written with\nDjango, is down as the free host I hosted it on is no longer available, so it\nis a good opportunity to rebuild it in Ruby on Rails and start my blog\nwww.lorrydriveloper.com which, I hope, will be up and running soon.\n\nThat's a wrap.
