Eye movement desensitization\nand reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an empirically validated treatment for\ntrauma, including such negative life experiences as commonly present in\nmedical practice. The positive therapeutic outcomes rapidly achieved without\nhomework or detailed description of the disturbing event offer the medical\ncommunity an efficient treatment approach with a wide range of applications.\n\n### Methods:\n\nAll randomized studies and significant clinical reports related to EMDR\ntherapy for treating the experiential basis of both psychological and somatic\ndisorders are reviewed. Also reviewed are the recent studies evaluating the\neye movement component of the therapy, which has been posited to contribute to\nthe rapid improvement attributable to EMDR treatment.\n\n### Results:\n\nTwenty-four randomized controlled trials support the positive effects of EMDR\ntherapy in the treatment of emotional trauma and other adverse life\nexperiences relevant to clinical practice. Seven of 10 studies reported EMDR\ntherapy to be more rapid and/or more effective than trauma-focused cognitive\nbehavioral therapy. Twelve randomized studies of the eye movement component\nnoted rapid decreases in negative emotions and/or vividness of disturbing\nimages, with an additional 8 reporting a variety of other memory effects.\nNumerous other evaluations document that EMDR therapy provides relief from a\nvariety of somatic complaints.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nEMDR therapy provides physicians and other clinicians with an efficient\napproach to address psychological and physiologic symptoms stemming from\nadverse life experiences. Clinicians should therefore evaluate patients for\nexperiential contributors to clinical manifestations.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Introduction\n\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)^1 is an empirically\nvalidated psychotherapy approach that medical personnel can employ to treat\nthe sequelae of psychological trauma and other negative life experiences. Its\nability to rapidly treat unprocessed memories of these adverse experiences has\nimportant implications for the medical community, as they appear to be the\nfoundation for an array of clinical symptoms. Clinical applications of EMDR\ninclude a wide variety of psychological problems affecting patients and family\nmembers, as well as stress-induced physical disorders and medically\nunexplained symptoms. The frequent ability of EMDR to bring about substantial\nimprovement in short periods of time has relevance to major current problems\nin medical practice such as increasing patient load and the cost of medical\ncare. The therapy procedures can be used by qualified medical personnel to\nimprove comfort levels and functionality in managing some of their most\ndifficult cases in everyday practice.\n\nEMDR therapy was introduced in 1989 with the publication of a randomized\ncontrolled trial (RCT)^2 evaluating its effects with trauma victims. The same\nyear, the first RCTs on trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and\npsychodynamic therapy were published.^3^,^4 In 2008, an Institute of Medicine\nreport^5 stated that more research was needed to determine the efficacy of\nEMDR, cognitive therapy, and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD); psychodynamic therapy and hypnotherapy were not\nconsidered because of the paucity of relevant evidence (one study each).\nHowever, since that time additional EMDR therapy RCTs with PTSD participants\nhave been published, and this therapy is recommended as an effective treatment\nfor trauma victims by numerous organizations, including the American\nPsychiatric Association,^6 Department of Defense,^7 and World Health\nOrganization.^8 Although meta-analyses report comparable effect sizes for CBT\nand EMDR therapy^9^,^10 and both are considered \u201chighly efficacious in\nreducing PTSD symptoms,\u201d^10p225 there are significant differences between the\ntwo treatments. As noted in the World Health Organization\u2019s 2013 Guidelines\nfor the Management of Conditions That Are Specifically Related to Stress,^8\nwhereas both therapies are recommended for PTSD treatment in children,\nadolescents, and adults, \u201cLike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR therapy aims to\nreduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive cognitions related to the\ntraumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve a)\ndetailed descriptions of the event, b) direct challenging of beliefs, c)\nextended exposure, or d) homework.\u201d^8p1\n\nTwenty-nine RCTs have evaluated EMDR therapy as a trauma treatment. Excluding\n4 RCTs determined by the International Society for Traumatic Stress Practice\nGuidelines Taskforce^11 to have provided insufficient treatment doses,\nfidelity, or both, the remaining 25 studies have created a strong knowledge\nbase. Twenty-four RCTs support the use of EMDR therapy with a wide range of\ntrauma populations (see meta-analyses cited above for a comprehensive listing\nof most studies and critiques). Seven of 10 RCTs have indicated that EMDR\ntherapy is more rapid or otherwise superior to CBT,^12^\u2013^19 and only 1 has\nreported superior effects for CBT on some measures.^20 The latter is likewise\nthe only RCT (of 25) to report a control condition superior to EMDR. Whereas\nthe EMDR therapy involved only 8 standard sessions and no homework, the CBT\ntreatment was vastly more complex and entailed 4 sessions of imaginal exposure\n(describing the trauma) and 4 sessions of therapist-assisted in vivo exposure\n(physically going to a disturbing location) plus approximately 50 hours of\ncombined imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure homework. The EMDR therapy\ncondition involved only 8 standard sessions and no homework. Of particular\nnote with respect to general clinical practice is a study conducted at Kaiser\nPermanente^21^,^22 that reported that 100% of single-trauma victims and 77% of\nmultiple-trauma victims no longer had PTSD after a mean of six 50-minute EMDR\ntherapy sessions, demonstrating a large and significant pretreatment versus\nposttreatment effect size (Cohen\u2019s \u03b4 = 1.74). This is consistent with 2 other\nRCTs that found that 84% to 90% of single-trauma victims no longer had PTSD\nafter three 90-minute EMDR sessions.^23^\u2013^25 Most recently, a study funded by\nthe National Institute of Mental Health evaluated the effects of 8 sessions of\nEMDR therapy compared to 8 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine.^26 EMDR was\nsuperior for the amelioration of both PTSD symptoms and depression. Upon\ntermination of therapy, the EMDR group continued to improve, whereas the\nfluoxetine participants who had reported as asymptomatic at posttest again\nbecame symptomatic. At follow-up, 91% of the EMDR group no longer had PTSD,\ncompared with 72% in the fluoxetine group.\n\nEMDR therapy is an eight-phase treatment approach composed of standardized\nprotocols and procedures. The eight phases and three-pronged protocol\nfacilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical picture, client\npreparation, and processing of a) past events that set the foundation for\npathology, b) current disturbing situations, and c) future challenges (Table\n1).^27\n\n### Table 1.\n\nOverview of eight-phase eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)\ntherapy treatment^27\n\nPhase| Purpose| Procedures  \n---|---|---  \nHistory taking| Obtain background information Identify suitability for EMDR\ntreatment Identify processing targets from events in client\u2019s life according\nto standardized three-pronged protocol| Standard history-taking questionnaires\nand diagnostic psychometrics Review of selection criteria Questions and\ntechniques to identify 1) past events that have laid the groundwork for the\npathology, 2) current triggers, and 3) future needs  \nPreparation| Prepare appropriate clients for EMDR processing of targets|\nEducation regarding the symptom picture Metaphors and techniques that foster\nstabilization and a sense of personal control  \nAssessment| Access the target for EMDR processing by stimulating primary\naspects of the memory| Elicit the image, negative belief currently held,\ndesired positive belief, current emotion, and physical sensation and baseline\nmeasures  \nDesensitization| Process experiences toward an adaptive resolution (no\ndistress)| Standardized protocols incorporating eye movements (taps or tones)\nthat allow the spontaneous emergence of insights, emotions, physical\nsensations, and other memories  \nInstallation| Increase connections to positive cognitive networks| Enhance the\nvalidity of the desired positive belief and fully integrate the positive\neffects within the memory network  \nBody Scan| Complete processing of any residual disturbance associated with the\ntarget| Concentration on and processing of any residual physical sensations  \nClosure| Ensure client stability at the completion of an EMDR session and\nbetween sessions| Use of guided imagery or self-control techniques if needed\nBriefing regarding expectations and behavioral reports between sessions  \nReassessment| Ensure maintenance of therapeutic outcomes and stability of\nclient| Evaluation of treatment effects Evaluation of integration within\nlarger social system  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nOne of the components used during the reprocessing phases is composed of dual\nattention stimuli in the form of bilateral eye movements, taps, or tones. The\neye movements have been the subject of great scrutiny and were called into\nquestion a decade ago by a meta-analysis^28 of studies evaluating treatment\neffects with and without this component. However, guidelines published by the\nInternational Society for Traumatic Stress Studies^11 indicated that no\nconclusions were possible because the studies evaluated in the meta-analyses\nwere fatally flawed owing to the use of inappropriate populations,\ninsufficient treatment doses, and lack of power. In contrast, since that time,\n20 RCTs have indicated positive effects of the eye movement component. Twelve\nRCTs demonstrate an immediate decrease in arousal, negative emotions, and/or\nimagery vividness,^29^,^30 and the remainder report additional memory effects,\nincluding increased attentional flexibility,^31 memory retrieval,^32 and\nrecognition of true information.^33 A recent meta-analysis^34 has reported\nthat significant outcomes are evident in both clinical studies, with a\nmoderate effect size (Cohen\u2019s \u03b4 = 0.41), and laboratory experiments, with a\nlarge effect size (Cohen\u2019s \u03b4 = 0.74). Three dominant hypotheses regarding\nproposed mechanisms of action of EMDR therapy that have been supported by\nresearch^35^\u2013^37 include that the eye movements a) tax working memory, b)\nelicit an orienting response, and c) link into the same processes that occur\nduring rapid eye movement sleep.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Experiential Contributors to Pathology\n\nEMDR therapy is guided by the adaptive information processing (AIP) model.\nDeveloped in the early 1990s,^1 this concept posits that, except for symptoms\ncaused by organic deficits, toxicity, or injury, the primary foundations of\nmental health disorders are unprocessed memories of earlier life experiences.\nIt appears that the high level of arousal engendered by distressing life\nevents causes them to be stored in memory with the original emotions, physical\nsensations, and beliefs. The flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of\nPTSD are prime examples of symptoms resulting from the triggering of these\nmemories. However, as indicated in the AIP model, a wide range of adverse life\nexperiences can also be stored in a dysfunctional manner, providing the basis\nfor diverse symptomology that include negative affective, cognitive, and\nsomatic responses. Sufficient processing of those accessed memories within the\nstandard three-pronged EMDR therapy protocol brings about adaptive resolution\nand functioning. It is conjectured that processing the targeted experiences\ntransfers them from implicit and episodic memory to explicit and semantic\nmemory systems.^1^,^38 The originally experienced negative emotions, physical\nsensations, and beliefs are altered as the targeted memory is integrated with\nmore adaptive information. What is useful is learned and stored with\nappropriate affective, somatic, and cognitive concomitants. Consequently, the\ndisturbing life experience becomes a source of strength and resilience.^39\n\nSupport for the AIP tenets positing the primacy of life experiences to\npathology comes from research showing that general life experiences (eg,\nrelational problems, problems with study or work) can be the source of even\nmore posttraumatic stress symptoms than major trauma.^40 Hence, patients\npresenting with anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, frequent anger, etc,\nshould be evaluated for adverse experiences contributing to current\ndysfunction. Two RCTs have demonstrated the effectiveness of EMDR therapy in\ntreating distressing life experiences that do not meet the criteria for\ntraumatic events in the diagnosis of PTSD.^24^,^25^,^41 Both trials reported\npositive treatment effects within 3 sessions. One of the studies using a mixed\nsample^24^,^25 reported comparable decreases in symptoms whether or not the\nparticipant met all criteria for PTSD. The 3 sessions of EMDR therapy resulted\nin an 84% remission of PTSD diagnosis with a large and significant\npretreatment versus posttreatment effect size (Cohen\u2019s \u03b4 = 1.69).\n\nThe ability of EMDR therapy to rapidly treat unprocessed memories of\ndistressing life experiences has multiple applications in medical practice, as\nsuch memories have been identified as the basis for a wide variety of clinical\nsymptoms. Research has revealed widespread mental health treatment\nimplications. For instance, \u201cHarsh physical punishment [ie, pushing, grabbing,\nshoving, slapping, hitting] in the absence of [more severe] child maltreatment\nis associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance\nabuse/dependence, and personality disorders in a general population\nsample.\u201d^42p1 Additional research demonstrates that \u201cExposure to adverse,\nstressful events ... has been linked to socioemotional behavior problems and\ncognitive deficits.\u201d^43p270 These studies highlight the significance of\ncarefully evaluating patients for a history of adverse life experiences. It is\nparticularly important in the treatment of children to identify interpersonal\nexperiences, including household dysfunction, bullying, and humiliation, that\nmay be contributing to problems such as anxiety, lack of focus, angry\noutbursts, inattention, and impulsivity issues that might otherwise be\nincorrectly diagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.^44^,^45 A\ncourse of EMDR therapy treatment can be used to alleviate the effects of\nexperiential contributors and to evaluate whether or not medication is\nactually needed. Reports of insomnia, nightmares, and night terrors should be\nsimilarly evaluated, as memory processing alone can improve the quality of\nsleep.^46\n\nAlthough these studies have contributed greatly to our knowledge base, the\nmost important research underscoring the importance of experiential\ncontributors to both physical and mental health problems is the Adverse\nChildhood Experiences (ACE) Study.^47 This study examined more than 17,000\nadult members in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program and \u201c... found a\nstrong dose-response relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or\nhousehold dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several\nof the leading causes of death in adults.\u201d^47p251 The implications for\ncombined medical and psychological treatment are relevant to both prevention\nand remediation. In this regard, the use of EMDR therapy to treat the patient\nand to identify the adverse life experiences that contribute to current\nsymptoms, and processing the memories to an adaptive resolution, can\nsignificantly contribute to efficient clinical practice.^1^,^48^,^49\n\nGo to:\n\n## EMDR Therapy Approach\n\nAccording to the AIP model, current experiences link into already established\nmemory networks and can trigger the unprocessed emotions, physical sensations,\nand beliefs inherent in earlier-stored adverse life experiences. In this way,\nwhen the past becomes present and patients react in a dysfunctional manner, it\nis because their perceptions of current situations are colored by their\nunprocessed memories. The AIP conceptualization provides the basis for a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the clinical picture, the targets selected for\ntreatment, and the procedures used during reprocessing.^1^,^45^,^49^,^50\nUnlike CBT, which involves extended focused attention on the disturbing event,\nEMDR reprocessing sessions promote an associative process that clearly reveals\nthe intricate connections of memories that are triggered by current life\nexperiences. The transcript of a patient who requested treatment for PTSD\nfollowing an earthquake^48 reveals the experiences of household dysfunction\nthat set the foundation for her current symptoms (see Sidebar: Partial\nTranscript of EMDR Therapy Session, available online at:\nwww.thepermanentejournal.org/files/Winter2014/EyeMovement.pdf). Note the\nspontaneous emergence of insight that ties together both past and present\ntrauma, as well as the rapid change in affect and cognitive response. Also of\nnote is the recognition of childhood feelings of powerlessness that provide\nthe foundation for psychosomatic problems. Such rapid decline in subjective\ndistress during a single EMDR therapy session has been reported in a number of\nRCTs.^14^,^51^,^52 A short course of EMDR therapy has also been found to\nsuccessfully treat cases of perceived neuropathy^48 as well as stress-related\ndermatologic disorders such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne excoriee,\nand generalized urticaria.^53\n\nImportantly, while CBT trauma treatments involve one to two hours of daily\nhomework to achieve positive effects, EMDR therapy uses none. As reported in a\ncontrolled study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, \u201cAn\ninteresting potential clinical implication is that EMDR seemed to do equally\nwell in the main despite less exposure [to the trauma memory] and no\nhomework.\u201d^54p614 Rapidly attained treatment effects and the absence of\nhomework make EMDR therapy highly amenable to physical rehabilitation\nservices. An RCT with patients suffering from PTSD following a life-\nthreatening cardiovascular event compared eight sessions of EMDR therapy to\nimaginal exposure therapy (which involves concentrating on the trauma memory\nand repeatedly describing it in detail).^12 EMDR therapy resulted in greater\nreductions on all measures posttest, indicating a rapid decline in trauma\nsymptoms, depression, and anxiety. Of note, significant improvement in trait\nanxiety was also reported and maintained. No such improvement was reported for\nimaginal exposure therapy. The authors reported that EMDR therapy was\ninitially posited to be more \u201cgentle\u201d and therefore amenable for this\ndebilitated population because \u201cdistancing\u201d rather than reliving has been\nfound to be correlated with treatment effects,^55 and the eye movements used\nin EMDR appear to immediately cause parasympathetic activation, resulting in\nphysiologic calming.^34^,^56^,^57 Further, RCTs of initial treatment sessions\nindicate that the subjective distress of patients decreases with EMDR therapy,\nwhereas it increases with exposure therapy.^14^,^52\n\n> ... EMDR therapy was initially posited to be more \u201cgentle\u201d and therefore\n> amenable for this debilitated population because \u201cdistancing\u201d rather than\n> reliving has been found to be correlated with treatment effects,^55 and the\n> eye movements used in EMDR appear to immediately cause parasympathetic\n> activation, resulting in physiologic calming.\n\nRehabilitation services can benefit from EMDR therapy to support both patient\nand family members. The traumatic impact of dealing with life-threatening,\nincapacitating disease can be mitigated by incorporating relatively few\nmemory-processing sessions to address distressing medical experiences, current\nsituations, and fears of the future. As reported by Gattinara,^58p170\u20131\n\n\u201cUsing this approach in the field of neuromuscular disease is useful on three\nlevels:\n\n  1. It can facilitate the processing of the traumatic event in the patient and the whole family.\n\n  2. It can rapidly reestablish a secure interpersonal context between the patient and his or her caregiver by reducing the high arousal level.\n\n  3. It can transform the health service into a network of support for patient and family, offering help in managing the emotional vulnerability connected with physical vulnerability, thus buffering the adverse impact of worsening clinical conditions.\u201d\n\nIn addition, because EMDR therapy requires no homework, it can be used on\nconsecutive days, allowing rapid completion of treatment. The cost\nimplications are obvious.\n\nEMDR therapy can also be used to help support family members dealing with the\ndeath of a loved one. The results of both prolonged debilitation and sudden\ndeath can involve trauma symptoms that include distressing intrusive images of\nthe suffering patient. The family member is often unable to retrieve positive\nmemories of the deceased, which further exacerbates and complicates the\ngrieving process.^59 As indicated in a nonrandomized multisite study,^60 EMDR\ntherapy reduced symptoms significantly more rapidly than the CBT on behavioral\nmeasures and on 4 of 5 psychosocial measures. EMDR was more efficient,\ninducing change at an earlier stage and requiring fewer sessions (6.2 vs 10.7\nsessions). Positive recall of the deceased was significantly greater (twice\nthe frequency) posttreatment with EMDR.\n\nA wide range of patients suffering from debilitating medical conditions can\nalso benefit from EMDR therapy. For instance, the utility of psychological\nservices for burn victims has been reported, with EMDR therapy specifically\nrecommended on the basis of both effectiveness and brevity of treatment.^61 As\nindicated previously, three to six sessions are generally sufficient to\nalleviate symptoms from a single trauma. Of particular note is the elimination\nof both PTSD and somatic symptoms in a burn victim who had been severely\ndebilitated for almost a decade.^62 The rapid alleviation of the patient\u2019s\nsymptoms and return to independent functioning are consistent with the AIP\nmodel, which posits that the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness are the\nresult of unprocessed memories of the trauma that contain the perceptions\nexperienced at the time of the event.^1^,^48^,^49\n\nThese findings have important implications for the medical community in that\nmany chronic pain patients may actually be debilitated by unprocessed memories\nencoded with the original somatic perceptions. As noted by Ray and Zbik,^63\nwhereas CBT treatments address chronic pain through cognitive interventions\nthat can reduce distress, EMDR therapy can result in the elimination of the\npain sensations. For instance, a number of researchers have reported positive\noutcomes of EMDR therapy for the treatment of phantom limb pain. The 4\nevaluations of patients published to date^64^\u2013^67 indicate an aggregate 80%\nsuccess rate as defined by complete elimination or substantial reduction of\npain sensations. According to the AIP model, the phantom pain is caused by the\nunprocessed memory of the experience during which the limb was damaged. This\nunprocessed memory contains the physical sensations experienced at the time of\nthe event. EMDR processing of the memory results in a simultaneous shift in\nemotions, physical sensations, and beliefs.^1^,^49 Completed processing is\nposited to involve an alteration of the originally stored memory through a\nprocess of integration and reconsolidation.^1^,^68 The change in the targeted\nmemory results in an elimination of those pain sensations that are not caused\nby physical nerve damage. Successful elimination and/or reduction of pain to\ntolerable levels has been reported after 2 to 9 EMDR therapy sessions.\nTherefore, when no neuropathy is observed in chronic pain patients it is often\nbeneficial to explore the potential results of a short course of memory\nprocessing.^69^,^70 In addition, EMDR therapy has been reported to be\nbeneficial in the treatment of migraine headaches in an open trial^71 and an\nRCT.^72\n\nGo to:\n\n## Potential Neurobiologic Concomitants\n\nThe different treatment outcomes and the procedural differences between EMDR\ntherapy and CBT indicate potentially diverse underlying neurobiologic\nmechanisms. For instance, trauma-focused CBT exposure therapies entail\nextended, detailed repetitions of the disturbing event that are repeated\nduring both sessions and homework. Research has indicated that prolonged\nexposures, as used in CBT, result in extinction, whereas brief exposures as\nused in EMDR therapy trigger memory reconsolidation.^73 These differences have\nsignificant neurobiologic and clinical implications. As noted by Craske et\nal,^74p6 \u201c... recent work on extinction and reinstatement ... suggests that\nextinction does not eliminate or replace previous associations, but rather\nresults in new learning that competes with the old information.\u201d This\nmechanism is posited to account for relapse. Further, \u201cExtinction is\nconceptualized as the development of a second context-specific inhibitory\nassociation that, in contrast to fear acquisition, does not easily generalize\nto new contexts.\u201d^74p12 These factors may account for differences in treatment\ntime, with EMDR therapy reported to be more rapid than CBT in five\nRCTs,^13^\u2013^15^,^17^\u2013^19 as well as reported positive effects obtained with\nEMDR treatment that have not been reported with CBT (eg, elimination of\nphantom limb pain, increased positive recall of the deceased). The fact that\nCBT exposure therapies are posited to leave the original memory intact may be\nthe reason these beneficial results have not been reported with CBT. Likewise,\na recent pilot study indicated that six sessions of EMDR therapy with patients\nwith psychosis and PTSD also resulted in \u201ca positive effect on auditory verbal\nhallucinations, delusions, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and self-\nesteem.\u201d^75p664 By contrast, successful CBT has resulted in a continuation of\nauditory hallucinations that the patient experiences, but with less distress.\nIn the EMDR study, the majority of participants who had initially experienced\nauditory hallucinations reported that these had disappeared. The findings that\n\u201c ... childhood adversity is strongly associated with increased risk for\npsychosis\u201d^76p2 suggest the need for additional rigorous research evaluating\nthe effects of memory processing with this population.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Future Research\n\nThe ACE Study^47 conducted at Kaiser Permanente provides an ideal platform for\nfuture research to evaluate the effects of EMDR therapy for a wide range of\npsychological and physical problems pertinent to medical practice. Some of the\nconditions found in the ACE Study to be correlated with exposure to adverse\nlife experiences in childhood are alcoholism, drug abuse, severe obesity,\ndepression, and suicide attempts. These conditions would lend themselves well\nto rigorous RCTs in which integrated EMDR therapy protocols that include\nprocessing the disturbing memories are compared to current standard care. Both\nimmediate and long-term follow-up of at least a year\u2019s duration to evaluate\nmaintenance of treatment gains would greatly inform current medical practices.\n\nOf equal importance is the finding in the ACE Study that ACEs result in the\nincreased incidence of physically debilitating conditions such as ischemic\nheart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures, and liver\ndisease. Rigorous longitudinal studies to evaluate the utility of EMDR therapy\nfor preventive care would provide the medical community an important\nopportunity to determine whether processing the memories of adverse\nexperiences can ameliorate these detrimental effects. The social policy and\nfinancial implications of such studies underscore their importance in\nproviding optimal care.\n\nFor any of the suggested studies, it is vital that clinical personnel with\nappropriate treatment fidelity carefully assess the nature of the disturbing\nevents in the patient\u2019s history and allocate adequate treatment time to\nprocess a sufficient number of memories to potentially achieve asymptomatic\nstatus. As reported in the ACE Study,^47 there is a \u201cstrong graded\nrelationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction\nduring childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes\nof death in adults.\u201d^47p245 As indicated previously, a short course of EMDR\ntherapy may be sufficient to eliminate a variety of psychological and somatic\nconditions. However, patients who have been serially abused throughout\nchildhood will generally need more treatment time to achieve comprehensive\nadaptive resolution.^1^,^50 Given that EMDR treatment effects generalize to\nsimilar memories, it is unnecessary to process each disturbing event. However,\nsufficient time should be provided to process the relevant memories within the\nvarious categories of adverse experiences.\n\nFor all the suggested studies, the inclusion of procedures to identify\nepigenetic and neurophysiologic changes subsequent to treatment also opens the\ndoor to potentially important assessment possibilities. Since EMDR therapy can\nbe provided on consecutive days, successful treatment can be accomplished over\na matter of weeks, rather than months, which can reduce time confounds and\nprovides both efficient and cost-effective research opportunities.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Conclusions\n\nA substantial amount of research indicates that adverse life experiences may\nbe the basis for a wide range of psychological and physiologic symptoms. EMDR\ntherapy research has shown that processing memories of such experiences\nresults in the rapid amelioration of negative emotions, beliefs, and physical\nsensations. Reports have indicated potential applications for patients with\nstress-related disorders, as well as those suffering from a wide range of\nphysical conditions. The medical community can also benefit from the use of\nEMDR therapy for prevention and rehabilitative services to support both\npatients and family members. A thorough assessment of potential experiential\ncontributors can be beneficial. If relevant, EMDR therapy can allow medical\npersonnel to quickly determine the degree to which distressing experiences are\na contributing factor and to efficiently address the problem through memory\nprocessing that can help facilitate both psychological and physical\nresolution. Rigorous research of the use of EMDR therapy with patients\nsuffering from the conditions identified in the ACE Study can further\ncontribute to our understanding of the potential for both remediation and\npreventive care.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nLeslie Parker, ELS, provided editorial assistance.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Footnotes\n\nDisclosure Statement\n\nThe author(s) have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Eye\n\nFor the eye altering alters all.\n\n\u2014The Mental Traveller, William Blake, 1757\u20131827, English poet, painter, and\nprintmaker\n\nGo to:\n\n## References\n\n1\\.
