Kinder Scout was the site of a\nmass trespass in 1932.\n\nThe freedom to roam, or \"everyman's right\", is the general public's right to\naccess certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for\nrecreation and exercise. The right is sometimes called the right of public\naccess to the wilderness or the \"right to roam\".\n\nIn Austria, Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway,\nScotland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, the freedom to roam\ntakes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law.\nThe access is ancient in parts of Northern Europe and has been regarded as\nsufficiently fundamental that it was not formalised in law until modern times.\nHowever, the right usually does not include any substantial economic\nexploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as\nmaking fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn countries without such general rights, there may be a network of rights of\nway, or some nature reserves with footpaths.\n\n## Europe[edit]\n\n### Nordic countries[edit]\n\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European\ncountries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm. Today, the right\nto roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland,\nNorway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds\nof years^[1] and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice'\nto become a commonly recognised right.\n\nCamping in a forest in Femundsmarka National Park, Norway\n\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of\nthe Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on\nanother's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone\nelse's waters, and picking wildflowers, mushrooms and berries. However, with\nthese rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm,\ndisturb, litter, nor to damage wildlife or crops.^[citation needed]\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take\nany other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a\nfire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with\nproper safety precautions). Making noise is discouraged. In some countries,\nputting up a tent in the forest for one night is allowed, but not the use of a\ncaravan. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as houses,\ngardens) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land.\nFor example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's\npermission.^[citation needed]\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In\nDenmark, there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land.\nAll dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming.\nUncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of\nownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks\nonly.^[citation needed]\n\n#### Finland[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(September 2018) (Learn how\nand when to remove this message)  \n---  \nIn Finland, picking berries is part of a Finnish everyone's right.\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called\n\"jokamiehenoikeus\" (every man's right) and more recently this is being\nreplaced with the gender-neutral form \"jokaisenoikeus\" in Finnish (everyone's\nright) and \"allemansr\u00e4tten\" in Swedish (lit. \"everyone's right\"), similar to\nother Nordic countries.\n\nThe right is not codified in any specific law. Instead, it arises from the\nprinciple of nulla poena sine lege - what is not illegal cannot be punished.\nThings that are not explicitly disallowed, are allowed by default.\n\nEveryone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where\nthis does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens\nor in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and\nplantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in\nthe winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on\nprivate land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official\nproceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.^[2]\n\nOne may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable\ndistance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers\n(as long as they are not protected species). One may fish with a rod and line\n(only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain\nrestrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can\nwalk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from\nselling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free. Picking cloudberry may be\ntemporarily restricted to local residents in parts of Lapland.^[3] In the\nautonomous province of \u00c5land the right to camp's inclusion in the right to\nroam was disputed, but since 2013 this is no longer the case.^[4]^[5]^[6]\n\nWhen traveling with a motorhome or camper, one can park and spend the night\nanywhere parking is allowed, including along public roads. Checking parking\narea signs is essential to ensure compliance with overnight stay regulations.\nPrivate and forest roads can serve as suitable parking spots, as long as there\nare no signage restrictions. Off-road driving requires landowner permission,\nbut parking off-road near the road is allowed for convenience. Overnight stays\nare generally prohibited in shopping center parking lots, but service stations\noften provide suitable facilities. When visiting national parks, designated\nareas or parking lots may allow overnight stays, potentially requiring a\npermit. Nature reserves have specific rules regarding overnight stays.^[7]\n\nOne may not disturb others or damage property, disturb breeding birds (or\ntheir nests or young), or disturb reindeer or game animals. One may not cut\ndown or damage living trees, or collect wood, moss or lichen on other people's\nproperty, nor may one light open fires without the landowner's permission\n(except in an emergency). It is acceptable, however, to use an alcohol burner,\nwood stove or similar device that has no hot parts touching the ground. One\nmay not disturb the privacy of people's homes by camping too near to them or\nmaking too much noise, nor litter, drive motor vehicles off-road without the\nlandowner's permission, or fish (excluding angling) or hunt without the\nrelevant permits.^[8] If horse riding causes more than a minor inconvenience\nor disturbance, an agreement for the long term use of the route must be made\nwith the landowner. A horse may also be taken to swim in a water body without\nthe consent of the owner of the water area (excluding public beaches).\n\n#### Norway[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(September 2018) (Learn how\nand when to remove this message)  \n---  \n  \nEveryone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through,\nuncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old consuetudinary law\ncalled the allemannsrett (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in\n1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act.^[9] It is based on\nrespect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show\nconsideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In\nNorway the terms utmark and innmark divide areas where the right to roam is\nvalid (utmark, literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out\nField]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (innmark, \"land inside [the\nboundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies innmark thoroughly, and all\nareas not covered by this definition are defined as utmark, generally speaking\nuninhabited and uncultivated areas. Cultivated land may only be crossed when\nfrozen or covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n  * People are allowed to camp at least 150 metres away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n  * Campfires are not allowed in the forest areas between 15 April to 15 September, unless it obviously can not lead to a fire.^[10]\n  * Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for up to two days. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n  * With a motorhome or a camper, it is allowed to park and spend the night anywhere parking is allowed, including along a public road, unless camping is explicitly forbidden. Often this right is however limited to one or two overnight stays.^[11]\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the Oslo\nFjord and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites\nfor holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public\naccess to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of\nproperty is prohibited in a 100-metre zone closest to the sea, but local\nauthorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant\nexemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to\nbuild closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the\nshore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted\n(but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\nCanoeing, kayaking, rowing and sailing in rivers, lakes, and ocean are\nallowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open\nfor swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are drinking water reservoirs\n(see for instance Maridalsvannet).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however,\nbe restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.^[12]\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in\nthe right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the\nfishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing may only be\nconducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a\nfishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16.\nChildren under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right\ncodified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the\nNorwegian Supreme Court in 2004. ^[citation needed]\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from\nthe shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things,\nprotect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding\nthe use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n#### Sweden[edit]\n\nIn Sweden allemansr\u00e4tten (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by\nthe Constitution of Sweden. Since 1994 the Instrument of Government says that\nnotwithstanding the right to own property \"everyone shall have access to\nnature in accordance with allemansr\u00e4tten\".^[13] What this means is not further\nexplicated on in the constitution, and only sparsely in other\nlegislation.^[14] In practice, allemansr\u00e4tten is defined as actions that are\nnot crimes, will not make a person liable to pay damages, nor can be\nprohibited by any authority.^[15] As in other Nordic countries, the Swedish\nright to roam comes with an equal emphasis being placed upon the\nresponsibility to look after the countryside; the maxim is \"do not disturb, do\nnot destroy\". Many Swedish people consider this to be a form of legacy or\nhuman right.\n\nAllemansr\u00e4tten gives a person the right to access, walk, cycle, ride, ski, and\ncamp on any land\u2014with the exception of private gardens, the immediate vicinity\nof a dwelling house and land under cultivation. Restrictions apply for nature\nreserves and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild\nflowers, mushrooms and berries (provided they are not legally protected), but\nnot to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on\nany water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and\nwalking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or\nwithin the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the\nhemfridszon). The hemfridszon's size depends on conditions but can be as large\nas 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house.^[14] To better protect access to\nwater and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not\npermitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or\nshoreline.^[16]\n\nFishing remains essentially private\u2014apart from on the biggest five lakes and\nthe coast of the Baltic Sea, the Sound, Kattegat and Skagerrak. It is\npermitted to drive a car on a private road unless explicitly signposted\notherwise. Small camp fires are generally permitted, but in some periods\nbanned by local authorities due to wild fire risk. It is allowed to put up a\ntent on any uncultivated land for a night or two.^[17] There has been some\ncontroversy on commercial use of the berry picking rights, when companies\nlegally contract people to pick berries in the forests.^[18]\n\nBuilding a fire is generally permitted except on bare rock faces where it can\nlead to cracking. Municipalities can issue fire bans during dry periods.\n\nWith a motorhome or camper, you can park and spend the night anywhere parking\nis allowed, including along public roads. Driving off-road with caravans and\nmobile homes is not permitted. At rest areas, the usual maximum stay for\novernight stays is around 24 hours on weekdays, with slightly longer durations\non weekends. Additional rules will be posted on rest area signs. There are no\nspecific regulations regarding how long you can park your motor vehicle\nadjacent to a non-off-road road.^[19]\n\nExercise of the rights is overseen by the County Administrative Boards\u2014which\ncan, for example, force the removal of a fence if it obstructs access to areas\nthat are important to the allemansr\u00e4tt.^[14]\n\n#### Iceland[edit]\n\nLike other Nordic countries Icelandic law contains a version of the freedom to\nroam, the right to access uncultivated land and pick berries. \"It is\npermissible to cross uncultivated private property without seeking any special\npermission, but landowners may limit routes with signs or other marks. State-\nowned land such as conservation areas and forestry areas are open to everyone\nwith few exceptions. These exceptions include \u2013 but are not limited to \u2013\naccess during breeding seasons or during sensitive growth periods\".^[20]\n\nHikers should, however, \"avoid taking shortcuts over fenced areas, pastures\nand private plots\", and follow the rules in conservation areas. Footpaths\nshould also be followed, if they exist, to help protect the landscape.\nFurthermore, \"landowners may not hinder passage of walkers alongside rivers,\nlakes and ocean, or on tracks and paths'.^[21] Cycling may be restricted on\nsome paths. Equestrians must keep to bridleways where they exist and in other\nplaces show \"consideration for the land\".^[21]\n\nIn many areas, like South and East Iceland, only in uninhabited areas that are\nnot protected maximum 3 Tents maybe pitched up for one night, if there is no\ncamp-site in vicinity.\n\nMotorized travellers with motorhomes (RV), camping cars (campers) and trailers\nmust always stay on an official campsite.\n\nIn national parks, it is forbidden to stay overnight outside an official camp-\nsite, both for motorized and non-motorized travellers.\n\nFishing requires a license but collecting \"berries, mushrooms, seaweed and\nother plants for immediate consumption\" is permitted on \"public lands and\nhighland pastures\".^[21]\n\n### Estonia[edit]\n\nIn Estonia, it is permitted to access natural and cultural landscapes on foot,\nby bicycle, ski, boat, or on horseback.^[22]\n\nPrivate property may be accessed at any time. If the private property is\nfenced or posted against trespassing, the permission of the owner is required\nto proceed. The owner of the private property is also required to post signs\nstating the ownership of the land, and contact numbers, to avoid legal issues.\nLand owners may not block access to land, roads or bodies of water that are\npublic or are designated for public use, including ice and shore paths.^[22]\n\nAll bodies of water that are public or designated for public use have public\nshore paths that are up to 4 m wide. The shore path along a navigable body of\nwater may extend to a distance of 10 m from the water line. The owner may not\nclose this path even if the private property is posted or marked with no-\ntrespassing signs. Grazing areas and other enclosed areas along the shore\npaths must have stiles. Ponds with no outlet located entirely on the land of\none land owner and lakes smaller than five hectares located on land belonging\nto more than one land owner shall not be in public use. Permission from the\nlandowner is required to access such bodies of water.^[22]\n\nNeither do bodies of water protected as sources of drinking water or which are\nin use by aquaculture or are in other special use have a shore path. All of\nthe rights and responsibilities regarding humans\u2019 interaction with nature are\ncollectively termed everyman's right. Everyman's right does not pertain to the\norganizing of sporting events or other public events in open country. To\norganize these, the permission of the landowners or other possessors of land,\nand if necessary, of the local government, must be sought.^[22]\n\nThe following is permitted in nature:\n\n  * accessing areas by foot, on bicycle, skis, boat or horseback in all places not prohibited on the basis of law(s);\n  * being present in any area where access is permitted;\n  * gathering wild berries, mushrooms, flowers, medicinal plants, hazelnuts and other natural products not under nature protection;\n  * fishing bodies of water that are public or designated for public use with a simple hand line.\n\nThe following is prohibited:\n\n  * accessing the immediate proximity of a person's yard, plantations, apiaries, sown crops, grain field and other cropland where damage is thereby incurred by the owner;\n  * lighting fires and camping without permission from the land owner or possessor;\n  * hunting and fishing without relevant license, except for simple hand line;\n  * injuring trees and bushes;\n  * disrupting the peace of local inhabitants;\n  * damaging the habitats and nests of forest animals and birds, gathering or removing their eggs, or otherwise doing harm to them;\n  * damaging nature protection objects and protected species;\n  * using motor vehicles where prohibited;\n  * polluting nature.\n\n### Belarus[edit]\n\nArticle 13 of Section I of the Constitution of Belarus guarantees that all\nforest and farm land is publicly owned.^[23]^[24] Forty percent of the\ncountry's territory is covered by forest,^[25] and approximately the same\namount devoted to agriculture.^[26]\n\nAccording to the Forest Code (Article 13)^[27] \"citizens have the right to\nfreely stay in the forest and collect wild fruits, berries, nuts, mushrooms,\nother food, forest resources and medicinal plants to meet their own\nneeds.\"^[28]\n\n### Austria[edit]\n\nThe right to roam in Austria, particularly in forests and mountainous areas,\nis called Wegefreiheit. Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed\nby Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are\nautomatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse\nriding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the\nland owner's permission. A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is\nowned by government bodies such as the Austrian State Forestry Commission\n[de], but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may\nbe closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in\nmountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states,\nsuch as Carinthia, Styria, and Salzburg guarantee a right to roam in\nmountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all\nrecreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and\nBurgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right\nto deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced,\nsince mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria. ^[29]\n\n### Czech Republic[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

This legal institution is applied when one\nland owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act gives a legal right to roam\nthrough country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of\ncountryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a natural person). Some\ntypes of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and\nbuilding grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens,\ngrounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded\nduring seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are\nexcluded during cattle grazing. In national natural preserves, national\nnatural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape\nprotected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only\nto roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas\n(e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed\nlesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a\nlegal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on\nthe ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However,\nbiking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest\nroads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through\nforest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not\nconsidered as \"forest land\" in land registration). Common use of forest can be\nrestricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest\nnurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed (common use of roads\n\u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed\npovrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\nIn Italy there is not a general right to roam: this was established by\njurisprudence in 1999 (Cassazione civile , sez. III , 27/08/1999 , n. 8997).\nPrivately-owned land is not accessible when marked as such,, while access to\npublicly-owned land is generally free. Berries and mushrooms can be picked on\npublicly-owned land but may be restricted in quantity/species and/or subjected\nto a fee, according to regional laws.\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

In fact, almost 43% of the Italian sandy\ncoastline is occupied by bathing establishments, while 7.2% is polluted or not\nmonitored. The situation varies from region to region. And although the\nEuropean Union has been asking Italy for years to have more free beaches, it\nkeeps getting worse.\n\n### Switzerland[edit]\n\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in Switzerland by the Swiss Civil Code.\nHowever, some cantons have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of\naccess of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely\nfor everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases\nlike the protection of young forest or biotopes it is not allowed to fence in\nforest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities\nrelated to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events\nin the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation.\nSimilar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches\nof water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e.\nbeing under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private\nproperty) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the\nfreedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms,\nberries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called Betretungsrecht, is guaranteed by\nmultiple federal laws. The Federal Nature Conservation Act,^[30] the Federal\nForest Act^[31] and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to\nopen landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling\nand horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated\nthrough state law.\n\n#### Bavaria[edit]\n\nThe Constitution of Bavaria guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural\nbeauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and\nmountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild\nfruits\".^[32] The right is nicknamed Schwammerlparagraph (mushroom clause).\nThe article also obliges \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with\ncare\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to\nmaintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries\nand to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking\ntrails and recreational parks\".\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and\nunenclosed land was restricted prior to the enactment of the Countryside and\nRights of Way Act 2000. Access to land in England and Wales is still more\nlimited than in most of Northern Europe, and some other European countries,\nwhile access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly\nprotected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or\nfishing rights. The Ramblers' Association, which works to increase the rights\nof walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n#### England and Wales[edit]\n\nSee also: Open Country and Trespass in English law \u00a7 Trespass to land\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(August 2019) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this message)  \n---  \n  \nIn England and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and\nbenefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government\nlegislated to introduce a limited right to roam, without compensation for\nlandowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually\nimplemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right\nto walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally\ndownland, moorland, heathland and coastal land.^[33] Forests and woodlands are\nexcluded, other than publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of\naccess by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the Forestry Commission.\nDeveloped land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from\nthe right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of\nthe categories described above. People exercising the right of access have\ncertain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to\nprotect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales,\nwith completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced.\nThis added to the legal right to use established public footpaths and\nbridleways, some common land and access to the foreshore. Land owners may\nprevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England\nand Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as swimmers and canoeists\nwith access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The British Canoe\nUnion is running the Rivers Access Campaign, to highlight the level of\nrestrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England\nand Wales.\n\nMuch of the Dartmoor National Park has been designated as 'Access Land',\nalthough it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with\nno restrictions on where walkers can roam.^[34] Because of the 1985 Act,\nDartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000,\nwhich established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in\n2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\nThe Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 extended access rights to land near the\nEnglish coast.\n\n#### Scotland[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Outdoor Access Code\n\nIn Scotland the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 comprehensively codified into\nScots law the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land\nin Scotland. The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for\nrecreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross\nland. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, to which the\nScottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on.\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking,\ncycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water\nfor canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming. The rights confirmed in the\nScottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in\nEngland and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).^[35]\n\n#### Northern Ireland[edit]\n\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most\nregressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes\nused to reach ... mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments\npass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be\nthere.\"^[36] The Access to the Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 gave\nsome rights, but access is generally modelled on the restrictive 1949\nEnglish/Welsh law. The absence of a tradition of access, political influence\nof landowners and problems of governance have been blamed for the lack of\nfreedom to roam.^[37]\n\n### Republic of Ireland[edit]\n\nKeep Ireland Open is a voluntary campaign organisation with the aim of\nimproving access to the countryside. Journalist Fintan O'Toole called Irish\nlaw \"perhaps the most negative and mean-minded regime for walkers in\nEurope\".^[38] Access rights in Ireland have been described as being \"the most\nregressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes\nused to reach our mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments\npass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be\nthere.\"^[36] The national parks are described by Keep Ireland Open as \"the\nonly places in Ireland where freedom to roam exists\", but they only cover 0.9%\nof the country. Comhairle na Tuaithe was established by \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, Minister\nfor Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2004 to mediate between\nlandowners, state agencies and recreational users of the countryside.^[39]\n\n## North America[edit]\n\n### United States[edit]\n\nBecause American property rights include the right to exclude others, the\nfreedom to roam does not generally exist in the United States. But under some\ncircumstances, long-term use of a path across private property may legally\nestablish a prescriptive easement for the public. On federally owned property,\nthe Property Clause of Article IV, Section III of the U.S. Constitution states\nthat the United States Congress \"shall have Power to dispose of and make all\nneedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property\nbelonging to the United States\", granting the legislative branch the authority\nto regulate federal property \"without limitations\".^[40]\n\nIn the United States, governmental entities including cities, counties,\nstates, and the federal government all manage land which are referred to as\neither public lands or the public domain. The majority of public lands in the\nUnited States are administered by the United States Forest Service and the\nBureau of Land Management, agencies of the federal government, and include\nabout 640 million acres of land, about 28% of the total land area of 2.27\nbillion acres.^[41]^[42] Any person, including non-citizens, can legally\naccess and recreate on these lands lawfully, sometimes referred to as the\nNorth American model of land conservation.^[43] Some state and local\ngovernments enforce stricter policies on their public land, such as loitering\nlaws and redlining practices,^[44] with some cities outright banishing certain\ngroups of people.^[45] Here are some specific state and local policies:\n\n  * California's California Coastal Act provides a similar right for its beaches, and the Surfrider Foundation has been successful suing littoral property owners who try to use trespassing laws to restrict public access to the public portions of a beach.^[46]\n  * Florida's state constitution establishes a public trust of \"sovereignty lands\", including wet beaches \"below mean high water lines ... for all the people,\" respecting a freedom to roam there, regardless of any private neighboring dry beach. Local ordinances typically limit this freedom strictly to roaming on foot, and prohibit driving motor vehicles or beaching boats.^[47]\n  * The State of Hawaii grants beach and coastal access to local residents and visitors. These beach transit corridors are considered public property defined as the \"areas extending seaward of the shoreline\". Coastal land owners are also required to maintain vegetation that would inhibit beach access as there are many varieties of fast growing coastal plants that can easily limit public access.^[48]\n  * Maine allows access to any outdoor property unless posted. Posting requires clearly marking with complying signs or paint. Signs must indicate that access is prohibited, that access is prohibited without permission of the landowner or the landowner's agent, or that access for a particular purpose is prohibited.^[49]\n  * In St. Louis, Missouri, the government banishes many homeless people and other vulnerable populations from large areas of the city. These areas include public land and many of the organizations that provide shelter, meals, and care to St. Louis\u2019s homeless people. Those who violate the orders have been jailed for months.^[45]\n  * New Hampshire common law gives members of the public the right to access unposted land.^[50]\n  * The Oregon Beach Bill was a piece of landmark legislation in the U.S. state of Oregon, passed by the 1967 session of the Oregon Legislature. It established public ownership of land along the Oregon Coast from the water up to sixteen vertical feet above the low tide mark.^[51]\n  * In Pennsylvania, the 1966 Recreational Use of Land and Water Act (RULWA) limits landowners' liability for personal injury and property damage if they make their land available to the public for recreation. The statute encourages landowners to open their undeveloped land for recreational use.^[52]\n  * The constitution of Rhode Island protects shore access, including swimming and gathering of seaweed.^[53]^[54] The 1982 Rhode Island Supreme Court decision in State v. Ibbison^[55]^[56] defines the end of private land as the mean high tide line, which is difficult to determine in day-to-day activities, and has resulted in beach access conflicts.^[57] Underfunding of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has resulted in lax enforcement against encroachment on public access and building of illegal structures.^[58]\n  * Vermont's constitution allows the public the right to hunt, fish and trap on open private land.^[59] A landowner who does not want to allow this access has a legal right to post signs that restrict this right.^[60]\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\nMuch of Canada is Crown land administered by the provinces. Some is leased for\ncommercial activity, such as forestry or mining, but on much of it there is\nfree access for recreational activities like hiking, cycling, canoeing, cross-\ncountry skiing, horse back riding, and licensed hunting and fishing, etc. At\nthe same time access can be restricted or limited for various reasons (e.g.,\nto protect public safety or resources, including the protection of wild plants\nand animals).^[61] In the Canadian Territories Crown land is administered by\nthe Canadian Federal Government. Canadian National Parks have been created\nfrom Crown land and are also administered by the Federal Government. There are\nalso provincial parks and nature reserves that have been similarly created.\nThe Indigenous peoples in Canada may have specific rights on Crown land\nestablished under treaties signed when Canada was a British colony, and have\nclaimed ownership of some Crown land.^[62]\n\nIn Ontario, Canadian citizens and people who have lived in Canada for at least\n7 months of the preceding 12-month period are allowed to camp for free up to\n21 days on any one site in a calendar year, on crown land/conservation\nreserves.^[63]\n\n## Australia[edit]\n\nAlthough formerly six British colonies, Australians only have limited access\nto the land, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.^[64] However, much of\nAustralia's land area is Crown land, which is administered by the Australian\nstates, and while a lot of this consists of pastoral leases, and land owned\nand run by Aboriginal people (e.g. APY lands), access is normally permitted\nfor recreational purposes to \u201cunallocated\u201d Crown land; though motorized\nvehicles are required to follow roads.^[65]\n\n## New Zealand[edit]\n\nThere is extensive public access in New Zealand, including waterways and the\ncoast, but it is \"often fragmented and difficult to locate\".^[66]\n\nThe \"Queen's Chain\" is a concept in New Zealand property law. It is a strip of\npublic land, usually 20 metres (or one chain in pre-metric measure) wide along\nrivers, lakes and the coast line. It was designed to prevent land upriver or\nalong a coast being inaccessible to any prospective buyers. The strips are\nincomplete and their exact modern location can be complex to\ndetermine.^[67]^[68] These strips exist in various forms (including road\nreserves, esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, marginal strips and reserves\nof various types) but not as extensively and consistently as is often\nassumed.^[69]\n\nIn 2007, the government of New Zealand reviewed the rights of public access\nfor outdoor recreation. However, unlike the United Kingdom, \"the New Zealand\nreview recommended no increase in the public's right to access private\nproperty\".^[70]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nIn recent years increased mobility and affluence has made previously remote\nareas more accessible and though significant harm or damage is unusual,\nendangered species are being disturbed, and litter left, by some recreational\nusers.^[71]^[72]\n\nHelena Jonsson, the President of the Federation of Swedish Farmers, argued in\n2011 that the way land was used had changed and that the law was out of date\nand needed to be revised, so as \"to bar commercial interests from using the\nlaw as an excuse to make a profit while they are on other people's private\nproperty\".^[73]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Adverse possession\n  * Air rights\n  * Boundaries in landscape history\n  * Campsite\n  * Commons\n  * Easement, the right of use over the real property of another\n  * Freedom of movement\n  * Romani people\n  * Land rights\n  * Land use\n  * Loitering\n  * Nomadic pastoralism\n  * Open Spaces Society\n  * Prior-appropriation water rights\n  * Property\n  * Public land\n  * Public space\n  * Public trust doctrine\n  * Right of way\n  * Riparian water rights\n  * Trespass\n  * Transhumance\n  * Vagrancy\n  * Wilderness\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Allemannsretten \u2013 en hevdvunnen rett\".
