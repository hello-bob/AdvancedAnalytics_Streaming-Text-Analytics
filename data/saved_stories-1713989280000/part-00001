The technique is part of a broader\napproach to flight control called Active Flow Control which dispenses with\ntraditional moving aerodynamic surfaces. AFC could yield meaningful advantages\nin future aircraft from greater efficiency to improved stealth.\n\nBut flying a headline-making fully Active Flow Control (AFC)-controlled\n\u201cX-plane\u201d isn\u2019t really the point. For the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) and its aerospace industry partners on the project, adding AFC\nto the aircraft designer\u2019s toolbox is.\n\n## A long-legged bird\n\nThe DARPA program for which Aurora plans to build and fly its AFC-controlled X\nplane is called CRANE (Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel\nEffectors). In general terms, conventional airplanes change or maintain\ndirection in three dimensions by changing the airflow around them using hinged\nsurfaces, a form of flow control. Instead, AFC uses timed and metered pulses\nto effect airflow changes. These disruptions change lift and drag at a\nspecific location to initiate pitch, roll, or yaw movements. The effectors\nactuate flow changes and are typically pneumatic or electric.\n\nOne technique puffs or streams air extracted from a jet engine through 1-4mm\nwide holes in the relevant parts of an aircraft\u2019s skin. Conversely, air can be\nsucked out of the flow. Such pneumatic blowing and suction can create or shape\naerodynamic wakes that aerodynamicists describe as virtual control surfaces.\n\nIf an aircraft\u2019s wings have rounded trailing edges, air will follow their\ncurvature \u2013 a tendency known as the Coanda Effect. Blow air over the top of a\nrounded trailing edge and you create a downward wake. Blow air from below and\nyou create an upward wake. The wakes can change the pitch of an aircraft,\nraising or lowering its nose just as flaps and elevators do. Left or right yaw\nmotion, produced by rudders on conventional aircraft, is harder to create with\npneumatic AFC, but it can be done by vectoring the thrust of an engine,\nessentially blowing or pulling exhaust gases to one side or the other.\n\nThese active effects can be achieved using arrays of effectors including\nfluidic oscillators shaped as slots, trapezoids or other configurations or\nsweeping jets which inject air into the flow at various locations on an\naircraft. Such effectors have been used on drones flown by Lockheed Martin\nSkunk Works, called ICE (Innovative Control Effectors) and BAE Systems\u2019 Magma\nwhich blew air through slots in the trailing edges of their wings to maneuver.\n\nAurora and DARPA\u2019s CRANE program is developing a full-size aircraft to\ndemonstrate the viability and benefits of Active Flow Control. This model was\nused in wind tunnel testing during early stages of the program (Photo: Aurora\nFlight Sciences)\n\nA 757 ecoDemonstrator flown by a Boeing-NASA team in 2015 is the only full-\nscale aircraft to have partially integrated AFC control thus far. It used\nsweeping jets to blow compressed air in arcs across the airliner\u2019s vertical\ntail in an attempt to improve aerodynamic efficiency.\n\nElectric AFC techniques use arrays of electrodes to discharge aerodynamic or\nelectrical pulses to locally alter airflow. Effectors called synthetic jets \u2013\nmillimeter-wide openings in the aircraft surface that open into centimeter-\nwide cavities with diaphragms \u2013 rely on rapid voltage pulses to make\ndiaphragms oscillate inward or outward, creating airflow sucking or blowing\neffects, much like a human lung.\n\nElectrically powered plasma actuators discharge pulses of electricity into the\nair through electrodes. The heat from the electricity turns the air into\nplasma, thermally altering flow vectors. All of these techniques have been\nresearched through decades of AFC experiments in laboratories, wind tunnels\nand small-scale aircraft.\n\nMany of the AFC tools that DARPA is seeking to highlight with CRANE will be\nexemplified in the full-scale X-plane that Aurora Flight Sciences will build.\n\n## The I believe button\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re actually going to fly with AFC is a big step forward,\u201d\nDARPA\u2019s CRANE program manager, Richard Wlezien, says. Wleizen has worked on\nAFC concepts for nearly 40 years, including in a previous DARPA program, but\nCRANE represents something new he affirms.\n\nCRANE will be the first full-scale experimental active flow control airplane\nand the first to fully integrate AFC into its flight control system.\n\n\u201cFull-scale\u201d was determined by DARPA as a 7,000 lbs (3,175 kg) aircraft with a\n30ft (9.1m) wingspan. The wingspan is roughly equivalent to that of an F-16,\nbut the similarity is merely coincidental Wleizen explains.\n\nDARPA sought dimensions that provide room enough for an engine that can propel\nthe AFC X-plane to speeds of up to Mach 0.67 (around 500mph/800km/h) and\ndemonstrate airplane-representative Reynolds numbers \u2013 dimensionless\nquantities that help predict fluid flow patterns in different situations. AFC\nhas been done at model scale Wleizen says, \u201cBut it behaves differently at a\nlower Reynolds number than it does at full scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aurora\u2019s CRANE program manager, Kevin Uleck, the X-plane\u2019s\nrealistic \u2013 if not large \u2013 size and Reynolds number characteristics click the\n\u201cI believe\u201d button that DARPA seeks to hit, inspiring others to take up and\napply the concepts it investigates. He adds that the scale of the experimental\naircraft will yield test results widely applicable to a \u201c5,000 lbs, 50,000\nlbs, or 100,000 lbs aircraft.\u201d\n\nAurora Flight Sciences has built 30 X-planes during its 30 years of existence.\nThe company\u2019s in-house experience is bolstered by parent company Boeing, whose\nflap-shoulder blowing AFC work, including on the ecoDemonstrator it will lean\non.\n\n\u201cWe are going to leverage the Boeing enterprise for CRANE, combining it with\nAurora\u2019s X-plane know-how,\u201d Uleck explains.\n\nUleck came to his position with no background in AFC but says, \u201cI always\nasked, how does the Boeing effector approach compare with other AFC approaches\nlike trailing-edge Coanda blowing, and that spawned this idea of making our\nX-plane modular so that we can evaluate and flight test different AFC\neffectors.\u201d\n\n## A modular X-plane\n\nWidely circulated artwork showing Aurora\u2019s AFC X-plane design shows a co-\nplanar, joined-wing design that does not definitively indicate what an AFC-\ncontrolled aircraft will look like.\n\nDARPA\u2019s Richard Wleizen merely calls it \u201ca vehicle that\u2019s been designed such\nthat it can be controlled by AFC.\u201d Kevin Uleck says the design looks the way\nit does in part because AFC efficacy \u201cis a function of aircraft planform,\u201d and\nthat there could be several AFC planforms.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to conceive a demonstrator that can accommodate all types of\nactive flow control in a diverse range of aircraft planforms and uses for AFC,\nwhether for high-lift, flight control or other objectives,\u201d says Aurora\u2019s\ngovernment programs lead, Graham Drozeski.\n\nThe X-plane will have three levels of configurability. The first arises from\nits co-planar shape which incorporates different wing sweep angles within one\nairframe. The forward wing section has a 55 \u030a sweep, the trailing outer wing\nhas a 30 \u030a sweep, and the aft empennage-wing has a 20 \u030a forward-sweep. The\ndesign\u2019s vertical tails have yet another sweep angle.\n\n\u201cThose four different flying surfaces all represent different aero elements\nthat we characterized during the tools-design process and we built them into\nthe X plane,\u201d Uleck says.\n\nRichard Wleizen explains that the range of different wing sweeps that Aurora\u2019s\ndesign can simultaneously accommodate was one of the factors that led DARPA to\nselect it over designs from other CRANE Phase 1 competitors Lockheed Martin\nand BAE Systems. Along with wing aspect ratio, wing sweep has a significant\nimpact on the effectiveness of AFC.\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the DARPA CRANE program X-plane being developed by\nAurora\n\nWleizen points out that most previous AFC research was done with models and\nsubscale drones that employed un-swept wings. The opportunity to evaluate\ndifferent AFC techniques across different sweeps within a single test flight\nwill yield important insights he affirms.\n\nIn addition, the entire outboard wing section can be interchanged. An\nalternative section can be built independently by a third party and then\nbrought to the airplane for flight testing with different AFC effector\nstrategies.\n\nOn a second level, Aurora\u2019s design also allows for an array of 14 effectors\nwhich can be changed from one type to another \u2013 fluidic oscillators, steady\njets and zero-net mass-flux actuators collectively or individually. A third\nlevel of configurability comes from the design\u2019s ability to incorporate coanda\nblowing across any of its trailing edges.\n\nThe X-plane Aurora is building for DARPA will focus on control via pneumatic\nAFC techniques but its inherent flexibility will allow for its use as a test\nplatform beyond CRANE.\n\n\u201cLife after DARPA\u201d is something Wleizen says the Agency fully expects for the\nX-plane. DARPA is actively working on plans to turn the aircraft over to other\nUS government organizations once CRANE is complete. These may evaluate other\nAFC approaches and may even integrate non-Aurora-designed arrays, effectors\nand outer wings.\n\nWleizen adds that DARPA has invested in work done by the Georgia Tech Research\nCorporation in developing a digital AFC design tool which is founded on a\nlarge data set that takes in planform and actuation methods generated within\nCRANE and outside. As with the X-plane itself, the Agency is looking to\ntransition this tool to other government entities so that it may come into\ncommon use.\n\n\u201cWe are not just going to provide data,\u201d Wleizen explains, \u201cwe are going to\nprovide a design tool that can be used for other vehicles.\u201d\n\nActive flow control could be used in blended wing aircraft such as this\nproposed stealthy refueling tanker aircraft\n\n## Creating a tool\n\nThe scope of CRANE has purposeful limits. Aurora\u2019s X-plane will still have\nbasic conventional controls for takeoff and landing. It will switch to AFC\ncontrol once aloft in cruise. It is not intended to be a highly maneuverable\nvehicle, but rather a platform to prove AFC effectiveness with a view to\npotential aerodynamic efficiency and high-lift benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking at the controllability of the aircraft,\u201d Wleizen stresses.\n\nThis contrasts with the recent demonstration of a tail-less AFC-controlled\nsmall drone at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where researchers\ndemonstrated a capability to maneuver at high angles of attack using trailing-\nedge coanda blowing.\n\nThe program\u2019s results are intriguing, but may not necessarily translate to\nfull-scale AFC-controlled aircraft which would have significantly different\nReynolds numbers.\n\nAurora\u2019s X-plane is really meant to \u201cdeliver tools to DARPA\u201d and the broader\naerospace sector says Drozeski. \u201cThe true output of the program is not just\nthat our aircraft flies, but that it puts a stake in the ground that proves\nthe tools are right.\u201d\n\nDrozeski and Uleck agree that AFC tools and techniques will find their way\nonto aircraft, conventional or otherwise. This will initially be to achieve\nsingle objectives such as stealth, lift performance and energy efficiency,\nrather than a fully AFC-controlled aircraft.\n\nNeither denies that such integration could be seen on aircraft that Boeing is\ndeveloping including the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing aircraft it is developing\nwith NASA or the blended wing-body concepts it is developing for strategic\nairlifter and aerial refueling tanker aircraft. In the future, a range of\naircraft of different configurations from advanced air mobility eVTOLs to\nsixth-generation fighters could theoretically benefit from an augmenting AFC\ncapability for specific flight and mission phases.\n\nHigh-aspect wings, such as this truss braced wing concept from Boeing, could\nuse active flow control technologies to improve performance (Photo: Boeing)\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful,\u201d Drozeski says, \u201cwe hope the data will be used by an\naircraft designer who is designing a new aerial refueling aircraft, unmanned\nor eVTOL aircraft. He uses the data and realizes, \u2018I could have a smaller\ntail, I could have a slower stall speed, a higher bring-back weight to an\naircraft carrier.\u201d\n\nAFC is an old concept and we are only now beginning to realize its potential\nas a conditions-based control mechanism or as a stand-alone vehicle control\nmethodology. The DARPA and Aurora X-plane is an important next step on the\npath to making AFC another instrument in the aircraft designer\u2019s toolbox.\n\nShare.
