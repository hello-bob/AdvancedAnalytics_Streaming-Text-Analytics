Before Instagram\nbecame a competition for the lowest common denominator, there were a few\nphotographers I followed. They consistently shared captivating images, always\nmanaging to evoke a sense of inspiration with each viewing of their work.\n\nI wasn\u2019t alone in this appreciation\u2014over time, they gained more recognition\nand accumulated larger followings. Or perhaps it was the other way around. The\n\u2018larger following\u2019 meant they were able to monetize their audience. However,\nsoon the tail was wagging the dog.\n\nAs the years passed, I noticed them sharing more frequently, yet the quality\nof their work declined. They gradually transitioned from being exceptional to\nmerely average. I suppose this is what they mean by \u201cregression to the mean.\u201d\nAlthough Sir Francis Galton, a 19th-century scientist, originally used this\nphrase to describe the heights of children, its significance has since\nexpanded. You may be familiar with the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx, an urban\nmyth suggesting that players or teams featured on the magazine\u2019s cover would\nexperience a decline in performance\u2014a prime example of it.\n\nThis phenomenon is affecting those who earn their livelihoods by creating\ncontent on the Internet. Initially, it was the photographers, then the\nYouTubers I followed. They were once entertaining and intriguing, but now they\nseem to be pandering to the algorithms. The reality of the algorithmic world\nis that it rarely rewards brevity and excellence. Most modern media algorithms\nare tuned to reward engagement.\n\nEngagement comes either from posting to the platform more frequently or to\nwhat the algorithm decides is trending and fits a certain format. Machines\nthen expose the content to as many people as they think it should. Engagement\nand reach go hand-in-hand in the modern content world.\n\nThese days the ideal recommended \u201calgorithmic\u201d length for a YouTube video is\nabout 14 minutes, while Instagram wants you to post 90-second Reels. Of\ncourse, engagement also comes from clickbait headlines or content that is\nsupposed to provoke a reaction.\n\nIt is hardly a surprise then that the photography philosophers are primarily\noccupied with camera reviews, while landscape YouTubers produce fewer\nphotographs and more comedy or van life videos\u2014all to keep the content\nflowing. Consequently, most of them have become uninteresting, a damning fate\nin our machine-powered attention-driven economy.\n\nI compare these algorithm-driven content producers to genuine creatives\u2014those\nwho have earned my subscription, notifications, and even clicks on their\nsponsored links. Why? Because they produce thoughtful, well-crafted, and\nauthentic video narratives that inform, educate, and, most importantly,\nstimulate my mind.\n\nMorten Hilmer creates lengthy, immersive videos about wildlife photography.\nHis channel rivals National Geographic, captivating me with its ability to\ntransport into his world. Another favorite channel of mine is Veritasium,\nwhere Derek Muller, a scientist, manages to make even the most obscure topics\nengaging. Then there\u2019s Lost Lakes by Jonathan Kelly, a former Canadian tech\nindustry executive who traded it all to pursue his passion for exploring the\n\u201cCanadian Lakes\u201d and camping in the great outdoors. His videos, like Hilmer\u2019s,\nare deliberate and thought-provoking, devoid of the rush to churn out mere\n\u201ccontent.\u201d\n\nThis trend is not confined to YouTube or Instagram; it\u2019s prevalent across the\ntext-based Internet. Newsletters, blog posts, and online articles are losing\nsignificance as they conform to the demands of a content machine driven more\nby algorithms and revenue than by serving the reader or customer. Recently, a\nfriend recommended a technology newsletter, so I signed up. However, I soon\nrealized that the primary objective was not to inform or educate but to \u201cgrow\u201d\nand \u201cscale\u201d the writer\u2019s eventual business.\n\nAnd not just newsletters \u2014 even the rapidly expanding podcast ecosystem is\nfollowing the all too familiar trajectory of increased output and decreasing\nquality. The chase for bigger numbers leads to the ultimate sin \u2014 forgetting\nthat you exist in the service of your reader, listener, and viewer.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced this phenomenon too. And that was before algorithms took\ncontrol of the modern ecosystem.\n\nDuring my time as a professional writer, I learned that my creative\nproductivity waned after reaching around 1250 words. While I could push\nthrough and write more, the quality inevitably suffered. I began repeating my\nwords and thoughts to meet the requirements to get the job done. It was a\nvaluable lesson. While consistent writing is crucial, it\u2019s equally important\nto recognize one\u2019s creative limits. This qualitative boundary extends beyond\nwork on the Internet; it permeates various aspects of life.\n\nI used to enjoy listening to a particular cricket commentator whose eloquent\nlanguage and leisurely style enhanced the experience of watching slow,\nsometimes meandering games. His voice was a rare treat, fostering a strong\nconnection. However, in today\u2019s landscape, it is ubiquitous\u2014featured in IPL\ngames, YouTube videos, and other broadcasts. His poetic commentary, unique\ninsights, and rare value proposition\u2014what made him special\u2014have been diluted\nby overexposure. The commentator has become average, at best, and a cliche\nmachine at worst. I don\u2019t fault him for capitalizing on opportunities, but\nthere comes a point where it\u2019s essential to decline and take a break.\n\nI\u2019m currently undertaking a 366-photo project, sharing one photo per day.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s been challenging, and I find myself struggling to maintain my\nartistic integrity. My inner artist urges me to pause and reconsider my\napproach. Perhaps I will. The real challenge lies not in giving up but in\ndiscovering a new approach.\n\nCan I adapt my landscape-honed style to urban environments? How do I\nincorporate the colors of modern life? These are the questions I face.\nHowever, if I find straying too far from my internal quality standard, it may\nspell the end of the project.\n\n#### Related Reading:\n\n> Social Internet Is Dead.

Christy White says:\n\nApril 7, 2024 at 9:41 am\n\nThank you for your thoughtful post, Om. I struggle with this concept too. In\nmy case, it\u2019s almost self-destructive. Once, I \u201cwent viral\u201d with an article. I\nwas even called out in the New York Times (as a \u201crelationship writer\u201d). When\nthat happened, I disappeared. I didn\u2019t write for many months. I made sure I\nwas forgotten. And it\u2019s never happened again. I consider that I was self-\ndestructive. But there\u2019s a part of me that knew it was bad. I didn\u2019t want the\npublicity, the exposure. It felt inauthentic, dangerous. Problematic. Of\ncourse, I do want to \u201cviews,\u201d and the \u201clikes.\u201d But I don\u2019t want to be run by\nthem. It\u2019s a complex tension.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1.

It might be a good\nlesson for others to learn from you. Also, for your comment it seems you were\nvery true to yourself. Thank you for reading.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  3.

Same goes for your\nphotography, which I found before your blog. So, I guess I\u2019m saying, you be\nyou. You\u2019re the engineer, I\u2019m the rider. You have a special voice\n(\ud83d\ude09).....don\u2019t lose it. Have a nice day!\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Jason says:\n\nApril 8, 2024 at 3:23 pm\n\nYour comment about the cricket announcer reminds me of what is happening to Al\nMichaels in the NFL. Except in Al\u2019s case, his smart, measured (and dare I say\ndulcet) tones are being slowly but surely sidelined in favor of boisterous,\nover-the-top announcers who treat every third play as if it were one of the\nmost exciting, amazing things they\u2019ve ever seen. I hate it.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
