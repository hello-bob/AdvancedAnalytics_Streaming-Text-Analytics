If you want to scoop me, or investigate\nthe data yourself, you can download the answers of the 5500 people who agreed\nto have their responses shared publicly. Out of concern for anonymity, the\npublic dataset will exclude or bin certain questions2.

I binned age to the nearest 10 years and deleted the finer-grained\nethnicity question. I binned all incomes above $1,000,000 into \u201chigh\u201d, and\nremoved all countries that had fewer than ten respondents (eg if you said you\nwere from Madagascar, it would have made you identifiable, so I deleted that).\nIf you need this information for some reason, email me.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n42 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n42\n\nShare this post\n\n#### ACX Survey Results 2024\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n253\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### ACX Survey Results 2024\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n253 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\ndeletedApr 19\u00b7edited Apr 19Comment deletedExpand full comment  \n---  \n  \nTheloApr 19Download the xlsx / csv file linked in the post, it contains\nexactly that.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nPhil GetzApr 19Derp.

Self report surveys are notoriously unreliable for\nquestions about sex lives to the point of uselessness. There has been some\ntentative study of the behavior of the lying themselves; how much the\ndeviation from the \"true\" number is, if the deviation follows a predictable\ntrend etc. But these studies have the exact same problem as the originals.

It all seems speculative though.Were I to\nspeculate even further, I don't think its entirely just people giving outright\nfalse numbers. Rather there are edge cases: oral sex, anal sex, homosexual\nexperimentation, PiV sex that is quickly abandoned for various reasons.

My total is about 20, which\nI think is pretty average for someone who's been around for a while, but if\nit's higher than average I don't care. If it's higher than average and\ntherefore I count as a slut in some people's minds, good grief, I don't care.\nI've got nothing against sluts. What even is a slut? A woman who enjoys sex\nand doesn't try to keep the total number of partners really low? Sounds like a\nreasonable take on life to me. My female friends mostly have the same\nattitude. Sometimes this 89% male setting (according to most recent survey)\nsounds remarkably ignorant about the actual women of the present era.

(and then\nsay 'yes I'm in a relationship' where the guy is 'nah, we're casual/friends\nwith benefits, it's not like we're dating').I recently learned the term\n\"situationship\", as in \"I'm in a situationship\". Not a relationship, something\nslightly more than casual, something like 'friends with benefits' but you\ndon't need to be friends (e.g. sometimes you have sex with that guy from work,\nso you're 'in a situationship'). Me, I would just have called that old-style\n\"casual sex\"/\"sleeping around\", but I'm not modern enough for the subtleties\nof today's youth.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nSophiaApr 19\u00b7edited Apr 19Thank you for asking. That's was me (and some other\npeople, I see). I'm solo poly, and currently have four regular partners (one\nof whom I live with) and some vague number of FWBs. The key to this large\nnumber is that most weekends, I go to a local sex club for an orgy and say yes\na lot. It doesn't occupy too much of my life or my mind; it's kind of like\njuggling a fifth romantic partner, in a way.I'm a woman in my early 40's and\nsomewhat conventionally attractive, so I'm reasonably popular and tend to\naverage about 10-15 sex partners (about 90% male) per night that I go. Of\ncourse, the community there is ever evolving, so there's a lot of duplication\nfrom week to week and estimating exactly how many unique sex partners that\nI've had is a complicated modeling problem, but I've been doing this for about\n8 years now, minus a couple for covid, on a frequency ranging from monthly to\nweekly, and so I made my best estimate.And yes, I do consider myself quite\nskilled, thank you. Practice really does help, and the wide variety of\npartners, each with their own needs, is ideal for mastering a variety of\ntechniques and tricks.As for why...well, it's partially because it's fun,\nobviously, but mostly it feels like a community service (in a good way). A lot\nof people aren't getting as much sex as they really need to flourish, and\nthat's a thing I seem to be unusually well psychologically suited to help them\nwith, so I do. This city and this community are important to me and have given\nme a lot, and this is my way of giving back. I'm a slut because I feel deeply\nthat it's the right thing to do.Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nDrossophiliaApr 19How did you get into that?

I don't know what the\ndifference is. Is it my autism? My autogynephilia? Dumb luck? Some combination\nof the three, I guess.Good luck to you, and I definitely encourage\nexperimentation.

I assume you retain function, do you think that's entirely a\nfunction of your surgeon, or of the type of surgery, or both? Also I don't\nknow if you've had FFS, and if you think that's contributed anything to your\nexperience? Part of the reason why I've put off surgery for so long is that\nthe prospect of going through the process to find a surgeon/team that's good\nenough seems so daunting, and the consequences so important.Expand full\ncommentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nSophiaApr 19My surgeon (Dr. Chettawut, in Bangkok) does seem to have some\ntechniques that I've never seen replicated, so I'd have to say it's a\ncombination of both. I have full function, and can orgasm both from clitoral\nstimulation and from penetration, though it took me several years of practice\nafter surgery to really get good at the latter. I've had bottom surgery and\nbreast augmentation (both with Chettawut) but no FFS; I'm genetically lucky\nenough that I don't feel that I need it; I'm already generally read as a woman\nwith a particularly striking nose and jawline, and I'm happy with that.I agree\nthat it's super important to pick a good surgeon; I owe a lot of my happiness\nto Dr. Chettawut's skill and I've known trans women whose experiences after\nbottom surgery have been a lot less positive.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nDrossophiliaApr 19\u00b7edited Apr 19Wow, gotcha!

I really\nreally hope that nobody is being tricked into same-sex activity (or if you\nprefer, what they may very reasonably view as same-sex activity). But I've\nseen transgender activists outright say that they don't have to disclose their\ntrue sex to a sexual partner, and the idea that this could be happening (and\nthat after years of laughing at the idea as beyond silly, the lgbt movement\ncould be actually tricking people into unwanted homosexual acts, and simply\nrules-lawyering the definitions to deny it) is horrifying.It looks from the\ncontext like Wanda is primarily reacting to this possibility, although I could\nbe wrong.EDIT: Oh and by the way, all of the above applies to gay people being\ntricked into heterosexual sex as well, which I think is far far more common\nsince they're already in a community with strong taboos against questioning\ntrans ideology.Expand full commentReply (7)Share  \n---  \n  \nBoinuwrote Badly17 hrs agoIt's not a particularly compelling question, though\nit certainly fits into the grand tradition of Just Asking Questions.I'd expect\nsomeone who's been part of a local sex-savvy community for eight years would\nbe fairly well known in that scene and have things sorted out.

The club explicitly holds itself out as a place where\ntrans people are welcome and should be expected; this is, in fact, among the\ncode of conduct rules that people agree to with entering the club.

I have a prominent tattoo with the transgender symbol featured.But no, I\ndon't verbally state, unprompted, before each encounter that I'm trans. That's\nnot a necessity by the social norms of this community (it would, in fact, be\nconsidered unusual), and if you don't like those norms, you shouldn't be\nattending these events.Have there been cases when straight men have had sex\nwith me and gone home not knowing I'm trans?

My\nwife teaches at a publicly-funded charter in my local area. Her pay is average\nfor public schools in the area. Note that this school is still fully publicly\nfunded. There's no tuition for students to attend, and there's no private\ninstitution or church running the program from the background. It's a non-\nprofit organization.She used to teach at a public school in a different region\nof the US. Her experience teaching at a charter school versus a district\npublic school:1\\. Charters have fewer requirements against teachers that have\nbuilt up over the years under the force of bureaucratic momentum. This means\nshe's less burdened with some D or R lawmaker's 'reform' effort they\nimplemented 5-10-15 years back but never checked up on it to see if it worked\nor was even net-positive (mostly not). Much more teacher empowering for\ndecisions to be localized. Much less draining on already-stretched teacher\ntime.2\\. No district means much of the school's success or failure is\ndependent on the competency of local administration. As such, poor admin is a\nrisk to the whole school, with little teacher recourse. Fewer resources to\nbackfill positions in case of unexpected teacher vacancies and the like. Much\nless stability from independent charters (though maybe some of these multi-\nschool projects overcome this limitation, we have no experience with that).3\\.\nBack when our old district leadership was lobbying against school choice\nmovements in the state, one argument against allowing charter schools was that\nthey would hollow out the public schools as all the 'best' students left for\ncharters. Our experience has been the opposite: high-need students concentrate\nin charter schools. This includes classes that are majority autistic, ADHD,\netc. The result is a very high need for special education resources within the\ncharter schools, alleviating this sort of pressure from public schools.Oddly,\nthe result is the exact same kind of sorting the opposition to charter schools\nworried about, except that this sorting is voluntary. I'm not sure what to\nmake of this. On one hand, if the sorting is objectively bad then why do\nparents do this voluntarily? (They have to intentionally sign up for charters\nand transport the kids there, while their local public school will send a bus\nto pick their kids up.) If it's somehow bad in general, but good individually,\nshould the state be removing the choices parents of high-need students\nexercise to get their kids a better education? Is there another explanation\nfor what's happening here? I don't know.What I do know is that none of the\ndoomsday scenarios that were parroted when school choice was being discussed\nin our old district school were present in the city we moved to that had long-\nsince implemented school choice.In retrospect, it feels a lot like the\narguments I heard in states where people aren't allowed to pump their own gas.\nRemove that restriction? How could we? That's a major public safety risk!\nPredictions aren't prophecy, and sometimes a policy has been successfully\nimplemented elsewhere. Not all school choice movements have been successful,\nbut not all have been unmitigated disasters either.

I do feel instinctively that Islam\nwouldn't count as \"Christian\" (and a lot of Muslims would not be happy with\nthe label), just as Christianity probably wouldn't count as \"Jewish\" -- so, I\nguess, the question is how do we define \"Christianity\" in a way that includes\nthe diversity of Christian thought (including trinitarians and\nnontrinitarians, Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians, and groups like the\nMormons) while simultaneously *excluding* Islam, Baha'i, etc.Expand full\ncommentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nDeiseach13 hrs agoCertainly, early thought considered Islam a Christian heresy\nrather than a new religion of its own - see Muhammad and Ali in Hell in\nDante's \"Divine Comedy\", where they are put in with the\nschismatics:http://teachmiddleeast.lib.uchicago.edu/historical-\nperspectives/middle-east-seen-through-foreign-eyes/islamic-period/image-\nresource-bank/image-02.htmlI think Islam and Mormonism can be seen to be\nheresies, due to carrying over certain Christian doctrines, but they are new\nfaiths of their own as well due to the different understanding of those.Expand\nfull commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nFLWAB11 hrs ago\u00b7edited 11 hrs agoI don't think you can keep the Mormons while\nkeeping out the Muslims if you define Christianity based on doctrine:\ntheologically, Islam is much closer to \"orthodox\" Christianity than the\nMormons are.

It's part of the Abrahamic tradition and regards Jesus of\nNazareth as a divine figure.2\\. A major component of the religion's scripture\ncomes from the body of tradition from which the Council of Nicea selected the\ncanonical New Testament.Mormonism pretty clearly hits both these marks. When\npeople argue that Mormonism isn't Christian, they're usually using a narrower\ndefinition of Christian, such as adherence to an understanding of the Trinity\nthat's more or less compatible with the Nicene Creed. Mormons, as I understand\nit, believe that God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are entirely\nseparate beings, albeit closely aligned in purpose, and are not of the \"same\nsubstance\". Mormon Christology seems similar in broad strokes to the old Arian\nHeresy, which was specifically rejected by the Council of Nicea.Expand full\ncommentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nFLWAB11 hrs agoWouldn't Islam meet those marks as well?
