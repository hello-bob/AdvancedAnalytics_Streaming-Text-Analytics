The Virtue of Complexity in Return Prediction\n\nMay 6, 2024 - Portfolio Solutions Group\n\nTopics - Machine Learning Long-Short\n\nCan Machines Time Markets? The Virtue of Complexity in Return Prediction\n\nMachine learning techniques can be used to improve market timing strategies by\npicking up nonlinearities between the predictor variables (i.e., signals) and\nreturns. In order to identify the nonlinearities, complex models \u2013 i.e.,\nmodels where the number of predictor variables is larger than the number of\nreturn time series observations \u2013 must be estimated. More complex models\nbetter identify the true nonlinear relationships and, thus, produce better\nmarket timing strategy performance.\n\nThis \"virtue of complexity\" result is validated in three practical market\ntiming applications: timing the stock market, the bond market, and the\nlong/short value factor. The performance improvements are real but modest,\nconsistent with the view that machine learning applied to return prediction\nleads to evolutionary, not revolutionary, wealth gains.\n\nDownload\n\n##### Related Thinking\n\n  * ##### The Virtue of Complexity in Return Prediction\n\nJournal Article - March 1, 2024\n\n  * ##### Deep Value\n\nJournal Article - December 4, 2017\n\n  * ##### Can Machines \"Learn\" Finance?\n\nJournal Article - June 7, 2019\n\n  * ##### Back in the Hunt\n\nTrade Publication - November 11, 2015\n\nThis document is not intended to, and does not relate specifically to any\ninvestment strategy or product that AQR offers.
