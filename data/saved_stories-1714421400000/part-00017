He is best known for writing The Book of\nKnowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0644\n\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u064a\u0629, romanized: Kitab fi ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiya, lit. 'Book in\nknowledge of engineering tricks', also known as Automata) in 1206, where he\ndescribed 50 mechanical devices, along with instructions on how to construct\nthem. He is credited with the invention of the elephant clock.^[3] He has been\ndescribed as the \"father of robotics\" and modern day engineering.^[4]\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\nDiagram of a hydropowered perpetual flute from The Book of Knowledge of\nIngenious Mechanical Devices by Al-Jazari in 1206.\n\nAl-Jazari was born in the area of Upper Mesopotamia in 1136. Sources state his\nexact location is unknown, but they speculate he could have been born in\nJazirat ibn Umar, where he got the name Jazari from or Al-Jazira which was\nused to denote Upper Mesopotamia.^[5]^[6]^[7] The only biographical\ninformation known about him is contained in his Book of Knowledge of Ingenious\nMechanical Devices.^[8] Like his father before him, he served as chief\nengineer at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the\nArtuqids which ruled across Upper Mesopotamia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty\nof Mosul and later of Ayyubid general Saladin.^[9] Little is known about his\nethnic background, so he has been variously described as Arab,^[10]^[11]^: 21\n^[12]^[13] Kurdish^[14] or Persian.^[15]\n\nAl-Jazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical\nengineer than an inventor^[16] who appears to have been \"more interested in\nthe craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology\nwhich lay behind them\" and his machines were usually \"assembled by trial and\nerror rather than by theoretical calculation\".^[17] His Book of Knowledge of\nIngenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears\nin a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only\ndescribes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book's style\nresembles that of a modern \"do-it-yourself\" book.^[18]\n\nSome of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his\nmonumental water clocks, which was based on that of a Pseudo-Archimedes.^[19]\nHe also cites the influence of the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers for his fountains, al-\nSaghani for the design of a candle clock, and Hibatullah ibn al-Husayn (d.\n1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he\nmade to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices,\ntechniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in\nthe works by his precessors.^[11]^: 21\u201322\n\n## 1206 edition (Ahmet III 3472)[edit]\n\nThe Artuqid ruler Nasr al-Din Mahmud (r. 1201\u20131222) is known to have\ncommisionned the first edition of Al-J\u0101mi\u2018 f\u012b \u1e63in\u0101\u2018at al-\u1e25iyal of Ibn al-\nRazzaz al-Jazari, in April 1206 at the Artuqid court.^[20]^[21] This\nmanuscript is known as Ahmet III 3472, now in the Topkap\u0131 Saray\u0131 Library. The\nminiatures are thought to reflect various aspects of the Artuqid court at the\ntime.^[20] Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari was employed at the Artuqid court during\nthe last quarter of the 12th century, and this is the earliest known\nmanuscript of his opus.^[21]\n\n  * Court scene.

It was in these water-\nraising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components.\n\n### Saqiya chain pumps[edit]\n\nThe first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari's\nsaqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first\nimplied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of\nmaximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed\na water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than\nmanual labour, though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps\nprior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying\nwater in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times,^[35] and were\nin everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.^[36] Interestingly, the\ndepiction of the chain in al-Jazari's pump appears to be in the form of a\nM\u00f6bius strip, from long before the M\u00f6bius strip was first identified as an\nobject of study in mathematics.^[37]\n\n### Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston\nmotion[edit]\n\nCiting the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an\ninspiration,^[38] al-Jazari went on to describe his version of suction pipes,\nsuction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a\ncrankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he developed a twin-cylinder\nreciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which\ndrives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods\nof two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed\ncylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The\ndelivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single\noutlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct\nsignificance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is\nremarkable for three reasons:^[9]^[39]^[40]^[41]\n\n  * The first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump.\n  * The first application of the double-acting principle.\n  * The conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion via the crank-connecting rod mechanism.\n\nAl-Jazari's suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water,^[citation\nneeded] with the help of delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more\nefficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.^[42]\n\n### Water supply system[edit]\n\nal-Jazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and\nhydropower, which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its\nmosques and Bimaristan hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a\nscoop-wheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a\nwater channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.^[43]\n\n## Automata[edit]\n\nAl-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.^[44] He also\ncreated automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks,^[9] and\ninvented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata.^[34]\nAccording to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the Italian Renaissance inventor\nLeonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-\nJazari.^[45]\n\nMark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers,\nespecially al-Jazari, as follows:\n\n> Unlike the Greek designs, these Arab examples reveal an interest, not only\n> in dramatic illusion, but in manipulating the environment for human comfort.\n> Thus, the greatest contribution the Arabs made, besides preserving,\n> disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks, was the concept of\n> practical application. This was the key element that was missing in Greek\n> robotic science.^[46]\n\n> The Arabs, on the other hand, displayed an interest in creating human-like\n> machines for practical purposes but lacked, like other preindustrial\n> societies, any real impetus to pursue their robotic science.^[47]\n\n### Drink-serving waitress[edit]\n\nOne of al-Jazari's humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water,\ntea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the\ndrink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which\nthe waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.^[48]\n\n### Hand-washing automaton with flush mechanism[edit]\n\nAl-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism\nnow used in modern flush toilets. This device is another example of humanoid\nautomata. It consisted of a human figure, made from jointed copper, holding a\npitcher resembling a peacock in its right hand. The pitcher is made from brass\nand holds within it a chamber, divided into two parts by a metal plate. This\nmechanism aided the pouring of the water from the spout so that it was smooth\nand would not splutter. The reservoir in which the water is held is situated\nwithin the right-hand side of the human figure. An axle is fitted into the\nright elbow of the human figure so as to allow the liquid to pour from the\nreservoir through the spout of the pitcher. The left arm of the figure had a\nfixed weight which would raise and lower the arm which would hold a towel,\ncomb and mirror.\n\nThis automaton was designed to aid the king whilst he performed his ritual\nablutions. A servant of the king would carry the figure and place it next to a\nbasin that could hold liquid. The servant then turned a knob on the back of\nthe figure which opened a valve resulting in the pouring of water from the\nright hand of the figure into the basin. When the reservoir is nearly empty\nand most of the water has been poured a mechanism is prompted and the left\nhand of the figure, holding the towel, comb and mirror, is extended out in the\ndirection of the king so that he can dry himself and tend to his beard.^[49]\n\n### Peacock fountain with automated servants[edit]\n\nWater and its usages holds particular importance in Islam; both as being an\nintegral part of the pre-prayer washing processes wudu and ghusl, and a key\nfeature in Islamic gardens \u2013 four fountains featuring in the Paradise Garden;\nthe Islamic final resting place referenced in the Quran. Additionally, with\nMesopotamia being a naturally drought-ridden place, machines relating to water\nheld a significant function; in both a divine and practical sense.\n\nAn entire section of The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices was\ndevoted to fountain mechanisms, titled: \u2018On the construction in pools of\nfountains which change their shape, and of machines for the perpetual\nflute\u2019.^[50]\n\nAl-Jazari's \"peacock fountain\" was a more sophisticated hand washing device\nfeaturing humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E.\nRosheim describes it as follows:^[46]\n\n> Pulling a plug on the peacock's tail releases water out of the beak; as the\n> dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates\n> a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the\n> peacock and offer soap. When more water is used, a second float at a higher\n> level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure \u2013 with a\n> towel!\n\nAl-Jazari's Peacock Fountain\n\nThe basin of the \"peacock fountain\" formed the basin for performing wudu, and\nit would have been operated by a servant, who would have pulled the plug and\npositioned the peacock's beak; allowing the mechanism to release the water\ninto the basin in front of the user.^[51]\n\nHowever, whilst water moving objects such as the peacock fountain had\nritualistic usage, there is suggestion that water-moving hydraulics were put\nto profane use. Ayhan Aytes suggests that:^[52]\n\n> Many of the devices also had additional functions that contradicted divine\n> omnipotence. The most profane purpose of several of his hydraulic and\n> pnuematic automata was to get guests at parties drunk as quickly as\n> possible.\n\n### Musical robot band[edit]\n\nAl-Jazari's musical robot band.\n\nAl-Jazari's work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow\nof water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly\nintervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic\nswitching.^[9]\n\nAl-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic\nmusicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking\nparties. Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was\nan early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of\nthe mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump\ninto little levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to\nplay different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved\naround.^[53]\n\n### The water-clock of the drummers[edit]\n\nThe water-clock of the drummers\n\nThe water-clock of the drummers, which differs from the Musical robot band in\nthat it lacks a flute-playing doll and instead has two trumpeters, consists of\nseven wood-jointed male figures, including the aforementioned trumpeters as\nwell as two dolls playing cymbals and the rest playing other percussive\ninstruments.^[54] The mechanism in this specific automaton serves as a clock\nby producing a musical output once every hour, illustrating Al-Jazari\u2019s\nability to create multi-faceted automata that functioned on a practical and\nentertainment level. The motion of the automaton is initiated at daybreak by\nanother male doll, who stands at the edge of the frieze element of the design,\nmoving across until he reaches a specific point at which a carved falcon leans\nforward dropping a ball from its beak onto a cymbal.^[55] All mechanical\naspects of the automaton are then driven by water and a series of pistons and\ncables. Each hour water drains out of the main cistern to cause another bucket\nto tip over driving a water wheel that is connected to the musicians. The\nautomaton is described to \u2018perform a with a clamorous sound which is heard\nfrom afar\u2019 and could play several different tunes.^[56] Like many other\nautomatons by Al-Jazari, this was created to entertain guests at the royal\npalace.\n\n## Clocks[edit]\n\nAl-Jazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks. These\nincluded a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and\nhalf a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in\n1976^[34]^[57] Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered astronomical\nclocks which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars.\n\n### Candle clocks[edit]\n\nOne of al-Jazari's candle clocks.\n\nAccording to Donald Hill, al-Jazari constructed the most sophisticated candle\nclocks known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as\nfollows:^[9]\n\n> The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of\n> the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the\n> indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere\n> with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that\n> had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the\n> candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The\n> automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other\n> candle clocks of this sophistication are known.\n\nAl-Jazari's candle clock also included a dial to display the time and, for the\nfirst time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in\nmodern times.^[58]\n\n### Elephant clock[edit]\n\nMain article: Elephant clock\n\nThe elephant clock described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several\ninnovations. It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after\ncertain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the cymbal\nand a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first water clock to\naccurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length\nof days throughout the year.^[59]\n\nAutomatic castle clock of al-Jazari, 14th century copy.\n\n### Castle clock[edit]\n\nFurther information: Clock tower\n\nAl-Jazari's largest astronomical clock was the \"castle clock\", which was a\ncomplex device that was about 11 feet (3.4 m) high, and had multiple functions\nbesides timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and\nlunar orbits, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the\nshape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved\nby a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a\nmannequin, every hour.^[9]^[60]\n\nAnother feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically\nplay music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a\nwater wheel.^[23]\n\nAl-Jazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights.\nThese included geared clocks and a portable water-powered scribe clock, which\nwas a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his pen was synonymous\nto the hour hand of a modern clock.^[34]^[57] Al-Jazari's famous water-powered\nscribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum, London in\n1976.\n\n## Miniature paintings[edit]\n\nAlongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also\nan accomplished artist.
