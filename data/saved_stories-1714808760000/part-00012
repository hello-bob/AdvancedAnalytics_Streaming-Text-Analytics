Once a rare\nblot on the galactic landscape, these days it\u2019s far from the only stinker in\nthe canon\n\nBen Child\n\nShare\n\nCan it really be that there are Star Wars fans who see George Lucas\u2019s Episode\nI \u2013 The Phantom Menace, once considered the emblem of everything that went\nwrong with the long-running space saga, as a bona fide classic ripe for\nrehabilitation 25 years on? As the much-derided 1999 film returns to cinemas\nthis weekend, there are rumblings in the ether that millennials, and perhaps\nthose even younger, are completely unaware of just how much of a disaster it\nwas. Then again, perhaps those of us who remember its debut in cinemas should\nbe prepared to listen to voices from a new generation. Was it really so bad\nafter all?\n\nPart of the problem is that where it was once a rare blot on the galactic\nlandscape, a Star Wars movie that failed to live up to the glories of the\noriginal trilogy, these days it\u2019s far, far away from being the only rubbish\nfilm in the canon. In fact, it could be argued that when considering movies\nsuch as the execrable The Rise of Skywalker, the middling Solo: A Star Wars\nStory and the two painful prequel follow-ups, The Phantom Menace is closer to\nthe mean average for the saga than it is to the bottom of the Dagobah swamp.\n\nWhere once we were shocked that something so tonally misguided, blithely\nracist and prosaically bloodless could be tagged with the famous title, we now\nhave the Star Wars Holiday Special to remind us that it can get worse. Back at\nthe turn of the century, few of us were aware that 70s and 80s misfires like\nthis even existed \u2013 see also Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure and Ewoks:\nThe Battle for Endor \u2013 it being the pre YouTube era when all but the most\nstudious of geeks were blissfully ignorant of them.\n\nBeginning his journey towards evil as a whinging brat ... Jake Lloyd as Anakin\nSkywalker in The Phantom Menace.\n\nIn the early 80s, when I first learned of Star Wars, the only way to see the\noriginal trilogy was to catch it at the cinema, or hope against hope for a\ncatch-it-or-miss-it TV broadcast. Yes, we had VHS or Betamax but everything\nlooked terrible when recorded off the box, and it wasn\u2019t possible to watch the\nhome video editions of the full trilogy until 1986. The result is that the\nsaga had an air of extraordinary grandiosity, as if we were all breathing\nrarefied Tatooine air every time it came on the telly.\n\nThis meant that when The Phantom Menace finally hit cinemas, 16 years after\nReturn of the Jedi debuted in 1983, it took a while for some of us to realise\nthat this was a different sort of Star Wars. Yes, the original trilogy had\nalways been relatively child-friendly, with its fun, knockabout space larks,\nteddy bear aliens and only vague, retrospective references to potential\nincest. But this time the main protagonist seemed to be an actual child\n(albeit one who was destined to grow up to be Darth Vader) with an annoyingly\nstereotyped comedy sidekick, as if this was not so much a play on the 1940s\nmatinee adventure serials of Lucas\u2019s youthful fever dreams as an irritatingly\ncheesy 90s TV knock-off of the same.\n\nMany of us had spent decades imagining what Anakin Skywalker might be like\nunderneath that shiny black, gothic carapace. I bet very few ever imagined\nthat his journey towards evil would begin as a whinging brat with a penchant\nfor shouting \u201cyippee\u201d and telling weird angel stories.\n\nNor did we expect the story of the galactic republic\u2019s decline to be so\ntedious and technocratic, involving trade embargos, boring speeches to the\nsenate and hideous CGI robo-battles. Even Yoda lost all his sparkle when\nengaged in portentous Jedi council navel-gazing, while Ewan McGregor\u2019s Obi-Wan\nKenobi had the worst rat tail since the breakup of New Kids on the Block.\n\nThere are few obvious racialised cliches in the original trilogy, yet the\nhorribly cod-Caribbean Jar Jar Binks, offensively antisemitic Watto the slave\nmaster and those ghastly pan-Asian peeps from the Trade Federation are all\nunforgivably twisted caricatures. It is impossible to understand how Lucas\nwent from making a starry-eyed paean to the Japanese masters in the late 70s\nand early 80s to a ridiculous reimagining of space fantasy populated by the\nworst stereotypes known to the cosmos just a few decades later.\n\nI rewatch The Phantom Menace through my fingers, pinpricks of detail feeding\nthrough to the cerebrum. If you squint hard enough it\u2019s possible to recall\nonly a movie that features the greatest lightsaber battle of all time (Kenobi\nand Liam Neeson\u2019s Qui-Gon Jinn against Ray Park\u2019s demonically balletic Darth\nMaul), some wicked podracing scenes and the opening scene in which the Jedi\ncoolly see off a pair of lightning-quick, rapid-fire droidekas, as we finally\nget to see how impressive the order was in its prime.\n\nBut a handful of thrilling set pieces do not a classic Star Wars movie make.\nIf you are seeing it again at the cinema this weekend, a warning: it\u2019s just as\nbad as you remember.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Film\n  * Week in geek\n  * Star Wars\n  * Science fiction and fantasy films\n  * George Lucas\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
