With most of the workforce stuck\nat home, can the spirit of serendipitous collaboration survive in a Zoom\nworld?\n\nWritten by Tiernan Ray, Senior Contributing Writer June 24, 2020 at 11:36 a.m.\nPT\n\n### rank\n\n### change\n\n### trend\n\n1\n\nOpenAI's Voice Engine can now clone a voice from a 15-second clip\n\n2\n\nWaymo self-driving cars start delivering Uber Eats orders\n\n3\n\nApple releases ReALM AI model to outperform GPT-4\n\n4\n\nDALL-E now uses prompts to edit AI-generated images\n\nview trend report\n\nLate Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs stressed the importance of\nserendipity in Silicon Valley, by which he meant chance, unplanned encounters\nin person between tech employees. His successor, Tim Cook, Monday held a\nvirtual conference for developers in front of the empty seats of the Steve\nJobs Theater on Apple's Cupertino campus.\n\nApple Inc.\n\n### Apple\n\n  * Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things\n\n  * I've tried Vision Pro and other top XR headsets and here's the one most people should buy\n\n  * Apple M3 MacBook Air hands-on: These 3 new features stood out to me most\n\n  * Apple doubles the lifespan of your iPhone 15's battery, no update required\n\n  * Apple Vision Pro tricks: How to take perfect screenshots and recordings (and avoid weirdness)\n\nThe late Steve Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that when he\ncommissioned the headquarters for the animated film studio Pixar, in East Bay,\nJobs made sure it was an open structure, where everything converged on an\natrium. Jobs believed, as Isaacson described it, that creativity is a result\nof serendipity. Serendipity is the specific word he used, and to Jobs, it\nmeant in-person meetings. Jobs wanted the workplace to be optimally conducive\nto creating those chance encounters.\n\n\"There's a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be\ndeveloped by email and iChat \u2014 that's crazy,\" Jobs is quoted as having said.\n\"Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run\ninto someone, you ask what they're doing, you say 'Wow,' and soon you're\ncooking up all sorts of ideas.\"\n\nLike many things Jobs advocated, serendipity became a staple in Silicon\nValley. The giant, gleaming mothership of Apple headquarters in Cupertino,\nwhich Jobs helped design before his death in 2011, is a monument to that\nphilosophy.\n\nSerendipity, however, may not survive in a Zoom world.\n\nMonday, Jobs's hand-picked successor, Tim Cook, opened the annual Apple\ndeveloper conference by standing in front of an empty auditorium, the Steve\nJobs theater, built to house 921 people. Apple made the event an online-only\naffair this year as California remains in partial lockdown amidst COVID-19.\n\nSuch innovative handling of a pandemic is fascinating, and perhaps it will be\nthe norm for some time to come, at least for group activities.\n\nBut will it allow Silicon Valley the kind of random encounters Jobs believed\nare essential?\n\n\"Serendipity is in danger of being lost in the Zoom world,\" Andrew Feldman,\nchief executive of AI chip startup Cerebras Systems, located a short ways from\nStanford University, told ZDNet. \"It's a casualty of planning.\"\n\nSerendipity was introduced to the English language by the 18th-century writer\nHorace Walpole, who referred to making discoveries by accident. Jobs, in\nJobsian fashion, believed serendipity could be engineered. Silicon Valley's\ntech leaders are now grappling with a new challenge, how to engineer\nserendipity in a greatly constrained environment.\n\n\"I think what people are trying to figure out is how you create non-work-\nrelated, informal interactions on a platform like Zoom,\" said Tim Cabral,\nchief financial officer of cloud software vendor Veeva Systems, based in\nPleasanton, California.\n\n\"One of the things that I told my team was, the thing that I'm going to miss\nis the open door policy and just hallway conversation, or the walk-up, five-\nminute discussion, question, whatever,\" said Cabaral, contrasting traditional\noffice culture to work-at-home.\n\nCabral's solution has been a virtual open-door policy.\n\n\"Every day at nine o'clock in the morning, and at four o'clock in the\nafternoon, when I don't have other scheduled meetings, I have open office\nhours on Zoom,\" said Cabral. The experiment has \"worked okay\" so far, though\nit's been an adjustment for people given that video is associated with planned\nmeetings.\n\n\"People don't think about Zoom as social interaction, they think about it as\nbusiness meetings, and so they didn't know what to do with it,\" Cabral\nobserved.\n\nThe unbounded capacity of online video holds the prospect of huge gatherings,\nbut can they replicate the wide-open communal spaces that were becoming more\nand more common just before the pandemic?\n\nOne of the last big tech venues built in recent years, the $370 million\nheadquarters in Santa Clara of computer chip titan Nvidia, designed by\narchitecture firm Gensler, called \"Endeavor,\" is a kind of Mecca of physical\nmeet-ups. The 500,000-square-foot space features a collection of swooping,\nsoaring catwalks and embankments overlooking a central plaza, paths for\nemployees to move amongst one another on their way from open cubicle clusters\nto areas of stadium seating, plus a variety of nooks, bars, and terraced\nplatforms. It is a breathtaking site, a kind of ode to physical interaction.\n\nNvidia is building an even-larger structure next-door to Endeavor, named\nVoyager, that expected to be completed in the next couple of years.\n\nHow do you re-create that vast in-person forum on a computer screen?\n\nCloud software maker Five9, based in San Ramon, California, which sells call\ncenter technology, has implemented a kind of social roulette on Slack, with\nhelp from startup Donut Technologies.\n\nNvidia's \"Endeavor\" campus in Santa Clara, a 500,000-square-foot polygon with\ntons of open spaces, is a kind of ode to in-person interaction. What happens\nnow in a world drifting more and more to remote work?\n\nNvidia Inc.\n\nAs Five9 CEO Rowan Trollope explained, \"myself, my leadership team, and\nhundreds of other Five9 employees are in a Slack channel called Virtual\nCoffee, and what Donut does is, it will introduce you every two weeks to a\nrandom person in that Slack channel, and you have a meeting, a 15 minute, 20\nminute, let's grab a cup of coffee, virtually.\"\n\nMany Five9 employees have joined, and so, \"it's an example of leveraging\ntechnology to manufacture serendipity in a remote world,\" said Trollope.\n\nThe loss of in-person interactions manifests in other parts of the tech world,\nnot just the Valley. Bristol, England, which has emerged as a tech hub in the\nU.K. in recent years, has its own characteristic startup culture that includes\nthe very British ritual of high tea, as Nigel Toon, chief executive of AI chip\ndesigner Graphcore explained in a recent interview with ZDNet.\n\nPeople still \"tend to go for tea no matter the pandemic,\" Toon said, \"and lots\nor interesting conversation will happen.\"\n\nGraphcore has always been a big user of tools like Slack, he said, and never\nforced anyone to come into the office in normal times. In that respect, \"we've\nbuilt a working style and a work culture that allows some of that serendipity\nto happen online using some of these productivity tools.\"\n\n\"But, I think, ultimately, it is an issue,\" Toon conceded of the threat to\nserendipity. \"I think it is important, people getting together around the\nwhiteboard; I'm sure all tech companies, everybody remote working, there's\nprobably a 15%, 20% hit on productivity, would be my guess.\"\n\nSerendipity also has a bearing on the education that tech professionals\nreceive.\n\n\"We'll never return to where we were,\" Internet pioneer Leonard Kleinrock told\nZDNet in May, reflecting on the vast social changes taking place in higher\neducation. Kleinrock, a professor at UCLA, noted that the quarantine is\n\"challenging at a deeper level the value of a campus-based college education,\"\nincluding \"how much college education is social interaction versus putting\nstuff in your head.\"\n\nThe pandemic is proving that \"online education works,\" at least for some\nsettings, noted Kleinrock.\n\nStill, something may be lost in not having in-person interactions, he\nobserved. Kleinrock recalled his days as a PhD student at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology in the early 1960s. His fellow engineering students\nwould teach one another their respective skills at the blackboard. \"That was a\nwonderful environment just rubbing elbows, learning,\" he said. \"You don't get\nthat in this environment now, you see.\"\n\nIn the opinion of Feldman, the Cerebras CEO, it may be a deeper question of\nrethinking fundamental ways in which teams operate.\n\n\"Leaders need to think carefully about how to replicate the inadvertent but\nexceptionally productive conversations that in the past took place in the\nlunch room and at conferences.\"\n\n#### What would Steve Jobs think of today's Apple?\n\nFeldman cautions that serendipity might have more to do with the kinds of tech\nwork that inherently involve cross-pollination. In contexts where inventors\nwork in a more solitary fashion, it may be less important.\n\n\"Cross-pollination is particularly helpful if the innovation is a synthesis of\ndifferent things, techniques borrowed from different fields,\" observed\nFeldman.\n\nTo be sure, the new remote world can bring gains, and there are some in the\nValley who believe that the end result will be a net positive.\n\n\"One of the wonderful things for me in this current situation is, it really\nforces you to rethink what you do and how you do it.\" said Gary Dickerson,\nchief executive of semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials, in Santa\nClara.\n\n\"I've been a big advocate of reinventing how we work.\"\n\nDickerson doesn't mind spending less time getting on a plane these days.\nAlthough most of the staff still works from home, Dickerson goes into the\nApplied offices three or four days a week.\n\n\"The serendipity thing, I get it,\" he said, \"but for me, personally, I think\nI'm better now, I'm more creative.\"\n\nApplied's teams \"have the time to focus now rather than being distracted or\nspending time on airplanes or jet-lagged coming back,\" he added.\n\n\"In some ways, I think the communications are even better, more focused,\" said\nDickerson. \"We can think deeper, we have time to dig into different things.\"\n\nIf many people in the Valley warm to the benefits that Dickerson describes,\nthen the prevailing attitude, when combined with fears of the virus, could\ntend to favor a permanent or at least semi-permanent culture of remote work.\n\nTrollope, the CEO of Five9, whose business is selling software to enable\ncontact centers to let employees work from home, thinks such jobs will stay at\nhome rather than go back to office buildings. He noted a number of\nefficiencies, including the ability of at-home call operators to schedule\ntheir days more flexibly. They can choose to spend hours in the middle of the\nday handling household and parental responsibility, and take calls during the\nhours they choose.\n\nStill, Trollope sees a reckoning. Some of the work world, especially employees\nfocused on careers, will realize things have gone too far in the direction of\nisolation, he predicted.\n\n\"Most people are going to have swung so far to the work-from-home world,\nbelieving that it's going to solve all of these problems,\" said Trollope.\n\"There's probably a handful of these other factors where the pendulum will\nswing back more towards at-work, or at-work, in-person, for certain kinds of\njobs.\"\n\nBeing physically present with a few colleagues may at some point become an\nedge for ambitious workers, an asymmetry in career potential.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you've got the advantage, you walk out of the meeting,\nyou're clapping the boss on the back, let's go to lunch next week.\"\n\n\"That's going to create an effect that ratchets back up the need to be in\nperson, because people want to get ahead in their careers,\" he predicted.\n\n\"If Joe's in the office, Mary is going to want to be in the office, too.\"\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### Could Windows finally get ARM right and outperform Apple silicon?\n\n### Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too\nlate)\n\n### How AI can rescue IT pros from job burnout and alert fatigue\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
