This leads to unintended visual outcomes on\nwebsites, disrupting carefully designed user interfaces.\n\n## Context \u00b6\n\nAs the Head of Product and Technology at edding AG, I manage a team that owns\nthe easycheck product. Part of it is a mobile-only frontend for driver\u2019s\nlicense verification, so the team is used to facing continual challenges with\nmobile web environments. However, there is a significant issue with the\nSamsung Internet browser and its forced dark mode.\n\n## Identifying the Problem \u00b6\n\nSamsung\u2019s forced dark mode, intended to facilitate nighttime reading and\nconserve battery life, automatically alters websites\u2019 color schemes without\nallowing developers to influence them. While well-meaning, this feature can\ndistort the design and usability of web applications, especially when precise\nvisual presentation is critical.\n\nThis became problematic when we attempted to place dark text over an animated\nbright video for a tutorial. The forced dark mode changed the color of the\ntext but to almost no extent the tone of the background, making it nearly\ninvisible against the bright background.\n\nI have reproduced this issue in a detailed example to understand the behavior.\n\nTry it for yourself: Live / Github.\n\nThe results:\n\n  * Everything that is behind prefers-color-scheme: dark is ignored.\n  * Everything that is behind prefers-color-scheme: light is rendered.\n  * Texts and Backgrounds are changed by an unknown algorithm.\n  * Videos, Images, and SVGs are toned down, which makes sense. Inverted pictures would look really stupid. The funny thing is that even when a CSS class colors an SVG, it still counts as an image resource and behaves like an image, not like text that is colored by a CSS class.\n\nI don\u2019t know what algorithm they use, but it is bonkers and unforseable. In\ngeneral, brighter colors (yellow, orange) seem to be more inverted, but other\ncolors (blues, greens, purples) are just a little bit toned down.\n\n## Expected Behaviour \u00b6\n\nAs a heavy dark mode user (mainly on iOS), I don\u2019t have a problem with the\nmagic that Samsung applies here - for websites with only a light and no dark\ntheme! But when website developers provide a dark theme via a preferred color\nscheme, it should always be preferred (hence the name!), and a forced dark\nmode should only be a fallback. Currently, Samsung ignores web standards, and\ndevelopers can\u2019t override this.\n\n## Seeking Resolution \u00b6\n\nI hope it is a bug because they mention a (in my opinion, more) correct\nbehavior on Samsung Internet\u2019s blog.\n\nBesides that, nobody on Stack Overflow can find it out, and Hacker News also\nlacks an outrage about this topic.\n\nI contacted the lead developer of the forced dark mode feature at Samsung\nInternet. However, he has not been associated with Samsung for over four years\nand redirected me to his boss, whom I have now contacted.\n\nThis letter calls Samsung to urgently address and rectify their browser\u2019s\nforced dark mode functionality. Developers must be able to control how their\nsites are displayed to ensure all users, especially in specialized B2B\napplications like ours, receive the intended experience without compromise.\n\n## Call to Action \u00b6\n\nI encourage everyone to try this out and visit the product they are\nresponsible for in a Samsung internet browser (it can be downloaded for every\nAndroid phone, not just Samsung).\n\nAlso, Please challenge my code. Perhaps I have made an error, and there is a\nway to make it work correctly after all?\n\n#### Article Meta\n\n  * Published On: 2024-04-22\n  * Found a typo?
