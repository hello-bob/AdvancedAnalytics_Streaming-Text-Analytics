Electric vehicles are projected to surge from 40\nmillion on the road today to a whopping 230 million by 2030. But to get there,\nwe\u2019d need a literally \u201cearth shattering\u201d 700% increase in the production of\nrare earth metals like neodymium. Here\u2019s the catch: these critical elements\nare already under strain. Mining them is often devastating to the environment,\nand just a handful of countries hold a 70% global chokehold on their refining.\nSo, the question becomes: can the EV boom avoid getting strangled by its own\nreliance on rare earth metals?\n\nCan the EV boom avoid getting strangled by its own reliance on rare earth\nmetals?\n\n### Quick Background on Rare Earth Metals (REMs)\n\nWhile not truly rare in the Earth\u2019s crust, REMs are tricky for us to extract\non the surface. They often occur in complex mixtures, making separation and\nextraction both tough on labor and the environment. Yet these 17 elements have\nunique properties that make them vital for modern technology:\n\n  * Unmatched Magnetic Strength: Neodymium (NdFeB) magnets are a cornerstone of EV technology. They pack a much higher magnetic punch than traditional magnets, allowing for the creation of lighter, more efficient electric motors. This translates to better range, faster acceleration, and overall improved performance.\n  * High Curie Temperature: This refers to the temperature at which a magnet loses its magnetism. REMs boast impressive Curie temperatures, which is crucial for the high heat of electric motors. They help EVs stay safe and reliable, even as they get pushed to their limits on the road.\n  * Workhorses of Electric Motion: Dysprosium (Dy) plays a vital role in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) commonly used in EVs. This REM enhances the motor\u2019s ability to convert electrical energy into mechanical force, boosting power output and efficiency. Also, some REMs like Lanthanum (La) are being explored for next-generation solid-state batteries.\n\nWith these unique properties, REMs enable the creation of powerful, compact,\nand efficient electric motors and batteries \u2013 the beating heart of any EV.\n\n## The Big Problem(s)\n\nThe seemingly unstoppable EV boom is riding on the back of a fragile and\nunsustainable supply chain for rare earth metals. Right now, we\u2019re trading one\ndependency (fossil fuels) for another, less visible but still problematic\ndependency on REMs. The bright promise of green technology could be severely\ndimmed if we don\u2019t fix this supply chain. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the major\nrisks:\n\n### Extraction is Dirty and Harmful\n\nCurrent REM mining methods are notoriously harmful to the environment.\nExtraction sites are often riddled with heavy metals, radioactive waste, and\nacidic water runoff. This not only disrupts local ecosystems, but also poses\nhealth risks to nearby communities.\n\nThe Bayan Obo mine in China, a major source of REMs, is a stark example of\nthis pollution legacy. For decades, its toxic wastewater has been dumped into\nan artificial lake, poisoning surrounding farmland and groundwater. As a\nresult, nearby villagers suffer disproportionate rates of cancer and\nrespiratory diseases. Studies have found alarming levels of thorium, a\nradioactive element, in the hair samples of villagers.\n\nThe Bayan Obo mine isn\u2019t an isolated case. While the scale and severity of\npollution can vary, most current REM mining leaves a damaging environmental\nfootprint.\n\nAerial view of the Bayan Obo Mine.

But their control goes beyond mining \u2013 they also refine\nan even greater percentage of the global REM supply. This concentration\ncreates a potential chokepoint for the global industry. Disruptions, whether\nfrom a trade war or earthquake, could clog up the EV supply chain practically\novernight.\n\nFor example, China has previously used its control of REM exports as a\ngeopolitical pressure tactic. In 2010, during a territorial dispute with\nJapan, China temporarily halted REM shipments, causing prices to spike. A\nrepeat of this scenario, as the global hunger for EV materials grows, could\nspark a resource scramble with unpredictable consequences.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about any single nation. Having a diversified, resilient supply\nchain is essential because EVs can\u2019t be built on a foundation of geopolitical\nfragility. Countries like Australia, Vietnam, and even the United States also\nhave significant REM deposits. While it will take time, a focus on ethical\nmining in these regions would lessen the industry\u2019s overreliance on a single\nsource.\n\n### Progress is Expensive\n\nThe International Energy Agency warns that the cost of key REMs like neodymium\nand dysprosium could spike 70% by 2040. This isn\u2019t just about consumers\nfeeling the pinch. Escalating REM prices could derail the EV revolution from\nan innovation side too.\n\nCurrently, the price of neodymium oxide hovers around $100 per kg, but\nprojections suggest it could reach $170 per kg or higher by 2040. This forces\na trade-off: either cut corners elsewhere in EV design (undermining\nperformance)... or slow down the pace of research into battery breakthroughs\nand new motor technology.\n\n### Recycling is Still Nascent\n\nWhile recycling REMs is promising, the hard truth is that the technology is\nnot yet ready to scale. Estimates suggest current methods recover less than 1%\nof REMs from e-waste or retired EV components. Also, the infrastructure for\nlarge-scale REM recycling is underdeveloped. So while recycling is a crucial\npiece of the long-term solution, it\u2019s not a magical fix for the challenges we\nface right now.\n\n## It\u2019s NOT Hopeless: Emerging Solutions\n\nThe REM problem is serious, but it\u2019s far from hopeless. In fact, it\u2019s sparking\na wave of innovation and strategic shifts:\n\n### Stepping Up Recycling\n\nCurrently, only an estimated 1% of REMs are successfully recycled.\nBreakthroughs in hydrometallurgy (using liquid solutions for extraction) and\nbioleaching (using microorganisms to break down ore) could transform e-waste\nand retired EV components into a viable REM reservoir.\n\nCompanies like Redwood Materials are already pioneering closed-loop systems\nfor EV battery recycling. The potential gains here are impressive. Studies\nsuggest that with improved technology, we could meet up to 35% of REM demand\nthrough recycling alone.\n\nClosed-loop system for EV battery recycling by Redwood Materials. Credit:\nVolkswagen\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nMotor manufacturers are experimenting with reluctance motors or induction\nmotors that significantly reduce (or entirely eliminate) the need for rare\nearth magnets. Tesla\u2019s Model 3, for example, uses a combination of motor\ntypes. While some performance drawbacks exist, ongoing research may make this\na widespread solution in the future.\n\n### Responsible Sourcing\n\nProjects like the Mountain Pass mine in California demonstrate a potential to\nreactivate domestic REM sources. If ethically mined and processed, sites like\nthis could lessen dependence on overseas suppliers. Governments are also\nfunding research into extracting REMs from unconventional sources like coal\nwaste.\n\n### Seabed Mining?\n\nVast REM deposits are suspected on the ocean floor, but seabed mining is\nhighly controversial. Companies like The Metals Company argue it can be done\nresponsibly, critics point to the immense potential for disrupting fragile\ndeep-sea ecosystems \u2013 an area we barely understand. The technology is unproven\nat scale, and regulations are still evolving.\n\nKey Takeaway: This isn\u2019t about one \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution. We need rapid\nadvances in recycling, materials substitution, responsible mining, and perhaps\na critical look at where seabed mining can fit into the picture, if at all.\nThe success of the EV boom depends on it.\n\n## Our Duty as an Informed Public\n\nThe sleek lines and silent motors of EVs symbolize a future free from fossil\nfuel dependence. But hidden beneath that gleaming exterior lies a harsh\nreality: the dirty, geopolitically fraught world of rare earth metal mining.\nThe REM problem shows us that true sustainability means looking beyond\nmarketing promises and understanding the full impact of these technologies.\n\nWe must demand transparency from companies about their supply chains. We must\npush for policies that support research, ethical sourcing, and domestic\ninnovation. And we must have informed discussions about the issues and\npotential solutions surrounding EVs. Only then can the EV revolution fulfill\nits promise of clean transportation, without leaving a trail of new\nenvironmental and geopolitical problems in its wake.\n\n#### Read Next\n\nMetaverse Explained: Future of the Internet or VR Ghost-Town?\n\nQuantum Computing Explained: Preparing for Quantum Supremacy\n\nInside a Quantum Computer: A Visual Guide\n\nGenerative AI Explained: Giving a Voice to Machines\n\nThe State of Artificial Intelligence 2024: AI Index Report\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n  1.
