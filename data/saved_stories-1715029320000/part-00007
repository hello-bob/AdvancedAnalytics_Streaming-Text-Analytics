First,\nthey split it lengthwise down the middle. Then, carefully, the couple peeled\nback the onion\u2019s layers, laying 12 fresh, eye-watering sections side-by-side,\nand topping each with a teaspoon of salt.\n\nThe onion wasn\u2019t the makings of a celebratory dish for the new year, but a\nwindow into the future. While the ground outside was still frozen, the couple\nlooked to the onion layers to predict the coming year\u2019s weather for their\nfarm.\n\nEarly the next morning on New Year\u2019s Day, the couple rose to check their\nresults. How each onion slice reacted to the salt overnight foretold how wet\nor dry each month would be. They examined each piece in order\u2014the first\nrepresenting January\u2019s precipitation, the second predicting February, and so\non. Some pieces were left with dry salt, indicating a dry month, while the\nnext might have a pool of briny liquid in its center, indicating heavy rains\nor snow. Caked or crusty salt crystals meant frost, and bubbles hinted at\nhumidity.\n\nAtlas Obscura Trips\n\nNEW \u2014 Italian Food & Wine: Eating Regionally\n\nView This Trip\n\nThe onion calendar, or onion oracle, dates back to the Middle Ages, when\nonions and other root vegetables were used by farmers to predict precipitation\nfor the year ahead. Some of the oldest records of using onions as an oracle\nare from the small town of Urbania, Italy, where the tradition is still\npracticed today.\n\nIn the town of Urbania, Italy, it\u2019s still common to consult onion oracles and\ndiscuss their predictions. Toni Pecoraro/ Wikimedia Commons/ Public Domain\n\nIn Urbania, they do the ritual on the night of January 24, the eve of what\u2019s\nknown in the Catholic calendar as the Conversion of St. Paul, when the man\nnamed Saul was struck to the ground by a divine light and decided to become a\nChristian. Paul had received a sign of things to come on that night, so\npractitioners believed that the onion could best be read on the magical date.\n\u201cHe received a sign from God, he should be willing to give signs back,\u201d says\nElisa Luzi, an anthropologist at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. Luzi\nis from a town near Urbania, and has studied onion oracles, earning her the\nlocal nickname \u201cthe onion girl.\u201d\n\nConsulting a vegetable about the long-term weather outlook seems quaint today,\nin an age of instant weather forecasts at our fingertips, but the tradition\nserved its purpose in the past. \u201cAs humans, we sometimes fear the future,\u201d\nsays Luzi. \u201cAs a farmer, the weather can destroy an entire year of work.\nHaving no control over rain or sun, you need to at least try and see what is\ncoming.\u201d\n\nLuzi grew up with her grandparents who were farmers, and she remembers her\ngrandmother saying casually, \u201cWhat did the onion say for this month?\u201d or \u201cBut\nthe onion said that...\u201d You can still hear the same questions around Urbania\ntoday, Luzi says.\n\nHow each section of onion reacts to a teaspoon of salt predicts precipitation\nfor the upcoming year. Roxanne Hoorn\n\n\u201cSome people believe it. Some do not,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is kind of like a\nhoroscope. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, you still check it every now and\nthen, just for fun.\u201d The palm-sized weather predictors, which are cheap and\nreadily available year-round, don\u2019t enjoy any special status. \u201cThe next day,\nright after the reading, they become soup,\u201d Luzi says.\n\nWhile the tradition today is best known around Urbania, it can be found\nelsewhere as well. Australian farmer Halwyn \u2018Hally\u2019 Herrmann, for example,\nused the method for 65 years.\n\nThe practice can also be traced back to German folklore. In North Dakota,\nDelbert Eszlinger learned the ritual in childhood from neighbors who also\nfarmed. The year the Eszlingers married, they decided to give the tradition a\ntry\u2014having continued it ever since. Donna Eszlinger says it usually works,\nwith the exception of one reading several years ago. \u201cIt was such an odd year\nwhere the weather changed so often,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole onion was way off.\u201d\n\nThe onion can be surprisingly specific, she adds. Three years ago, two pieces\ncut from the exact same outermost layer of the onion predicted opposite\nresults for the months of January and July. \u201cWhen we checked it the following\nmorning, January had moisture and July had absolutely nothing,\u201d says\nEszlinger. \u201cSo what determines that there\u2019s moisture in one and not at all in\nthe other?\u201d The contrasting results turned out to be right, she says. \u201cWe had\na lot of snow that January, and then that July was very dry.\u201d\n\nYou can use any type of onion to make a calendar, but the Eszlingers prefer\nyellow. Colin / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nIn Ashley, even the local news has started following onion predictions\u2014but not\neveryone is on board. \u201cOne time a weatherman on our local station caught wind\nof this and said, \u2018Nobody knows the weather better than the weatherman,\u2019\u201d says\nEszlinger with a laugh. \u201cIt was like he was a little put out that we were\npredicting the weather, like we\u2019re taking away his job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think folklore forecasts will continue to reside in our social communities\nand circles. They\u2019re tradition,\u201d says Steve Ackerman, retired professor of\natmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He\nadds tactfully: \u201cWhile old sayings of the coming weather still enter our\nsocial lives, I do think we rely more now on forecasts that better reflect our\nunderstanding of atmosphere circulations.\u201d\n\nThe Eszlingers appreciate science-based weather predictions and the\nconvenience of the Weather Channel, but they still carry on the onion\ntradition\u2014and Donna Eszingler hopes others will continue it after her. \u201cThe\nones that are doing it, they\u2019re the same age I am. I\u2019m 75,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nGerman thing and a heritage that we like to carry on.\u201d\n\nThere are already signs that her two daughters are interested in continuing\nthe many-layered tradition, she says. \u201cThey\u2019ll call and say, \u2018Okay, Mom, what\nare we going to have this year?\u2019\u201d\n\n### How to Make Your Own Calendar\n\nThe practice of making an onion calendar can vary slightly depending on what\narea you\u2019re in, but the tradition goes something like this:\n\nStep 1: Select a nice round onion. While the color and where it\u2019s grown don\u2019t\nmatter, everyone has their preferences. The Eszlingers prefer yellow. \u201cThe\nyellow one seems to be a sturdier onion,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you probably get a\nbetter reading that way.\u201d\n\nIllustrations: Anne Meadows for Atlas Obscura\n\nStep 2: Cut the onion in half lengthwise and carefully separate the six\noutermost layers so that you have 12 sections total. Lay the sections out in\ntwo rows: The first half should be January through June, with January being\nthe outermost layer and June the innermost. The second half represents July\n(the outermost layer) through December (the innermost).\n\nStep 3: Add a teaspoon of salt in the center of each onion cup.\n\nStep 4: Let sit overnight. Some people keep it inside, but many agree it\nshould be outside to get the most accurate reading.\n\nStep 5: In the early morning\u2014ideally around 5 a.m.\u2014bring the onion inside and\nquickly jot down your readings before the inside temperatures change the\nresults.\n\nStep 6: Enjoy consulting your onion calendar throughout the year!\n\nGastro Obscura covers the world\u2019s most wondrous food and drink.
