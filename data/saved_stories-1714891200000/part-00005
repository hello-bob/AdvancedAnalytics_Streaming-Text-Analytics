Details taken from those\nstories will appear in ChatGPT as a summary or quote, with a link to the\nspecific article being cited.\n\nKayla Wood, a spokesperson for OpenAI, confirmed the deal also gives the\ncompany access to the FT\u2019s archive, including content behind the publication\u2019s\nstandard and premium paywalls. Under the terms of the deal, this archive can\nbe used to train ChatGPT\u2019s underlying models.\n\nThe new deal only applies to the FT, and won\u2019t extend to other brands owned by\nNikkei, the publication\u2019s Japanese parent company.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nThe Financial Times is ready for its AI to answer your questions (well, some\nof them)\n\nJoshua Benton\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n\u201cAs with any transformative technology, there is potential for significant\nadvancements and major challenges, but what\u2019s never possible is turning back\ntime,\u201d said John Ridding, the FT Group\u2019s CEO, in a statement. \u201cWe value the\nopportunity to be inside the development loop as people discover content in\nnew ways.\u201d\n\nThe announcement mentions citations of the FT will appear as \u201crich links\u201d in\nChatGPT. Both the FT and OpenAI declined to share specifics on how these \u201crich\nlinks\u201d will display, but the phrase indicates users will be able to easily\nclick through to an original FT.com article.\n\nChatGPT has already been experimenting with new ways to cite its sources. Last\nmonth, the company rolled out a feature that inserts the hyperlinked names of\nwebsites used when ChatGPT browses the internet to draft a response. The\nfeature is currently only available for ChatGPT\u2019s enterprise and premium\nsubscribers.\n\nWith this deal, the FT joins a growing list of newsrooms that have inked\ncontent licensing agreements with OpenAI over the past year.\n\nIn 2023, OpenAI signed deals with The Associated Press and Axel Springer SE,\nthe German publisher that owns Business Insider and Politico. Last month,\nOpenAI announced similar deals with the French newspaper Le Monde and the\nSpanish media conglomerate Prisa Media, which own El Pa\u00eds and El Huffpost.\n\nIn December, Bloomberg reported Axel Springer\u2019s contract with OpenAI would\nlast three years and net the company tens of millions of euros. OpenAI and the\nFT declined to answer questions about the terms of their deal.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nThe Intercept charts a new legal strategy for digital publishers suing OpenAI\n\nAndrew Deck\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nThe partnerships represent a marked difference from the approach towards\nOpenAI from newsrooms like The New York Times, and smaller digital publishers\nsuch as The Intercept, which have both filed lawsuits against OpenAI alleging\ncopyright violations.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect help from the disruptors\u201d: The FT\u2019s chief executive on AI,\n\u201cloyalist\u201d readers, and its U.S. expansion\n\nSarah Scire\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nIn March, during a conversation with my colleague Sarah Scire, Ridding argued\nthat that the relationship between publishers and generative AI developers can\nbe symbiotic, under the right conditions.\n\n\u201cIf [generative AI] develops in the way it looks as though AI developers want\nit to develop...then they\u2019re going to undermine the news content on which\ntheir models are trained,\u201d Ridding said at the time, gesturing to an\nalternative path that includes direct compensation for news publishers and\ncitations of their work. \u201cThere\u2019s a mutual interest in the verification and\nvalidation of gen AI content against trusted sources.\u201d\n\nAndrew Deck is a generative AI staff writer at Nieman Lab.
