Part of one of Ingenuity\u2019s rotor blades\nlies on the surface about 49 feet (15 meters) west of the helicopter (left of\ncenter in the image). (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/LANL/CNES/CNRS)\n\nSaying goodbye is never easy, especially from a world away.\n\nThe Ingenuity Mars helicopter team convened one last time on Tuesday (April\n16) to oversee a transmission from the little rotorcraft, the first robot ever\nto explore the skies of a world beyond Earth.\n\nThe meeting, in a control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in\nSouthern California, came nearly three months after Ingenuity's 72nd and final\nflight. The 4-pound (1.8 kilograms) chopper damaged its rotors while landing\nthat day, consigning it to a stationary existence from now on \u2014 but it lives\nstill, as a weather station and technology testbed.\n\n\"With apologies to Dylan Thomas, Ingenuity will not be going gently into that\ngood Martian night,\" Josh Anderson, Ingenuity team lead at JPL, said in a\nstatement.\n\n\"It is almost unbelievable that, after over 1,000 Martian days on the surface,\n72 flights, and one rough landing, she still has something to give,\" Anderson\nadded. \"And thanks to the dedication of this amazing team, not only did\nIngenuity overachieve beyond our wildest dreams, but also it may teach us new\nlessons in the years to come.\"\n\nRelated: NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity has flown its last flight after\nsuffering rotor damage\n\nEngineers working on NASA's Ingenuity mission together monitored a\ntransmission from the history-making Mars helicopter in a control room at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory on April 16, 2024. They confirmed the operation of a\nsoftware patch that will allow the helicopter to act as a stationary testbed\nand collect data that could benefit future Mars explorers.

Ingenuity flew four more times in\nrelatively quick succession, acing its demonstration mission, which aimed to\nshow that aerial exploration is possible on the Red Planet despite its thin\natmosphere.\n\nAnd Ingenuity just kept on flying, on an extended mission during which the\nhelicopter served as a scout for Perseverance. Over the course of its 72 Mars\nflights, Ingenuity stayed aloft for a total of 129 minutes and covered 10.5\nmiles (17.0 km) of ground \u2014 more than 14 times farther than it was originally\nexpected to go, according to NASA officials.\n\nZoomed-in view of NASA's Mars Ingenuity helicopter, captured by the SuperCam\nremote imager aboard the agency's Perseverance rover on Feb. 25, 2024.

The\nhelicopter team met on Tuesday, before that happens, to eat some \"Final Comms\"\nchocolate cake and review a key transmission relayed via Perseverance and\nNASA's Deep Space Network.\n\n\"The telemetry confirmed that a software update previously beamed up to\nIngenuity was operating as expected,\" NASA officials wrote in the same\nstatement. \"The new software contains commands that direct the helicopter to\ncontinue collecting data well after communications with the rover have\nceased.\"\n\nIngenuity will continue to wake up every day, activate its onboard computers\nand test its solar panels, batteries and electronics, NASA officials added.\nThe chopper will also photograph the Martian surface and collect temperature\ndata at its final landing site, a spot the team calls Valinor Hills.\n\n\"Ingenuity's engineers and Mars scientists believe such long-term data\ncollection could not only benefit future designers of aircraft and other\nvehicles for the Red Planet, but also provide a long-term perspective on\nMartian weather patterns and dust movement,\" NASA officials wrote.\n\nIngenuity will continue this work for as long as it can \u2014 until something\nbreaks, for example, or dust blocks its solar panels. The mission team\nbelieves the chopper's memory can hold about 20 years' worth of such data, so\nIngenuity could be a valuable resource to Mars explorers years down the road.\n\nThis image, which shows the shadow of a damaged rotor on NASA's Mars\nhelicopter Ingenuity, was taken after its 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18,\n2024 on the Red Planet.

This missive was sentimental rather\nthan functional, featuring the names of people who had worked on Ingenuity's\nmission over the years, NASA officials said.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
