However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and\nbelowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems\nremain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes\nacross \u2018green\u2019 aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and \u2018brown\u2019\nbelowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical\nrainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that\nmost of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food\nweb. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber\nagroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the\nkey energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of\nthe total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy,\nwhereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids\n(earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic\nenergy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced\nenergy flux to higher trophic levels, down to \u221290%, and with shifts from slow\n(fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production\ntowards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously\nreported soil carbon stock depletion^3. Here we show that well-documented\nanimal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change^4,5,6 are\nassociated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs\nacross aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Silvopastoral systems and remnant forests enhance carbon storage in\nlivestock-dominated landscapes in Mexico\n\nArticle Open access 06 October 2022\n\n### Climate warming restructures food webs and carbon flow in high-latitude\necosystems\n\nArticle 03 January 2024\n\n### Intensive grassland management disrupts below-ground multi-trophic\nresource transfer in response to drought\n\nArticle Open access 16 November 2022\n\n## Main\n\nLosses of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems have been documented across\ncontinents, biomes, clades and ecosystem compartments^1. Tropical ecosystems\nare among the most threatened globally, with losses driven primarily by land-\nuse change, such as the conversion towards commodity crops^2. However,\nunderstanding of these transformations is hampered by the complexity and\nenormous biodiversity of tropical ecosystems. On first approximation, the\nspread of agricultural monocultures causes drastic declines in plant diversity\nin comparison to rainforests^4. These effects cascade beyond basal trophic\nlevels through food webs and also affect higher trophic-level invertebrate and\nvertebrate consumers^2,5,6. Thus, to mechanistically understand the\nconsequences of land-use changes for animal biodiversity and related\nfunctions, we need to know the resulting complex changes in food webs across\nmultiple trophic levels and along different food chains.\n\nLosses of animal diversity may be explained by reduced primary ecosystem\nproductivity^7 and by changes in the structure of, and interactions in,\nconsumer communities, as has been shown in studies on the impacts of invasive\nspecies, climate or other environmental changes^8,9. Energy, as a common\ncurrency which sustains life^10, can impose limits on the total number of\nspecies in an ecosystem^7, whereas shifts in community structure can change\nenergy pathways through ecological networks (energy flux), which is closely\nassociated with the distribution of biodiversity across different trophic\nlevels and ecosystem compartments^11. For instance, under tropical land-use\nchange, large declines in the number of species were correlated with a\nsimultaneous reduction in total energy flux in litter invertebrate\ncommunities^12, demonstrating that biodiversity loss is associated with a loss\nin available energy. In soil, however, a similar decline in biodiversity was\nnot associated with reduced total energy flux but with a redistribution of\nenergy across the food web^8,12. This indicates that biodiversity loss is\nassociated with exclusion of specific functional groups, rebalancing the\nsystem energetically. Disentangling total available energy changes from shifts\nin its distribution may help us to determine appropriate measures for\nrestoration of ecosystem functioning.\n\nThe distribution of biomass and energy fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems is\nlargely structured in \u2018green\u2019 (aboveground) and \u2018brown\u2019 (belowground) food-web\ncompartments, which jointly shape ecosystem functioning and stability^13.\nRedirection of energy across aboveground and belowground compartments is of\ninterest to agricultural management, including, for example, nutrient\navailability^14, yield^3,15, soil carbon storage^3 and pest control^16.\nHowever, despite close linkages of these two compartments by means of common\nprimary producers (plant shoots and roots) and mobile animals, including\ngeneralist predators^17, belowground and aboveground tropical food webs have\nbeen studied independently of each other and the distribution of energy across\naboveground\u2013belowground and invertebrate\u2013vertebrate food webs has never been\nquantified. This non-integrated perspective hampers understanding of the\nconsequences of conversion of rainforest into agricultural production systems\non total animal energy flux and, accordingly, on animal biodiversity and\necosystem functioning.\n\nHere, we quantified energy fluxes across earthworms, birds and arthropods in\nsoil and canopies of tropical rainforests in Sumatra, Indonesia to describe\nthe energetic structure of tropical animal food webs across aboveground and\nbelowground ecosystem compartments. Our group selection represents most animal\nbiomass in these systems (arthropods and earthworms)^18,19, including\necosystem engineers (earthworms and ants) and animals at different trophic\nlevels\u2014from detritivores, microbivores and herbivores (various arthropod\ngroups) to top predators (for example, spiders and birds)\u2014thus reliably\nreflecting the composition of the food web as a whole. We further assessed\nchanges in the energy flux distribution after rainforest transformation into\nplantation systems, including jungle rubber (selectively logged rainforest\nwith planted rubber trees), as well as rubber and oil palm monoculture\nplantations, to show how altered land use changes the trophic functioning of\naboveground versus belowground food webs. Our main hypothesis was that there\nare different keystone animal groups which channel most of the energy in\nrainforest and plantations and that energy distribution changes with land use:\n(1) across strata more energy is allocated to aboveground food webs in\nplantations because plantation management commonly aims to maximize\naboveground production; (2) across trophic levels less energy is channelled to\nhigher trophic levels in plantations because monocultures cannot sustain\nabundant and diverse predator communities; and (3) across resources at the\nbase of the food web living plants are more important, whereas leaf litter is\nless important in plantations because of lower predation pressure,\nmonodominant plant species and a reduction in litterfall. Such energy re-\nallocation is associated with changes in animal trophic functions across\naboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments, with functional\nconsequences at the ecosystem level.\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we estimated abundance and biomass of canopy\narthropods using insecticide fogging, of birds using audio recorders and point\ncounts and of soil arthropods and earthworms using high-gradient heat\nextraction from soil cores across 32 sites representing rainforests and\nplantations^20. We linked collected body mass and biomass data to literature\ndata on traits and feeding preferences of taxa to define 62 trophic guilds\nacross all animal groups and to reconstruct food-web topologies at each site.\nWe further used steady-state food-web modelling, which assumes that energetic\ndemands of each trophic guild (including metabolic rate, losses during food\nassimilation and consumption by higher trophic levels) are compensated by\nenergy uptake from lower trophic levels. Metabolic rates of each guild per\nbiomass unit were estimated from body masses using metabolic regressions and\nmultiplied by the observed biomasses. Resulting energy fluxes were used as\nquantitative measures of the distribution of energy and consumption of\ndifferent resources (living plants, litter, bacteria, fungi, soil organic\nmatter and other animals) in aboveground and belowground food webs^11,12. We\nvalidate our results with another independent survey at the same sites (except\njungle rubber) 4 years after the main survey, to prove the generality of our\nfindings.\n\n## Aboveground and belowground rainforest food webs\n\nWe found that most of the energy in rainforests was channelled in belowground,\nrather than in aboveground, animal food webs. The total aboveground energy\nflux (sum of all energy fluxes to canopy arthropods and birds) was 21.6 \u00b1 9.7\n(1 s.d.) mW m^\u22122 with a total fresh animal biomass of 0.8 \u00b1 0.6 g m^\u22122,\nwhereas the total belowground energy flux (sum of all energy fluxes to litter\nand soil arthropods and earthworms) was 295.8 \u00b1 125.5 mW m^\u22122 and the biomass\nwas 9.5 \u00b1 7.1 g m^\u22122 (Figs. 1 and 2). These figures question the existing\nresearch focus on aboveground tropical food webs and animal biomass^21. This\nenergetic dominance of soil over canopy animals in rainforest is unexpected\nbecause about 95% of the energy channelled belowground is assumed to be\nprocessed by microorganisms^22. The soil biomass numbers generally resembled\nthose reported previously for animals in rainforests^8,22 but for canopy\narthropods they were slightly lower^6,21,23. Because canopy fogging may result\nin potential undersampling (suggested numbers span from twofold^21 to\nsixfold^23), we also ran a sensitivity analysis, assuming that canopy height\naffected the effectiveness of this method (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 2).\nThis analysis suggested that the real energy flux aboveground (assuming\nuniform distribution of arthropods in canopies) could be 62.0 \u00b1 24.5 mW m^\u22122\nin the most-severe undersampling scenario but could still not explain the\n14-fold aboveground\u2013belowground difference in energy flux we recorded. The\nbelowground energetic dominance could be related to plant production, animal\nmetabolism and resource quality: (1) tropical trees allocate twice as much\nproduced organic matter belowground, in the form of litter and root biomass,\nas they store aboveground^3,24; (2) soil is inhabited by numerous small\nanimals which have high metabolic rates per unit biomass^10 and together make\nup the biggest share of energy channelling across aboveground and belowground\ncompartments; and (3) basal food resources belowground (litter and soil\norganic matter) are of poor palatability which results in a low assimilation\nefficiency. Thus, more resource consumption belowground than aboveground is\nneeded to gain the same amount of energy^25. This finding also indicates a\nperceived \u2018biomass/energy flux\u2014diversity discrepancy\u2019 between aboveground and\nbelowground tropical communities, with tropical canopies being extremely\nspecies-rich but having relatively low animal biomass and energy flux in\ncomparison to soil and litter communities. However, very little is known about\nspecies diversity of arthropods in tropical soils^3,12,26, so it is possible\nthat biodiversity levels are much higher in rainforest soils than is estimated\nat present.\n\nFig. 1: Distribution of energy across birds, earthworms and arthropods in\nrainforest food webs across aboveground and belowground compartments.\n\nConnecting lines on the food-web diagram represent average energy fluxes.\nFluxes are classified into strong (solid lines) and weak (dotted lines), on\nthe basis of an arbitrary threshold of 5 mW m^\u22122. The opacity of the lines\nscales with flux values. Food-web nodes include basal resources (displayed\nwith black drawings/diagrams on the left) and consumer trophic guilds\n(coloured points), grouped into canopy arthropods (blue), birds (green), soil\narthropods (pink) and earthworms (yellow). Sizes of consumer nodes are\nproportional to node fresh biomasses (square root scale). Nodes are ordered\nhorizontally according to the trophic position (continuous variable; nodes\nwere slightly jittered to avoid overlaps but the general order remains) and\nvertically according to the ecosystem stratification (positions within the\nfour major animal groups/colours are random). Exemplary dominant taxonomic\ngroups in the major trophic levels (primary consumers, omnivores and primary\npredators, top predators) are shown with text. The scheme summarizes data\nacross all rainforest sites (n = 8).

Sizes of consumer nodes are proportional to node biomasses.\nConnecting lines on the food-web diagram represent average energy fluxes,\nquantified in mW m^\u22122 (represented by line thickness). Colours of energy\nfluxes reflect colours of the donor nodes and represent associated \u2018trophic\nfunctions\u2019: herbivory (on leaves or roots), litter transformation,\nbacterivory, fungivory, soil transformation and predation. Average trophic\nfunctions for each major group of consumers and for the food web in total are\nsummarized as stacked proportional bar charts (n = 8 sites per system).\nEstimated mean energy fluxes are shown with numbers to the right of the bars;\ntotal energy flux (sum of all fluxes) is given as mean \u00b1 1 s.d.

Meyer.\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\n## Rainforest canopy arthropods and birds\n\nWe found that arthropods dominated energetically over birds in rainforest\ncanopies. Energy flux to canopy arthropods was 18.0 \u00b1 9.7 mW m^\u22122, whereas\nbirds contributed only 1.6 \u00b1 1.9 mW m^\u22122 (Figs. 1 and 2). The bird biomass\nestimate (0.3 g m^\u22122) matches a previous detailed inventory in the\nneotropics^27, suggesting that our estimates are realistic. As we did not\nmeasure contributions by other vertebrate groups (for example, bats and\namphibians), we cannot be certain about the relative contributions of\nvertebrates versus invertebrates based on our data. However, including more\nvertebrate groups would also increase invertebrate energy flux, as many of\nthem feed on invertebrates, making it unlikely that this would compensate for\nthe 12-fold difference in energy flux we detected. Overall, it is evident that\nrainforest food webs are energetically dominated by invertebrates and are\nlargely \u2018brown\u2019.\n\n## Keystone groups across land uses\n\nWe found strong community shifts in plantations in comparison to rainforest,\nwhich supports our main hypothesis that different taxa play key energetic\nroles in different systems (Extended Data Fig. 6). These shifts were not\nassociated with total animal energy flux decline but mainly with its re-\nallocation. The total animal energy flux was similar in rainforest and\nmonoculture plantations (310\u2013317 mW m^\u22122) and was about 50% higher in jungle\nrubber, although the variation was very high (the total system effect was not\nsignificant; Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). Differences were strongest in\nearthworms, which were responsible for an average of 13% of the energy flux\nper site in rainforest (29.4 \u00b1 37.1 mW m^\u22122) but for 60\u201379% of the energy flux\nacross plantations (group \u00d7 system interaction \u03c7^2_9 = 50.1, P < 0.0001;\nExtended Data Table 1). The high energy flux in jungle rubber may be explained\nby intermediate disturbance of the ecosystem combined with favourable\nconditions for earthworms (for example, higher pH due to liming and ashes\nafter burning^8), which are able to exploit earlier accumulated soil organic\nmatter as an extra resource and incorporate it into the food web (Fig. 1). The\nincrease in the earthworm-associated energy flux was mirrored by a decline in\nthe soil arthropod-associated energy flux (Fig. 1). It is known that\nearthworms may negatively affect soil and litter arthropods through direct\n(consumption of small fauna) and indirect trophic interactions and\nenvironmental modifications (litter removal and microbial feeding)^8,28, but\nthe arthropod decline may also have been a result of reduced leaf litter input\nand reduced soil organic carbon and nitrogen in plantations^29. Energetically\nimportant arthropod groups in rainforest included springtails (12%), beetles\n(9%) and ants (7%; belowground food webs; Fig. 1), whereas in plantations they\nincluded springtails (3\u20135%), beetles (1\u20135%) and termites, symphylans,\nbutterfly larvae, millipedes and dipterans, depending on specific ecosystem\ntype (belowground food webs; Supplementary Table 1). These shifts illustrate\ndifferent susceptibility of animal taxa to ecosystem transformation^30,31.\nTropical land-use change has been found to result in an 18\u201370% decline in\nspecies richness in arthropods, birds and other taxa^30,31,32,33. Our findings\nshow that this species decline is associated with fundamental changes in the\nenergy distribution across food webs, rather than overall energy flux decline\nin converted tropical ecosystems.\n\n## Aboveground-to-belowground shift with land use\n\nPlantation management commonly aims to maximize yield and associated\naboveground production. Therefore, it is likely that energy flux will be\nhigher in aboveground compared to belowground food webs in plantation systems.\nIn support of this, a previous study found that biomass of canopy arthropods\ndeclined less than that of soil arthropods after rainforest transformation to\noil palm monoculture plantations^6. Thus, we initially proposed that\nbelowground energy flux (sum of all energy fluxes belowground) would be\nstronger in rainforests, whereas aboveground energy flux (sum of all energy\nfluxes aboveground) would be stronger in plantations. However, contrary to our\nhypothesis, rainforest transformation resulted in a relative increase in\nbelowground compared to aboveground fluxes. The belowground energy flux was\nhigher than the aboveground in rainforest (about 14-fold) and this difference\nincreased in jungle rubber (about 30-fold), rubber (55-fold) and oil palm\nmonocultures (68-fold), with an even higher difference in biomass (Fig. 3a,b;\nsignificant system:compartment interactions). This change in the ratios\nresulted from reduction of the total aboveground energy flux by \u221275% to \u221279%\nin both monoculture plantation types in comparison to rainforest (up to \u221292%\nconsidering potential undersampling of canopy arthropods; Extended Data Fig.\n2), whereas belowground energy flux changed little. This change may be because\nof a delayed impact of land-use change on belowground compared to aboveground\nbiodiversity, which could be explained by legacy effects due to the high\ninertia of soils^34, for example, exploitation of earlier accumulated soil\norganic matter. The differing energetic responses of aboveground and\nbelowground systems to land-use change in tropical landscapes echo the\nrecently demonstrated differences in aboveground and belowground biodiversity\nresponses observed in temperate grasslands^35. This implies that such\ndiverging responses might be universal, fitting the \u2018green\u2013brown imbalance\u2019\nhypothesis, which suggests a higher resistance of belowground than aboveground\nfood webs owing to a lower number of specialized links in the former^13\n(because of restricted mobility of organisms and thus a more opportunistic\nfood selection). At present, belowground processes in plantations seem to be\nstabilized by earthworms which energetically compensate for losses in\narthropod communities^36. However, earthworms in plantations are mainly\nrepresented by invasive species^37 and their dominance reduces the entire food\nweb to a detritus\u2013microbe\u2013animal or detritus\u2013animal scheme. The number of\ntrophic interactions in both aboveground and belowground webs in plantation\nsystems decreased by 13% to 37%, reflecting reduced biodiversity aboveground\nand belowground (Fig. 3c). Therefore, soil animal communities in plantations\nrely on fewer interactions (on average \u221221%), reflecting documented losses of\nbiodiversity and multifunctionality^8,12,30,38 but nevertheless process a\nsimilar amount of energy as soil animal communities in rainforests. This\ndemonstrates a remarkable adaptability of belowground food-web functioning to\nperturbations^35.\n\nFig. 3: Aboveground and belowground food-web indicators in rainforest and\nplantations.\n\na\u2013d, Bulk indicators were calculated separately for aboveground (canopy\narthropods and birds, above the zero line) and belowground food webs (soil\narthropods and earthworms, below the zero line) for total biomass (a), total\nenergy flux (b), food-web complexity (c) and trophic hierarchy (d). Trophic\nhierarchy was calculated as the ratio of all \u2018predatory\u2019 energy fluxes to all\n\u2018basal resource consumption\u2019 energy fluxes. e, Carbon cycling rate was\ncalculated as the ratio of all outgoing fluxes from bacteria to all outgoing\nfluxes from fungi. f, Carbon balance was calculated as the ratio of all\nproduced faeces (unassimilated food) to all outgoing fluxes from soil organic\nmatter. Each point is a site, bars represent means (n = 8 sites per system).\nColours denote land-use systems (dark green, rainforest; light green, jungle\nrubber; orange, rubber; yellow, oil palm). Units for each parameter are given\nin brackets; note square root scale in a, b and f. Asterisks mark significant\ndifferences of mean values for the given parameter aboveground or belowground\nfrom that in rainforest (generalized linear mixed-effects models; two-tailed\n***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05).

F,\nrainforest; J, jungle rubber; R, rubber; O, oil palm.\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\n## Predation decline in plantations\n\nIt has been suggested that diverse plant communities avoid resource\nconcentrations and promote nutrient heterogeneity, which prevent (specialized)\nherbivores from being very abundant; at the same time, diverse plant\ncommunities provide greater refuge and resources for (generalist) predators\nthan do monocultures, which jointly sustain higher predation-to-herbivory\nrates^16,39. Indeed, previous studies have shown that proportionally less\nenergy flows to predators in soil and litter food webs in plantations than in\nrainforests^8,12. Thus, we also suggested that predation to primary\nconsumption rates would be lower across aboveground and belowground food webs\nin plantations than in rainforest. In agreement with this, the\npredation/consumption ratio declined by 18% aboveground and by up to 90%\nbelowground with rainforest transformation to jungle rubber and oil palm.\nHowever, in monoculture rubber plantations the proportion of predation in\ncanopy and soil arthropods (but not in birds) was similar or even slightly\nhigher than that in rainforest (increase of 11% aboveground; Fig. 3d). High\npredation in rubber canopies might be associated with a simple canopy\nstructure^40 but this does not explain low predation in oil palm. Because the\nhigh predation in rubber canopies was mainly associated with a large biomass\nof blood-sucking gnats and mosquitoes, it may be explained by the presence of\nsmall water bodies (rubber sap collection buckets) in rubber plantations which\ncan host aquatic dipteran larvae. The different effects of oil palm and rubber\ncultivation on relative predation suggest that tropical land-use choices can\nhave a predictable impact on specific food-web functions. Our results\nillustrate that decline in predation is a common trend across aboveground and\nbelowground compartments and taxa with agricultural transformation^8,12.\nAgroecosystems often have a weaker natural control of pests in comparison to\nmore natural ecosystems^41, which may partly explain pest outbreaks in\nplantation systems such as oil palm^42. Reduced natural pest control in oil\npalm is also supported by a lower predation-to-herbivory ratio (0.37 \u00b1 0.16 in\nbirds, 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 in canopy arthropods and 1.14 \u00b1 0.63 in soil arthropods) in\ncomparison to rainforest (0.64 \u00b1 0.29 in birds, 0.34 \u00b1 0.05 in canopy\narthropods and 1.95 \u00b1 0.74 in soil arthropods).\n\n## Changes in belowground carbon cycling\n\nWe classified non-predatory energy fluxes according to five major basal\nresource classes, corresponding to the \u2018trophic functions\u2019 of herbivory,\nlitter feeding, fungivory, bacterivory and soil feeding (Fig. 2)^43. We\nproposed that the dominant trophic functions would change with land use,\nindicating different carbon pathways at the ecosystem scale\u2014specifically, we\nexpected proportionally higher use of primary basal food resources, especially\nliving plants, in plantations, resulting from a decrease in alternative\nresources, such as microbial biomass and leaf litter^44. We found that land-\nuse change to plantations consistently altered energy distribution at the base\nof food webs by reducing total herbivory and fungivory, while increasing\nbacterivory and soil feeding (function \u00d7 system interaction \u03c7^2_15 = 111.1, P\n< 0.0001; Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). We recorded a 3.2- to 4.4-fold\nincrease in bacteria/fungi energy flux ratio across plantation systems (Fig.\n3e). This increase was explained mostly by the high abundance of earthworms in\nplantations, which can effectively assimilate bacterial carbon from old soil\norganic matter^45. However, an almost twofold increase in bacteria/fungi\nenergy flux ratio was also observed in soil arthropods in oil palm\nmonocultures (Fig. 2). These results are in line with previous studies showing\nthat disturbance associated with agriculture and high fertilization rates may\nchange the balance from slow (for example, fungal) to fast (for example,\nbacterial) energy fluxes in soil food webs^15,46. At the same time, these\nresults are in contrast to the existing evidence of higher bacteria\nconsumption by soil animal communities in rainforests, as indicated by\nbacteria-specific fatty acid biomarkers^47. However, the same study reported\nan increase in non-specific bacterial biomarkers^47. The likely increase in\nbacterivory therefore indicates that there is accelerated energy processing\n(faster turnover rates) in these systems. A shift from the naturally observed\nbalance to food webs dominated by fast energy channelling may make the system\nmore susceptible to perturbations (resulting from an increase in strong\ninteractions^48) and may accelerate depletion of carbon stocks^15; the latter\nhas been observed in rubber and oil palm plantations^3. This depletion is\nassociated with high soil feeding by earthworms, which can effectively use old\nsoil carbon resources^49. However, the net effect of earthworm feeding\nactivity on carbon sequestration and emission remains a controversial topic in\nsoil ecology^50,51. To quantify animal effects on soil carbon stocks, we here\ncalculated the ratio between the production of faeces (unassimilated food) and\nthe consumption of soil organic matter by all soil invertebrates. It has been\nshown that conversion of plant materials into faeces by soil invertebrates\nincreases microbial biomass production^52, which is the key process\ncontributing to soil organic matter formation and stabilization^53. In turn,\ninvertebrates are able to mobilize and recycle this stored carbon while\nfeeding on bulk soil. Supporting the link between the belowground food-web\nstructure and net carbon loss in plantations, we found that the production-to-\nconsumption ratio decreased by more than 75% from 27.6 \u00b1 29.6 in rainforest to\n3.8 \u00b1 2.9 in jungle rubber, 6.2 \u00b1 10.4 in rubber and 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 in oil palm\nplantations (Fig. 3f). Overall, our analysis suggests that changes in energy\nflux distribution due to habitat transformation have large functional\nconsequences for carbon cycling. However, the exact mechanisms involved and\nquantification of these animal effects over time requires dynamic ecosystem-\nlevel modelling and targeted experiments.\n\n## Methodological caveats\n\nThere are few empirical studies on tropical invertebrate food webs and food-\nweb analysis can be sensitive to assignment of trophic guilds and\ninteractions^54. Here, we based our reconstruction on a recent review^55 and\nempirical data collected from our study sites^36, which make our food webs as\nclose to reality as possible at the current state of knowledge. Sensitivity\ntests of our food-web reconstruction model revealed feeding\nspecialization/omnivory as the main characteristic affecting absolute\nestimates of belowground-to-aboveground energy balance but none of the\npossible coefficients affected our conclusions (Extended Data Fig. 1). Our\naboveground energy flux estimates could also be biased because we did not\nsample all vertebrate animal groups. Amphibians, reptiles, bats and other\nmammals are important invertebrate predators in tropical rainforests. However,\nas discussed above, this is unlikely to change our conclusions which are based\non more than tenfold differences in energy fluxes, with the same applying to\nthe potential undersampling of canopy invertebrates (Extended Data Fig. 2).\nFinally, our plantation systems were 14\u201318 years old and were unlikely to be\nat a stable state, especially considering higher rates of change in the\naboveground than in the belowground ecosystem compartments. We therefore call\nfor studies evaluating tropical land-use systems in the longer term. To prove\nthe generality of our findings, we performed another survey at the same sites\n(except jungle rubber) in 2016\u20132017. This validation survey showed lower\nestimates of the absolute biomass and energy flux but validated energetic\ndominance of the belowground over the aboveground energy flux, canopy\narthropods over birds, energetic decline in canopies, re-allocation of energy\nto belowground food webs in plantations and shifts in trophic functions, such\nas an increase in bacteria-to-fungi and a decrease in faeces production-to-\nsoil consumption ratios. However, it did not validate the general loss of\ntrophic links across aboveground and belowground compartments (Extended Data\nFigs. 5, 6 and 7; Supplementary Notes). Potentially, some trophic links were\nrestored as plantation aged (from about 15 years old in the main survey to\nabout 19 years old in the validation survey) but future plantation replanting\n(normally done at 25 years) will probably result in a second wave of\nbiodiversity decline^56, which may lead to further food-web disassembly.\nOverall, it is clear that our assumptions and approaches do not affect our\nmain conclusions.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur study provides an energetic description of tropical rainforest and\nplantation food webs across aboveground and belowground compartments,\ndemonstrating generalities of land-use effects previously observed only in\ntemperate ecosystems. In addition, we report new and nuanced patterns of food-\nweb responses depending on specific land uses and ecosystem compartments.\nOverall, we conclude that (1) rainforest animal communities are energetically\ndominated by arthropods in belowground food webs; (2) animal communities in\ntropical canopies suffer higher total energetic losses due to rainforest\ntransformation than those in belowground food webs but the energy in\nbelowground food webs in plantations is reallocated from functionally diverse\narthropod communities to invasive earthworms^8; (3) land-use change is\nassociated with a decline in predation and an increase in relative herbivory\nboth aboveground and belowground in jungle rubber and oil palm, however, the\nhigh predation in rubber suggests that crop choices can have predictable\noutcomes for trophic functions in food webs; and (4) belowground food webs in\nplantations rely on different basal resources than those in rainforest,\npromoting faster energy channelling and shifting carbon balance from\nproduction of faeces to consumption of soil organic matter. These changes are\nassociated with previously observed depletion of carbon stocks^3 but the\nmechanisms driving animal effects in this context remain to be tested\nexperimentally.\n\nIt is well documented that tropical land-use change results in animal\nbiodiversity losses both aboveground and belowground^30,31. We show here that\nbiodiversity losses are associated with changes in food-web structure,\nconsumption of different pools of organic matter and energy fluxes and these\nchanges are distinctly different between the aboveground and belowground\nrealm. We suggest that restoration and management practices in the tropics\nwhich alter the energetic balance across ecosystem compartments, taxa, size\nclasses and trophic levels, need to be more closely considered and trialled.\nPlantations, especially oil palm, are very productive^3 but the available\nenergy for maintaining multitrophic biodiversity is disproportionately low,\nwhich is associated with re-allocation of energy fluxes to basal trophic\nlevels in belowground food webs. The high total energy flux indicates that\nenergy is not a limiting factor for animal biodiversity in plantations and\nrestoration measures should focus on other ecosystem aspects. Improving\nbelowground habitat structure through mulching^38,57 and reducing herbicide\nuse^58 could be sufficient to partly restore soil biodiversity and energetic\nbalance in belowground food webs. However, it may take time for the effects of\nthese measures to become visible as a result of high historical inertia of the\nsoil system. Aboveground, measures directly affecting vegetation are needed.\nFor example, increasing canopy complexity by planting trees in monoculture\nplantations^59,60 and designing diverse landscapes^30 could provide more\necological niches, probably resulting in re-allocation of more energy to\naboveground food webs. In the absence of restoration measures, intensive\ntropical land use may foster earthworm invasion belowground, further depletion\nof soil organic stocks and increase risks of aboveground pest outbreaks. This\nis likely to result in intensification of fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide\nuse. Experimental studies exploring the effect of restoration measures on the\nenergy distribution and trophic functions of food webs across aboveground and\nbelowground compartments of tropical ecosystems will be crucial for better\nmanagement of the energy of tropical ecosystems, to sustain tropical\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study region and design\n\nThe study was carried out in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia in the\nframework of the Collaborative Research I 990 \u2018EFForTS\u2019^20. Over the last few\ndecades, lowlands in this region have experienced drastic land-use change from\nrainforests to smallholder-dominated cash crop agriculture of mainly rubber\n(Hevea brasiliensis) and oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis)^30. We\nstudied four common land-use systems: primary but slightly degraded lowland\nrainforest^61, jungle rubber, rubber monocultures and oil palm monocultures.\nForest plots were located in the Bukit Duabelas National Park and the Harapan\nRainforest Restoration concession (PT REKI) and had a 90th percentile tree\nheight of 29.5 m and tree density of 556 trees ha^\u22121 (diameter at breast\nheight \u2265 10 cm). Jungle rubber plots represented an extensively managed\nagroforest system, which is established by planting rubber trees into\nsecondary or disturbed forest and had a 90th percentile tree height of 21.0 m\nand tree density of 580 trees ha^\u22121. Rubber and oil palm monocultures\nrepresented smallholder plantations, often with intensive management\n(fertilizers and herbicides) and a 90th percentile tree height of 17.0 and\n12.7 m and tree density of 467 and 138 trees ha^\u22121, respectively. At the time\nof the main survey (May\u2013November 2013), the age of all monoculture plantations\nwas between 8 and 17 years. In total, 32 sampling sites were surveyed in an\narea of about 80 \u00d7 80 km spanning two regions (with loamy Acrisol and clayey\nAcrisol soils)^62; each land-use system was replicated eight times, four in\neach of the two regions^20,30. Statistical methods were not used to\npredetermine the sample size, no blinding and randomization were used. Each\nplot measured 50 \u00d7 50 m and had five permanent 5 \u00d7 5 m subplots. More\ninformation is provided in the introductory EFForTS paper^20. In each of the\n32 plots, we applied a combination of collection methods to assess bird,\ncanopy arthropod, soil arthropod and earthworm communities. Our assessment is\na snapshot which cannot represent all animal species at the study sites.\nHowever, the functional composition of communities is typically more stable\nthan the species composition^38; that is, despite species turnover, different\nspecies will perform similar roles in the food web. This turnover, however, is\nexpected to be moderate because of a limited seasonality at the study region,\nwith a rainier period during December\u2013March and a dryer period during\nJuly\u2013August^20. Although we were not able to fully cover the spatial\nheterogeneity in each plot, our sampling design compensates for this with true\nreplication of n = 8 plots per system. To account for the temporal variation,\nvalidate results of the main survey and prove the generality of our findings,\nwe did another independent survey with the same approach at the same sites\n(except jungle rubber; that is, 24 plots) in 2016\u20132017. Data from both surveys\nwere processed in the same way to reconstruct food webs across aboveground and\nbelowground compartments^43. To do this, we estimated densities and biomasses\nof taxa, classified trophic guilds and assigned body masses, habitat\npreferences and feeding preferences to each guild^43. Feeding preferences at\nthe base of the food web were assigned to the five major basal resource\nclasses^43: living plants (leaves and roots), leaf litter, fungi, bacteria and\nsoil organic matter (dead organic matter mainly associated with the mineral\nsoil fraction). The biomass of basal resources was not used in the food-web\nmodelling because we focussed on consumption/energy flux^63.\n\n### Birds\n\nBirds were sampled with point counts as well as automated sound recordings\nfrom May to July 2013. All plots were visited three times for 20 min point\ncounts. The observer stood in the plot middle and all birds detected in the\nplot were recorded. Point counts took place between 6:00 and 10:00 and the\ntiming for individual plots alternated between early and late morning^32. We\nexcluded detections from fly-overs and bird vocalizations that could not be\nidentified immediately were recorded using a directional microphone\n(Sennheiser ME-66) to compare with recordings from the xeno-canto online bird\ncall database (http://xeno-canto.org/). In addition to point counts, we\nrecorded stereo sound at 44,100 Hz sampling frequency (SMX-II microphones,\nSM2+ recorder, Wildlife acoustics); the recorders were attached to the central\ntree of the plot at 2.0\u20132.5 m height. We recorded sound in eight plots\nsimultaneously; sampling all 32 plots took 4 days (10 and 13 May and the 3 and\n7 June 2013). We uploaded the first 20 min of recording after sunrise to the\nonline eco-acoustics platform BioSounds^64 so that two independent\nornithologists could identify all audible bird calls and calls visible on the\nspectrogram (within an estimated 35 m radius) to species. For each plot, bird\nspecies identified by both ornithologists in the recordings were subsequently\nmerged with the species obtained from the point counts to generate the dataset\nused in the analysis. In total, 418 bird occurrences were detected in 2013 and\n542 in 2016 (validation survey). Guilds were defined on the basis of feeding\npreferences of species (five levels: fruits and nectar, plants and seeds,\ninvertebrates, vertebrates and scavenging, omnivores), spatial distribution\n(canopy, ground foraging or both) and body masses; following information\nobtained from a public database^65. In total, 11 guilds were distinguished\n(raw data are available from figshare; Data availability).\n\n### Canopy arthropods\n\nCanopy arthropods were collected by fogging (the application of a knockdown\ninsecticide) in three locations per plot between May and October 2013 (main\nsurvey) and 2017 (validation survey). Target locations were randomly\npositioned in the plot; fallen trees and canopy gaps were avoided. Fogging was\nconducted immediately after sunrise, in dry conditions to avoid small\narthropods sticking to precipitation. A mixture of 50 ml of DECIS 25 EC (Bayer\nCrop Science, deltamethrine 25 g l^\u22121) and 4 l of petroleum white oil was\napplied to each target canopy, about 20 min per fogging event. Underneath each\ntarget canopy, square 1 \u00d7 1 m funnel traps were placed at about 1.5 m above\nground level using ropes and each funnel was fitted with a 250 ml plastic\nbottle containing 100 ml of 96% ethanol. Sixteen funnels were used during the\nmain survey in 2013, whereas eight funnels were used for the validation survey\nin 2017. Two hours after the application of the insecticide, stunned or dead\narthropods were collected and cleaned from debris, the ethanol was exchanged\nand the samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further analysis. The data used in\nthis study were based on combined abundances of canopy arthropods across the\nthree subsamples per plot, resulting in one abundance value per plot. More\ndetails on the sampling are provided elsewhere^66. Overall, 366,975 individual\ncanopy arthropods were collected during the main survey and 179,334 during the\nvalidation survey. Arthropods were then sorted to 12 major arthropod orders\n(Acarina, Araneae, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Hemiptera,\nHymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Psocoptera and Thysanoptera). As large\nflying taxa such as Apoidea and Vespoidea in part actively evaded the\ninsecticide fog at the time of application (J.D., personal observation), the\norder Hymenoptera in this study is represented by Formicidae (ants) and\nBraconidae (a family of parasitoid wasps), both of which were highly abundant\nin the samples^66,67. Also, four abundant beetle families with contrasting\nfeeding strategies were analysed separately from the rest of the order\nColeoptera (henceforth termed \u2018other Coleoptera\u2019)\u2014Chrysomelidae,\nCurculionidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae. Arthropod taxa listed above were\nused as trophic guilds (17 in total), each assigned with feeding preferences\nto living plants or other invertebrates and vertebrates according to existing\nliterature^55 and unpublished data on stable isotope composition measured in\nthe collected animals. We extrapolated general knowledge on the trophic\necology of high-rank taxa (for example, Chrysomelidae are herbivores whereas\nStaphylinidae are predators) to all collected individuals in these taxa\nassuming phylogenetic signal in trophic niches and because information on the\nfeeding preferences of most tropical invertebrate species is lacking. Average\nbody mass of each guild at each plot was estimated using group-specific\nlength\u2013mass regressions^63; body lengths were measured for all animal groups\nin each sample (up to ten random individuals per sample per group to estimate\nthe mean). Density of canopy arthropods per square metre was calculated by\ndividing the total abundance of collected arthropods by the number of traps\nused. Detailed biodiversity declines over the investigated land-use change\ngradient are published for arboreal communities of ants^67, beetles^68,\nspringtails^69, spiders^33 and parasitoid wasps^66.\n\n### Soil arthropods and earthworms\n\nSoil invertebrates were collected using a high-gradient extraction method. In\neach plot, three soil samples were taken (one in each of three subplots)\nduring October and November 2013. Samples measured 16 \u00d7 16 cm and comprised\nthe litter layer and the underlying mineral soil layer to a depth of 5 cm.\nLitter and soil were extracted separately but merged in the food-web analysis.\nAnimals were extracted from litter and soil for 6\u20138 days under a heat gradient\nfrom 40 to 50 \u00b0C above the sample to 15 \u00b0C below the sample and collected in\ndimethyleneglycol:water solution (1:1) and thereafter transferred to 70%\nethanol. More details on the sampling and extraction procedure are given\nelsewhere^70. In total, 29,956 soil invertebrate individuals were collected in\n2013 and 50,401 individuals in 2016 (validation survey). The lower total\nnumber of collected individuals in 2013 is because mites and springtails were\ncounted in only two out of three samples per plot. Collected animals,\nincluding earthworms were sorted to high-rank taxa (orders and families) under\na dissecting microscope, allowing allocation to trophic guilds^55. Soil\ninvertebrate taxa are generally consistent in their trophic niches^71.\nHowever, to reflect widespread omnivory, most of them were assigned to feed on\nmultiple basal resources (living plants, litter, bacteria, fungi, soil organic\nmatter and other invertebrates) on the basis of existing knowledge^55 and\nstable isotope composition previously measured in the collected animals^36.\nAverage body mass of each guild at each plot was estimated using group-\nspecific length\u2013mass regressions^63,72,73,74, with body lengths measured from\nall individuals in each sample (for ants and symphylans we measured only the\nfirst ten individuals per sample). Vertical distribution across soil, litter\nand ground for each trophic guild of soil arthropods was estimated using the\nrelative abundance of this guild in litter (litter and ground layers) or\nsoil^10. In total, 33 guilds of soil arthropods and one guild of earthworms\nwere distinguished (Extended Data Fig. 6). Density of soil invertebrates per\nsquare metre was calculated by recalculating the abundance from the sample to\nthe metre scale.\n\n### Food-web reconstruction\n\nAll data manipulations and statistical analyses were done in R v.4.2.0 with R\nstudio interface v.1.4.1103 (RStudio, PBC). We used a \u2018multichannel\u2019 food-web\nreconstruction approach^43. We combined all trophic guilds across birds,\ncanopy and soil arthropods and earthworms into a single table which included\nthe following traits of each guild: feeding preferences to plants (including\nphototrophic microorganisms and endophytic/epiphytic microorganisms\naboveground), litter, fungi, bacteria, soil organic matter or animal food\n(predation on invertebrates or vertebrates), mean body mass, body mass\nvariation (standard deviation), biomass per square metre and spatial niche\n(soil, litter, ground and canopy). The table was complemented with published\ninformation on protection traits and C and N content for each guild^55 (full\ndata with all traits are available from figshare; Data availability). Because\nspecies-level biology of tropical invertebrates is poorly known and we did not\nhave species-level information for about 50% of the studied arthropods, traits\nwere assigned to supraspecific taxa assuming their general trophic and\nfunctional consistency^71. Generic rules of food-web reconstruction based on\nfood-web theory were used to infer weighted trophic interactions among all\nnodes with the following assumptions^43: (1) there are phylogenetically\ninherited differences in feeding preferences for various basal resources and\npredation capability among soil animal taxa which define their feeding\ninteractions (reflected as resource preferences in the raw data table)^55; (2)\npredator\u2013prey interactions are primarily defined by the optimum predator\u2013prey\nmass ratio (PPMR)^75,76\u2014typically, a predator is larger than its prey but\ncertain predator traits (hunting traits and behaviour, parasitic lifestyle)\ncan considerably modify the optimum PPMR^43. We measured body mass\ndistribution overlap for each potential pair of predator and prey in each food\nweb to determine the most plausible trophic interactions; (3) strength of the\ntrophic interaction between predator and prey is defined by the overlap in\ntheir spatial niches related to vertical differentiation, with greater overlap\nleading to stronger interactions (no overlap among specialized canopy and soil\narthropods and full overlap between \u2018canopy\u2019 birds and arthropods collected\nusing canopy fogging); (4) predation is biomass-dependent^77\u2014because of higher\nencounter rate, predators will preferentially feed on prey that are locally\nabundant; and (5) strength of the trophic interaction between predator and\nprey can be considerably reduced by prey protective traits\u2014prey with physical,\nchemical or behavioural protection are consumed less^78. All these assumptions\nare applied together to infer the most plausible trophic interaction matrix.\nFor example, feeding preferences of omnivorous nodes to basal resources or\nother invertebrates were assigned on the basis of literature (assumption 1),\nwhereas prey selection among other invertebrates was based on size, spatial\nniche, total biomass and protection of prey (assumptions 2\u20135). The\nreconstruction R script is available from figshare (Code availability). Food-\nweb reconstruction was carried out separately for each plot; collected data\nwere averaged across subplots. Plots were assumed to represent local food webs\nand were used as biological replicates in statistical analyses (Extended Data\nFigs. 3 and 4).\n\n### Energy flux estimation\n\nTo calculate energy fluxes among food-web nodes we used reconstructed\ninteraction networks, biomasses, body mass-dependent metabolic losses and\nenvironmental temperature and applied the fluxweb package^77. In brief, per-\nbiomass metabolic rates were calculated from average fresh body masses using\nthe equation and coefficients for corresponding phylogenetic groups of\ninvertebrates^13,79 and endothermic vertebrates^12 (the used metabolic\nregressions typically have R^2 > 95% if calculated for a wide range of body\nmasses; Extended Data Table 2). The mean annual soil temperature was taken\nfrom meteorological measurements at our study sites (forest 25.0 \u00b0C, jungle\nrubber 25.6 \u00b0C, rubber and oil palm 26.1 \u00b0C)^80. The energy flux to each node\nwas calculated from per-biomass metabolism, accounting for assimilation\nefficiencies (proportion of energy from food that is metabolized by the\nconsumer) and losses to predation assuming a steady-state energetic system\n(energetic losses from each node are compensated by the lower trophic levels;\nfor example, if herbivores are present in the system there is enough plant\nbiomass to sustain them)^13,81. Although the steady-state assumption is\nunlikely to be fully supported in most real-world ecosystems, this assumption\nallows for comparison of dominant energy processes across different ecosystems\nthat are stable at the time of consideration (years) and thus was appropriate\nfor our aims. We used diet\u2010specific assimilation efficiencies which we\ncalculated from nitrogen content of each prey/basal resource node using a\npublished equation^25. Assimilation efficiencies for basal resources were\ncalculated as 21% from plant material, 18% from leaf litter, 13% from soil\norganic matter, 96% from bacteria and 36% from fungi and from 61% in\nmillipedes to 97% in centipedes, earthworms and several other animal\ngroups^43. Then, we applied the fluxing function to the reconstructed\ninteraction networks, which delivered energy flux estimations among all food-\nweb nodes. Data were expressed in mW m^\u22122. Because the absolute estimates of\nthe energy flux can be biased as a result of the abovementioned assumptions\nand regression-based conversions, we focus mainly on comparisons in our main\nconclusions. Detailed information on the approach can be found in the energy\nflux methodology paper ref. ^63.\n\n### Food-web parameters\n\nTo analyse food-web structure and energetics and test our hypotheses, we\ncalculated bulk parameters for each food web and classified energy fluxes\naccording to \u2018trophic functions\u2019. Trophic functions were primarily linked to\nthe consumed food: herbivory represented a sum of outgoing fluxes from living\nplants (leaves/shoots and roots); litter and soil feeding represented a sum of\noutgoing fluxes from plant litter and soil organic matter, respectively;\nbacterivory and fungivory represented a sum of outgoing fluxes from bacteria\nand fungi, respectively; predation represented a sum of outgoing fluxes from\nall animal nodes. Six bulk parameters were calculated: (1) total biomass of\nall studied animal groups per square metre; (2) total energy flux (in mW)\nacross all studied animal groups per square metre; (3) number of trophic links\namong trophic guilds in the reconstructed food web (a proxy for food-web\ncomplexity); (4) ratio of all energy fluxes from prey to predators to all\nenergy fluxes from basal resources to primary consumers (a proxy for trophic\nhierarchy and predation control^18); (5) ratio of all energy fluxes from\nbacteria versus all energy fluxes from fungi (a proxy for carbon cycling\nrate^48); and (6) ratio between the production of faeces and the consumption\nof soil organic matter (a proxy for soil organic matter/carbon balance). The\nlast indicator is new and is based on three main lines of evidence: (i)\nconversion of plant material into faeces by soil invertebrates increases\nmicrobial biomass production^52; (ii) microbial biomass production is the key\nprocess contributing to soil organic matter formation and stabilization^50;\n(iii) consumption of soil organic matter by invertebrates (a sum of outgoing\nfluxes from soil organic matter) leads to consumption of associated microbial\nbiomass^50 and thus has opposite effects to the first two lines of evidence.\nTo calculate the production of faeces, we multiplied all energy fluxes by\ninverted assimilation efficiency and summed them up, thus quantifying all\nunassimilated food in the food web. We highlight that this parameter is new\nand should be validated through controlled experiments, as the effect of soil\nfeeders on soil organic matter sequestration is context-dependent (although\noften negative as predicted)^50. All parameters, except (5) and (6), and all\ntrophic functions were calculated for the entire food web, separately for\naboveground and belowground food-web compartments and for individual animal\ngroups (birds, canopy arthropods, soil arthropods and earthworms).\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nTo analyse the overall distribution of energy flux across animal groups and trophic functions, we first ran two mixed-effect models testing the effect of land-use system (rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm), region (two regions included in the design) and either major animal group or trophic function on energy fluxes in food webs (the lme4 package)^82. Two models were run separately for groups and functions because not all functions are performed by all groups. Chi-square, significance and degrees of freedom were approximated using Wald Chi-square tests (the car package)^83. We allowed for random intercepts depending on the plot to account for interdependence of groups and functions in the same site. The model code was lmer(Flux ~ Group (or Function) * Landuse + Region + (1 | Plot), data). To test specific hypotheses related to changes in trophic functions (first, more energy allocated to aboveground food webs in plantations; second, lower predation in plantations; third, a shift in basal resource feeding and carbon cycling across land-use systems), generalized linear models were run for each of the four bulk food-web parameters calculated separately for aboveground and belowground food-web compartments (response variables: total biomass, total energy flux, number of trophic links and trophic hierarchy) and two indicators of carbon cycling in belowground food webs (response variables: bacteria-to-fungi ratio and faeces production-to-soil consumption ratio). Data distribution selection followed visual inspection of the frequency distributions of raw data and homogeneity in the residuals of the model. Gaussian distribution was used for the number of trophic links, bacteria-to-fungi ratio, trophic hierarchy and production-to-soil consumption ratio and log-normal distribution was used for the total energy flux. The model code was lm(Flux ~ Landuse * Above/belowground + Region, data). Owing to a strong heteroscedasticity of variance across aboveground and belowground compartments, we used generalized least-squares models to analyse the total biomass^84 (the nlme package)^85. The model code was gls(Flux ~ Landuse * Above/belowground + Region, weights = vf, data), where vf <\\- varIdent(form = ~ 1 | Above/belowground * Landuse). To test for significant differences between rainforest and other land-use systems, we applied the same types of models for aboveground and belowground food-web compartments separately, testing the effect of the land-use system and reported P values of the linear model coefficients.\n\n### Sensitivity analyses\n\nWe ran two further analyses to evaluate sensitivity of our conclusions to\nfood-web reconstruction assumptions and undersampling of canopy arthropods. To\ntest if the revealed patterns are robust to our food-web reconstruction\nassumptions (see section on Food-web reconstruction), we re-ran food-web\nreconstructions and energy flux calculations 50 times, varying the following\nparameters from 0 to 1 with the step of 0.1 (Extended Data Fig. 1): (1)\nomnivory, where 0 is full resource specialization and 1 is full trophic\ngeneralism; (2) self-predation, where 0 is no self-predation and 1 is no\nlimits on self-predation; (3) size-structured predation, where 0 is strictly\nsize-structured predation and 1 is trophic interactions independent of body\nmasses; (4) spatial-structured predation, where 0 is predation strictly\ndefined by spatial niche overlaps and 1 is trophic interactions independent of\nspatial niche overlaps; and (5) protection, where 0 is all protection\nconsidered and 1 is no protection considered. Results are presented in\nExtended Data Fig. 1. Overall, we found that our absolute energy flux\nestimations in belowground food webs were most sensitive to the degree of\nomnivory. This effect was driven by a low assimilation efficiency of specific\nfood resources (for example, soil organic matter). Degree of omnivory used in\nthe main analysis (auxiliary resources were assumed to be five times less\nimportant than the main ones) seems realistic considering that multichannel\nfeeding has repeatedly been reported in soil invertebrates^55,86,87. None of\nthe tested settings undermined our main conclusions.\n\nTo test if our results were biased because canopy fogging underestimated the\ncanopy arthropod biomasses, we used data on canopy heights. For that, during\nFebruary 2013 to August 2014 we measured all trees in all plots with a minimum\ndiameter at breast height of 10 cm, allowing us to calculate the average tree\nheight and 90th quantile per plot. We assumed that canopy fogging was\nefficient until a certain tree height but failed to assess arthropods above\nthis height. Ten different heights were tested, starting from 14 m maximum\nfogging efficiency (high undersampling) to 22 m maximum fogging efficiency\n(low undersampling). In each iteration, we used the range from 5 m (lower\ncanopy) to the height of maximum efficiency as the \u2018assessed community\u2019 and\neverything above that height as \u2018unassessed community\u2019. Assuming the same\ndensity and community composition in the unassessed community, we multiplied\ncanopy arthropod biomass by the ratio of unassessed to assessed community.\nFinal multiplication coefficients varied from 1.0 in most of the plantation\nplots (no undersampling) to 3.5\u20133.8 in several rainforest plots (only about\n30% of arthropods were sampled). Food-web reconstructions and energy flux\ncalculations were re-run using new canopy arthropod biomasses. Results are\npresented in Extended Data Fig. 2. Overall, we found that under \u2018high\nundersampling\u2019 scenario energy fluxes in aboveground food webs in rainforest\nincreased almost threefold in comparison to our initial model. This increase\nwas less evident in jungle rubber and almost not present in plantations in\nwhich the canopy height was low. Thus, the \u2018high undersampling\u2019 scenario\nexacerbated land-use effects on the total energy fluxes aboveground (\u221287%\ndecline in rubber and \u221292% decline in oil palm in comparison to \u221275% and \u221279%\ndecline in our initial analysis, correspondingly). Despite these pronounced\ndifferences, none of the tested settings undermined our main conclusions.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nRaw data used in the analysis are available from figshare:\nhttps://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24648438.

Coefficients used in the main analysis are shown with\nblack vertical lines. Omnivory controls how important auxiliary resources are\nfor the consumers (a). Self-predation controls for the extent to which each\nnode feeds on itself (cannibalism), where 1 means that individuals of their\nown guild are considered in the same way as those in all other nodes (b).\nSize-structured predation controls for deviations from the rules of\npredator\u2013prey mass ratios (c). Spatial predation controls for deviations from\nthe rules of spatial niche overlap (d). Protection controls for the importance\nof prey protection (e).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Sensitivity analysis of the canopy fogging\nundersampling.\n\nEffect of canopy arthropod undersampling on the energy fluxes in four land-use\nsystems (dark green \u2013 forest, light green \u2013 jungle rubber, orange \u2013 rubber,\nyellow \u2013 oil palm; n = 8 sites per system, standard error is shown as the\nvariation measure). We tested how the maximum tree height for efficient\nfogging affected our results. Average and 90th quantile (Q90) of tree height\nwere calculated for each plot (a). The quantiles were further used to estimate\nbias in energy flux estimations aboveground (solid line) and belowground\n(dashed line), assuming that fogging works efficiently to assess canopy\narthropods up to a certain tree height (models were run for each additional\nmetre starting from 14 m as a \u2018large bias\u2019 and up to 22 m as a \u2018small bias\u2019;\nb). Land-use effect was more pronounced if we assumed a large bias due to\nhigher trees in rainforest, than in plantations (n = 8, 1 SD variation; c).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Reconstructed food webs in each land-use system from\nthe main survey in 2013.\n\nEight food webs per system representing eight sites are shown. \u201cB\u201d and \u201cH\u201d in\nthe site codes refer to the \u201cBukit Duabelas\u201d and \u201cHarapan\u201d regions,\ncorrespondingly. Food-web nodes include basal resources displayed with black\nlabels (living plants \u2013 P, plant litter \u2013 L, fungi \u2013 F, bacteria \u2013 B, soil\norganic matter \u2013 S) and consumer trophic guilds shown with circles. Consumer\nnodes are clustered in four major groups according to their vertical\ndistribution and ecological niches (canopy arthropods \u2013 light green, birds \u2013\ndark green, soil arthropods \u2013 light red, earthworms \u2013 beige). Horizontal\ndistribution of consumer nodes represent trophic positions (trophic level\nincreases from left to right). Connecting lines on the food-web diagram\nrepresent energy fluxes in mW m^\u22122 (represented by the thickness of the\nlines).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Reconstructed food webs in each land-use system from\nthe validation survey in 2016\u20132017.\n\nEight food webs per system representing eight sites are shown. \u201cB\u201d and \u201cH\u201d in\nthe site codes refer to the \u201cBukit Duabelas\u201d and \u201cHarapan\u201d regions,\nrespectively. Food-web nodes include basal resources displayed with black\nlabels (living plants \u2013 P, plant litter \u2013 L, fungi \u2013 F, bacteria \u2013 B, soil\norganic matter \u2013 S) and consumer trophic guilds shown with circles. Consumer\nnodes are clustered in four major groups according to their vertical\ndistribution and ecological niches (canopy arthropods \u2013 light green, birds \u2013\ndark green, soil arthropods \u2013 light red, earthworms \u2013 beige). Horizontal\ndistribution of consumer nodes represent trophic positions (trophic level\nincreases from left to right). Connecting lines on the food-web diagram\nrepresent energy fluxes in mW m^\u22122 (represented by the thickness of the\nlines).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Validation of the main survey from 2013 with the\nresults of the validation survey from 2016\u20132017.\n\nEffects of land use and above/belowground compartment identity on bulk food-\nweb parameters compared between the main survey in 2013 and the validation\nsurvey in 2016\u20132017 (a). Each point is a site, bars represent means. Colours\ndenote land-use systems (dark green \u2013 forest, light green \u2013 jungle rubber,\norange \u2013 rubber, yellow \u2013 oil palm; n = 8 sites per system). Note square root\nscale in biomass, total energy flux and carbon balance charts. Asterisks mark\nsignificant differences between means for the given parameter above- or\nbelowground from that in rainforest (two-tailed; ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p\n< 0.05). Effects of land-use system and above/belowground on the tested\nparameters are given below the corresponding bar charts. Average trophic\nfunctions for each major group of consumers and for the food web in total are\nsummarized as stacked proportional bar charts (b). Refer to Figs. 2 and 3 in\nthe main text for more detailed explanations. Note that jungle rubber was not\nassessed in 2016\u20132017.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Biomasses of trophic guilds in different land-use\nsystems.\n\nGuilds of aboveground (birds, canopy arthropods) and belowground (earthworms\nand soil arthropods) animals are shown separately and ordered according to\naverage biomass across systems. Mean fresh biomasses from the main survey in\n2013 are displayed with bars. Full definitions and abbreviations (for example\nEw \u2013 earthworms, Av \u2013 birds) of the trophic guilds are given in the data\ntables available from Figshare (see Data availability).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 Biomasses of trophic guilds in different land-use\nsystems in the validation survey.\n\nGuilds of aboveground (birds, canopy arthropods) and belowground (earthworms\nand soil arthropods) animals are shown separately and ordered according to\naverage biomass across systems. Mean fresh biomasses from the validation\nsurvey in 2016\u20132017 are displayed with bars.
