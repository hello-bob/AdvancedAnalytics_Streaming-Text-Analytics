This means that\neven if BearAuth is compromised, your secrets are still safe.\n\nZero-access encryption works by encrypting your secrets with your API keys,\nwhich BearAuth never stores. Even BearAuth can't decrypt your secrets unless\nyou make a request with an API key.\n\nOther solutions not only don't use zero-access encryption, but they\ntechnically can't do so. They have features like login pages that are end-user\nfacing, so they have to be able to decrypt and use your secrets independently.\nThis makes your secrets vulnerable to breaches and misuse.\n\nBearAuth is focused on security, because it's all we do.\n\n### More Control\n\nThe user experience is yours. Your website, your components, your design. No\nredirecting to a 3rd party login page with pay-to-remove 3rd party branding.\nNo page refreshes to re-authenticate. No fiddling with custom domains pointing\nto a 3rd party. You just need a single /auth (or equivalent) endpoint in your\nown API, and we will even provide the implementation.\n\nThe API is simple and can be self hosted. If you ever feel like you want to\nmove away from BearAuth, you can replace the API with your own implementation,\nand you won't have to change your user experience at all. The vendor lock-in\nis that low.\n\n### Lower Cost\n\nBearAuth is minimal. The simple and low ongoing cost we pass on to you\nreflects our focus. We don't need to try to amortize the cost of implementing,\nmaintaining, and supporting a large feature set. Anything we don't do, is a\nmiddle markup you avoid.\n\nAs you implement your own authentication solution, we can provide consultation\nengagements for a one-time fee, all the way up to building the whole solution\nfor you on your own infrastructure. Once you have your solution with the\nfeatures you need, you won't need to pay for more than the ongoing cost of\nusing the API.\n\nWe can also help you self-host the BearAuth API itself for an annual\nsubscription fee. This can reduce your costs even further, while providing\neven more security and control.\n\n## Popular repositories\n\n  1. .github .github Public\n\n  2. bearauth-com.github.io bearauth-com.github.io Public\n\n### Repositories\n\nShowing 2 of 2 repositories\n\n  * .github Public\n\n0 0 0 0 Updated Apr 17, 2024\n\n  * bearauth-com.github.io Public\n\n0 0 0 0 Updated Apr 17, 2024\n\n#### People\n\nThis organization has no public members.
