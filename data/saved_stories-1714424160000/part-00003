People seem keen to alter\nthe past when looking for a future partner.\n\nAccording to an OkCupid user survey with over 185,000 responses, nearly two-\nthirds (62%) of single women who use the app want to erase an ex from a \u201cgood\nphoto.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, there is geographic variance in how many users want to delete\nexes from photos. American users wish to delete exes quite a bit, with more\nthan half of all users, regardless of gender, wanting to eliminate former love\ninterests in portraits. German and French users, at 27% and 29%, respectively,\nare more relaxed.\n\nHowever, no country holds a candle to the Philippines, where 74% of OkCupid\nusers want to delete their exes. Presumably, the different preferences by\ncountry rely heavily upon societal norms surrounding prior dating partners,\nwith some countries generally caring more than others about whether a\npotential partner has any dating history.\n\nGlobally, 51% of all respondents have wanted to erase an ex from a photo of\nthemselves, with 43% saying it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to look at them, 41%\nsaying it helps them get over the breakup, and 16% seeking to use the photo on\na dating profile.\n\nThere are also differences by age, with younger users more interested in\ndeleting exes from photos. Older daters seem more patient for prospective\nmatches with photos of exes.\n\nIt is not just the users with ex-filled photos who want them gone. People\nlooking at dating profiles also prefer to see portraits with just one person\nin the frame. Nearly seven in 10 daters say they want to see individual photos\nof potential matches. Love-seekers with a profile photo of only themselves get\n42% more likes and 25% more matches on OkCupid.\n\nPhotoroom\u2019s new Ex-Terminator is very easy to use thanks to the power of AI.\nUsers upload their images to the website, \u201cerase\u201d their \u201cno-good ex,\u201d and\n\u201cmove on.\u201d Photoroom and OkCupid promise that a person\u2019s ex will be gone\n\u201cwithout a trace.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Ex-terminating\u2019 your ex by erasing them from a good photo is set to become\nthe summer\u2019s hot new dating trend,\u201d says OkCupid\u2019s Head of Brand Michael Kaye.\n\nSo far this year, OkCupid users have already sent more than 100 million first\nmessages to others, with about 70% seeking a long-term relationship. That\u2019s a\nlot of first moves and many people looking at other\u2019s portraits.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s to heal and move on or to salvage a good photo, millions of\nfolks want to erase their exes from old pictures,\u201d says Lauren Sudworth,\nPhotoroom\u2019s Head of Brand.\n\nImage credits: Photoroom and OkCupid\n\nCulture, News\n\nai, app, artificialintelligence, dating, datingapp, okcupid, photoediting,\nphotoroom, portrait, selfie\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAI Product Photo Platform Photoroom Receives $43 Million in Funding\n\nStudy Finds That Kodak EasyShare and Camera Phones Make You Ugly\n\n\u2018Replace My Ex\u2019 Shows a Lighter Side of AI Photo Editing\n\nEx-Yahoo CEO Launches Shine, an AI-Powered Group Photo Sharing App\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nSatellite Photo Shows an Army of \u2018Black Spiders\u2019 on Mars\n\nApr 26, 2024\n\nNewly-Unearthed Photo May Reveal Iceberg That Sunk The Titanic\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\nCamera Sales Grew For First Time in 13 Years, But Not for Canon\n\nApr 26, 2024\n\nThe Celebrities You Might Not Know Are Into Their Photography\n\nApr 27, 2024\n\nPhotographer Becomes Online Sensation With Stunning Dog Portraits\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
