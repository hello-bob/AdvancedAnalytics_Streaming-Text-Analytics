They include\nhis 1867-1868 \"thousand mile walk,\" his early years in Yosemite, extensive\ntravels in Alaska, his 1903 world tour, and his 1911-1912 voyage to South\nAmerica and Africa. The journals offer a unique perspective on Muir's life and\nexperiences in his own words and drawings.\n\nSome of the journals are filled with miscellaneous notes and jotted writings,\nwhile others feature diary-like narratives. Similarly, some journals contain\nonly text while others, especially those from his Alaska trips, are full of\ndrawings that reflect the places Muir visited.\n\nMany, but not all, of the digitized John Muir journals are transcribed.\nPortions of the journals can be difficult to read because of faded writing,\nbut the zoom feature enables users to magnify pages and improve their\nlegibility. Join our Muir Journal Transcription Project to help.\n\nThe \"titles\" assigned to each journal are taken from the published Guide and\nIndex to the Microform Edition of the John Muir Papers, 1858-1957. These\ntitles convey the general content of each journal, but many of the journals\ncontain a wealth of information beyond the subject indicated in the title. It\nmay be helpful to consult the John Muir chronology for more information on\nwhere Muir was during the periods when he was writing various journals.\n\nThe unpublished works of John Muir are under copyright by the Muir-Hanna\nTrust.
