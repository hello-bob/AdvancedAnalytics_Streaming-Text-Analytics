Increasing evidence suggests that animal culture can,\nlike human culture, be cumulative: characterized by sequential innovations\nthat build on previous ones^1. However, human cumulative culture involves\nbehaviours so complex that they lie beyond the capacity of any individual to\nindependently discover during their lifetime^1,2,3. To our knowledge, no study\nhas so far demonstrated this phenomenon in an invertebrate. Here we show that\nbumblebees can learn from trained demonstrator bees to open a novel two-step\npuzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so\nindependently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrator bees to perform\nthe unrewarded first step without providing a temporary reward linked to this\naction, which was removed during later stages of training. However, a third of\nnaive observer bees learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators,\nwithout ever being rewarded after the first step. This suggests that social\nlearning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to \u2018re-\ninnovate\u2019 through individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open\nthe box despite extended exposure for up to 24 days. This finding challenges a\ncommon opinion in the field: that the capacity to socially learn behaviours\nthat cannot be innovated through individual trial and error is unique to\nhumans.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Collective intelligence: A unifying concept for integrating biology across\nscales and substrates\n\nArticle Open access 28 March 2024\n\n### A brainstem\u2013hypothalamus neuronal circuit reduces feeding upon heat\nexposure\n\nArticle Open access 27 March 2024\n\n### Physiography, foraging mobility, and the first peopling of Sahul\n\nArticle Open access 23 April 2024\n\n## Main\n\nCulture in animals can be broadly conceptualized as the sum of a population\u2019s\nbehavioural traditions, which, in turn, are defined as behaviours that are\ntransmitted through social learning and that persist in a population over\ntime^4. Although culture was once thought to be exclusive to humans and a key\nexplanation of our own evolutionary success, the existence of non-human\ncultures that change over time is no longer controversial. Changes in the\nsongs of Savannah sparrows^5 and humpback whales^6,7,8 have been documented\nover decades. The sweet-potato-washing behaviour of Japanese macaques has also\nundergone several distinctive modifications since its inception at the hands\nof \u2018Imo\u2019, a juvenile female, in 1953^9. Imo\u2019s initial behaviour involved\ndipping a potato in a freshwater stream and wiping sand off with her spare\nhand, but within a decade it had evolved to include repeated washing in\nseawater in between bites rather than in fresh water, potentially to enhance\nthe flavour of the potato. By the 1980s, a range of variations had appeared\namong macaques, including stealing already-washed potatoes from conspecifics,\nand digging new pools in secluded areas to wash potatoes without being seen by\nscroungers^9,10,11. Likewise, the \u2018wide\u2019, \u2018narrow\u2019 and \u2018stepped\u2019 designs of\npandanus tools, which are fashioned from torn leaves by New Caledonian crows\nand used to fish grubs from logs, seem to have diverged from a single point of\norigin^12. In this manner, cultural evolution can result in both the\naccumulation of novel traditions, and the accumulation of modifications to\nthese traditions in turn. However, the limitations of non-human cultural\nevolution remain a subject of debate.\n\nIt is clearly true that humans are a uniquely encultured species. Almost\neverything we do relies on knowledge or technology that has taken many\ngenerations to build. No one human being could possibly manage, within their\nown lifetime, to split the atom by themselves from scratch. They could not\neven conceive of doing so without centuries of accumulated scientific\nknowledge. The existence of this so-called cumulative culture was thought to\nrely on the \u2018ratchet\u2019 concept, whereby traditions are retained in a population\nwith sufficient fidelity to allow improvements to accumulate^1,2,3. This was\nargued to require so-called higher-order forms of social learning, such as\nimitative copying^13 or teaching^14, which have, in turn, been argued to be\nexclusive to humans (although, see a review of imitative copying in animals^15\nfor potential examples). But if we strip the definition of cumulative culture\nback to its bare bones, for a behavioural tradition to be considered\ncumulative, it must fulfil a set of core requirements^1. In short, a\nbeneficial innovation or modification to a behaviour must be socially\ntransmitted among individuals of a population. This process may then occur\nrepeatedly, leading to sequential improvements or elaborations. According to\nthese criteria, there is evidence that some animals are capable of forming a\ncumulative culture in certain contexts and circumstances^1,16,17. For example,\nwhen pairs of pigeons were tasked with making repeated flights home from a\nnovel location, they found more efficient routes more quickly when members of\nthese pairs were progressively swapped out, when compared with pairs of fixed\ncomposition or solo individuals^16. This was thought to be due to\n\u2018innovations\u2019 made by the new individuals, resulting in incremental\nimprovements in route efficiency. However, the end state of the behaviour in\nthis case could, in theory, have been arrived at by a single individual^1. It\nremains unclear whether modifications can accumulate to the point at which the\nfinal behaviour is too complex for any individual to innovate itself, but can\nstill be acquired by that same individual through social learning from a\nknowledgeable conspecific. This threshold, often including the stipulation\nthat re-innovation must be impossible within an individual\u2019s own lifetime, is\nargued by some to represent a fundamental difference between human and non-\nhuman cognition^3,13,18.\n\nBumblebees (Bombus terrestris) are social insects that have been shown to be\ncapable of acquiring complex, non-natural behaviours through social learning\nin a laboratory setting, such as string-pulling^19 and ball-rolling to gain\nrewards^20. In the latter case, they were even able to improve on the\nbehaviour of their original demonstrator. More recently, when challenged with\na two-option puzzle-box task and a paradigm allowing learning to diffuse\nacross a population (a gold standard of cultural transmission experiments^21,\nas used previously in wild great tits^22), bumblebees were found to acquire\nand maintain arbitrary variants of this behaviour from trained\ndemonstrators^23. However, these previous investigations involved the\nacquisition of a behaviour that each bee could also have innovated\nindependently. Indeed, some naive individuals were able to open the puzzle\nbox, pull strings and roll balls without demonstrators^19,20,23. Thus, to\ndetermine whether bumblebees could acquire a behaviour through social learning\nthat they could not innovate independently, we developed a novel two-step\npuzzle box (Fig. 1a). This design was informed by a lockbox task that was\ndeveloped to assess problem solving in Goffin\u2019s cockatoos^24. Here, cockatoos\nwere challenged to open a box that was sealed with five inter-connected\n\u2018locks\u2019 that had to be opened sequentially, with no reward for opening any but\nthe final lock. Our hypothesis was that this degree of temporal and spatial\nseparation between performing the first step of the behaviour and the reward\nwould make it very difficult, if not impossible, for a naive bumblebee to form\na lasting association between this necessary initial action and the final\nreward. Even if a bee opened the two-step box independently through repeated,\nnon-directed probing, as observed with our previous box^23, if no association\nformed between the combination of the two pushing behaviours and the reward,\nthis behaviour would be unlikely to be incorporated into an individual\u2019s\nrepertoire. If, however, a bee was able to learn this multi-step box-opening\nbehaviour when exposed to a skilled demonstrator, this would suggest that\nbumblebees can acquire behaviours socially that lie beyond their capacity for\nindividual innovation.\n\nFig. 1: Two-step puzzle-box design and experimental set-up.\n\na, Puzzle-box design. Box bases were 3D-printed to ensure consistency. The\nreward (50% w/w sucrose solution, placed on a yellow target) was inaccessible\nunless the red tab was pushed, rotating the lid anti-clockwise around a\ncentral axis, and the red tab could not move unless the blue tab was first\npushed out of its path. See Supplementary Information for a full description\nof the box design elements. b, Experimental set-up. The flight arena was\nconnected to the nest box with an acrylic tunnel, and flaps cut into the side\nallowed the removal and replacement of puzzle boxes during the experiment. The\nsides were lined with bristles to prevent bees escaping. c, Alternative action\npatterns for opening the box. The staggered-pushing technique is characterized\nby two distinct pushes (1, blue arrow and 2, red arrow), divided by either\nflying (green arrows) or walking in a loop around the inner side of the red\ntab (orange arrow). The squeezing technique is characterized by a single,\nunbroken movement, starting at the point at which the blue and red tabs meet\nand pushing through, squeezing between the outer side of the red tab and the\nouter shield, and making a tight turn to push against the red tab.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe two-step puzzle box (Fig. 1a) relied on the same principles as our\nprevious single-step, two-option puzzle box^23. To access a sucrose-solution\nreward, placed on a yellow target, a blue tab had to first be pushed out of\nthe path of a red tab, which could then be pushed in turn to rotate a clear\nlid around a central axis. Once rotated far enough, the reward would be\nexposed beneath the red tab. A sample video of a trained demonstrator opening\nthe two-step box is available (Supplementary Video 1). Our experiments were\nconducted in a specially constructed flight arena, attached to a colony\u2019s nest\nbox, in which all bees that were not currently undergoing training or testing\nwere confined (Fig. 1b).\n\nIn our previous study, several bees successfully learned to open the two-\noption, single-step box during control population experiments, which were\nconducted in the absence of a trained demonstrator across 6\u201312 days^23. Thus,\nto determine whether the two-step box could be opened by individual bees\nstarting from scratch, we sought to conduct a similar experiment. Two colonies\n(C1 and C2) took part in these control population experiments for 12 days, and\none colony (C3) for 24 days. In brief, on 12 or 24 consecutive days, bees were\nexposed to open two-step puzzle boxes for 30 min pre-training and then to\nclosed boxes for 3 h (meaning that colonies C1 and 2 were exposed to closed\nboxes for 36 h total, and colony C3 for 72 h total). No trained demonstrator\nwas added to any group. On each day, bees foraged willingly during the pre-\ntraining, but no boxes were opened in either colony during the experiment.\nAlthough some bees were observed to probe around the components of the closed\nboxes with their proboscises, particularly in the early population-experiment\nsessions, this behaviour generally decreased as the experiment progressed. A\nsingle blue tab was opened in full in colony C1, but this behaviour was\nneither expanded on nor repeated.\n\nLearning to open the two-step box was not trivial for our demonstrators, with\nthe finalized training protocol taking around two days for them to complete\n(compared with several hours for our previous two-option, single-step box^23).\nDeveloping a training protocol was also challenging. Bees readily learned to\npush the rewarded red tab, but not the unrewarded blue tab, which they would\nnot manipulate at all. Instead, they would repeatedly push against the blocked\nred tab before giving up. This necessitated the addition of a temporary yellow\ntarget and reward beneath the blue tab, which, in turn, required the addition\nof the extended tail section (as seen in Fig. 1a), because during later stages\nof training this temporary target had to be removed and its absence concealed.\nThis had to be done gradually and in combination with an increased reward on\nthe final target, because bees quickly lost their motivation to open any more\nboxes otherwise. Frequently, reluctant bees had to be coaxed back to\nparticipation by providing them with fully opened lids that they did not need\nto push at all. In short, bees seemed generally unwilling to perform actions\nthat were not directly linked to a reward, or that were no longer being\nrewarded. Notably, when opening two-step boxes after learning, demonstrators\nfrequently pushed against the red tab before attempting to push the blue, even\nthough they were able to perform the complete behaviour (and subsequently did\nso). The combination of having to move away from a visible reward and take a\nnon-direct route, and the lack of any reward in exchange for this behaviour,\nsuggests that two-step box-opening would be very difficult, if not impossible,\nfor a naive bumblebee to discover and learn for itself\u2014in line with the\nresults of the control population experiment.\n\nFor the dyad experiments, a pair of bees, including one trained demonstrator\nand one naive observer, was allowed to forage on three closed puzzle boxes\n(each filled with 20 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose solution) for 30\u201340 sessions, with\nunrewarded learning tests given to the observer in isolation after 30, 35 and\n40 joint sessions. With each session lasting a maximum of 20 min, this meant\nthat observers could be exposed to the boxes and the demonstrator for a total\nof 800 min, or 13.3 h (markedly less time than the bees in the control\npopulation experiments, who had access to the boxes in the absence of a\ndemonstrator for 36 or 72 h total). If an observer passed a learning test, it\nimmediately proceeded to 10 solo foraging sessions in the absence of the\ndemonstrator. The 15 demonstrator and observer combinations used for the dyad\nexperiments are listed in Table 1, and some demonstrators were used for\nmultiple observers. Of the 15 observers, 5 passed the unrewarded learning\ntest, with 3 of these doing so on the first attempt and the remaining 2 on the\nthird. This relatively low number reflected the difficulty of the task, but\nthe fact that any observers acquired two-step box-opening at all confirmed\nthat this behaviour could be socially learned.\n\nTable 1 Combinations of demonstrators and observers, with outcomes\n\nFull size table\n\nThe post-learning solo foraging sessions were designed to further test\nobservers\u2019 acquisition of two-step box-opening. Each session lasted up to 10\nmin, but 50 \u03bcl 50% sucrose solution was placed on the yellow target in each\nbox: as Bombus terrestris foragers have been found to collect 60\u2013150 \u03bcl\nsucrose solution per foraging trip depending on their size, this meant that\neach bee could reasonably be expected to open two boxes per session^25.\nAlthough all bees who proceeded to the solo foraging stage repeated two-step\nbox-opening, confirming their status as learners, only two individuals (A-24\nand A-6; Table 1) met the criterion to be classified as proficient learners\n(that is, they opened 10 or more boxes). This was the same threshold applied\nto learners in our previous work with the single-step two-option box^23.\nHowever, it should be noted that learners from our present study had\ncomparatively limited post-learning exposure to the boxes (a total of 100 min\non one day) compared with those from our previous work. Proficient learners\nfrom our single-step puzzle-box experiments typically attained proficiency\nover several days of foraging, and had access to boxes for 180 min each day\nfor 6\u201312 days^23. Thus, these comparatively low numbers of proficient bees are\nperhaps unsurprising.\n\nTwo different methods of opening the two-step puzzle box were observed among\nthe trained demonstrators during the dyad experiments, and were termed\n\u2018staggered-pushing\u2019 and \u2018squeezing\u2019 (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Video 2). This\nfinding essentially transformed the experiment into a \u2018two-action\u2019-type\ndesign, reminiscent of our previous single-step, two-option puzzle-box\ntask^23. Of these techniques, squeezing typically resulted in the blue tab\nbeing pushed less far than staggered-pushing did, often only just enough to\nfree the red tab, and the red tab often shifted forward as the bee squeezed\nbetween this and the outer shield. Among demonstrators, the squeezing\ntechnique was more common, being adopted as the main technique by 6 out of 9\nindividuals (Table 1). Thus, 10 out of 15 observers were paired with a\nsqueezing demonstrator.\n\nAlthough not all observers that were paired with squeezing demonstrators\nlearned to open the two-step box (5 out of 10 succeeded), all observers paired\nwith staggered-pushing demonstrators (n = 5) failed to learn two-step box-\nopening. This discrepancy was not due to the number of demonstrations being\nreceived by the observers: there was no difference in the number of boxes\nopened by squeezing demonstrators compared with staggered-pushing\ndemonstrators when the number of joint sessions was accounted for (unpaired\nt-test, t = \u22122.015, P = 0.065, degrees of freedom (df) = 13, 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) = \u22123.63\u20130.13; Table 2). This might have been because the\nsqueezing demonstrators often performed their squeezing action several times,\nlooping around the red tab, which lengthened the total duration of the\nbehaviour despite the blue tab being pushed less than during staggered-\npushing. Closer investigation of the dyads that involved only squeezing\ndemonstrators revealed that demonstrators paired with observers that failed to\nlearn tended to open fewer boxes, but this difference was not significant.\nThere was also no difference between these dyads and those that included a\nstaggered-pushing demonstrator (one-way ANOVA, F = 2.446, P = 0.129, df = 12;\nTable 2 and Fig. 2a). Together, these findings suggested that demonstrator\ntechnique might influence whether the transmission of two-step box-opening was\nsuccessful. Notably, successful learners also appeared to acquire the specific\ntechnique used by their demonstrator: in all cases, this was the squeezing\ntechnique. In the solo foraging sessions recorded for successful learners,\nthey also tended to preferentially adopt the squeezing technique (Table 1).\nThe potential effect of certain demonstrators being used for multiple dyads is\nanalysed and discussed in the Supplementary Results (see Supplementary Table 2\nand Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nTable 2 Characteristics of dyad demonstrators and observers\n\nFull size table\n\nFig. 2: Demonstrator action patterns affect the acquisition of two-step box-\nopening by observers.\n\na, Demonstrator opening index. The demonstrator opening index was calculated\nfor each dyad as the total incidence of box-opening by the demonstrator/number\nof joint foraging sessions. b, Observer following index. Following behaviour\nwas defined as the observer being present on the surface of the box, within a\nbee\u2019s length of the demonstrator, while the demonstrator performed box-\nopening. The observer following index was calculated as the total duration of\nfollowing behaviour/number of joint foraging sessions. Data in a,b were\nanalysed using one-way ANOVA and are presented as box plots. The bounds of the\nbox are drawn from quartile 1 to quartile 3 (showing the interquartile range),\nthe horizontal line within shows the median value and the whiskers extend to\nthe most extreme data point that is no more than 1.5 \u00d7 the interquartile range\nfrom the edge of the box. n = 15 independent experiments (squeezing-pass\ngroup, n = 5; squeezing-fail group, n = 5; and staggered-pushing-fail\n(stagger-fail) group, n = 5). c, Duration of following behaviour over the dyad\njoint foraging sessions. Following behaviour significantly increased with the\nnumber of joint foraging sessions, with the sharpest increase seen in dyads\nthat included a squeezing demonstrator and an observer that successfully\nacquired two-step box-opening. Data were analysed using Spearman\u2019s rank\ncorrelation coefficient tests (two-tailed), and the figures show measures\ntaken from each observer in each group. Data for individual observers are\npresented in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo determine whether observer behaviour might have differed between those who\npassed and failed, we investigated the duration of their \u2018following\u2019\nbehaviour, which was a distinctive behaviour that we identified during the\njoint foraging sessions. Here, an observer followed closely behind the\ndemonstrator as it walked on the surface of the box, often close enough to\nmake contact with the demonstrator\u2019s body with its antennae (Supplementary\nVideo 3). In the case of squeezing demonstrators, which often made several\nloops around the red tab, a following observer would make these loops also. To\nensure we quantified only the most relevant behaviour, we defined following\nbehaviour as \u2018instances in which an observer was present on the box surface,\nwithin a single bee\u2019s length of the demonstrator, while it performed two-step\nbox-opening\u2019. Thus, following behaviour could be recorded only after the\ndemonstrator began to push the blue tab, and before it accessed the reward.\nThis was quantified for each joint foraging session for the dyad experiments\n(Supplementary Table 1). There was no significant correlation between the\ndemonstrator opening index and the observer following index (Spearman\u2019s rank\ncorrelation coefficient, r_s = 0.173, df = 13, P = 0.537; Supplementary Fig.\n2), suggesting that increases in following behaviour were not due simply to\nthere being more demonstrations of two-step box-opening available to the\nobserver.\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the following index\nbetween dyads with squeezing and dyads with staggered-pushing demonstrators;\nbetween dyads in which observers passed and those in which they failed; or\nwhen both demonstrator preference and learning outcome were accounted for\n(Table 2). This might have been due to the limited sample size. However, the\nfollowing index tended to be higher in dyads in which the observer\nsuccessfully acquired two-step box-opening than in those in which the observer\nfailed (34.82 versus 16.26, respectively; Table 2) and in dyads with squeezing\ndemonstrators compared with staggered-pushing demonstrators (25.78 versus\n15.76, respectively; Table 2). When both factors were accounted for, following\nbehaviour was most frequent in dyads with a squeezing demonstrator and an\nobserver that successfully acquired two-step box-opening (34.82 versus 16.75\n(\u2018squeezing-fail\u2019 group) versus 15.76 (\u2018staggered-pushing-fail\u2019 group); Table\n2).\n\nThere was, however, a strong positive correlation between the duration of\nfollowing behaviour and the number of joint foraging sessions, which equated\nto time spent foraging alongside the demonstrator. This association was\npresent in dyads from all three groups but was strongest in the squeezing-pass\ngroup (Spearman\u2019s rank order correlation coefficient, r_s = 0.408, df = 168, P\n< 0.001; Fig. 2c). This suggests, in general, either that the latency between\nthe start of the demonstration and the observer following behaviour decreased\nover time, or that observers continued to follow for longer once arriving.\nHowever, the observers from the squeezing-pass group tended to follow for\nlonger than any other group, and the duration of their following increased\nmore rapidly. This indicates that following a conspecific demonstrator as it\nperformed two-step box-opening (and, specifically, through squeezing) was\nimportant to the acquisition of this behaviour by an observer.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this article, we present evidence suggesting that Bombus terrestris, a\nsocial invertebrate, is capable of learning a novel behaviour from a\nconspecific that cannot be learned through individual trial and error. Two-\nstep box-opening involves an initial, unrewarded step, in which bees must push\na blue tab away from the path of a red tab, before pushing the red tab to\nreceive a reward. This behaviour was so challenging that, unless an extra\nreward was added beneath the blue tab, demonstrators failed to learn two-step\nbox-opening during training. This additional reward had to be removed\ngradually during later training stages to avoid bees refusing to open more\nboxes. Even so, 5 out of 15 naive observers successfully acquired the complete\nbehaviour from the trained demonstrators. The fact that any observer bee was\nable to learn the complete two-step behaviour was notable precisely because\nthey acquired the complete behaviour: these bees had never been exposed to any\nform of puzzle box, had not learned either of the two steps before being\nexposed to the other and, unlike the demonstrators, had never been rewarded\nfor pushing the blue tab. Yet they were able to acquire the entire behaviour\nsequence through social learning.\n\nBy contrast, in a previous study, great tits were challenged with a two-step\npuzzle-box task after they had previously learned one of the two steps^26.\nAlthough the birds could combine the two behaviours to solve the puzzle, they\ndid not learn the complete two-step behaviour from the demonstrator: rather,\nthey learned component behaviours and recombined them individually to form the\nfull solution. The authors hypothesized that great tits might need both steps\nto be rewarded, at least initially, which mirrored the observations we made\nwhile developing our demonstrator training protocol. But bees in our study\nwere still able to learn the complete behaviour without any reward for the\nfirst step or experience with any type of puzzle box, purely through exposure\nto a knowledgeable conspecific. Whether this challenge constrains multi-step\nsocial learning in other species could be worthy of further investigation.\n\nThe results of the control population experiments, in which bees were exposed\nto puzzle boxes for 36 h across 12 days or 72 h across 24 days, were equally\ntelling. No bee came close to opening even a single box, and their interest in\nthe closed boxes plummeted with time, although they continued to forage on\nopened boxes during pre-training. For comparison, in our previous work using\nthe two-option puzzle box that required only a single-step action, the two\n12-day control colonies generated 13 learners between them in the absence of\nany demonstrator^23. This notable capacity for innovation is consistent across\nparadigms: in previous work on string-pulling, some bumblebees learned to pull\nstrings without a demonstrator^19. The failure of bees to open the two-step\nbox independently, then, is unlikely to be due to a lack of behavioural\nflexibility. However, both of these previous examples involved single-step,\ndirectly rewarded tasks. If bumblebee learning relies mainly on reward- or\npunishment-based associations, it might simply not be possible for them to\nindividually learn unrewarded actions, unless these are somehow linked to a\nrewarded action. This might be why bees succeeded in learning two-step box-\nopening only when exposed to a demonstrator performing the squeezing\nbehavioural variant: this action pattern essentially combined the two steps\ninto one, reducing the degree of temporal and spatial separation between the\nfirst step of the behaviour and the reward when compared with staggered-\npushing. This may have permitted bees to form an association between the two.\nBut the presence of the demonstrator itself was also key: observers closely\nfollowing behind the demonstrator as it performed the key squeezing action\nessentially saw them squeezing too, accurately replicating the demonstrator\u2019s\nbehaviour without the need for imitative copying. Although there was no\nsignificant difference, the duration of following behaviour was also markedly\nincreased among learners compared with non-learners, suggesting that this\nfacilitated the transmission of two-step box-opening to an extent. Taking\nthese lines of evidence together, bees seem highly unlikely to be capable of\nsolving the two-step puzzle box through individual learning, even though they\nwere capable of learning to do so socially. This is in itself impressive, but\nit becomes more so when one considers that it represents, to our knowledge,\nthe first evidence of this capacity in any non-human animal. The ability to\nlearn a behaviour socially that is too complex to be arrived at individually\nis still thought to represent a fundamental distinction between humans and\nanimals, and to characterize human cumulative culture.\n\nCumulative culture refers to behavioural traditions that are repeatedly\nimproved or elaborated on through sequential innovations that are socially\ntransmitted throughout a population^1,2,3. Although certain animals have been\nproven to be capable of sustaining such culture^16,17, unlike in human\ncumulative culture, the final behaviour was not so complex that an individual\ncould not have innovated it alone^1. Humans are still considered the only\nspecies that is capable of socially learning behaviours that are so complex\nthat independent re-innovation is impossible within an individual\u2019s own\nlifetime^18,27. This stipulation has resulted in a dearth of laboratory-based\nexperimental assessments of cumulative culture in animals. It is difficult to\nconceive of an experimental design that might convincingly demonstrate this\ncapacity in long-lived species, such as primates, cetaceans or corvids^28, but\nthese are the species that we tend to assume are most likely to be capable of\nthis feat. Food-washing behaviours by macaques^9, pandanus-leaf tool designs\nby New Caledonian crows^12 and the songs of humpback whales^29 have all been\nproposed as potential examples of cumulative culture, but none have been\nconfirmed through laboratory-based experiments. In the case of cetaceans,\nthere are additional physical constraints: it is hard to see how one would\neven begin to approach such an experiment in a wild humpback whale. This does\nnot mean that these animals are incapable of cumulative culture, or even that\nthese examples do not represent it: it simply means that we cannot know for\nsure whether they do. Even with our present study, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that one bee in a million might manage to solve the two-step box\nwithin its lifetime, although this seems unlikely. Adult bumblebees do not\ndedicate their entire lifespan to foraging: younger adults typically remain in\nthe nest, performing tasks such as nursing or building, with older adults\nbecoming foragers and tending to remain so until their death^30,31. Foraging\nlifespan does vary between individuals, with one previous study finding an\naverage of 8.33 days (range, 1\u201322 days, n = 49 bees)^31. This would fall well\nwithin the duration of our control experiments.\n\nIn this study, we did not aim to examine the maintenance of two-step box-\nopening as a behavioural tradition by a group of bumblebees over time, as we\ndid in our previous work with the two-option box^23. However, the evidence\ngathered by the present study and our previous work suggests that this would\nat least be cognitively plausible. This is especially notable because Bombus\nterrestris has not been confirmed to exhibit any form of culture in the wild,\ncumulative or otherwise, although nectar-robbing and its laterality could\nrepresent strong candidates for non-cumulative culture^32,33. In fact, on the\nsurface, this species seems unlikely to show cumulative culture at all in the\nwild. Bumblebee colonies in temperate regions do not typically persist beyond\na single biological generation^30. They are survived by naive queens that\nmight have little opportunity to learn from experienced individuals, which\nwould effectively reset any annual accumulation of complexity or efficiency.\nStill, in our study, bumblebees were able to learn a behaviour from a\ndemonstrator that was complex enough that they failed to re-innovate it\nindependently. Perhaps, then, the apparent lack of cumulative culture among\nwild bumblebees is as simple as a lack of opportunity and need^34. Wild bees\nare perhaps unlikely to stumble across natural analogues of multi-step puzzle\nboxes that they must open to feed. But why they are capable of such a feat, if\nit is not something necessary in their natural lives, remains an unanswered\nquestion.\n\nSocial insects have some of the richest, most intricate behavioural\nrepertoires in the entire animal kingdom. Their nest architectures are orders\nof magnitude larger than any individual, and are built in common. Leafcutter\nants farm fungus on the leaves that they collect^35, and honeybees communicate\nthe distance and direction of resources through their dance language^36. This\nbehaviour was all once thought to be purely instinctive. However, we are\nincreasingly beginning to appreciate the role of social learning in such\nbehaviour: at least some components of the honeybee dance language appear to\nbe shaped by social influences^37. Some social insect species form colonies\nthat last for years or even decades: these include honeybees^38, tropical\nbumblebees^39,40,41 and stingless bees^42,43. If the learning abilities of\nthese species resemble those of Bombus terrestris, these might be the best\ncandidates in which to observe the natural occurrence of culture\u2014even\ncumulative culture\u2014and they represent exciting models through which further\nquestions can be pursued.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Animal model\n\nBumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) were obtained from Agralan. Whole\ncolonies were transferred to 30.0 \u00d7 14.0 \u00d7 16.0-cm bipartite wooden nest boxes\nafter delivery, and were housed in these for the duration of the experiment.\nColonies were maintained at room temperature, and experiments were performed\nunder standardized artificial lights (12:12, high-frequency fluorescent\nlighting; TMS 24F lamps with HF-B 236 TLD (4.3 kHz) ballasts (Koninklijke\nPhillips), fitted with Activa daylight fluorescent tubes (OSRAM Licht)). Bees\nforaged ad libitum on 20% w/w sucrose solution, which was provided by means of\nmass feeders overnight in the flight arena, with pollen provided directly to\nthe nest box every two days. All individuals used for our experiments were\nfemale workers, and while the specific age of each individual was not\ndetermined they were of an age typical of foragers for this species. None of\nthe colonies had been used for any previous experiments. All experiments were\nconducted in accordance with the ASAB/ABS guidelines for the use of animals in\nresearch. There were no licence or permit requirements for the experiments\npresented in this paper.\n\n### Experimental set-up and puzzle-box design\n\n#### Puzzle box\n\nThe two-step puzzle box was a modified version of the two-option puzzle box\nused in our previous study^23. This incorporated a transparent lid that\nrotated anti-clockwise around a central axis when a red tab was pushed,\nexposing a 50% w/w sucrose-solution reward on a yellow target; however, an\nadditional blue tab initially blocked the path of the red tab (Fig. 1a). Two\nstoppers prevented either tab from being moved in the incorrect direction, and\na plastic shield around the box prevented bees reaching with their proboscis\nfrom the side of the box to obtain the reward without manipulating the tabs.\n\n#### Flight arena\n\nAll experiments were performed in a flight arena (66.0 \u00d7 60.0 \u00d7 30.0 cm),\nwhich was connected to the hive boxes with transparent acrylic tunnels (26.0 \u00d7\n3.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm). Plastic strips used as sliding doors along this tunnel\ncontrolled access to the flight arena. Flaps cut into the arena sides allowed\nthe removal and replacement of puzzle boxes with minimal disturbance to the\nbees, and brush strips lining the sides of the flight arena prevented bees\nfrom escaping during this process. The interior walls were lined with\nlaminated paper showing a random distribution of pink dots. The top of the\nflight arena was a sheet of transparent UV-transmitting perspex acrylic, and\ncameras (iPhone 6S; Apple) were placed on top of the arena to record all\nexperiments from above.\n\n#### Individual tagging\n\nBees were marked with numbered Opalith tags (Opalithpl\u00e4ttchen; Bienen-Voigt &\nWarnholz) for individual identification^23. In brief, small groups of bees\nwere allowed into the flight arena to forage on lidless puzzle boxes, with\nyellow targets (carrying 10 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose-solution rewards) fully exposed\nand accessible. Bees that foraged from multiple boxes (that is, were motivated\nforagers) were captured and tagged before being returned to the hive box. Bees\nwere never used for experiments on the same day that they were tagged to\nprevent any confounding stress-associated effects, and to allow\nacclimatization to the tag.\n\n### Demonstrator training protocol\n\n#### Manual training of two-step box-opening\n\nPotential demonstrators were identified during group foraging on lidless\nboxes, as described above. When a tagged bee was observed repeatedly and\nreliably coming back and forth between the nest box and the flight arena to\nforage, it was selected for further training, and all other bees were\nrestricted to the nest box. Full details of the stepwise protocol can be found\nin Supplementary Fig. 3. Notably, to train bees to push the unrewarded blue\ntab as the first step of the behaviour, it was necessary to introduce a\ntemporary additional reward beneath this tab, which was then removed during\nlater training stages. Successful acquisition of two-step box-opening was\nconfirmed with an unrewarded learning test.\n\n#### Demonstrator unrewarded learning test\n\nOnce a bee reliably opened two-step puzzle boxes in exchange for no reward\nbeneath the blue tab and for 20 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose solution beneath the red\ntab, it proceeded to the unrewarded learning test. The full unrewarded\nlearning test protocol can be found in the Supplementary Information.\n\nA total of 13 bees from four colonies (colony IDs A\u2013D) passed the demonstrator\nlearning test. Three of these (A-8, A-6 and A-27) were used to pilot these\nexperiments, and one (B-25) died before it could be used as a demonstrator.\nThus, nine bees in total were used as demonstrators for the dyad experiments\n(Table 1). The average training period for a wholly naive bee was two days\nand, in an attempt to reduce this time, three trained demonstrators (A-17,\nA-24 and C-26) were originally used as observers in the dyad experiments\nbefore being put through the stepwise training protocol and passing the\nunrewarded learning test.\n\n### Dyad experiments\n\n#### Observer selection\n\nIn total, 15 observers from three colonies took part in these experiments.\nEach observer was paired with a trained demonstrator, with some demonstrators\nbeing used for multiple observers in succession (Table 1). Observers were\nselected in the same manner as demonstrators, during group foraging on lidless\nboxes, with only the most motivated and reliable foragers chosen. Thus,\nalthough observers were familiar with the yellow target indicating the\npresence of a reward, they had no experience with closed boxes, or with the\nmovement of the tabs. They also never had any experience of being rewarded for\npushing the blue tab, as demonstrators did during early training phases.\n\n#### Joint foraging phase\n\nBefore each joint foraging session, the demonstrator and the observer were\nheld in the tunnel for 3 min, starting from when both were present. After\nthis, they were released into the flight arena and presented with three closed\npuzzle boxes, each filled with 20 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose solution. As these were\nopened, they were removed from the arena, cleaned with 70% ethanol to remove\nolfactory cues, refilled and replaced. Once the demonstrator returned to the\ntunnel (or after 20 min elapsed, at which point the demonstrator was manually\nreturned to the nest box) the experimenter removed one box, opened it and\nplaced it back in the arena so that the observer could access the reward. This\nwas again intended to preserve foraging motivation. Occasionally,\ndemonstrators lost motivation to forage during this phase: to counter this, if\nthey ever failed to open more than two boxes in a single session, they were\ngiven individual foraging sessions until they opened boxes consistently again.\n\n#### Observer unrewarded learning test\n\nAfter 30 joint foraging sessions, the observer proceeded to an unrewarded\nlearning test in the absence of the demonstrator. This was identical to the\ntest used for demonstrators, but if the box was opened in the 15-min time\nlimit, the observer was given a yellow acrylic chip loaded with 10 \u03bcl 50% w/w\nsucrose solution followed by a closed box with 50 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose solution\non the target. The observer was then allowed to forage ad libitum on closed\npuzzle boxes (containing the usual 20 \u03bcl 50% w/w sucrose solution), until it\neither returned to the nest box or stopped opening boxes for 3 min. Observers\nthat passed proceeded to the solo foraging phase, whereas those that failed\nreturned to joint foraging sessions with the demonstrator. Additional learning\ntests were given after every five \u2018remedial\u2019 joint foraging sessions, but if\nthe observer failed three times it was considered to have failed to acquire\ntwo-step box-opening. At this point, joint foraging was ceased.\n\n#### Solo foraging phase\n\nObservers that passed the learning test proceeded to the solo phase. Here,\nthey were challenged with ten foraging sessions in the absence of the\ndemonstrator. Each session was preceded by a 3-min waiting period in the\ntunnel and then lasted up to 10 min, after which the bee was manually returned\nto the nest box if it had not already returned of its own accord. Three puzzle\nboxes, each containing 50 \u03bcl of 50% w/w sucrose solution, were placed in the\narena, and if none were opened during a session, the bee was given a yellow\nacrylic chip with 10 \u03bcl of 50% w/w sucrose solution before being returned to\nthe nest box. This was done in an effort to maintain their foraging motivation\nfor further sessions.\n\n### Control population experiments\n\nA total of three colonies (IDs C1, C2 and C3) were used for these experiments,\nwhich followed a similar protocol to that used with the control population\ndescribed in our previous work^23. These experiments aimed to determine\nwhether bees could spontaneously learn to open the two-step box during an\nextended period of exposure. Several bees managed to open a single-step puzzle\nbox without a demonstrator in our previous experiments^23.\n\nIn brief, each day at around 9.30 a.m., the mass feeders were removed from the\nflight arena and the bees were returned to the nest box. If more than two\nhoneypots were full, the sucrose solution was removed using a handheld\npipette, with care being taken to avoid damaging any part of the hive\nstructure. This ensured a strong motivation to forage. After around 30 min,\nbees were allowed unrestricted access to the flight arena, in which they\nreceived 30 min of group pre-training with eight lidless boxes, with the\nyellow targets (bearing 10 \u03bcl w/w 50% sucrose rewards) fully exposed. This\ndaily pre-training ensured that the bees maintained a strong association\nbetween the colour yellow and the reward, and encouraged as many bees into the\nflight arena as possible before the experiment began. After the pre-training,\nthe boxes were removed, wiped with 70% ethanol, refilled with 20 \u03bcl w/w 50%\nsucrose, closed and replaced to begin the population experiment. Each\nexperimental session lasted for 3 h. Colonies C1 and C2 underwent the\nexperiment for 12 consecutive days (36 h total exposure to the closed boxes),\nand colony C3 underwent the experiment for 24 consecutive days (72 h total\nexposure to the closed boxes).\n\n### Video analysis\n\nAll videos were analysed using BORIS v.7.10.2, which permitted the coding of\npoint events, the extraction of event durations and the assigning of each\nevent to a bee ID, box ID, tab colour and opening method as appropriate^44.\n\n#### Dyad experiments\n\nFor both the joint sessions and the post-learning solo foraging sessions,\npoint events were coded when boxes were opened (\u2018demonstrator opening\nincidence\u2019 in the joint sessions; \u2018learner opening incidence\u2019 in the solo\nsessions). The start and end of observer \u2018following behaviour\u2019 were also coded\nas point events in the joint sessions. Following behaviour was defined as the\nobserver being present on the surface of the puzzle box, within a bee\u2019s length\nof the demonstrator, while it performed box-opening (so following behaviour\ncould occur only after the demonstrator began pushing the blue tab and before\nit accessed the reward). The total duration of following behaviour in each\njoint session was thus extracted.\n\nAs the dyads underwent different numbers of joint sessions, depending on\nwhether the observer acquired two-step box-opening or not, demonstrator\nopening incidence and observer following duration were indexed to permit\nstatistical comparisons. The demonstrator opening index for each dyad was\ncalculated as the total incidence of box-opening/the number of joint sessions,\nand the following index was calculated as the total duration of following/the\nnumber of joint sessions.\n\n#### Box-opening method\n\nAs mentioned above, two different methods to open the two-step puzzle box were\nidentified during these experiments: squeezing and staggered-pushing (Fig.\n1c). Thus, all incidences of box-opening in both the dyad and the control\npopulation experiments were labelled with the box-opening technique that was\nused. Because in some cases, bees would leave the box surface during the\nopening or move between the blue and red tabs several times, even while\nperforming the key squeezing movement between the tabs (sometimes repeatedly),\nany openings in which this squeezing action was incorporated were labelled\n\u2018squeezing\u2019.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nData were analysed using R (v.4.0.4)^45. Comparisons between two groups were\nmade with unpaired one-sided t-tests or Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, depending on the\nnormality of the data (assessed using Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests), and homogeneity of\nvariances (assessed using F tests). Comparisons between more than two groups\nwere made with one-way ANOVA or Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests, as appropriate.\nCorrelation analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019s rank order correlation\ncoefficient tests. Sample size selection was based on those used in other\ncomparable studies, and as observers were assigned into groups based on\nwhether they passed or failed an unrewarded learning test and the predominant\nbehavioural variant used by their demonstrator, randomization was not\napplicable. This was an observational study of animal behaviour and so did not\nrequire blinding. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically\nsignificant difference.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nData underlying the figures presented in the manuscript are available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25012286.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
