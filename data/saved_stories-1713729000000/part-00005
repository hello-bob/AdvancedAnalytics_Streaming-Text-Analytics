Today, we\u2019re\nfeaturing a live version of \u201cThe Cave\u201d from Mumford & Sons. One of the\nhighlights from [lastfm]Mumford & Sons[/lastfm]\u2019 breakout debut album Sigh No\nMore, \u201cThe Cave\u201d shows the London boys at their best. And today\u2019s Free MP3 is\nan exclusive live version of the song, recorded by our friends in L.A. at a\nspecial daytime session during Coachella! \u201cThe Cave\u201d is a rousing, beer-soaked\nfolk song that tells the tale of of a lover who was wronged by their careless\npartner, but is still determined to fix things. \u201cBut I will hold on hope/ And\nI won\u2019t let you choke/ On the noose around your neck,\u201d lead singer Marcus\nMumford belts out. It\u2019s a tale of heartache, but the emotion is defiant.\nMumford & Sons have been one of the real breakout successes of this year,\ngoing from playing pub gigs to the Coachella main stage in a matter of months\n(and the aforementioned private gig at the KROQ Coachella House, where this\nversion was recorded). And it is with good reason. Their music fits in the\ntradition of great English folk-inspired rock bands like The Waterboys, The\nPogues, and Men They Couldn\u2019t Hang\u2013rough around the edges, but plenty sweet on\nthe inside.

Now Trombino is literally making donuts... with a nod to his\npunk past. A couple weeks back, Trombino made a serious career change and\nopened Donut Friend in Los Angeles\u2019 historic Highland Park neighborhood.\nBlueberry compote, bacon, cayenne pepper, manchego chese and orange marmalade\nare just a few of the ingredients available in his design-your-own donut line-\nup, but music fans may be more interested in the band-themed pastries. The\ncurrent concoctions include (A)pple Pi(E), a donut stuffed with caramelized\napples and cheddar cheese, topped with a caramel glaze and toasted peanuts; it\nwas inspired by peace-punk band (A).PPL(E). There\u2019s Bacon-182, a self-\nexplanatory ode to one of the biggest bands Trombino\u2019s produced; Chocolate\nfrom the Crypt, named for Rocket from the Crypt (with whom Trombino\u2019s early\nband Drive Like Jehu shared a guitarist); and the chocolate mousse-stuffed\nFudgegazi, a delectable tribute to Fugazi. \u201cI actually just came up with a\nlist of names [a few years ago],\u201d Trombino explained from his office at the\nback of the store. \u201dI had donut combinations already that I wanted to use and\nthen I came up with all these lists of names, and I just started matching them\n[to band names].\u201d There\u2019s a personal story for almost every concoction. \u201cRites\nof Sprinkles is Rites of Spring,\u201d he explained. \u201cHands down one of the bands\nthat changed my life so I was very happy that they were on this list.\u201d \u201cAround\nthe time that I was doing the Jimmy Eat World records, Christie Front Drive\nwas a band that Jimmy Eat World looked up to,\u201d Trombino explained. \u201cSo, you\nget Custard Front Drive.\u201d But worry not, Jimmy Eat World fans. As the act\nTrombino is perhaps most associated with as a producer, Jimmy Eat World has\nits own donut in the works, the perfectly titled Jimmy Eat Swirl. The band has\neven submitted recipe ideas for it. Perhaps the most controversial donut on\nthe menu, GG Almond is named after one of music\u2019s most polarizing performers,\nGG Allin, who was known for mutilating himself on stage. \u201cThe people that know\nGG Allin are kind of turned off by this donut... because he was disgusting,\u201d\nTrombino joked. \u201cPeople have said, \u2018I can\u2019t eat a donut named after GG\nAllin.\u2019\u201d When asked if any of the bands are aware of the their tributes in\ndough form, Tromboni recalls a visit from Wall of Voodoo\u2019s Bruce Moreland, who\ncame in and introduced himself. \u201cThat was kind of cool,\u201d Trombino said with a\nsmile. Moreland took his Walnut of Voodoo to go. Do all Donut Friend patrons\nget the references? No. But that\u2019s half the fun. \u201cHearing people order these\ndonuts, who clearly have no idea who these bands are, makes me chuckle,\u201d\nTromboni said. \u201cRequesting a Rites of Sprinkles, it\u2019s just so funny to me.\u201d\nTrombino says he initially \u201cthrew away\u201d money on consultants who didn\u2019t have\nany better ideas then he did. Having sold his home to pay for the new\nbusiness, the self-proclaimed perfectionist is committed to making Donut\nFriend a success. As for why he made the switch from distortion effects to\nglazes and fillings, it has much to do with the state of the music biz for the\nkinds of acts he was known to produce. \u201cI never built myself a recording\nstudio, which eventually became an issue. Recording budgets shrunk. If you\ndidn\u2019t have your own place to work, unless you were making big records, it\nbecame difficult to make money,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve always been in the mid-\nrange sort of tier so I never got really big records. The mid-range budgets\ngot to the point where I couldn\u2019t afford to go to a studio... to pay someone\nelse and pay myself was tough. I squeaked by for a while but eventually it was\nlike I gotta build a recording studio or something. And, I opted for\nsomething. I had this idea like five years ago. I\u2019d been chewing on it\nforever. And I just felt like it was time to do something. Stop talking about\nit and do it.\u201d \u2013 Jay Tilles, Radio.com|\n<urn:uuid:2f990760-d149-4919-90d2-84559fc12d8f>| CC-MAIN-2016-26|\nhttp://1041jackfm.cbslocal.com/2013/10/01/from-blink-182-to-bacon-182-inside-\nproducer-mark-trombinos-punk-rock-donut-shop/| 2016-06-24T20:23:08Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.978301|\n1,074  \nFootage from the dash-cam of a Louisiana police car in 2003, someone ends up\ngetting shot.

As a matter of fact, among the list of the top 1,000 people, places\nand things with large follower bases, it is mostly smaller, niche companies\nthat have some popularity. In the world of Twitter, either because of\nsuspicion, boredom or demographics, the corporate world might as well pack up\nand go home. Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) has a modest following of 4.3\nmillion, which places it 244th with Twitter followers. Leader Justin Bieber\nhas 45 million. Whole Foods Market Inc. (NYSE: WFM) has 3.6 million, which\nputs it in the 326th spot. BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ: BBRY) has 3.2 million,\nwhich places it at 376. Maybe people on Twitter like to watch companies, like\nBlackBerry, that go through train wrecks. Starbucks and Whole Foods are among\nthe American companies that can claim to be good citizens. Each buys\ningredients for its top-selling products through networks that are built\naround carefully crafted relationships with farmers. In that sense, their\nhabits do not match those of big companies at all. Each has avoided using\nslave labor in China and the yield of crops that use genetically altered seed.\nThe lack of big companies on Twitter likely goes to the trustworthiness of\ntheir messages. As hard as these firms try to make their messages fun or\ntether their products to customer care, the only reason that Xerox Corp.\n(NYSE: XRX) and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) have a presence on Twitter is\nbecause they pay for it. The fact that companies pay for their presence likely\nmakes the universe of Twitter users even more suspicious. The absence of large\ncompanies on Twitter is actually very good for the social network. These\ncorporations have to resort to paid tweets to have any hope of reaching large\naudiences. Twitter has found a friend in the world\u2019s largest marketers,\nlargely because they are ignored.

They've\ndismantled his work station, but not his computer. So that sums up their\nattitude: doing the minimum to still look like a capitalist corporation that\nhas to do due diligence when one of their own is found to be charged with\nhacking their fellow news media, but expressing their tacit support by waiting\nto see if the charges stick. The search warrant is now online, and makes for\ninteresting reading, where you can discover the following: o Yahoo turned over\nemail materials to the investigation o There isn't just some minor hack of a\nnews article on the LA Times, as the tech symps keep claiming, restored in 30\nminutes, but the issue of the theft of the Fox affiliate's email address list,\nwhich seems to include government email lists o Damage to Tribune Media's\nserver is set at $17,650.40 for 333 man hours and doesn't include costs\nrelated to the stolen email list affecting Fox 40 News in Sacramento nor ad\nrevenue losses taken as a result of the attack o There are at least two\ndifferent IP addresses attached to the AESCracked account said to be run by\nMatthew Keys o Other non-news stuff like \"Adrian Lamo is gay\" Best quote? In\nthe title of this blog -- about taking part in a hacking operation and\nthinking it will have no consequences. AESCracked says \"Boomerangs don't\nalways return to the thrower\" after giving the hackers the passwords. And one\nof the hackers says: \"This one will.\" Indeed. So today Keys -- who is back\nperkily tweeting today and accepting well-wishers' concern and seeming to\nstave off one offer of Anonymous \"court support\" (does that mean stalking the\nprosecutors to their homes like Anon is doing to Carmen Ortiz from Swartz's\ncase?!) -- announced that he had a pair of crack lawyers already notable\n(notorious) for defending Anonymous. As @revmagdalen, a Twitter user who is\noften critical of Anonymous and WikiLeaks pointed out, if you are trying to\nshow that you were *not* with Anonymous on a hacking operation, it hardly\nseems prudent to have accepted the pro-bono assistance of Anonymous-associated\nlawyers, but Keys said forthrightly that he didn't care about their past\ncases. The Reverand is concerned about the defendant's rights in the hands of\nthese lawyers and thinks it's not good if these work for The Cause through\ntheir client. The attorneys do have a \"progressive\" agenda and seem to be\ntrying to \"write new law\" as aggressive and vain lawyers are wont to do, and\nat least one of whom, Jay Liederman, loves the idea of the \"DDoS as a sit-in\"\nlike the Woolworth's counter. Nonsense. The blacks in the 1960s demonstrating\nfor their civil rights were asking for equality before the law, not taking\nother people's rights away. They politely entered stores, paid for a few\npurchases, then sat normally at the lunch counter like other folks. They were\nnot disruptive. They didn't close down the entire store or make it unusable\nfor other people. But that's what Anonymous does -- takes away other people's\nrights to freedom of association and expression, and closes down their\nbusiness or nonprofit for varying periods, causing damage for clean-up and\nrestoration. It's completely ridiculous to compare these very different types\nof protest, one non-coercive and the other coercive. I don't know quite why\nReverend is running a Bide-A-Wee Home for Wayward Anons (see Franny and Zooey)\non her Twitter stream and worrying about their legal defense, to the effect\nthat crusading lawyers shouldn't turn their clients into poster boys for their\ncauses and should try to get them off. But... There will be plenty of others\nto worry about them getting off, and I'm more interested in seeing that\njustice is served -- and I believe that the feds would not bring this case\nafter a year unless they felt they could make it airtight in court. The\noperative point today from the lawyers speaking on the Kremlin tool Alyona\nMinkovsky's live Huffpo show is that -- surprise, surprise -- their client is\nnot guilty (she used to run her propaganda spigot more directly at the\nKremlin-funded RT, but now she is one thin layer removed at Huffpo, which\nmakes it more \"respectable,\" I guess). And Jay Liederman, the attorney\nassociated with the pro-DDoS position, says that Matthew Keys did not hack the\nsite. When pressed rather gingerly by a Huffpo anchor who in fact was very\nsupportive of the hacker throughout the show, as to whether or not his client\nwas AESCracked, the pseudomyn of the person who gave the passwords to the\nTribune news sites, he gets vague and starts saying that some of the time\nAESCracked was his client, but some of the time he was not. Now, just a minute\nhere. How is that going to be established? The problem with this IRC channel\nstuff is that the people operating the channel might scrub this information,\nbut maybe some of it is retrievable from the ISP. It's true that when you log\non to channels, you can just make up a name. So different people could use\ndifferent names. But the channel operator or moderator will have your IP\naddress. And that's just what kayla -- that notorious kayla of LulzSec infamy\n-- asks for in this chat. Now, here's what needs explanation -- and either it\nhas one, that isn't going to be favourable to Keys, or it will prove his\nlawyers' point that he wasn't in control of this account or this name the\nentire time. First, the search warrant from the agent says this: p. 11\n\"email@example.com was registered by someone purporting to be MATT KEYS from a\nzip code of 95824 for Sacramento, California; these values are set by the user\nupon account creation and are not subject to verification. The account was\nactivated on December 2, 20010 and accessed only once by the user. The IP\naddressed used to access this account was 220.127.116.11 and resolved to a\nlocation in Sacramento, California. An attempt to identify the user of this\nIPO address was unsuccessful. Now, that's the alibi that could be used\nthroughout -- oh, IP addresses are dynamic. Oh, you can't figure out who\nreally owns them, blah blah blah. But as we know perfectly well, this is just\ngeekitude, and in fact IP addresses can stay static; they can also be dynamic\nbut still on a range that still shows location; and it can be triangulated\nwith other information to pinpoint identity. As I've pointed out many times,\nthe very reason that every website in the Metaverse uses your IP address to\nenable your log on or your history or your access to certain things is because\nthis is indeed an identifier, and good enough of one for the purposes of the\nfunctioning of the Internet -- and identification of you on a persistent\nbasis. People who keep warbling on about how this isn't the case are just\ntrying to Fisk and distract from the smoking guns. Even so, there's this: When\nthe Anonymous hacknarchists (I don't like the cutesy name \"hacktivist\" and\nwon't use it on them as it implies they do good social activism which they\nmainly do not) suspect that AESCracked is an informant, they expel him from\nthe chat room. Then kayla asks for his IP address: Client connecting at\nbelldandy.anonops.ru:A2SCracked\n(A2SCracked@75-53-171-204.lightspeed.nscrca.sbcglobal.net) Then kayla says:\n\"that's a real IPS\" -- and indeed it is, because it shows a Sacramento\nlocation, it's not an anonymizer. Then later, another LulzSec operative asks\nfor and gets the IP addresses of AESCracked and gets these: 18.104.22.168\n22.214.171.124 These could be anonymizers and they show the UK as a location\n-- that's my understanding of it but someone who is a \"computer scientist\" can\nexamine all this and tell me what they think. So the alibi is either/and a)\nyou can't tell what my client's IP address is because it doesn't show that\nmuch information to locate him b) IP addresses aren't identifiers because they\nare dynamic c) look at these different ones ascribed to him in this one chat\nlog. Mkay, but yah, whatever. No sale from where I sit. It's really a stretch\nto think that first AESCracked comes on and offers passwords and eggs the\nhackers on, then somebody else hijacks/hacks/takes/uses his account from\nsomewhere else, to do other stuff, more serious, like take Fox affiliate\nemails? I find that hard to believe. This is just my first rough take from\nreading this quickly and I will try to find more time to study it later.\nMeanwhile, some other interesting Anoniana: one of them says at one point\n\"never the media\" at the offer of hacking the Fox affiliate. As if Anonymous\nas some thieves' law that they don't hack media, so that they are not accused\nof harming the First Amendment freedom they seek. Nonsense, of course, because\nthey've hacked Gawker, PBS and other media sites and they do all count as\nmedia. Then AESCracked argues essentially, \"but Fox isn't media\". And the Anon\nreasons thusly, even with bad spelling: \"you're correct but people percieve\nthem to be media, and that would be very bad for us\" Yeah. Truly. But you are\nbad. So meh. And they go and hack the Fox stuff anyway. So much for thieves'\nlaw. As we know, Parmy Olson, who wrote the door-stop book on Anonymous, says\nthat she asked Keys if he did the hack and he denied it. But she didn't put\nall of this in her book, and I challenge her about this at the Forbes site,\nbecause I think she is just protecting her journalsts' tribe there (and it's\npart of minimizing the crimes of Anonymous and their infection of society,\ntoo). In fact, she seems to be part of what has outed his involvement, as her\nbook is mentioned in the search warrant. But Keys himself bragged of his\ninvolvement. Motivation? Well, it looks to me like it's this -- wanting to\nbelong: It disappoints me because there was a good chunk of time when I didn't\nfit in anywhere, and finally I fit in somewhere, even if it was among a group\nof renegade criminals. You guys were funny and smart and very patient even\nthough I'm internet dumb. And then this happens and it sucks balls He's\ndisappointed that they are accusing him of leaking to the feds. Not clear\nexactly how that worked, with Sabu deliberately, or because Sabu was working\nfor the feds and leaked him. But the lawyers claimed today that Keys was \"on\nassignment,\" that he did this hack merely as part of a caper whereby he wanted\nto gain the confidence of Anonymous hackers that he was studying in the IRC\nchannel, in order to \"do a story\". Well, I instantly thought of the Food Lion\ndefense and how that notion didn't work. That is, Food Lion was specifically\nabout using the deception of an employment application at a supermarket, to\nenable journalists to work undercover in the store to cover bad conditions.\nBut it's in the larger sense philosophically (even if not technically or\nlegally) about how you can't commit a felony, then get exonerated from it by\nsaying you were \"doing a story\" as a journalist, and you \"needed\" to do it\nthis way for cover. This case is taught everywhere as an ethics issue in\njournalism schools, and I've never seen anybody claim in the press freedom\ncommunity claim that this court decision should have been different. You don't\nget to feign employment and defraud an employer, or commit a felony like\nhacking and stealing and defacing, in order to \"get the story\". I couldn't\nhelp thinking how this comes back to my muting and defriending by Anthony de\nRosa, the director of social media for Reuters, whom I confronted on Facebook\nfor his tendentious coverage of OWS on the Brooklyn Bridge, and asked him to\nstop trying to make the news, and just cover it. Because indeed, these that's\nwhat happens when he joins the Jacobins and the Marxist-Leninists in trying to\njustify bridge occupation. Reuters should ditch these social media mavens who\nare just crypto-revolutionaries in their midst trying to overthrow the\ninstitution. Yes, I mean that. It's not journalism. I will be watching very\ncarefully to see if the Committee to Protect Journalists caves under the\nferocious pressure they have been under now for years by the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, who has one of their operatives now on the staff, and\ntakes up Keys as a \"journalist's case\". It doesn't at all appear to be one,\nwhatever the lawyers are bluffing with. Some other noise on the Internet --\nthe wacky Internet life of Matthew Keys, who led a \"double life,\" as a\njournalist by day and a nerd nuisance by night trolling people. Did you know\nthat Keys is a \"famous Internet troll\" and has an entry at Encyclopedia\nDramatica? And so on. There are plenty of comments around, i.e. on Gawker to\nlet us know that Keys is a douche -- stalking people, playing the victim,\nbeing an ass, whatever. It's immaterial to his case, however. Sabu or any\nnumber of \"Internet enforcers\" may have felt that this guy needed to go down\n-- and maybe they set him up and burned him, especially because he wrote\nnegatively about them. But really what this case comes down to is whether\nthese lawyers can make the case that their client's attachment to AESCracked\nand these IP addresses sticks or not. We don't know everything the feds may\nhave come up with to show that these things all stick, but I have a feeling\nthat they do have the goods. \"you've been part of this operation,\" says tflow,\none of the Lulzsec hackers. Here's Mr. Alibi coming down the tracks:\n\"AESCracked: I've never been part of the operation. AESCracked: Just a lurker\n; )\" And yet he distinctly came in the chat room, gave the passwords, then\nsaid \"go get 'em\". So we'll see. Hey, I should apply to be the Reuters deputy\nsocial media journalist, I have an entry at Encylopedia Dramatica, too!|\n<urn:uuid:48757440-5e01-49e7-9bbc-309fc19b8390>| CC-MAIN-2016-26|\nhttp://3dblogger.typepad.com/wired_state/2013/03/boomerangs-dont-always-\nreturn-to-the-thrower-this-one-will.html| 2016-06-24T20:16:45Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.977841|\n3,093  \nNew 3 Doors Down Acoustic Dates!

Maybe you've felt the same way. In this post I'm going to\nopen your eyes to some things that you may not have considered before now.\nMarketing and today's shopper Technology has given us a smaller package for\nour phone book. They have shrunk it all the way down to about the size of a\ndeck of cards. And they call it -- a cell phone. In fact it's even easier to\nuse than the original phone book! Here's why ... When you use a phone book,\nthe only way you can find what you want, is to know what it is called, or what\nkind of business would carry it. There are no listings for problems. A simple\nexample would be that you locked your keys in your car. You would have to know\nthat you need a locksmith in order to get any help from the phone book. By\ncomparison, cell phones today have what they call a 'web browser' built into\nthe phone. To get your car unlocked, you could simply search for \"keys locked\nin car\" and it would show you possible solutions. Everything from suggestions\non how to get them out yourself, to calling a locksmith. Why is this\nsignificant to your business? How many people today, carry a phone book in\ntheir pocket? And finding a phone booth, conveniently close by, with a usable\nphone book is very rare these days. Yet, tons of people now carry a cell phone\nalmost everywhere they go. Today's cell phones are web enabled, which allows\nyou to access the internet directly from your handset. Even grandparents are\nlearning how to send text messages and search on the internet. That means that\nwhen someone looks for a solution to their problem 'online' and you aren't\nthere, then you don't exist for that customer. How can someone buy from you,\nwhen they don't know you even exist? How you can benefit from a website today\n- Buyers can find you from their cell phone - You can list all your products\nso buyers will know what you offer - You can list services you offer,\nincluding details - You can build a contact list that allows you to instantly\ncommunicate with them - You can be easily found by buyers in surrounding\ncommunities - You can promote your business by the solutions you offer - You\ncan find out what really works in promoting your business Is setting up a\nwebsite too expensive for a small business? You might be wondering if setting\nup your own website is expensive. The answer is no and yes.Let's say that you\nthink spinning graphics and alternating images on a black background with gold\ncolored text is the best way to present your business on a website. Then you\nmight be inclined to spend a lot of money on graphic design. The problem is,\nyour opinion doesn't count! A smarter idea, is to build your website so that\nit impresses the people who come to visit. That way they might stay long\nenough to find what they are looking for. When someone is on the hunt for a\nsolution to their problem, they may be impatient. They are likely to be more\nimpressed with a site that loads onto their computer (or cell phone) screen\nfast, is easy to read, easy to navigate, and helps them find what they want.\nIn other words, they may not wait around for slow loading graphics. When they\nfind what they are looking for or believe that you can help them, then they\nwill take action. The plan is to give them enough reasons to call, come down,\nget on your list or make a purchase while they are on your website. That's why\nit's best to design your website to please those who will find it. If they\ndon't stay on your site long enough to find a solution they can use, then they\nwill not be calling you. Make sense? Could you make your own website and save\nsome money? Yes you can. Here are the primary steps you will need to take; -\nRegister a domain name - Sign up with a hosting service - Get an HTML code\neditor - Decide on your website's purpose - Put it all together Giving your\nwebsite a name You will need to register a domain name for your website. A\nwebsite address is designated by a series of four numbers separated by\nperiods. Registering a domain name to your website allows it to be found with\na descriptive name. Your domain name may indicate what your website is about\nor reflect the name of your business. Plus it is easier to remember a name,\nthan a string of numbers and this makes it easier for your customers to tell a\nfriend.Getting your website on the internet Next, you will need to set up an\naccount with a hosting service. This will allow your website to be viewed by\nmany people at the same time. Hosting services have a faster (and more\nexpensive) connection to the internet than is needed for personal use. And\nthey run 24/7. Designing your Website You will need to acquire an HTML Editor.\nThis is a program to create and edit HTML code for your website. This code is\nwhat tells the internet browser programs what to do with the text and images\non your webpages. HTML editors can range from free to hundreds of dollars.\nResearch will pay big dividends Your next step is to do some keyword research.\nYou need to find out what terms your potential buyers are typing into the\nsearch engines when they are looking to find your products and services. Part\nof how you will get your site to show up on people's computer screens, is by\nincorporating these search terms into your website design. Decide what you\nwant people to do Having a good feel for what search terms will lead people to\nyour website, you will need to decide what the primary purpose of your site\nwill be. Is it going to help you build a list of subscribers? Is it going to\nconvince people to call you? Or, are you going to sell something to your\nwebsite visitors? The construction details Once you have decided on your\nobjective, your search terms and figured out how to use your editor, you'll\nneed to design your webpages for three distinct audiences. - the search\nengines \u2013 you need to show that your website content is relevant to the search\nterms - people looking for information \u2013 they don't yet know the solution to\ntheir problem(s) so you'll need to educate them to get them to the next step -\npeople who are looking to buy now \u2013 they just need to know why they should buy\nfrom you Some of your search terms will go on the page that people see. Some\nof the search terms will go in the code that is not displayed. Some of the\ncontent of your website may be in reports that visitors can download. Those\nreports should show them why they should work with you and give them easy ways\nto contact you for more information. Finally, testing and tracking With your\nwebsite published to the World Wide Web and visitors coming to it, you'll be\nable to test all aspects of your website. You'll want try to increase the\nnumber of visitors coming to your site. And more importantly, you will want to\ntry to increase the number of visitors who take action once they are there.\nWith some fine tuning, your website can be like a magnet that attracts people\nfrom all around the area. Once at your website, they'll receive reasons to\ncall you, email you or get onto your list. Your list could provide ongoing\ntips and information like a newsletter or maybe an early notification of\nspecial offers. You will need to give people good reasons to get on your list.\nThe bottom line is that your results will determine what works best, not\nguesswork. Through testing and tracking you can improve your conversion rate\n(visitors to prospects to customers) and the amount of visitors your website\nreceives per month.

One place buyers can find local businesses, is in the\nlocal phone book. It's good, but it has limitations. They can find you by name\nbut only if they already know the name of your business. Or they can find you\nby guessing which category you're listed under. Phone book ads are expensive,\nplus unchangeable. And, you may get listed on the same page with all your\nbiggest competitors. (Even some of the out of town ones!) What you could have\nWould you be able to attract more buyers, if you could give them more potent\nways to find you? Answer: YES! When they do find your listing, wouldn't you\nprefer to be the only business on the page? Of course you would! You can have\neven more... What if you could have a listing for every brand that you sell?\nAnd a listing for every type of product you sell? And while we're at it, let's\ninclude all the services you offer. You'd want that too, if it's all the same\nprice, wouldn't you? For the same price? Yes, it's all the same price! So, why\nnot go ahead and make your listing bigger and broader, so that it attracts\neven more potential buyers! Let's include a listing for all the problems that\nyour products and services solve. Sometimes people don't already know exactly\nwhat product they're looking for. Your expanded listing will allow them to\nfind you, by simply searching for solutions to their problem. It gets even\nbetter... There's more! Your listing can be set up so that anyone within a two\nhour's drive, can find you just as easily as local buyers can. A more\neffective marketing approach This type of business listing goes way beyond a\nphone book listing or ad. When people find your listing, you'll be able to\ngive them tons of reasons to call you. In fact, you'll be able to convince\nthem that contacting you is the best thing for them to do. It does take more\nwork to put together a comprehensive sales-generating listing, than to do a\nsimple business card style listing. But it will definitely be worth the\neffort! With your new business listing, doing all of these things doesn't cost\nyou any more than doing just some of them. So, since it's all the same price,\nwouldn't you want to do all you can to get your phone and your cash register\nringing? Are you a little interested yet? Want to discuss this in more detail?\nGive me a call, email me or just leave a comment here by clicking the\n\"comment\" link below. We can set up a time to meet. You tell me what you want\nto accomplish, and I'll show you how I can help you. Wishing you continued\nsuccess, Small Business Marketing Coach P.S. Your expanded business listing\nwill help buyers from a larger area find you more easily and conveniently.\nPlus the people that find your listing will be better prospects for what you\nsell, because they will have found you while looking for a solution to their\nproblem!

All eastbound traffic on University Parkway will be stopped\nat Boyd Street, and all westbound traffic on Mill Street will be stopped at\nAirport Road. All parade route barricades from University Parkway north to\nLafayette Street will go up in preparation for the Santa Claus parade. The\nSanta Claus parade will begin at 1:00 p.m. at the corner of University Parkway\nand Jefferson Street. The parade will move along Jefferson Street to Front\nStreet turning on Lafayette Street and continuing down Second Street to\nUniversity Parkway. At the conclusion of the parade and when foot traffic\nallows, Jefferson Street and Second Street south to University Parkway will\nreopen for vehicular traffic. The Pine Street/Keyser Avenue Bridge and\nUniversity Parkway between Boyd and Mill Street will reopen as well. At 4:30\np.m., the Church Street Bridge will close to all foot traffic and Cane River\nLake will close 250 feet south of the last Christmas display (near the Santa\nClaus House) and 250 feet north of the flag set piece for all boat traffic in\npreparation of the fireworks show. At 5:00 p.m., barricades will be placed on\nWilliams Avenue north of Henry Avenue to St. Maurice Lane and at the\nintersections of East Second Street with Stephens Avenue, St. Clair Avenue,\nWhitfield Drive, Sirod Street and Adelaide Street to mark the fireworks safety\nzone. Foot traffic will be prohibited in this area once the barricades are in\nplace. The fireworks show will begin at 6:00 p.m. over Cane River Lake. At the\nconclusion of the fireworks and once the all clear has been given by the Fire\nDepartment, the Church Street Bridge and all streets outside of the gated\nfestival area will reopen.

They say writer's write what they\nknow so the truth about their protagonists -- and the whoppers -- probably\nreveal as much as the personal stuff. Fiction lies in what we'd like to try\nbut social norms, family pressure and lack of a bail emergency fund keep us\nfrom living up or living down to expectations in the real world. On the page,\nbold can be true or false and our characters get to do everything we wish we\ncould get away with. On the other hand, the story has to be believable unlike\nmany of the too true to be believed personal stories we revealed during the\nlast pass at this. I've told the tank story (one of my party stories) a fair\namount but I think some people still think I'm making it up. What am I making\nup about Sara today? 1. Sara saw Connor naked before she knew his last name.\n2. Sara dated Russ before he came out. 3. Sara graduated from the University\nof Washington with a degree in art history. 4. Sara never had a pet as a kid.\n5. Sara has bought multiple solutions from informercials to hide her freckles.\n6. Sara's keeping a file of information to blackmail her boss \"just in case.\"\n7. Sara once told her sister-in-law that if she wanted to feel powerful, she\nshould not wear underwear. 8. Sara once confessed to be a compulsive liar --\nwhich was a lie. 9. Sara wore the same dress as her husband's ex-fiancee to a\nswanky black tie dinner. 10. The most romantic gift Connor ever gave Sara was\na portable tracking device. All the true things are either in the books\n(including the as yet unpublished Horsewhipped) or can be inferred from\nconversations within the text. The falsehoods could turn up in any subsequent\nbook. I really like some of those lies.

In December 1997,\nrepresentatives of some 160 nations agreed to a treaty in Kyoto, Japan\nrequiring industrial nations to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas\n(ghg) emissions. Under the treaty, the U.S. would be required to reduce its\nemissions by seven percent below the 1990 level by 2012, a real cut of more\nthan 30 percent once population and economic growth are factored in.1 Although\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the treaty, the prognosis for Senate\nratification has been poor, due largely to industry opposition. In response,\nthe President included provisions in his budget designed to sweeten the Kyoto\ndeal for corporations. For example, his budget included a $273 million program\nto make building more energy-efficient. This provision may explain why\nHoneywell, which was recently awarded a Department of Energy contract to work\non building efficiency, now supports the treaty. The treaty also included tax\ncredits for consumers purchasing hybrid automobiles. Predictably, Toyota,\nwhich just developed a hybrid vehicle operating on gas and electricity, also\nrecently endorsed the treaty.2 The Administration also supports a program\nknown as Early Action Crediting (EAC) to provide incentives for corporations\nnot only to support, but to advocate Kyoto treaty ratification. Under EAC\nproposals introduced by Senator John Chafee (R-RI) and Representative Rick\nLazio (R-NY), the President would be permitted to give companies reducing ghg\nemissions prior to 2008, when the Kyoto treaty is to take effect, emissions\ncredits that could either be used or sold when Kyoto goes into effect. These\nemissions credits would essentially serve as permits for a business to emit a\nspecified amount of ghg once the Kyoto treaty goes into effect. The more\npermits, the more a company could emit. By granting such credits, corporations\nwould be encouraged to lobby for Kyoto's ratification because the credits\nwould be worthless without ratification. Early credits are industry's\ninsurance against the possibility that Kyoto will be ratified. But in buying\nthe insurance, ratification would become more likely. It's analogous to buying\nauto insurance to increase your chance of being in a car crash.3 The fact that\nCongress would even consider legislation that could influence or preordain the\noutcome of a Senate deliberation should be of great concern to every American.\nIronically, Early Action Crediting would make the chances that the U.S. could\ncomply with the Kyoto treaty, once ratified, unlikely. This is because it\nwould make compliance with Kyoto's targets more difficult for small businesses\nand family farms. The reason? Under the Kyoto treaty, developing nations can\nearn extra emissions credits for reductions occurring prior to 2008, but\nindustrialized nations can't. In other words, every early credit the President\ngrants would mean one less in the U.S. pool after 2008.4 Since most small\nbusinesses lack the political contacts and expertise to negotiate deals with\nthe Clinton Administration and lack the resources to reduce their emissions\nearly, large businesses would garner most of the early credits.5 Thus, the\nburdens of Kyoto would rise for small firms while dropping for larger ones. By\nmaking compliance more difficult for small firms, early crediting would make\nit less likely the U.S. could meet the Kyoto targets without sacrificing small\nbusiness, which creates two-thirds of all new jobs. An additional weakness of\nthe Chafee/Lazio Early Action Crediting proposals is that they could stimulate\nthe transfer of money from the private sector to the environmental movement,\ngiving environmentalists greater resources to press for Kyoto-style\nregulations and compromising the integrity of our political process. Under\nEAC, third parties would be permitted to monitor corporate emissions\nreductions. According to the NonProfit Accountability Project (NPAP), the very\ngroups that have pressed for this arrangement are the ones that would profit\nfrom them. NPAP notes that the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) was the chief\narchitect of the EAC proposals and that its satellite group, Environmental\nResources Trust (with which EDF shares board members), has already negotiated\na lucrative contract to provide monitoring services.6 Allowing third parties\nto monitor emissions could also facilitate environmentalist fundraising by\ngiving corporations the incentive to give generously to environmental groups.\nIf EAC is approved, corporations will be tempted to pay tribute to monitors\nknowing they are the final arbiters of who does and doesn't deserve emissions\ncredits. This would compromise not only the integrity of emissions accounting\nand verification, but our political process. Senator Byrd was right to insist\nthat jury tampering in the impeachment inquiry not be tolerated. Tampering\nwith the Kyoto treaty jury shouldn't be tolerated either. 1 John Carlisle,\nNational Policy Analysis #233 \"White House Tries to Buy Support for Greenhouse\nGas Reductions,\" The National Center for Public Policy Research, Washington,\nDC, February 1999. 3 Marlo Lewis, \"Early Action Crediting: Growing the Kyoto\nLobby at Small Business' Expense,\" On-Point Policy Brief, Competitive\nEnterprise Institute, Washington, DC, February 2, 1999. 5 Joel Bucher, \"Early\nEmissions Credits: Subsidizing the Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol,\"\nCapitol Comment, Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation, Washington, DC,\nMarch 11, 1999. 6 \"Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Corrupt on Global Warming\nPolicy,\" NonProfit Accountability Project, Washington, DC.

It should be\ncompulsory reading for anybody in politics. There are a few reasons why UK\nconstruction projects cost such a ridiculously high amount. First of all,\nthere is the universally charged Day-Works scam, charged by every single major\nconstruction firm in the UK, which essentially doubles costs. Don't like it?\nTry finding a contractor who will work without it...Interestingly, it is\nunheard of in Japan, where I once witnessed an entire motorway built in a\nweek. Second of all, there is the ridiculous Health and Safety industry.\nInitially a decent idea as the UK had the highest rate of deaths in\nconstruction of any developed nation - now simply an industry in itself. It\nleads to horrendously over-engineered solutions, overspending on materials and\ndesign and huge delays in completion times. Complain about it and you're seen\nas someone who wants construction workers to be mangled by any piece of\npassing machinery. Health and Safety employs 200,000+ people in the UK. In\nFrance, it employs no-one, and they're not slow to adopt restrictive working\npractices. Third of all, there is our horrifically labyrinthine planning\nprocess, brought about by there being simply too many politicians. In terms of\npopulation Greater Glasgow and Manhattan are pretty similar. Manhattan has 10\ncouncillors; Glasgow has 328. Fourthly, there is the cost of land in the UK.\nProgressive land release policies, such as the Greens' Land Tax, designed to\nprevent speculative land banking by housebuilders, supermarkets etc are\nactually a good idea, which would prevent property prices from artificially\ninflating - I don't generally have a lot of time for the Greens, but this is a\ngood policy, and one that works well elsewhere. Fifthly - there are very few\nskilled construction professionals in the UK, and those that are employed in\nthe industry generally suffer from low wages, poor working conditions and\noften poor training. I do laugh when I hear of contractors trying to tempt\nschool leavers to take on a career with them - abusive, one-sided contracts,\nno rights and short-termism are rife. Consequently, sub-contracting is\neverywhere. So the next time you wonder why our major projects cost so much -\nsimply think of the five reasons given above. I disagree that landbanking is\nthe problem - I think it is a symptom of the fact that the planning system\nprevents so much land getting planning permission which makes land with\npermission unnaturally expensive. However whichever is the primary fault it\ndoes mean building land is unnecessarily expensive, with costs running right\nthrough the process. This demonstrates the strength of the net. There is\nabsolutely no way that print journalists would ever, even if they already know\nall this as i am sure 1 or 2 do, could ever be allowed to break ranks &\npublish an article like Alex's. Saturday Scotsman letter Saturday Scotsman\nnews item OurScotland discussion board On the one hand, since it has no\nlegislative power over the UK Parliament it was a lot of political posturing\nas the Telegraph points out There was one of those daft debates at Holyrood\nyesterday on an issue over which the Scottish Parliament has no power and in\nwhich it has - at least on the evidence of the sparse attendance - very little\ninterest. The issue was Europe, and specifically, that the SNP believes that\nthe UK Government should hold a referendum on the EU reform treaty.... In the\nend, the \"unholy alliance\" of SNP and Tories - plus the Greens - comfortably\ncarried the day, thanks to a mass abstention by Labour and, for the record,\nthe Scottish Parliament believes that there should be a referendum on the\ntreaty. On the other hand it is within the power of Holyrood to hold a\nconsultative referendum within Scotland & enthusiastic or not there would\nclearly be a majority for it. So lets have one. A little democracy is better\nthan none. Guardian article subheaded \"The coming UN vote for a universal\nmoratorium on the death penalty could mark another turning point for\ncivilisation\" True though Ms Bonino clearly does not understand the English\nlanguage enough to know that turning point means a point at which one turns.\nThe prime duty of government is to protect the citizen. That means that when\nthe citizen is threatened or actually subject to murder it is government's\nDUTY, not pleasure or choice, to act decisively to discourage such acts. If we\naccept that the death penalty tends to discourage those who, in the full\nknowledge of what they do, commit murder then it is the DUTY of government to\nexecute them. This would indeed be a \"turning point\" on a road which has\npreviously led up from barbarism to civilisation. The statistical evidence is\nthat execution does deter (very much more strongly that passive smoking kills\n& pretty much on a par with whether active smoking does). It is also\nintuitively obvious & anybody who says otherwise either has to be able to\nexplain why murderers are deterred by the chance of imprisonment but not by\nexecution or to explain why they aren't personally on record as saying\nmurderers shouldn't get anything worse than probation. It is a fake by\npoliticians who haven't the guts to do their plain duty & expect plaudits for\nit. In fact the overwhelming majority of our leaders DO believe in the death\npenalty - we just disagree on whom to use it against. I believe in the\nexecution of particularly vicious murderers & they believe & indeed practice\nthe execution of pregnant innocent Serbian women. I trust nobody will suggest\nthat there is any true moral equivalence between the toughest supporter of\nhanging & ANY of the genocidal scum MPs who support the latter proposition. A\n2nd post on that thread was deleted by them. It read \"Googling Ms Bonino <the\nauthor of the article against the death penalty>it turns out that she not only\nsupported the genocidal war to murder pregnant Serbian women but was on the\nlist to be gauletier of the genocidal Nazi regime we established there. I\ntrust nobody will ever suggest that either that obscene genocidal child raping\nNazi whore, nor anybody who shares her platform & fails to denounce her, can\never, under any circumstances, claim any form of moral equivalence to those on\nthe traditional side. On such hypocrisy so much of modern government is\nbuilt.\" Ashdown to Afghanistan\nhttp://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/daniel_korski/2007/12/from_bosnia_to_afghanistan.html\nGuardian article Nazi Ashdown\nhttp://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/daniel_korski/2007/12/from_bosnia_to_afghanistan.html\nGuardian article Martin Bell\nhttp://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/martin_bell/2007/12/return_of_the_censor.html\nGuardian article And in the best tradition of when one door closes another\nopens - my being censored by the Scotsman seems to have been ended. They have\njust done a revamp of the site (& I agree with David Farrer of Freedom &\nWhisky that it is distinctly not an improvement) & presumably this means a\nfresh start - or it may merely be that, having published a letter of mine on\nwhich I was then deemed unworthy to comment did look rather silly. Friday,\nDecember 21, 2007 \"We are told a new Forth bridge will cost between \u00a33.2 and\n\u00a34.2 billion (your report, 20 December). Back when the estimate was \u00a32.5\nbillion (in June) I thought it was high. The previous road bridge cost \u00a319.5\nmillion, which converts today to \u00a3314 million. Why have costs, after\ninflation, gone up ten to 13 times? It would seem amazing if this was purely\ngovernment regulations, but the alternative would seem more sinister. A third\ncrossing was initially sold on the threat that the current bridge was about to\nfall down because the cables were ageing. However, it seems ever more likely\nthat it can be reroped at a cost of about \u00a310 million. This is, after all,\nwhat the rest of the world does. Anybody want to bet on whether, as soon as\nall the expensive contracts have been signed, we will be told that reroping\ncan proceed apace? This was a short letter & greatly understates the problem\nsince the real way to provide a crossing is by a tunnel, which, if we did it\nat the same cost as Norway manages, would set us back about \u00a340 million - 1%\nof what we are being charged for this. Here is a reply I put up on the Herald\nonline expanding on this & refering to previous articles I have done on the\nsubject. I have discussed this on my blog & my articles contain further links\nto various costings so I will refer you to Costings of previous bridges &\nNorwegian tunnels My FoI enquiry into how the tunnel was costed Herald\ndiscussion yesterday ending with a Scot living in Norway calling our costings\n\"criminal\" Proposal for a Scottish tunnel Project across Scotland similar to\nNorway's, which should cost far less than this one bridge 9% Growth Party\nPress release yesterday Thursday, December 20, 2007 This account has had its\nposting rights withdrawn.

If you have any questions please\ncontact firstname.lastname@example.orgI did but they aren't replying. I have\nnow been barred by Channel 4 (twice) the Scotsman & the Guardian. Clearly we\nhave a trend here & the common factor is not hard to find. The British media\nare actively opposed to the truth. In not one of these cases has the party\ndoing the banning ever come up with a single case where any criticism I made\nwas not entirely factual. In all 3 cases I had shortly previously been\ndiscusing the Yugolsav wars so this seems to be the absloute no-go area for\nthe truth in the British media. In the Guardian's case it may be because I\nsaid that Paddy Ashdown had perjured himself at the Milosevic \"trial\" a matter\non which the evidence is literally rock solid or that his adminstration in B&H\nhad fired somebody for objecting to child sex slavery being allowed by that\nadministration. Both of which, though censored by most of our media (hats off\nto the Telegraph) are matters of public record. Wednesday, December 19, 2007\nThe Scottish government have decided to build a new Forth Bridge. \"A new\nbridge is to be built across the Firth of Forth, just west of the existing\nsuspension road crossing. The cable stayed-style bridge is due to open in\nabout 2016 and will cost between \u00a33.2bn and 4.2bn. Finance Secretary John\nSwinney told Parliament that concerns over the future viability of the\nexisting bridge meant the government had to act now. Ruling out a tunnel, he\nsaid the chosen option would deliver the crossing in the quickest possible\ntimescale..... He went on: \"It will be an iconic structure. It will maintain a\nfundamental link across the River Forth. It will create a new and better\nconnection to our transport infrastructure in west and east central Scotland.\n\"And it will be delivered through effective and comprehensive care for our\nnatural environment\".... The five-and-a-half year construction project is\nexpected to get under way in 2011, with a competition to find a constructor\ndue to be launched the year before.\" Back when the cost was a mere \u00a32.5\nbillion (June this year) I asked why it was so high. The previous road bridge\ncost \u00a319.5 million which converts today to \u00a3314 million. I have asked why\nexactly real costs have gone up 8 times (now 10 to 13 times) & received no\nanswer except for an implication it is \"environmental\" & other paperwork\ncosts. The \u00a3314 seems in line with overseas experience such as the 2.1 km\nSydney cross city tunnel at \u00a3300 million. The official cost of a tunnel is\neven higher & very much looks like it has been set high so that it will make\nthe bridge look good. We know the Norwegian government have been building\ntunnels at between \u00a33.5 & \u00a311 million per km which should produce a Forth\ntunnel at about 1% of the quoted price. The laws of physics are the same on\nboth sides of the North Sea. I don't believe the rush to build this based on\nthe original claim the current bridge was about to fall down because the\ncables were going. This story seems now to be winding down & I very strongly\nsuspect it will be found possible to re-rope this bridge for about \u00a310 million\n- just after contracts are signed on a new bridge. If so then there is no\nurgency & we need not be bounced into this. We are entitled to know exactly\nwhy the Scots government cannot build things at less than 10 to 100 times what\nit costs in the rest of the world. If it is regulatory we should remove such\nregulations. If it is corruption we should prosecute. The point about buying a\npig in a poke is that it is unwise to buy without seeing what it is. This\napplies equally when discussing a \u00a34.2 billion pig. Any new crossing should be\nopenly arrived at, knowing whether it is actually needed & with an open\nbidding process including foreign bidders. Bidders should be invited to quote\nfor any form of crossing - so long as it does the job. We are also entitled to\nfull explanation of why building costs so much higher in Scotland. Only when\nall facts are on the table should a decision be made. I note that, unlike the\nlast bridge this is going to be toll free. Perhaps this is due to the\ngenerosity of taxpayers towards motorists or perhaps it is because with\nprobable interest payments on this running at at least \u00a3300 million a year\nthere is no possible way that tolls could pay for it, as they did for the\nprevious bridge & not charging anything handily conceals that this project\nmakes no economic sense. Tuesday, December 18, 2007 1)The LibDems have chosen\nthe wrong (well ok wrongest) candidate for their leader. Nick Clegg is clearly\na stuffed shirt, which is why he was the preferred candidate among the \"great\n& good\". Huhne, despite much idiocy & some dishonesty over environmentalism,\nclearly was a competent economist with some actual ideas. He lost by 500 votes\n& may well get a 3rd chance if Clegg doesn't start inspiring & their vote\nkeeps deservedly falling. Clegg's pompous acceptance said he hoped to help\nBritain to become a better \"liberal country\" which will be difficult leading a\ndeliberately illiberal party. Ming has commented on how well the party will do\nwith a young leader! 2) The government has increased its guarantee to Northern\nRock to cover effectively ALL of its \u00a3100 billion liabilities. No answer as to\nwhy this has been done, nor why the Branson takeover hasn't been hurried\nthrough or indeed anything. The old adage is if you owe the bank \u00a310,000 you\nhave a problem, if you owe them \u00a31,000,000 they have a problem. Well the bank\nowe us \u00a3100,000,000,000 & we have a hell of a problem. Moreover we have\nestablished a far worse precedent. If house prices are going to fall &\nsometime they will because their prices bear no relationship to the cost of\nbuilding them but are merely held up by government preventing building, then\nNA will be merely the first to fold. The government will find it infinitely\ndifficult to refuse to subsidise them all & totally impossible to do so.\nJapan's economic growth, the fastest in the world, was brought down to zero\nfor a couple of decades by a government which devoted its entire economic\nresources to ensuring banks which were were broke because of a property\nbubble, were propped up. We should, under no circumstances, do the same.\nBankruptcy is a, perhaps the, vital part of the free enterprise system. If the\nshareholders of NR refuse to sell to Branson until they get a price which\nactually depends only on our underwriting them then we should have called in\nthe receivers & let him sell to Branson (or the other guys). 2 guesses as to\nwhether the story about us being down \u00a3100 billion or a sheep tick taking over\nthe Illiberals led the news. No guesses which should have. However this means\nI have had 4 letters on 3 subjects in the Herald (global warming, nuclear\npower & now Trump) & 1 in the Scotsman (Trump) in as many weeks which has\nbroken a dry spell. I note considerable coverage is being given to LibDem\nleader Nicol Stephen's accusation that the SNP \"may\" have done something\nillegal but he can't quite say what, following on his accusation, at first\nminister's questions of them suffering the disgraceful sin of \"cleverness\".\nThis was apparently intended to distract attention from the fact that the\nleading councillors who refused to allow Mr Trump to invest \u00a31 billion in\nAberdeenshire were LibDems. < It is a shame that he did not benefit from\nsimilar coverage when, a couple of years ago on Question Time, he accused the\nIsraelis of criminal behaviour for responding to Hamas rocket attacks by\ndestroying an electricity sobstation which he said was a \"war crime\". The\nLibDems very enthusiasticly supported bombing Yugoslavia to help the NATO\narmed KLA commit genocide. One of the least murderous of NATO's acts there was\ndestroying electricity generators. Does anybody know of any other party leader\nwho has thus not only accused other parties of criminal behaviour but\naccidentaly accused his own of war crimes?> Monday, December 17, 2007 My\nrecent comment on Nicol Stephen accusing the SNP of \"cleverness\" was partly\ninspired by my response to a particularly brown-nosing piece by him on how his\nwonderful speech proved \"we in the Scottish Lib Dems are the real opposition\nto this gnat government\". None of the other comments are really worth going on\nabout but pretending to accept comments & not doing so is a breach of\nnetiquette which should not go unmentioned. And before Norman comments I do\nnot & have never pretended to accept comments which are obscene or purely\npersonally abusive to me or other commenters, though I have accepted ones from\nhim which were abusive but also made a point. This does not make his wife the\nsame but, since she gave him total support throughout, it does prove her unfit\nfor any serious role in government.

(B) If what I said was improper to\nwrite online about somebody writing what are clearly the Guardian's political\nviews then the only possible way it can be right for the Guardian to publish\nexactly the same words about somebody not given the chance to defend himself\nis if it is if the paper is willing to say anything about today's propaganda\nenemy & censor anything about the genocidal war criminals whose pockets they\nare in. In which case in what circumstances can we believe anything they say.\nFor example we know that everything they are saying today about Darfur they\nwere saying in the 90s about Yugoslavia. How do we know that any of it is true\nwhen we know for a fact that the Guardian is willing to make up anything about\none side & censor anything by the side we are (currently) supporting.\nObviously the proper thing to do is to hand over the south of England to\nimmigrants & to ethnically cleanse all British born people. This is, after\nall, what the Guardian has commissioned so very many articles to say should be\ndone to the Serbs. Obviously if the Guardian is not being openly racist & pro-\nNazi they must have commissioned a similar number of articles to support a\nsimilarly progressive policy in Britain.\nhttp://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/liam_byrne/2007/12/values_added.html\nAnswering Will Hutton on the long boom & the alleged coming recession: \"That\nlong boom was made possible by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the\nopening of China (and to a lesser extent India) in the 1990s\" No. The long\nboom was caused by the growing importance of computerisation & of Moore's Law\nwhich says that computer capacity, at a fixed price, doubles every 18 months.\nThis may well also be what caused the collapse of the USSR as well since they\nhad missed out on computerisation & PCs & the internet were incompatible with\ntotalitarianism. The boom will continue because Moore's Law in still operative\n(& something similar is happening in bio-tech), but it may only continue\noutside Europe. Britain's \"boom\" has, in fact been a comparative recession\nsince we have grown at 2.5% while the world average was 5%. The main reason\nfor this is that far from being an entrepreneurial culture we are in fact a\nvery heavily & destructively state regulated one. House prices, which are set\nby government regulation which actively prevents housebuilding, is a prime\nexample. Free enterprise - The concept of \"right\" & \"left\" seems to have\nbecome largely defined by how each reacts to free enterprise. If you think\nfree enterprise is is an efficient system which maximises human productivity\nyour are \"right\". You are also right since hundreds of examples of countries\nwhich have run by free enterprise or command, or as in the case of China moved\nfrom one to the other undeniably show that free enterprise is much more\nefficient. If you believe that some form of central planning works more\nefficiently you are \"left\" (or possibly a Fascist or Nazi but most \"leftists\"\ndon't know anything about these movements except that they hated Blacks &\nMoslems*. A recent variation is that you join the Greens (who claim to be\n\"left\" despite being the ultimate conservatives) & say that maximising\nefficiency (ie progress) is a bad thing & get to blame free enterprise anyway.\nThe original meaning of left & right is that when representatives entered the\nFrench revolutionary Parliament the posh people went through the door first &\nthus ended at the right of the chamber. If the term were to have any related\nmeaning now it would have to be in favour of maximising the rights & incomes\nof the poor as against those in charge. On that basis maximum free enterprise\nbut with a decent welfare state should be the leftist position whereas\nmaintaining control of the nearly 50% of our economy by the \"great & good\" of\nthe civil service etc would be a rightist position. People like Clare short\nwho believe in illegal wars & bombing hospitals would be very far to the\nright. *They are wrong. The Nazis were to busy being against the Slavs & Jews\nto bother Blacks & got on very well with Moslems who manned several SS\ndivisions for them.\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2226539,00.html Why does the\nGuardian refuse to do more articles on the threat to humanity from witchcraft.\nAll these articles saying this year's floods, last years drought, hurricane\nKatrina, the low level of hurricanes since, the reduction in butterflies &\npolar bears, the increase in butterflies & polar bears etc are caused by\nglobal warming. Everybody knows these are caused by witches. It is all a\nconspiracy by greedy capitalists who are only after profits & who stop the\npapers telling of the real threat. All these witches flying around & kissing\nthe devil's bum must be true because computer models show that if all the\namended figures showing they exist continue at the predicted rate we will all\nbe going to Hell sometime after peak oil hits. There must be government grants\nfor an urgent programme of finding witches. The government must employ more\nwitchfinders. I guarantee they would find lots of witches. Only thus can we\noverthrow capitalism.\nhttp://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ed_pomfret/2007/12/climate_of_confusion.html\nIan twists & turns like a twisty turny thing in yet another of the articles\nsupporting the KLA which he bet me a bottle of rum didn't exist. In fact, as\nhe effectively admits the NATO powers did accept the complete legal\nsovereignty of Yugoslavia as part of the occupation agreement. In any case the\nHelsinki Treaty also guarantees that all European countries, except Albania\nwhich refused to play, acknowledged a duty to \"take no action against the\nterritorial integrity & unity\" of all European countries including Yugoslavia.\nThis rule is, or rather was, a very good basis for European peace. Therefore,\nwhatever Ian says there is no possibility of ANY European or US politician who\npossesses the remotest trace of integrity supporting \"independence\" under his\nopenly genocidal Nazi KLA friends. Ignoring justice, ignoring the rule of law,\nignoring human decency (since a KLA which, with NATO help, kidnaps children to\nsell to brothels is hardly decent), ignoring war crimes, ignoring genocide &\nethnic cleansing of 350,000 Kosovars by NATO's Nazi police, ignoring\neverything but naked self interest - even then Ian should not support his Nazi\nfriends. London is currently just over 40% immigrant, shortly it will be\nmoreso just as the Kosovars have been outnumbered by Albanian immigrants whom\nour media, as a racist propaganda term now call \"Kosovars\". The precedent has\nbeen established which would allow Ian to be driven from his home or murdered\nby \"Londoners\" in \"revenge attacks\". Equally, by establishing that the rule of\nlaw, the UN Charter & indeed the most solemn treaty promises of every NATO\nnation are totally valueless we have ensured that every small country must\nrely on weaponry &/or the Shanghai Pact - ask North Korea, Iran or indeed\nIsrael. This makes the world a vastly more dangerous place, for all of us not\njust those Nazi journalists who have, for so many years, deliberately lied to\nsupport genocide.

So she's suing\nthem. Cassini, a former Hollywood costumer and the man responsible for Jackie\nKennedy's iconic pillbox hat, and Tierney, an Oscar-nominated actress who\nstarred in the 1944 film \"Laura,\" were married from 1941 to 1952. They had two\nchildren- Antoinette Daria, who was mentally handicapped and\ninstitutionalized, and Christina, who was born in 1948. The couple divorced in\nCalifornia in 1953, and their divorce decree mandated that Cassini split half\nof his estate equally between the couple's two daughters upon his death.\nCassini married Nestor in 1971 and died in March 2006, at age 92. In 2007,\nChristina filed a claim in Nassau County Surrogate's Court arguing that she\nwas entitled to 25 percent of her father's estate under the divorce agreement.\nBut according to papers filed by Marianne Nestor Cassini in Los Angeles\nSuperior Court in 2010, Oleg Cassini had actually willed $500,000 in trust to\nDaria, $1 million to Christina and the remainder to her. She argued that the\ndivorce decree was overridden by the will. The courts felt differently, and in\nMay 2012, a New York appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling that Christina\nis entitled to a quarter of her father's estate. Her takeaway? A cool $13\nmillion. But Nestor Cassini filed a motion to appeal, and on Thursday she\nfiled another lawsuit, this time against Putney Twombly Hall & Hirson, in New\nYork, and two of its attorneys, William Pollak and Philip Kalban. She also\nsued Nachsin & Weston, of Los Angeles, who consulted on the original case.\nAccording to Nestor Cassini's lawsuit, her lawyers should have challenged\nChristina's 2007 claim under the statute of limitations. Their failure to do\nso was an act of \"negligence and malpractice.\" She is seeking $13 million.\n\"These failures by defendants resulted in a loss to the estate of Oleg Cassini\n(the 'estate') of at least $13 million (representing the share of the estate\ngranted to Christina upon her successful cross-motion for summary judgment) as\nwell as causing plaintiff to incur significant attorneys' fees, costs, and\ndisbursements, and court costs and fees to move to reargue and for leave to\nrenew and to appeal the improper granting of Christina's cross-motion,\"\nCourthouse News reported. Suing your lawyer is not a common occurrence, said\nJohn Nockleby, a professor of law and director of the civil justice program at\nLoyola Law School, in Los Angeles. \"You have to show two things\u2014first, that in\nsome important way the lawyer messed up, and secondly that the person would\nhave won the underlying case,\" he said. \"In a legal malpractice you have to\nshow that your lawyer made an important error that a reasonably careful lawyer\nwould not have made.\" Andrew W. Mayoras, an estate litigation attorney and co-\nauthor of Trial & Heirs: Famous Fortune Fights, said he doubts Nestor Cassini\nwill win. \"In this case, it appears that Marianne Nestor Cassini, having\nfailed in both New York and California -- both in the initial courts and the\ncourts of appeal in each state -- now seeks to lay blame on the only target\nleft,\" he said. \"She feels they should have attacked Christina Crissini's\nclaim on the basis that it was filed it too late. But, it appears that she\nfiled it approximately one year after her father died. Until he died, the\ndivorce judgment provision was not breached because he could have created a\nwill that complied with it. So Christina's claim likely will be determined to\nbe timely and it is very unlikely that Nestor's claim will prevail.\" Nestor\nCassini is no stranger to lawsuits. In 2010 she filed a $10 million defamation\nlawsuit against Vanity Fair after it published a story, \"Cassini Royale,\"\nabout the battle over Cassini's estate. Publisher Conde Nast says the lawsuit\nis unresolved.| <urn:uuid:1d7dc993-d063-4402-884a-1c7878b9a15a>| CC-\nMAIN-2016-26| http://abcnews.go.com/Business/fashion-designers-widow-sues-\nlawyers-inheritance-dispute/story?id=17174250&singlePage=true|\n2016-06-24T21:17:40Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.980753|\n880  \nPosters promoting \"Hung,\" HBO's new series about a burgeoning escort service,\nshow a down-and-out middle-aged man and woman, she with a smirk and a \"Pimp\"\nplastered underneath her mug, he with a furrowed brow and a \"Ho\" below. It's\nalso a complete fantasy. While \"Hung's\" plot is rooted in real life dilemmas\n-- its \"ho,\" Ray (Thomas Jane), finds he can't pay back his adjustable rate\nmortgage with his salary as a high school basketball coach and turns to Tanya\n(Jane Adams), a former hook-up, to help market his supposedly massive manhood\n-- the premise of women paying for a romp in the sack strikes some in the\nindustry as ludicrous. \"I don't see women reaching out to male prostitutes;\nit's not financially viable,\" said George Flint, director of the Nevada\nBrothel Owners' Association. \"The concept of male prostitutes marketing to\nfemale clients makes about as much sense as selling sand to Waikiki. I think\nit makes a nice story, but I don't see it being reality.\" But what \"Hung\" has\nright, according to former and current sex workers, is the more-common-than-\ntalked-about trend of good looking guys exploring side gigs as escorts during\ntough economic times America's currently enduring. \"Sex work is always an\noption when other options run out,\" said Craig Seymour, author of \"All I Could\nBare: My Life in the Strip Clubs of Gay Washington, D.C.\" \"If you're a cute\nguy, you can always find a way to make money based on your looks, probably\nmore from gay men than you can from straight women. In real life, Ray would\nprobably be turning to gay men instead of straight women.\" That doesn't\nnecessarily mean Ray would be gay. \"There are a lot of straight guys that sell\ntheir sexual services to gay men for money,\" Seymour said. \"Many of my friends\nwho do that might be high school drop-outs, maybe they work in construction;\nin general, they have temporary jobs. When those dry up in a bad economy, the\none thing they rely on is stripping for men or escorting for men.\" Adam, a\n22-year-old college student, sees some of himself in \"Hung.\" He started\nselling sex services four years ago to supplement earnings from his part-time\njob, using online social networks to find clients. But now, because of the\nrecession, he relies on escorting to get by. \"My dad got laid off from his job\nin November, so I started tricking more to pay my rent and make my car\npayments,\" he said. \"I used to have a strict rule for myself that the money I\nmade from sex was strictly to be used for fun. That somehow made it less real.\nBut that's definitely changed with the recession.\" Adam, who asked that his\nfull name not be revealed, estimated he earns about $500 a week thanks to\nappointments with two regular clients, both male. He doesn't know any men who\nmake money marketing to straight women. \"A lot of my friends have started\nstripping for men because of the recession and not being able to find a job,\"\nWright said. \"I'm 90-percent sure that most of them have dabbled in escorting\nas a result.\" The unrealistic notion of male-to-female escorting isn't lost on\n\"Hung's\" creators, Colette Burson and Dmitry Lipkin. But they argue that\nturning the prostitution paradigm on its head makes the show appealing. \"There\nis this fantasy element psychologically: Ray can't run away from these women\nthe way men yearn to run away from relationships,\" Burson said. \"He can't just\nsay, 'You're being really weird' to a client and get out of there. He needs\nthem.\" That's the reality of a down economy. But, as Seymour pointed out,\n\"There's something about our personality that draws us into the line of work\nthat we do. ... If you're escorting, you're probably enjoying it on some\nlevel.\" So while the premise of a man selling sex to a woman may be the stuff\nof fiction, the idea that a guy would enjoy that line of work doesn't seem so\nfarfetched. \"Ray says in episode two, 'I'm game.' He has no other game to try\nand he's willing to try this one,\" Burson said. \"But I don't think the journey\nis excruciating to him. It's scary, for sure, but in some ways, I think it's\nthe most interesting journey that's ever happened to him.\"|\n<urn:uuid:b4e6b08f-5795-4451-8c05-ca7b254d1ed6>| CC-MAIN-2016-26|\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=8114173&page=1|\n2016-06-24T21:36:22Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.984219|\n960  \nA personal goal can be as exhilarating as drinking rocket fuel. It can mess\nwith your stomach and get relatively expensive compared to a Snapple, but the\nendorphin rush outweighs the downside. I believe in going for the gusto. Why\nnot try to reinvent the wheel? Make it smoother, rounder \u2014 more \"wheelie.\" The\nnew wheel might roll better. If not, you can always fall back on the original\nwheel. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. However, there are some things you\njust clearly know not to do. I wouldn't bungee-jump off the 59th Street Bridge\ninto the dirty waters of Manhattan. (It's enough of a feat just spending time\nwith someone who did.) I wouldn't try to start my own book club if I only read\nthe pop-up kind. I also know better than to enter a Miss America pageant. Not\nonly am I too old, but the perfect pear shape they strive for during the\nswimsuit competition would be lost to my baked-potato figure. Even if the\njudges were obsessed with starches, and even if I were able to answer their\ninane questions about changing the world with some modicum of intelligence,\nI'd still end up losing out when I accidentally cracked Joan Van Ark's skull\nwhile twirling a baton on ice skates to Irene Cara's \"What a Feeling\" \u2014\nassuming Joan were a celebrity judge. Failure Comes as No Shanghai Surprise\nKnow your limitations! That's the point I'm trying to make here, which is why\nI can't tolerate one more minute of Mrs. Guy Ritchie \u2014 aka Madonna \u2014 getting\nin front of a camera and trying to act. Before all you Madonna fans aim your\nbullet-loaded conical bras at me, know that I, too, am a fan of Our Lady of\nthe Blond Ambition. She is a musical icon, and if you don't agree with that,\nthen you must agree she's a marketing genius. She is the queen of reinvention.\nShe knows how to MOVE. She moves her music, her body, an audience, men, and\nmerchandise. But ladies and germs, she does not know how to MOV-IE. She just\ncan't act. This statement can be taken two ways, as over the years many have\nfound her behavior to be rather unsavory. There's no point in arguing the\nentertainment value of the Sex book, her many documentaries, the \"Justify My\nLove\" video, etc. They were Madonna then and again. And as is her forte,\npresto change-o, she's now a mother of two and a \"happily married\" woman. But\nas far as her acting \u2014 it's been bad since her first time out of the gate. If\nyou're so enthralled by her other talents that you are blind to her lack of\ntheatrical abilities, I urge you to take a walk down celluloid way with me: \u2022\nDesperately Seeking Susan \u2022 Shanghai Surprise \u2022 Who's That Girl? \u2022 Dangerous\nGame \u2022 Body of Evidence \u2022 Evita I'm not including A League of Their Own or\nDick Tracy, because those were decent films with ensemble casts. Their success\nwasn't sitting on Madonna's shoulder. But, if you're still such a die-hard fan\nand think I'm such a hard-nose, then go rent all of these and watch them back\nto back. If you don't attempt some kind of personal abuse (aka toothpicks in\nyour eyeballs, biting hunks out of your forearms), then you should stop\nreading here because you're too far gone. Which brings us to her latest \u2014\nSwept Away. Her husband, Snatch director Guy Ritchie, clearly loves Madonna\nblindly because he allowed himself to go against the instinctual gift he has\nfor filmmaking and miscast her in a role that could've been pulled off by just\nabout anyone with talent. Harvey Fierstein in drag would've had more\nbelievable on-screen chemistry with co-star Adriano Giannini than did Madonna.\nBasically, if this movie isn't her final attempt at film-career suicide, then\nI don't know what will be (Evita was supposed to be the movie death of her).\nSwept Away is a remake of the 1974 Lina Wertm\u00fcller film starring Mariangela\nMelato and, coincidentally enough (yeah right), Adriano Giannini's papa,\nGiancarlo Giannini. In its day it was weighted with controversy as it touched\non communist ideals, sexual exploration and situations that were certainly\nmore taboo back then. Madonna\u2019s No Sandler Whatever Ritchie intended to do\nwith this version of the film is all but lost because Madonna is so\noverpoweringly awful that she would've been less guilty had she shot this film\nto death with a rifle. In the inimitable words of the Rolling Stones, \"You\ncan't always get what you want.\" Although Madonna has lots of fans, the bottom\nline is that the flick has grossed $375,000 on 196 screens. That's roughly\n$1,900 a screen, or about 191 people per screen). All I'm saying is if your\nmodus operandi is going for the gusto and doing it for public consumption,\nthen it's important to have the talent to back it up. And although I never\nthought I'd say this, Adam Sandler does that! I saw Punch-Drunk Love and,\nalthough this is one quirky, jerky film, Sandler stepped up to the plate.\nWhether you are a fan of his potty-humor/slapstick comedy or not, the guy is a\nbox-office gold mine. His plethora of films appeals to a certain younger\ncrowd, but he never ceases to pull in the movie masses. Sandler went out on a\nlimb, went for the real dramatic carrot and got it. Although his role as the\nemotionally troubled Barry Egan contains behavior reminiscent to Sandler's own\nunusual characteristics, he is able to take his oddness to a whole new level.\nTruthfully, the guy really can act. There are scenes where his volatility is\ncompletely unnerving. Punch-Drunk allows him to switch-hit with the big-team\nplayers like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, who have put aside their comedy\ncapes for more dynamic parts. Honestly, Madonna could take a lesson or two\nfrom Mr. Sandler, and if not from him, then from an acting teacher. Sandler\nmight make comedy albums, but he's never going to try and become a Top 40\nsinger. He knows better. These two flicks should change titles. I got Swept\nAway by Adam Sandler's performance in Punch-Drunk Love, and that's exactly\nwhat Guy Ritchie must've been hit with to make such a hideous movie with his\nwife.

More than\n4,000 patients were offered the screening and almost 2,500 (60 percent) agreed\nto be tested. Of those, 26 patients (one percent) had a preliminary positive\nresult for HIV infection. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The rapid\nscreening kits were provided free of charge by the Washington, D.C.,\nDepartment of Health, while researchers did the actual clinical work. While\nthis approach would not be feasible over the long-term, it does suggest some\nmodels for a program of ongoing HIV testing in hospital emergency departments,\nsaid study author Jeremy Brown, research director in the university's\ndepartment of emergency medicine. He said the cost per preliminary positive\nHIV result was about $1,700, and about $4,900 per confirmed case of HIV\ninfection. \"Washington, D.C., has one of the highest AIDS case prevalence\nrates in the United States, and our results suggest that ED HIV screening in\nthis high prevalence area is well accepted by patients,\" Brown noted. \"The\ncost per case detected is low when compared with other methods for the early\ndetection of HIV.

Microsoft's new 80GB Zune music player seems to be outselling the\nApple iPod Nano, at least for the moment. A Thanksgiving week report noted a\nshortage of the new Zune media players ($249) on the Web and in retail stores,\nsuggesting it gave Apple a little run for consumer's money. Don't expect it to\nlast though. Zunes should be back on retail and virtual shelves very soon, so\nthese sleek-looking Wi-Fi enabled music players are an option for your\nstocking if you're ready to fork over some big bucks. For that special someone\nwho already has an iPod or music player, check out Griffin's new TuneBuds\n($19.99), earphones that are both comfortable and sound great so you can\nlisten in style. They are noise-isolating, lightweight and available in six\ndesigner colors (silver, pink, light green, blue, light blue and red) so you\ncan match whatever player you're carrying that day. Taking the music on the\nroad? Make sure to get an iTrip Auto SmartScan ($79.99) from Griffin. It's a\nredesigned iTrip so no more fumbling around with your FM dial trying to tune\ninto the right station to play your tunes. The FM transmitter plugs into the\ncar's 12-volt/cigarette lighter, scans the radio dial for you, finds the three\nclearest FM frequencies and saves them as presets that you can recall at any\ntime with a single button. It charges your iPod at the same time so you've got\na full battery when you arrive at your destination. DYMO Personal Labelmaker\nFor that gadget hound with a drawer full of tangled electrical cords and AC\npower packs, a label maker is a must. The DYMO Personal Labelmaker ($39.99)\nlets you label just about anything: cords, files, CDs, shelves, storage\ncontainers, even your Christmas stocking. The portable labelmaker features a\nlarge keyboard and screen so you can see what you're typing and labels are\navailable for paper, plastic and iron-on. 'Halo 3' Flash Drive Is there a\n\"Halo\" fan in your life? Let Master Chief protect his data. Mimoco has a line\nof mimobot designer USB flash drives that make great stocking stuffers. The\n\"Halo 3\" Mimobot Series 1 features Master Chief, Red Spartan and Blue Spartan.\nThey'll be preloaded with series-specific content, \"Halo\"-related media,\nwallpapers, screensavers, as well as unpublished pages from the Marvel Halo\ncomics, sections from the \"Halo 3\" strategy guide and excerpts from the\nupcoming Halo novel. The \"Halo\" series is available in 1GB ($49.95), 2GB\n($69.95) and 4GB ($109.95) capacities. Lastly, no stocking would be complete\nwithout the perfect tool to help you open all those plastic-encased electronic\nitems that are harder to open than a bank vault. The Zibra Co. in Mooresville,\nN.C., has put an end to \"package wrap rage\" by developing the Swiss Army knife\nof scissors, called Open It! ($11) It's a combination scissor-box cutter-\nsnipper; it even has a built-in pair of screwdrivers. The Open It! looks like\na pair of gardening shears with some serious cutting ability. They can snip\nthrough plastic as well as those wire ties that take forever to unfurl as your\nchild is screaming trying to get the toy that is bound to the cardboard. A\ntiny screwdriver set is tucked away in one handle, which might have come in\nhandy the other day when I fouled the screw on the battery compartment of a\nkid's digital camera. The other side houses a retractable knife that not only\nslices through presents that come in cardboard boxes, but also lets you slice\nopen CD and DVD packaging. Open It! comes in five colors and is so versatile,\nit will be used all year round. I think I may get one for my mom.

Janet and Jermaine Jackson are also in Tucson. Perry Sanders,\nKatherine Jackson's estate attorney, traveled to Tucson Tuesday night to meet\nwith Janet and Jermaine Jackson and check on Katherine Jackson's condition. He\nwas assured by people staying with her that she was OK, but did not see her.\n\"I think you have a bunch of people who have a lot of different ideas about\nwhat should happen with their mother in this situation,\" Sanders told ABC\nNews. \"It's a complex family dynamic.\" Sandra Ribera, another attorney for\nKatherine Jackson, told ABC News, \"The children were able to make contact with\ntheir grandmother very late yesterday evening.

But at its May 28 meeting board\nmembers did just that, adopting a resolution discontinuing contracts at the\nclose of the 2012-2013 school year for all 22 of the district\u2019s learning\nadvocates. Student learning advocates, hired on a year-to-year basis using\nmoney from the district\u2019s integration fund, serve Anoka-Hennepin\u2019s diverse\npopulation of students as mentors, providing leadership, offering\nencouragement and accountability and motivating students to succeed. Also\ndiscontinued with the adoption of the resolution are three interpreters, four\nIndian education advisers, some three dozen paraeducators and a secretary.\nState budget cuts made the cuts necessary, according to Michelle Vargas, chief\nfinancial officer for Anoka-Hennepin School District. \u201cThis is a result of the\nnew integration and achievement formula implemented in the recent legislative\nsession,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe lose approximately $260,000 in funding for FY14\n(school year 2013-2014).

Regular readers of this blog will be\nwell aware that coffee is my beverage of choice most mornings, but even more\ndiligent readers will also have picked up that my household often looks for\ninspiration from the land of the rising sun due to Sharon spending a couple of\nyears there on exchange. Spending a Sunday afternoon lazily gallivanting\naround the city we happened to be strolling down Hay St towards Subiaco when\nwe happened to stumble (I do a lot of stumbling) into Green Tea House, the\ndelightful tea shop owned by the exceedingly friendly Mr Wasaki. What followed\nwas probably an hour and a half\u2019s worth of tasting tea, talking about tea,\ntalking about coffee, talking about Japan, talking about food, talking about\nJapanese food in Japan, talking about Japanese food in Australia, talking\nabout Chinese tea compared to Japanese tea, smelling tea in an incense burner,\nand eventually, actually buying some tea. As you might have guessed, Mr Wasaki\nlikes to talk. He is a well schooled individual who has been living in\nAustralia for the better part of 15 years now, having moved over here with his\nwife and family quite some time ago, but only recently having followed his\nheart by starting his own business importing and selling the tea he so dearly\nloves. That tea in question is of course Japanese green tea. High grade, hand\npicked, vacuum packed, and air shipped for maximum freshness, Mr Wasaki leaves\nlittle to chance. His tea\u2019s range from the everyday Sencha, to the superior\nGyokuro, and having gotten to try just about all of them, I can say they are\nall quite good. I was also glad to have finally found somewhere that sells\nMatcha (the ground tea powder made from Gyokuro, used in traditional Japanese\ntea ceremonies, and a damn good ice cream flavouring :) ). Not just sticking\nwith tea, he also sells Noren (traditional Japanese curtains used to hang in\nhomes or shops as a welcome banner), as well as a number of special Japanese\nfoods and sweets that no doubt have the ex-pats coming back on a regular\nbasis. He also sells a whole range of tea cups and bowls, which go along with\nhis tips for preparing the tea properly, i.e: NEVER pour boiling water over\ntea leaves. You will bring the bitter flavours out, rather, pour the water\nfrom the kettle into another bowl first, and then wait a few minutes til the\nwater is roughly 80C before pouring it into the tea leaves. The tea itself is\ngreat. I can\u2019t say I am in any way a tea fanatic, jasmine, oolong, and russian\ncaravan is about as exotic as I\u2019ve been, but the flavours of the high end\nJapanese teas were outstanding. Clean and crisp, yet with an almost buttery\nfinish to many of them, most markedly pronounced in the Gyokuro, we could not\nhelp but buy a pack of our own and go home to continue the experiment. I also\npicked myself up a can of matcha, and have been sprinkled it into everything I\nthink is sprinklable. My only concern is that Mr Wasaki is a little too\nfriendly for his own good. He almost talked me out of buying the Matcha\nbecause he said he could get me something more suitable for cooking with, and\nthen he almost forgot to charge me when I went to pay. His enthusiasm and love\nfor his products shows through more than anything however, and it\u2019s this\ncoupled with his quiet unassuming nature that make Green Tea House a welcome\nrespite from so many shops who just want to take your money and get you out\nthe door. If ever you find yourself in the area, do yourself a favour and drop\nin to sample some excellent Japanese tea in a very relaxing atmosphere.|\n<urn:uuid:6ccfe994-ec69-4d13-a46f-c3bed5815e40>| CC-MAIN-2016-26|\nhttp://abstractgourmet.com/2007/01/green-tea-house/| 2016-06-24T20:16:14Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.975537|\n804  \nIf so, I would guess that this question--of whether a stay of the judgment\npending appeal should be entered--will get to the Supreme Court no matter\nwhat. After writing the post last night, I realized that, even if the District\nCourt or the Eleventh Circuit grants the stay, the plaintiff states will be\nable to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court. And why wouldn't they? It\nwould only mean more media coverage for their efforts. So, assuming the DOJ\nseeks a stay--again, I do not know whether it needs one--then I think this\nmatter is headed to the Court. One other point: if the lower court grants a\nstay, and the Supreme Court decides to let that stay remain in place, that\nwill not signal much. That is not a whole lot different from a denial of\ncertiorari. If the lower courts have denied the stay, and it is the United\nStates that comes to the Court seeking one, what the Court does will say much\nmore. Either it will be denying the request of the Solicitor General merely to\nallow the constitutional provisions of the Act to be implemented pending the\nultimate resolution of the constitutionality of the individual mandate, or it\nwill be reaching down to grant a stay when it was denied by the lower courts.\nEither of these would be a decent signal--although obviously not dispositive--\nof what the justices think of the states' claims on the merits.

First one: I\u2019ve\nworked out every day this week. I\u2019m not gonna make some unrealistic statement\nand say that this is how I\u2019m living from here on out, but good gracious does\nit make me feel giddy. Second tweak: I\u2019ve cut out coffee. I know. I know. I\ncan\u2019t believe I just wrote that. It wasn\u2019t planned. I woke up Monday morning\nand got some tea instead of coffee. And then I did the same thing the next\nday. And the next day. And now, it\u2019s Friday and I feel like I have more energy\nthan I\u2019ve had in months. In months I\u2019m guessing this won\u2019t last for long\u2013the\ntaste of coffee is a long time love. I decided to keep up with the health-ish,\nunusual track that I\u2019m on and snack on some beets. (I honestly don\u2019t even know\nwho I am right now.) I hate beets. I think they taste\u2013for the most part\u2013like\ndirt. Like, the actual earth. People put a bunch of goat cheese on them and\navocado and think they\u2019re delicious. Datsss cool. I\u2019m just not one of those\npeople. But I do love those Terra chips. You know those? They\u2019re like $6 a bag\nfrom Whole Foods and they\u2019re filled about a quarter of the way? Yeah. Well,\nthe beet chips\u2013surprisingly\u2013are my favorite. It\u2019s unexplainable. Turns out\nslicing some beets and baking them is waaaay cheaper than buying a big bag of\npre-sliced and pre-baked ones. I made one batch last week and one batch\nyesterday. Pro-tips: Martha\u2019s method with placing a baking sheet on top of the\nchips to keep them flat is a winner. She\u2019s too smart. Also, only take the\nbeets out of the oven when they\u2019re pale. Their color will turn from a deep\nbeet red to a pale beet red. This is confusing in text, I\u2019m sure, but if you\ntake the dive and make these, you\u2019ll see the difference when you do an oven\npeek. So, join me on this strange journey. Grab a mandoline. Slice up some\npretty golden beets and maybe a few red beets. Toss them with very little\nolive oil. Sprinkle on a some sea salt. Baked them. And boom. Healthy\nsnacking. It\u2019s happening. Baked Beet Chips 4 medium beets 2 teaspoon extra-\nvirgin olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, with racks in upper and lower\nthirds. Peel beets and slice 1/16 inch thick with a mandoline. In a large\nbowl, toss beets with extra-virgin olive oil. The beets should have a very\nthin coat. 2. On two rimmed baking sheets (or use one sheet and bake in two\nbatches), arrange beets in a single layer. Sprinkle with a small amount of sea\nsalt. 3. Stack another rimmed baking sheet on top of each. Bake until edges of\nbeets begin to dry out, about 20 minutes. Uncover and rotate sheets. Bake 10\nto 20 minutes, removing chips as they become lightened and pale in color.\nNote: Pretty much all of mine needed the full extra 20 minutes of baking time.\nTransfer to a wire rack; chips will crisp up as they cool.

State Department of Environmental Conservation spokesman\nDave Winchell said the bear was killed because it had lost its fear of humans\nafter being fed by them. \"This weekend it approached a young child, coming\nwithin 4 or 5 feet of it,\" Winchell told the Enterprise in an email. Winchell\nsaid the bear had been seen in the Long Lake numerous times over the last\nseveral months. It was reported to DEC that its mother was killed and that\npeople had been feeding the young bear, Winchell said. \"It has become\nhabituated to obtaining food from humans and lost its fear of them,\" Winchell\nsaid. \"Therefore it was a threat to human health and safety and had to be\neuthanized.\" The bear is the 13th nuisance bear to be killed in the\nAdirondacks this summer by the DEC, homeowners and farmers. In DEC's Region 5,\nwhich encompasses the northern and eastern parts of the Adirondacks, there\nhave been seven nuisance bears killed by DEC staff, homeowners and farmers.\nThe DEC put down six nuisance bears this summer in the Old Forge area alone.\nThe department killed another this winter in the Tug Hill region, just west of\nthe Adirondacks. Biologists have said the increase in nuisance bear activity\nwas due to the dry weather this summer, which caused food sources to be scarce\nfor the animals. The bear population is also believed to be increasing, in\npart because last year was an abundant year for bear food, which allowed the\nanimals to have a successful reproductive season.

Perhaps there's an economic benefit to the region we're all\nmissing. If we just play up the excitement of snowmobiling down a trail with\nsteep banks on both sides on 40-inch front skis that are trapped between\nexposed steel rails, we could attract a whole new crowd of thrill seekers.\nWhen you add in the possibility of encountering a barely covered siding or\nswitch that could stop you instantly, propelling you over the handlebars while\nbending your legs in a direction nature never intended, it makes bungee\njumping and skydiving look tame by comparison. And imagine the rush when you\nmeet another snowmobiler coming in the opposite direction while you're both\ntrapped inside the bare rails with those ever-present ditches on both sides.\nPromoted properly, I think we're talking billions here. Seriously, attempting\nto ride a snowmobile on a rail line is a harrowing experience 90 percent of\nthe time, and most sensible snowmobilers would rather risk falling through the\nice while riding on the lakes than take a rail line. But of course the bigger\nquestion is, would a trail system be more beneficial to the economy and\nAdirondack residents in general than the train? \"Expert\" financial estimates\naside, here's what I know: After spending six years up here and having dozens\nof guests visit us in this beautiful place, no one has ever taken us up on the\nsuggestion of riding the tourist train. No one. Most want to hike or bike or\nkayak or snowmobile or ski or snowshoe or visit the shops or whatever, but no\none wants to ride the train. All the people I have ever asked about it have\neither never done it or done it once and offered the opinion that it might be\nworth doing once in the fall, if that. It simply is not the draw for the area\nthat having an extensive trail system would be. Sure, holes can be punched in\nany estimate offered up, but personal experience and simple logic tell me and\nshould tell most that removing the rails in favor of a trail system would be\nmuch more beneficial to the economy and them personally than a rarely used\ntrain.| <urn:uuid:4528edee-af7f-4396-9ec7-2554e52b626c>| CC-MAIN-2016-26|\nhttp://adirondackdailyenterprise.com/page/content.detail/id/538868/Say-no-to-\nrail-snowmobiling--yes-to-trail.html?nav=5005| 2016-06-24T20:25:05Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-26/segments/1466783391519.0/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20160624154951-00000-ip-10-164-35-72.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.957284|\n463  \nExplore sex dating, meet swingers, find local sex near you on the best online\nadult dating site on the web.

The first step to\nprotect your family is to install parental control software on your computer.\nSome of the best-known and respected parental control software packages are\nCyberPatrol, Net Nanny and Safety Surf. Also, some ISPs (Internet Service\nProviders, the companies that let your modem connect to the Internet) provide\ncontent filtering as part of their basic service. Check with your ISP to see\nif this is an option they offer. Parental control software works by blocking\naccess to specific websites and online content. In most cases, when you buy\nthe software it already contains a large list of sites that are inappropriate\nfor children. You can then update the software through the manufacturer's\nwebsite or, in some cases, the software will update itself. Another way\nfiltering software works is to block sites based on key words, such as \"sex.\"\nHowever, filtering software doesn't have to just block access to adult-\noriented material. You can configure the software to filter for topics such as\ntobacco, drugs and drug culture, alcohol, violence and racism. Since there\nmight be only one computer in your household, and you might be using the same\ncomputer as the children, you can set up the system to filter content during\ncertain hours, such as when you're at work and not around to supervise your\nchildren's web surfing. You can also setup the system to create a password,\nthat only you know, to override the restrictions. Some programs can also block\npersonal information, such as name, address and phone number, from being sent\nfrom your computer. This is an excellent way to protect children from\npotential online predators. Many programs allow you to create different levels\nof security and filtering based on the different ages of the computer's users.\nChildren can be given high security and heavy content filtering, but when you\nlog on to the machine, you can set it to not filter any content at all. One\nthing to remember is that by installing filtering software on your computer,\nyou might also restrict childrens' access to legitimate sites. This is\nespecially true if you rely on key words (such as \"sex\") for blocking. Certain\nkey words appear on legitimate news and information sites, so it's best to\nexperiment with different settings when configuring the filter controls.\nInstalling filtering software is no guarantee that children won't be exposed\nto some inappropriate material online. New websites pop up everyday, so it's\nimportant to keep your software up to date. Also, learn how your Internet\nbrowser software works so that you can check the sites your family has visited\n(this is the \"History\" feature, which displays a list of websites visited by\nthe web browser). Talking to your children about the possible dangers that\nexist on the Internet, and supervising their web surfing are still the best\nways to protect them. Some key general Internet-related safety points for your\nchildren: - Tell them to never give out personal information about themselves\nor the family to strangers they might meet online or in a chat room. - Remind\nthem that online it's easy for people to pretend to be someone else.

The data processing pipeline\nis optimized for LLM performance and ran on the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library, our large\nscale data processing library.\n\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb was originally meant to be a fully open replication of \ud83e\udd85 RefinedWeb,\nwith a release of the full dataset under the ODC-By 1.0 license. However, by\ncarefully adding additional filtering steps, we managed to push the\nperformance of \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb well above that of the original \ud83e\udd85 RefinedWeb, and\nmodels trained on our dataset also outperform models trained on other commonly\nused high quality web datasets (like C4, Dolma-v1.6, The Pile, SlimPajama) on\nour aggregate group of benchmark tasks.\n\nThat said, we think there is still room for additional filtering and\nimprovement and intend to continue exploring how to improve the dataset\nquality in coming versions of \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb.\n\n## What is being released?\n\nAlong with the dataset, which includes all CommonCrawl dumps since 2013, we\nalso share all the code needed to fully reproduce our processing setup using\nthe \ud83c\udfed datatrove library here. To enable full replication of our results, we\nhave also published the small ablation models we have trained using nanotron\nto validate the dataset and compare it with other reference datasets. You will\nfind them here, with checkpoints every 1000 steps. We have also published our\nevaluation results here.\n\nYou will find details on the different processing decisions we took and some\ninteresting explorations of deduplication methods and differences between\nCommonCrawl dumps in our technical report to be published in the coming days.\n\n## How to download and use \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\n\nYou can load the full dataset or a specific crawl/dump (see

1.8B parameters models on 27 billion tokens. To compare \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\nwith other datasets, we also trained one of these 1.8B models per target\ndataset, on 350 billion tokens sampled from it (or the entire dataset when its\nsize was < 350 billion tokens).\n\n### Hyper-parameters for ablation models\n\nThe detailed configurations for training the 1.8B parameters ablation model\ncan be found here (link will be added soon).\n\n### Ablation evaluation benchmarks\n\nTo conduct the ablations for each of our dataset filtering choices, we\nselected a set of benchmarks which we identified as \u201chigh-signal\u201d benchmarks.\nThese benchmarks were selected according to the following criteria:\n\n  * small variance between runs trained on different samplings of the same dataset\n  * performance increasing monotically during training (or close)\n  * separation between runs on datasets of known quality (C4, The Pile, RedPajama) higher than the variance between runs with various modeling/data seeds\n\nWe used the following list of benchmark for our ablation runs:\n\n  * commonsense_qa (acc_norm)\n  * hellaswag (acc/acc_norm)\n  * openbookqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * piqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * siqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * winogrande (acc/acc_norm)\n  * sciq (acc/acc_norm)\n  * arc (acc/acc_norm)\n  * mmlu (acc/acc_norm)\n\nTo compare runs we consider an aggregate score, the average of the scores for\nthese tasks.\n\nThe prompts for all these benchmarks are formatted in order to compute and\ncompare the log-likelihood of the full answers for each multiple choice\nquestion. All the implementation details for the benchmarks are available in\nlighteval here (link to be added soon).\n\n### Comparison with other datasets\n\nWe compared \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with the following datasets:\n\n  * RefinedWeb\n  * C4\n  * Dolma v1.6 (the CommonCrawl part)\n  * The Pile\n  * SlimPajama\n\nYou will find these models on this collection. We have uploaded checkpoints at\nevery 1000 training steps. You will also find our full evaluation results\nhere.\n\nNote: The plot is smoothed by averaging 5k steps in a rolling window.\n\n# Dataset card for \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\n\n### Dataset Summary\n\nThis dataset was created by processing 95 CommonCrawl dumps comprising web\ndata crawled from the summer of 2013 to March of 2024. \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb includes a\nvariety of domains and topics in English and is primarily intended to be used\nas a research artifact on public data in the context of pretraining dataset\nfor large language models. The CommonCrawl data was carefully processed,\nfiltered and deduplicated with the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library, resulting in the\nlargest publicly available clean LLM pretraining dataset, counting around 15\ntrillion tokens (gpt2 tokenizer).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe following is an example sample from the dataset. It is part of the CC-\nMAIN-2021-43 and was crawled on 2021-10-15T21:20:12Z.\n\n    \n    \n    { \"text\": \"This is basically a peanut flavoured cream thickened with egg yolks and then set into a ramekin on top of some jam. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea.

If you would like to only use\nthe data from a particular CommonCrawl dump, you can use the dump name as a\nsubset. You will find the full list of available dumps on the table above.\nFrom experiments we have run, not all dumps give the same performance. For\nrelatively small trainings (<400 billion tokens) we recommend using the recent\nCC-MAIN-2023-50 and CC-MAIN-2024-10. We will share more details about these\nexperiments on our future technical report.\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n\nWhile multiple open-weights models have regularly been released in recent\nmonths, these releases often do not include the model's training data. With \ud83c\udf77\nFineWeb we aim to provide the open source community with a very large clean\npretraining dataset that can be used to push the envelope on truly open source\nmodels (open source models where data is also released).\n\n### Source Data\n\nThe source data consists of webpages crawled by the CommonCrawl foundation\nover the 2013-2024 time period.\n\nWe then extracted the main page text from the html of each webpage, carefully\nfiltered each sample and deduplicated each individual CommonCrawl dump/crawl.\n\nWhile we originally intended to deduplicate the dataset as a whole, our\nablations showed that training on a sampling of individually deduplicated\ndumps/crawls outperformed training on a sampling of all the dumps/crawls\ndeduplicated together. We will discuss this further in our technical report.\n\n### Data processing steps\n\nWe used the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library to process the data. You can find a working\nscript that launches the entire processing pipeline here.\n\nThe data processing pipeline consists of:\n\n  1. Url Filtering, removing documents originating from Malicious and NSFW websites, using both block-list as well as subwords detection\n  2. Trafilatura text extraction on the raw HTML from CommonCrawl\u2019s warc files\n  3. FastText LanguageFilter, removing any document with en language score lower than 0.65\n  4. Quality filtering\n\n    1. Gopher Repetition / Quality\n    2. C4 Quality filters except terminal_punct rule\n    3. FineWeb custom filters, consisting of heuristics for removing list-like documents, documents with repeated lines and documents with likely wrong line formatting.\n  5. MinHash deduplication ****with each crawl deduplicated individually (5-grams, 14x8 hash functions)\n  6. PII Formatting to anonymize email and public IP addresses\n\n### Annotations\n\nWe augment the original samples with the language, language_score and\ntoken_count annotations. The language related annotations are automatically\ngenerated by our language filter. token_count is generated by applying the\ngpt2 tokenizer to the text column.\n\n### Personal and Sensitive Information\n\nWe anonymize email addresses and public IP addresses.\n\nFor emails, we apply a regex pattern and replace any occurrence of an email\naddress with either email@example.com or firstname.lastname@example.org. For\nIP addresses, we also employ a regex pattern and then further filter to only\nanonymize IP addresses allocated for public networks. Matched IP addresses are\nthen replaced with one of the following randomly generated IP addresses, which\nat the time of dataset creation were not responding to ping requests:\n22.214.171.124, 126.96.36.199, 188.8.131.52, 184.108.40.206, 220.127.116.11,\nand 18.104.22.168. We decided against applying regex patterns for phone\nnumbers due to the high false positive rate.\n\nDespite our efforts, given that \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb is sourced from the internet at\nlarge, it is very likely that some personable identifiable information (PII)\nwill be present. If you find your own PII in \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb and would like it\nremoved, please fill out our PII removal form (available soon).\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Social Impact of Dataset\n\nWith the release of this dataset we aim to make model training more accessible\nto the machine learning community at large.\n\nWhile multiple open-weights models with strong performance have been publicly\nreleased in the past, more often than not these releases are not accompanied\nby the corresponding training dataset. This is unfortunate as the dataset\nspecificities and characteristics have been demonstrated to have a very large\nimpact and role in the performances of the models. As the creation of a high\nquality training dataset is a fundamental requirement to training an LLM\ncapable of excelling at downstream tasks, with \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb we (a) not only make\nthe dataset creation process more transparent, by sharing our entire\nprocessing setup including the codebase used, we also (b) help alleviate the\ncosts of dataset curation, both in time and in compute, for model creators by\npublicly releasing our dataset with the community.\n\n### Discussion of Biases\n\nEfforts were made to minimize the amount of NSFW and toxic content present in\nthe dataset by employing filtering on the URL level. However, there are still\na significant number of documents present in the final dataset that could be\nconsidered toxic or contain harmful content. As \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb was sourced from the\nweb as a whole, any harmful biases typically present in it may be reproduced\non our dataset.\n\nWe deliberately avoided using machine learning filtering methods that define\ntext quality based on the similarity to a \u201cgold\u201d source such as wikipedia or\ntoxicity classifiers as these methods have been known to disproportionately\nremove content in specific dialects and overclassify as toxic text related to\nspecific social identities, respectively.\n\n### Other Known Limitations\n\nAs a consequence of some of the filtering steps applied, it is likely that\ncode content is not prevalent in our dataset. If you are training a model that\nshould also perform code tasks, we recommend you use \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with a code\ndataset, such as The Stack v2. You should also probably consider complementing\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with specialized curated sources (such as Wikipedia, for example) as\nthey will likely have better formatting than the wikipedia content included in\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb (we did not tailor the processing to individual websites).\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nThe dataset is released under the Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-\nBy) v1.0 license.
