It\u2019s a question that way too many\nCybertruck owners are asking themselves these days. And a new video posted to\nYouTube appears to show the most grotesque answer to date.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla\u2019s Interns Reportedly Feeling the Wrath of Elon Musk\n\nElon Musk Is Dangerously Close to Losing The Tesla Hoe\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nThe video, uploaded on Sunday by YouTube user Joe Fay, starts by explaining\nthat viewers thought he was cheating in a previous video by not just letting\nthe frunk close properly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla\u2019s Interns Reportedly Feeling the Wrath of Elon Musk\n\nElon Musk Is Dangerously Close to Losing The Tesla Hoe\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\n\u201cIn my last video everybody kept saying that when the Tesla Cybertruck was\ncoming down on my finger that I pushed up to make it open up and sense my\nfinger but that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Fay explains.\n\n\u201cAnd to prove that wrong I\u2019m going to put my finger completely flat against\nthe Cybertruck this time. I\u2019m not going to hover it. I\u2019ll put it completely\nflat and see if it crushes my finger because everybody is asking,\u201d Fay\ncontinues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncredibly, the content creator even tries it out with a stick first, which\npromptly breaks in half.\n\n\u201cBut first I\u2019m going to test it out with this stick. This is exactly what I\u2019m\ngoing to do with my finger. I\u2019m going to put it right there and hopefully my\nfinger doesn\u2019t break like that but let\u2019s find out,\u201d Fay says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll let you watch the video for yourself to see what happens next.\n\nMY CYBERTRUCK BROKE MY FINGER...\n\nWell, that was exactly what you\u2019d expect to happen, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThese videos may have been funny at first, but watching someone literally\nbreak their finger in this perverse display of faith in Tesla or Cybertrucks\nor Elon Musk more broadly is getting pretty disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazingly, YouTuber Jeremy Judkins, one of the people who tried this in a\nviral video earlier and had the frunk close hard on his finger, told Business\nInsider that an engineer at Tesla told him he was doing it wrong. How?\nApparently rather than interpreting your tapping on the car as a plea for help\nas it crushes your bones, the Cybertruck thinks you want the door to close\nharder. Seriously.\n\nFrom Business Insider:\n\n> Judkins said that after the finger test, a lead cybertruck engineer at Tesla\n> said he did the video wrong.\n>\n> The engineer told him the frunk increases in pressure every single time it\n> closes and detects resistance, Judkins said. It\u2019s going to assume you want\n> to close the frunk and maybe something like a bag is getting in the way,\n> which would make it close harder.\n>\n> \u201cUsing this information, that means it closed on my finger harder than my\n> hand and way harder than my arm,\u201d the YouTuber wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you think that\u2019s bad, it gets even worse. Judkins tried a new\nexperiment with a bag, and it still closed in a horrific way.\n\n> Judkins said the algorithm should favor safety instead of a bag getting in\n> the way. But even when Judkins put a bag in the way of closing the frunk, it\n> still closed, which meant it didn\u2019t quite respond to resistance the way it\n> should have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGizmodo isn\u2019t aware of any videos showing a finger that\u2019s been severed while\ntrying this trick. At least not yet. It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time\nbefore someone completely chops off a finger.\n\nPlease don\u2019t do this with a Cybertruck. Other vehicles have sensors that\nrecognize something foreign like a human finger is in the way and doesn\u2019t\nactively try to harm you. It\u2019s not worth losing a digit while proving you\u2019re\nworthy of the Musk cult. But if you do decide this is how you\u2019d like to prove\nyour worth, make sure you upload it to YouTube so the world can see what a\ndumbass you are.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
