It\u2019s been 15 years since the\nApp Store was launched; while the generative AI revolution started merely 18\nmonths ago. Mobile is now dominated by a duopoly of two giants, administering\na collection of <100 apps that never seem to leave the charts (and a long tail\nthat doesn\u2019t matter much). This duopoly\u2019s only true opponents are world\ngovernments.\n\nThe brand new AI ecosystem, on the other hand, is in a state of utter chaos\nwith new startups, technologies, and papers launched every week. One\ngenerative AI startup looks to be in the lead one week, and a few weeks later,\ntheir entire approach is in crisis \u2014 just look at AI video, recently! New\napproaches like open source, new types of hardware, regulation, and much more\nthreaten to upend the stack rank every few quarters \u2014 isn\u2019t that existing!?\n\nEvery startup is building on top of an existing S-curve. Perhaps you\u2019re\nbuilding in mobile, which is near the tail end of the curve. Or perhaps you\u2019re\nworking on spatial computing, web3, AI, or something near the beginning. This\nwill color your product approach, how they take their startup to market, how\ninvestors think about funding in the sector, and so on.\n\nTHE \"IT WORKS\" FEATURE When startups are early to an S-curve, as we\u2019re seeing\nwith AI right now, the act of building a product is often hard, but the growth\ncan be easy. In the early days of the web, developers did not have the benefit\nof open source, cloud computing, high-level programming languages, and on. The\nsheer act of building something like eBay (something that we would now\nconsider relatively simple), was a miracle in itself. The most important\nfeature that a website needed to have was the \u201cIt Actually Works\u201d feature.\nThat is, the technology was difficult enough and the developer base small\nenough that delivering an actual working product was enough to attract users\nwithout much marketing or growth. You might know that today's AI landscape is\nperhaps not that different. You\u2019ve now seen new startups posting a demo video\nor some test output and immediately there are thousands of users on their\nwaitlist ready to try their product. In the age of social media, I think this\nhas been accelerated for AI products that generate visual output \u2014 whether\nvideo, photos, 3D assets or otherwise \u2014 because it\u2019s so easily shareable.\n\nIn the early days of mobile, it was often said that apps competed with\nboredom. Apps competed with waiting in line, sitting on the toilet, and all\nthe other boring bits of time we\u2019d rather be doing something else. But 15\nyears later, a new app has to compete with the most engaging experiences ever\nbuilt \u2014 whether that\u2019s an infinite stream of short videos, or an endless\nscroll of beautiful travel photos, or something else. As mobile hits the\nplateau of its S-curve, it\u2019s not enough to simply \u201cwork.\u201d In fact, mobile\napps, have to be very very different than anything that has come before it to\nhave a chance of success. Early S-curve products can fast follow and exercise\nSteve Jobs\u2019s famous quote \u201cgood artists copy, great artists steal.\u201d Late\nS-curve products have to contend with significantly higher user expectations\nof what constitutes a minimum viable product. Late S-curve startups are better\noff trying to create new categories, rather than fast-following, because at\nleast new product categories might invent a small minimum viable product.\n\nTHE NOVELTY EFFECT Novelty fuels early S-curve products. This desire for\nnovelty means that whenever there are major new features or upgrades to\nunderlying AI models, you see a rush of new users without much marketing\neffort. While all of this novelty drives high-level growth numbers, I will\nalso argue that in the early phase of an S-curve, there is both high growth\nand high churn. During this phase, growth is easy because of word-of-mouth\nfrom highly enthusiastic early adopters. However, I would warn you that\neventually low retention will catch up to even the fastest growing products as\nnovelty effects start to die down.\n\nNovelty effects kick in because, well, humans are kind of dopamine fiends.\nWhen we see an amazing AI-generated image for the first time, it\u2019s like\nWOWWOWOW \u2014 followed by sharing, commenting, and forwarding to friends. But do\nshow people a cool AI photo a few dozen times, and we get used to it. We need\neven more, to be entertained. Thus, sharing goes down, and so down overall\nengagement. Every product on an S-curve in a rapid ascent up the middle of the\nS, but as the plateau starts to hit, then the novelty effects start to unwind.\nAt some point, retention will be king, and only the most retentive products\nwill survive.\n\nInvestors focus on the early part of the S-curve because the first few years\nshould usher in big upticks simply by being in the market. It\u2019s easier to\ndeliver an \u201cit works\u201d feature than to compete in red oceans of established\nproducts, and founders can get new users, plenty of growth, while trading off\nthe fact it might be a big harder to build a v1. This is why venture capital\nmoney often pours into a new sector like AI, causing many startups to follow\nthe money and pivot into the category. Is this opportunistic? Yes. Is it\nsmart? Probably also yes. The best markets often have tons of competition, are\nhot and very dynamic, and this is often seen as a good thing. If you\u2019re in a\nmarket by yourself with no competition, then perhaps it\u2019s not that great of a\nmarket after all?\n\nTHE LATE S-CURVE The skills needed to succeed in a late S-curve market, in\ncontrast, are very different. And they translate to a different set of\ndynamics that investors will evaluate.\n\nThe product thesis has to be along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s radically different\u201d\nthan \u201cIt works.\u201d After 15 years the mobile apps market has had, literally,\nmillions of different forms of experimentation. Every photo app that people\ncould have imagined during this time has probably been tried. Radical new\ninnovations are needed, or at least innovations that are counter to dominant\nnarratives. (An example here is the \u201canti-Instagram thesis\u201d that products like\nBeReal have been able to ride lately)\n\nIf an older market no longer from a novelty effect, then growth will be slower\nand more efficient from day one. Often the growth channels that dominate at\nthis point, our saturated by establish players. For instance, this is true in\nmobile where mobile ads are saturated by gaming/travel/ecommerce companies.\nStartups often find it hard to compete in the saturated channels, and instead\nhave to discover novel ones which is difficult. Investors tend to seek\nefficient growth, rather than expecting, or seeing wildly exponential curves.\n\nWHEN DESIGN RULES This doesn't mean that late S-curve startups aren\u2019t\npossible, or that they can\u2019t be successful. This is where design-oriented\nteams can thrive. It's been noted that while Apple didn't invent the GUI\noperating system, the MP3 player, the laptop, the smartphone, they arrived at\nthe middle/end of the S-curve and often perfected the product. This is last-\nmover advantage, rather than first-mover. But it\u2019s a very different type of\nteam that does this versus the ones that create the first practical\ninstantiation of something.\n\nToday, founders find themselves at a crossroads. Those who have hard-earned\nsecrets in mobile apps will still find opportunities to use those secrets, but\nneed to be mindful of the stage of S-curve they reside. They will have to be\neven more clever, do even more what\u2019s new, in order to break out. And for\nthose who stand at the beginning of the AI revolution, it\u2019s easy to get\nstarted. But it\u2019s hard to ride the chaos and stay on top. And even harder when\nthe novelty inevitably stops, as only the best products will win.\n\nFinal thought - I leave you with a chart of many of the technologies that have\nemerged, ascended rapidly, and then slowed down over the past few years.\nYou'll notice that as modern communication/publishing/computing has taken\nhold, technology adoption is getting faster and faster. Get ready to ride the\nS-curve.\n\n### Subscribe to @andrewchen\n\nBy Andrew Chen \u00b7 Launched 8 days ago\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 General Partner @ a16z.
