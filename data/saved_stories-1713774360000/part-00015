Despite its short initial run (only three seasons), Star Trek became one\nof the most influential shows in the history of television. The show's\ndepiction of a racially-integrated, multinational crew of men and women\nworking together successfully, as well as its attention to contemporary social\nand political issues, pushed the boundaries of network television, earning\nStar Trek a dedicated fan base that lobbied for the franchise's continuation.\n\nIn the television show, the Enterprise traveled at speeds measured in\nmultiples of the speed of light using warp drives, a propulsion concept\nextrapolated from supersonic flight to imagine faster-than-light travel. The\nfictional ship grossed 190,000 tons, and measured 947 feet long and 417 feet\nin diameter. The saucer-shaped hull included 11 decks, and had a crew\ncomplement of 430.\n\nThe model's principal designer, Walter \"Matt\" Jefferies, created several\ndifferent ideas for the Enterprise's design to fit the requirements provided\nby Star Trek's creator Gene Roddenberry. To support the final design\nsuggestion, Jefferies also created a rough 4-inch balsa and cardboard\nprototype. A 33-inch \"pilot\" model mostly of solid wood was then built by\nmodel-maker Richard C. Datin under subcontract to the Howard Anderson Company.\nEnlarging the plans for that model resulted in the final 11-foot model shown\nhere. The Anderson Company again turned to Datin who contracted it out to\nProduction Model Shop of Burbank, California, with Datin supervising the\nconstruction while he did the detail work. The internal lights and nacelle end\ncap effects were added in 1965.\n\nParamount Studios donated the model to the Smithsonian's National Air and\nSpace Museum in 1974.\n\nDisplay Status\n\nThis object is on display in Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall at the National\nAir and Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nObject Details\n\nKey Accomplishment(s) Model Used to Film The Original 1960s TV Series Brief\nDescription This model of the fictional starship Enterprise was used in the\noriginal 1960s Star Trek TV show.
