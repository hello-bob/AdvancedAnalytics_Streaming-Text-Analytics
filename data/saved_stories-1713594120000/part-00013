Located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, it\nwas the transport hub of a region that became known as \u201cLittle Egypt\u201d because\nof its huge deltaic plains where farmers could grow anything.\n\nToday, however, the name is redolent of lost civilisations. To walk around is\na strange experience. Turreted Victorian houses gently crumble, being\nreclaimed by the weeds. What was once downtown (pictured) resembles an\nabandoned film set. Cairo has no petrol stations, no pharmacies and no\nhospitals. It has gone from six schools to two, both half-empty. \u201cWhen I was\ngrowing up in the 1970s, we had two grocery stores, we had two gas stations.\nYou know, a lot of businesses were still open,\u201d says Toya Wilson, who runs the\ncity\u2019s still operating and beautiful Victorian library. One modest grocery\nstore remains, but it is run at a loss by a charity and, when your\ncorrespondent visited, was deathly quiet, with many bare shelves.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get unlimited access to The Economist\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
