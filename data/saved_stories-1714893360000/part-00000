At 2.8 pounds, the 3010 was great for travel. But over\nthe years it lost the ability to charge its batteries and eventually died.\n\nI replaced the Toshiba in February of 2002 with an IBM X22. At 3.8 pounds, the\nX22 is lighter than the 701 (but heaver than the 3010). But it's nice to be\nback using the IBM trackpoint again. And the X22 has the nicest keyboard of\nany laptop I've used.\n\nOne last item, my laptops belong to the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory and so (obviously) I cannot sell them.\n\n### Which laptop to get?\n\nI was in the market for a laptop to take on the road and wanted something\nsmall. But since it was going to spend most of its life on the coffee table in\nmy living room, I wanted something with a nice keyboard. These factors make it\npretty obvious why I latched onto IBM's ThinkPad 701 sub-notebook series. In\nthe process getting and using the the Butterfly I picked some interesting\ninformation which I've tried to incorporated here.\n\n### Pro's and Con's\n\nHere's my take on the strengths and weaknesses of the Butterfly:\n\nPluses| Minuses  \n---|---  \n1.| Keyboard expands to 85 full sized keys| 1.| VGA display (only 640\u00d7480)  \n2.| Sub-notebook size and weight| 2.| Older technology batteries  \n3.| Swappable disk drives| 3.| Largest disk only 720 MB  \n4.| IrDA-compatible infrared transceiver| 4.| Modem speed only 14.4 Kbps  \n5.| Upgradable to 40MBs of memory| 5.| Fastest processor only 486 DX4/75  \n6.| Genuine Intel processor| 6.| Satan Inside  \n7.| It will run Unix| 7.| It comes with Windows pre-installed  \n  \n### Information from IBM\n\nHere's the main IBM page for the ThinkPad 701. It has the complete\nspecifications for the Butterfly series.\n\nIBM has an ftp area for mobiles. The main file of interest is for the\nButterfly is called IBM ThinkPad 701 Technical Information, Tips, and\nTechniques. Aside from listing the current versions of software and firmware\nit gives memory maps, IRQs, DMA assignments, etc. One other file worth\nmentioning is the version 3O BIOS upgrade document which describes how to\nupgrade your BIOS to the current release. This is something you should do\n(especially if you're planning on running Windows 95).\n\nThe Butterfly comes with a User's Guide. The IBM part number for this is\n25H4900.\n\n### Operating systems\n\nButterfly's come with PC DOS 6.3 and Microsoft Windows 3.11 preinstalled. The\n75 MHz models also come with OS/2 Warp. They will run Windows 95; this is one\nof the systems I regularly run on mine. I'm told it runs Windows NT.\n\nYou can also run Unix. I'm currently running FreeBsd and BSD/OS. I've also\nheard that some people are running Linux and NetBSD.\n\n### Software\n\nHere are some of my favorite software to run on the Butterfly. (And it's worth\nmentioning that Butterfly runs DOOM quite nicely!)\n\n### Networking\n\nOne of the first things you'll probably want is an ethernet adapter.\n\n### Traveling with the Butterfly\n\nThe whole point of getting a sub-notebook is to take it places. Here's some\ninformation that's useful when you travel with your Butterfly.\n\nYou might want to get a carrying case.\n\nAnother concern is security; you want to do what you can to keep some cretin\nfrom making off with your machine.\n\n### PCMCIA toys\n\nThe butterfly has the standard two type I/II PCMCIA slots. There are more\nslots in the optional DOCK. This means you can have fun with the many PCMCIA\ntoys that are available.\n\n### Peripherals\n\nThe MultiPort II port replicator allows access to a number of peripherals.\n\n### Not the first 701\n\nOne final note, the Butterfly is apparently not the first 701; according\nHarold Rogers' The History of Computing at Los Alamos, a vacuum tube based IBM\n701 was produced in 1952. Other sources indicate this was IBM's first\ncomputer.\n\n### The Butterfly is now a movie star\n\nThe Butterfly has a cameo in the Mission: Impossible movie. It's also in the\nGoldenEye movie.\n\n### Information from other sources\n\nHere are some links to other sources.\n\n### Maybe the last with a folding keyboard\n\nOne final note, the Butterfly has been discontinued.
