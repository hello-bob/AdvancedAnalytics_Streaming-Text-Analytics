Using an advanced metal 3D-printing technique, Qian\u2019s team has now\ncreated a new \u201cmetamaterial\u201d \u2014 a material with properties not seen in nature \u2014\nwith a lattice structure that distributes load stress more evenly.\n\nIn testing, their metamaterial, fabricated from a common titanium alloy,\nproved to be 50% stronger than the strongest alloy of similar density used in\naerospace.\n\n\u201cWe designed a hollow tubular lattice structure that has a thin band running\ninside it,\u201d said Qian. \u201cThese two elements together show strength and\nlightness never before seen together in nature. By effectively merging two\ncomplementary lattice structures to evenly distribute stress, we avoid the\nweak points where stress normally concentrates.\u201d\n\nRMIT\n\nAreas where stress concentrated in a previous design (left) can be seen in red\nand yellow. In the new structure (right), stress is more evenly distributed.\n\nMaking a metamaterial: To create their super strong metamaterial, the RMIT\nteam relied on a 3D printing technique called \u201claser powder bed fusion,\u201d which\nis very different from traditional 3D printing, where a material is extruded\nfrom a nozzle layer by layer.\n\nInstead, a layer of metal powder is spread over the base of the printer. A\nlaser is then used to melt the powder in the desired pattern. Another layer of\npowder is then added to the bed, and the process is repeated, with the newly\nmelted metal binding to the metal below it.\n\nLooking ahead: While this technique enabled the creation of the unique\nmetamaterial, it could also be a hurdle to getting it out of the lab and into\nreal-world applications \u2014 at least initially.\n\n\u201cTraditional manufacturing processes are not practical for the fabrication of\nthese intricate metal metamaterials, and not everyone has a laser powder bed\nfusion machine in their warehouse,\u201d said lead author Jordan Noronha.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the technology develops, it will become more accessible and the\nprinting process will become much faster, enabling a larger audience to\nimplement our high-strength multi-topology metamaterials in their components,\u201d\nhe continued.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!
