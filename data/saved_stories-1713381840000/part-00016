The emulator is called Bimmy, and it was developed by Tom Salvo.\n\nOn the App Store, Bimmy is described as a tool for testing and playing public\ndomain/\"homebrew\" games created for the NES, but the app allows you to load\nROMs for any NES games available for download online, such as Super Mario\nBros. and Donkey Kong. Nintendo released the NES game console in 1985, so some\nof these games are nearly 40 years old. On its website, Nintendo says\n\"downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal.\"\n\nThe release of Bimmy comes after Apple removed Game Boy emulator iGBA from the\nApp Store for ripping off another emulator known as GBA4iOS, which was\ndistributed outside the App Store. Apple said it had approved of iGBA's\nfunctionality prior to learning that the app was a knockoff, suggesting that\nemulators for older Nintendo game consoles are permitted on the App Store, and\nBimmy seems to be the first proof of that.\n\nApple updated its App Review Guidelines to permit retro game console emulators\nearlier this month. Apple says developers of emulators are \"responsible for\nall such software\" offered in the app, including compliance with \"all\napplicable laws.\"\n\nUpdate: In a post on the MacRumors Forums, the developer of Bimmy said they\ndecided to remove the app from the App Store. \"No one reached out to me\npressuring me to remove it,\" he said. \"But I'd rather not have the risk.\"\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 184 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nmukiex\n\n17 hours ago at 11:37 am\n\nMan I just need that DS emulator with iPad 'n Apple Pencil support.\n\nScore: 17 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nMac Fly (film)\n\n17 hours ago at 11:51 am\n\nWill disappear in 3 2 1\n\nScore: 12 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nPakaku\n\n17 hours ago at 12:06 pm\n\n> Nintendo sends C and D in 3..2...1....\n\nIf the app isn't actually supplying anything copyrighted (ROMs, BIOS files,\nkeys, etc.) or using copyrighted code, then Nintendo has nothing to stand on.\nIf Nintendo is worried about piracy, then they need to make it easier to buy\ntheir old copyrighted games.\n\nScore: 11 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nvipergts2207\n\n16 hours ago at 01:20 pm\n\n> Because these apps trivialise copyright infringement and intellectual\n> property theft.\n\nThese billion-dollar corporations should be thankful to have folks such as\nyourself around to make sure someone is there to stand up for them.
