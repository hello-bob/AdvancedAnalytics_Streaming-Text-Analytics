Now, scientists have discovered the\nfirst known fractal protein \u2013 and it seems to be an evolutionary accident.\n\nFractals are tricky to define, even for mathematicians, but generally speaking\nthey\u2019re geometric shapes that are made up of smaller structures that\nthemselves resemble the whole. In practice, that means that if you zoom in on\npart of a fractal, you\u2019ll see a similar structure \u2013 and if you zoom in on part\nof that part, you\u2019ll see a similar structure, and so on essentially into\ninfinity.\n\nMore Stories\n\nSpace\n\nDragonfly rotorcraft given green light for mission to Titan\n\nScience\n\nJunk food damages growing brains so severely it affects long-term memory\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nIn nature, fractal features appear in things like snowflakes, lightning bolts,\nand river networks. Molecules might seem like a prime place you\u2019d expect to\nfind them, since they can arrange themselves into all kinds of intriguing\nshapes, but among all the existing catalogs of molecules, there has never been\na regular fractal (those that match almost exactly across scales).\n\nBut now, scientists at Max Planck Institute and the Philipps University have\nfound the first regular molecular fractal. It\u2019s an enzyme used by a species of\ncyanobacteria to produce citrate, which was found to naturally assemble itself\ninto a specific fractal pattern called the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\n\nThe progression of a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle fractal pattern\n\nSaperaud\n\nBasically, start with a single equilateral triangle. Then punch out an\ninverted triangle from the center, so you have three smaller triangles that\nmake up one larger triangle, with a triangular void in the center (a symbol\nthat may look familiar to fans of The Legend of Zelda). Then punch out an\ninverted triangle from each of the smaller solid triangles, so you\u2019ve got\nthree of the second shape, or nine of the original shape, making up a larger\ntriangle. You could potentially keep doing this forever, with each smaller\ntriangle \u2013 and that\u2019s the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle fractal pattern.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled on this structure completely by accident and almost couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what we saw when we first took images of it using an electron\nmicroscope,\u201d said Franziska Sendker, first author of the study. \u201cThe protein\nmakes these beautiful triangles and as the fractal grows, we see these larger\nand larger triangular voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any\nprotein assembly we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d\n\nTo figure out how this protein takes on such an intriguing structure, the\nresearchers used electron microscopy to analyze it in more detail, and found\nthat its self-assembly wasn\u2019t symmetrical. Different protein chains were found\nto make slightly different interactions at various positions in the fractal,\nforming the striking structure.\n\nSo does this mathematical marvel serve a specific purpose in the bacterium\u2019s\nbiology? To find out, the team genetically altered the microbe so that the\nprotein didn\u2019t form the fractal structure, but the bacterium was still able to\nproduce citrate just fine.\n\nThis inspired the researchers to investigate another possibility: that this\nstructure is relatively easy to evolve, so it just happens by chance, and\ndoesn\u2019t need to have a specific purpose. They used an ancestral sequence\nreconstruction technique to trace back its possible evolution over millions of\nyears, then biochemically produced those ancient proteins.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, they found that the fractal structure appeared fairly\nquickly, after only a few mutations. But it was soon lost in other\ncyanobacteria lineages, until it remained only in the one species it was\nrecently found in.\n\n\u201cAlthough we can never be totally sure of the reasons why things happened in\nthe past, this particular case does have all the trappings of a seemingly\ncomplex biological structure that just popped into existence for no good\nreason at all because it was simply very easy to evolve,\u201d said Georg Hochberg,\nsenior author of the study.\n\nThat might not be a particularly satisfying explanation for people looking for\nmeaning in something that almost feels artificial, but on the plus side, it\ndoes suggest that there may be many more molecular fractals waiting to be\ndiscovered.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.\n\nSource: Max Planck Institute\n\n## Tags\n\nBiologyProteinMathematicsMax Planck InstituteEvolutionStructureBacteria\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nMichael Irving\n\nMichael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the\nweirder mysteries of the universe.
