Seven years later, it faces more problems than ever.\n\nBy Istvan Tarrosy and Zoltan Voros\n\nFebruary 03, 2023\n\nMexico Station in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nCredit: Istvan Tarrosy\n\nThis article is the fifth in a series dealing with rail and industrial park\ndevelopments by Chinese actors in Ethiopia, which began with our analyses of\nthe Addis Ababa Light Rail Train (AALRT) and the Addis-Djibouti railway in The\nDiplomat in 2018. Part 3 revisited the same two projects in 2019; Part 4\ndescribed our visit to Mekelle Industrial Park in 2020. This time, we\nrevisited the AALRT, got on board, and observed the current state of\ninfrastructure and service in Ethiopia\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Addis Ababa Light Rail Train (AALRT), sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first inner-\ncity tram project, was hailed as an exemplary infrastructure development in\n2015 and a ground-breaking step forward for Africa-China relations. Today, it\nfaces even more challenges than the ones we noted in 2018, when we first took\na ride.\n\nBetween our visits, numerous crises hit one of Africa\u2019s most progressively\ndeveloping economies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and several armed\nconflicts, the most devastating of which was the two-year-long war in Tigray.\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his government have been seeking to restructure\nEthiopia\u2019s debt to China, while also trying to convince other international\nlenders and donors to let Ethiopia use the money that had been earmarked for\nrepaying several of the country\u2019s loans to fund pandemic measures and other\ndevelopment-related projects. As reported by Business Day, last month, China\neven announced a partial cancellation of Ethiopia\u2019s debt.\n\nThe rail track of the AALRT stretches into the distance. Photo by Istvan\nTarrosy\n\nAmong the infrastructure development projects that needed substantial external\nfunding, both the light rail (tram) of Addis Ababa and the Addis-Djibouti\nrailway should be mentioned. In our first articles, we underlined the\nsignificant amount of loans from China Export Import Bank that, in the case of\nthe AALRT, secured enough funding for construction tp begin in December 2011.\n\nA critical review article by Bouraima et al. published in the Journal of\nTransport Geography, confirmed our view about the projects\u2019 insufficient\nfeasibility planning, which in the case of the AALRT resulted in a substantial\namount of money being needed for maintenance. As Bouraima et al. point out,\n\u201cpoor feasibility studies can contribute to cost and time overruns of mega\ninfrastructure and their subsequent operationalization challenges.\u201d In our\nfollow-up research we could record several of these challenges.\n\nThe once impressive-looking tram in Addis has been struggling with many\nproblems. In a report from May 2022, it was highlighted that substantial theft\nfurther decimated the electricity supply infrastructure, which was having\ndifficulty providing sufficient backing to the trams running already in 2018.\nAccording to one of our local respondents, a university lecturer in political\nscience, this reveals yet another dimension of the problem: As long as people\ndo not feel ownership over the infrastructure, they do not think that it is a\nsin when they steal \u201cfrom the government.\u201d The lecturer advocated for more\neducation and efforts to raise societal awareness.\n\nThe former grandeur of the AALRT \u2013 originally on par with many metropolises\naround the world \u2013 has rather quickly diminished, with broken chairs at\nstations, litter uncollected along the rail tracks, and substantial dirt on\nthe surface of the rail sheds.\n\nA broken bench at an AALRT station. Photo by Istvan Tarrosy\n\nWe noted in our first article on the tram that in the first 14 months of\noperation, the system \u2013 which was initially designed to move up to 60,000\npeople per hour \u2013 carried an average of 105,000\u2013110,000 daily passengers. We\nnoted the power troubles in 2018, which have since been joined by the theft\nand maintenance issues described above.\n\nDespite the fact that the AALRT began with 41 trains on both lines, we now\nknow that the vast majority of them are no longer in operation. According to a\nrecent paper, only 17 train vehicles remained on both routes by the beginning\nof 2020 (the Blue North\u2013South line had nine trains in operation, while the\nGreen East\u2013West line had eight trains). According to our weekday rush hour\ninvestigation, by the beginning of 2023, the situation is quite similar; a bit\nbetter on the Blue and worse on the Green line. The service interruptions\ncontinued in 2022 and 2023 with a further reduction in the number of cars,\nalthough the exact number of operating trains was never highlighted by the\nofficials. Daily ridership has fallen to 56,000.\n\nAn AALRT station from viewed from a distance. Photo by Istvan Tarrosy.\n\nAccording to Obsie et al., the average wait time on the Green line in 2020 was\n12 minutes, while the average wait time on the Blue line was 15 minutes.\nHowever, in January 2023, during rush hour, the average wait time on the Green\nline was 19 minutes, with only six trains operating on that line, marking a\nfurther decrease in the number of trains. The Blue line had 10 trains, with\none double train out of these, and the average wait time was 13 minutes,\naccording to our on-the-spot calculation.\n\nAll of these statistics indicate that only one additional train has improved\nwaiting times on the Blue line, and our experience indicates that overcrowding\nhas also decreased \u2013 far more so than on the Green line, where the loss of two\ntrains has increased waiting times by nearly 60 percent compared to 2020.\n\nA railcar engine at a station. Photo by Istvan Tarrosy\n\nAs we searched for the causes, we discovered two potential, likely\ninterconnected problems: car motor overloading problems and inadequate\nmaintenance. In the first instance, according to a study, the traction motors\nare supporting a mechanical load that exceeds the train\u2019s intended overload\ncapability. According to this paper, a single train can accommodate 254\npassengers at normal capacity and 317 passengers with seats and standing room\nonly when it is overloaded. However, the operational scenario showed that even\nunder the worst traffic conditions, one train may be transporting up to 60\nextra passengers.\n\nThe second problem is related to insufficient imports of spare parts and a\nlack of maintenance experts. Although we stated in our first article in 2018\nthat a complete knowledge transfer was planned in three to four years,\nmaintenance remained a problem even after this period. The situation pushed\nthe Ethiopian Railway Corporation in 2022 to extend contracts with two Chinese\nconsultants tasked with handling such work for the light-rail service. Thus,\nthe knowledge transfer is still not 100 percent complete. The Reporter, an\nEthiopian website, claims that $60 million is required for spare parts to fix\nthe vanished vehicles. The cost of the entire project was $475 million, so\nnearly 13 percent of that amount is required to keep the trams running just a\nfew years after the lines opened to the public.\n\nAs we observed last month, these compounding problems have resulted in single\ntrains not being able to accommodate all waiting passengers. It is not always\npossible for waiting passengers to squeeze into the car they want to take, and\nwe found passengers left outside of trains due to lack of space \u2013 even outside\nof rush hour.\n\nAt times, overcrowding makes it a real physical exercise to get on the tram.\nPhoto by Istvan Tarrosy\n\nThis modern technology has become like a minibus, which is still among the\nmost used means of transportation on a daily basis. A minibus (the matatu in\nKenya, or the dala dala in Tanzania), which is in many cases an old Toyota\nHiAce originally with 12 seats, often carries 18-20 people.\n\nThe bulk of passengers on the tram, like minibus passengers, must wait in long\nqueues for their turn to get on. As long as far fewer trains are in service\nthan the need and number of potential passengers, coupled with the fact that\nthe operating times are rather slow, in numerous instances \u2013 especially during\nrush hour \u2013 it is a tough physical exercise to squeeze into the train. We\nourselves were not successful in several cases.\n\nAfter boarding, it may take an hour or an hour-and-a-half to arrive at Ayat\njunction on a 10-kilometer-long road, as another of our local respondents, a\ntaxi driver, told us.\n\nAddis has taken several promising steps to organize traffic, including traffic\nlights, signs, and special lights displaying the time remaining to a color\nchange installed at many of the most congested traffic junctions. Near the\ntram stations such equipment has also been installed, but according to our\nobservations it often does not function. As we wrote in our first piece of the\nseries, sometimes it is life-threatening to cross the road to get to the\nstation. Visible zebra crossings and functioning traffic lights would help a\nlot.\n\nOverall, if the AALRT worked properly in terms of frequency and\npredictability, it would help local transportation needs. It is also much\ncheaper than any other means of transport. However, the fact that it is not\nworking properly leaves Addis not only with irritated passengers, but also\nwith a company that is losing money. In addition, the investment in this way\nplaces significant strain on urban transportation by taking space away from\nminibuses and taxis.\n\nAlready have an account? .\n\nYou have reached the limit of 4 free articles this month.\n\n## Get to the bottom of the story\n\nUnderstand the Asia-Pacific's biggest issues with a The Diplomat subscription.\n\nSubscribe Now View Subscription Options\n\nAlready have an account? .\n\nThis article is the fifth in a series dealing with rail and industrial park\ndevelopments by Chinese actors in Ethiopia, which began with our analyses of\nthe Addis Ababa Light Rail Train (AALRT) and the Addis-Djibouti railway in The\nDiplomat in 2018.
