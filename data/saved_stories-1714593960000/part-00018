Michael\nDwyer/AP hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nMichael Dwyer/AP\n\nEight daily newspapers sued OpenAI and Microsoft on Tuesday, alleging that the\nmaker of ChatGPT copied its work without permission or payment.\n\nMichael Dwyer/AP\n\nEight daily newspapers including The New York Daily News and The Chicago\nTribune sued OpenAI and Microsoft on Tuesday seeking to stop the tech\ncompanies' from using copyrighted articles to train artificial intelligence\nchatbots.\n\nThe copyright infringement suit claims the maker of ChatGPT copied stories\nfrom the newspapers \"with impunity,\" never seeking permission or payment for\nthe use of millions of articles that were used by the popular chatbot to\nrespond to questions.\n\nChatGPT, which relies on vast amount of data scraped from the internet, has\nbecome a direct competitor to the newspapers at a time when the news industry\nhas been pummeled by sinking advertising and subscription revenue, the lawsuit\nargues.\n\nIn addition, according to the suit, ChatGPT at times falsely attributes\nreporting to the newspapers in the answers it generates, tarnishing the\nreputation of the news outlets.\n\nFor instance, the suit cites an example in which ChatGPT states that The\nChicago Tribune has recommended an infant lounger the paper never endorsed. In\nfact, the product the chatbot mentions had been linked to infant deaths and\nrecalled.\n\nIn another example noted by the suit, ChatGPT was asked if smoking cures\nasthma, and the chatbot fabricated that The Denver Post published research\nindicating that smoking can be a cure for asthma. That assertion is obviously\nfalse, and the paper never published such research.\n\n\"This issue is not just a business problem for a handful of newspaper or the\nnewspaper industry at large,\" lawyers for the newspapers wrote in the suit.\n\"It is a critical issue for civil life in America.\"\n\nIn a statement, OpenAI said it takes \"great care\" to support news\norganizations in building its products.\n\n\"Along with our news partners, we see immense potential for AI tools like\nChatGPT to deepen publishers' relationships with readers and enhance the news\nexperience,\" said a spokesperson for OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's biggest financial backer, did not respond to a request for\ncomment.\n\nAttorneys for the newspapers, which are all owned by the New York investment\nfund Alden Global Capital, are asking for unspecified monetary damages and for\nthe practice of using its copyrighted work to end.\n\nThe suit additionally asks for the destruction of any AI models OpenAI uses\nthat incorporate works published by the newspapers \u2014 something AI experts have\nsaid would be nearly impossible to accomplish without completely rebuilding\nits models, an incredibly arduous and costly endeavor.\n\nRe-training an AI model could cost \"on the order of a hundred million dollars\nfor earlier models, and a billion or even multiple billions for future\nmodels,\" said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University\nand the author of the forthcoming book Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Make\nSure That AI Work For Us.\n\nMarcus said trying to filter out copyrighted material from a dataset can be\ncomplicated because even if there was a master list of all the URLs that had\nto be removed, sites like Reddit often include versions of copyrighted stories\nin posts, meaning there is \"no guarantee that you won't have scraped copies\nfrom elsewhere on the internet,\" Marcus added.\n\n### Newspapers' suit fuels legal showdown over AI and copyright law\n\nIt is the latest legal headache for OpenAI, which was hit with a similar\ncopyright infringement lawsuit from The New York Times last year.\n\nTogether, the legal challenges are set to be a high-stakes court battle\npitting one of the world's leading AI companies against news publishers,\nduking it out over an area of law that experts say is unresolved and murky.\n\nTo the newspaper publisher, the case appears straightforward: OpenAI, they\nclaim, stole its copyrighted material.\n\n\"This lawsuit is about how Microsoft and OpenAI are not entitled to use\ncopyrighted newspaper content to build their new trillion-dollar enterprises,\nwithout paying for that content,\" according to the suit.\n\nYet OpenAI has long claimed that its so-called \"large language models,\" hoover\nup vast amounts of data from all corners of the internet under what is known\nas the \"fair use\" doctrine.\n\nUnder that legal theory, copyrighted works can be used without permission if\ncertain criteria are met, like if it is substantially changed, or if the new\nwork does not compete with the original.\n\nThe \"fair use\" doctrine allows researchers, teachers, critics and others to\nrely on copyrighted works without permission and payment.\n\nYet legal scholars have said it is far from certain that the law is on the on\nthe side of AI companies, and it will likely take years of court battles and a\nlong appeals process to determine whether leading technology firms like OpenAI\nhave violated the law or not.\n\nOther publishers have chosen to take a more conciliatory path with the\ncompany. The Associated Press, German publisher Axel Springer, which owns\nPolitico and Business Insider, and, recently, The Financial Times, have all\nstruck licensing agreements with OpenAI to be paid for use of copyrighted\nmaterial.\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Research News\n\n#### How do you counter misinformation?
