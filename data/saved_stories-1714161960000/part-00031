Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.\n  * Live, immersive environment: Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!\n  * Amazing debugging experience: Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!\n  * Pharo is yours: Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people constantly contributing with frameworks and libraries.\n  * Fully open-source: Pharo full stack is released under MIT License and available on GitHub\n\n... more on the Pharo Features page.\n\nIn this iteration of Pharo, we continue working on our objectives of\nimprovement, clean-up and modularization. Also, we included a number of\nusability and speed improvements. A complete list of changes and improvements\nis available in our Changelog\n\nSome highlights of this amazing version:\n\n## Highlights\n\n### New breakpoint system\n\nThe debug point system is a breakpoint model that supersedes the previous\nimplementation of breakpoints and watchpoints. They are configurable,\ncomposable, and extensible. The traditional breakpoints remain available,\nincluding conditional breakpoints, one-time breakpoints, and object-centric\nbreakpoints. Additionally, there are new types of breakpoints, such as\nchained-breakpoints, which condition the activation of certain breakpoints on\nthe triggering of others (e.g., breakpoint B only activates if breakpoint A is\nhit first). Debug points also feature a dedicated browser and integration\noptions.\n\n### Tools\n\n  * Scalable fluid class syntax is now the default one\n  * Preparing the introduction of the Bloc graphic system by migrating more tools to Spec2 widgets\n  * Spec2 UI framework enhancements to support GTK 4\n  * Leaner version of the Metacello package manager\n  * More robust and strict mode for FFI\n\n### System\n\n  * New architecture for refactorings and domain specific transformations\n  * Code loading speed improvement\n  * Fast browsing via fully optimized package tags\n  * Optmized memory usage via optimized method protocols\n  * Compiler simplifications and improvements\n\n### Virtual machine\n\n  * Massive image support with permanent space\n  * String/ByteArray comparison speed up\n\n## Development Effort\n\nThis new version is the result of 1895 Pull Requests integrated just in the\nPharo repository. We have closed 865 issues and received contributions from\nmore than 70 different contributors. We have also a lot of work in the\nseparate projects that are included in each Pharo release:\n\n  * http://github.com/pharo-spec/NewTools\n  * http://github.com/pharo-spec/NewTools-DocumentBrowser\n  * http://github.com/pharo-spec/Spec\n  * http://github.com/pharo-vcs/Iceberg\n  * http://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3\n  * http://github.com/pillar-markup/Microdown\n  * http://github.com/pillar-markup/BeautifulComments\n  * http://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe always say Pharo is yours. It is yours because we made it for you, but most\nimportantly because it is made by the invaluable contributions of our great\ncommunity (yourself). A large community of people from all around the world\ncontributed to Pharo 12.0 by making pull requests, reporting bugs,\nparticipating in discussion threads, providing feedback, and a lot of helpful\ntasks in all our community channels. Thank you all for your contributions.\n\nThe Pharo Team\n\nDiscover Pharo: https://pharo.org/features\n\nTry Pharo: http://pharo.org/download\n\nLearn Pharo: http://pharo.org/documentation\n\n26 April 2024\n\n<\\-- [Pharo 12] will enter feature freeze on March 1st\n\nPharo is developed by an international community of open-source developers,\ncoordinated and maintained by the pharo consortium and receives essential\nsupport from Inria, RMOD, CNRS, UDL, Cristal and many others.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
