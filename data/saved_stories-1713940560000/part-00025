By uniting\nbackend and infrastructure code, Nitric improves dev productivity so you can\nbuild and ship cloud applications fast. Define your apps in terms of the\nresources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs,\nevent subscribers and scheduled jobs. Quickly build, test and then deploy to\nAWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base. Nitric also\ntakes a cloud-agnostic approach, maintaining consistency across various cloud\nplatforms, which is crucial to prevent vendor lock-in and ensure redundancy.\nThis platform abstraction can empower organizations to adapt your application\narchitectures without disrupting developer focus on innovation and your\ncompetitive edge.
