Apart from the usual\nanxieties, there was an overriding emotional factor. My wife, who had died a\nyear or so earlier, had for many years collected images of women reading:\nmainly drawings, prints and watercolours, plus one small painting. I was\nbrowsing through the online catalogue of a French sale when I was stopped by\ntwo pictures by Odilon Redon, both of his wife, Camille, reading: one was\npredominantly pale green, and showed her sitting in the middle distance in a\ngarden; the other, predominantly red and purple, showed her in close-up, with\nelongated features and eyes cast down on her book. Redon was famously\nuxorious, and painted Camille constantly over a period of thirty years. He\nonce wrote:\n\n> You can tell the nature of a man from his companion or his wife. Every woman\n> explains the man by whom she is loved, and vice versa \u2013 he explains her\n> character. It is rare for an observer not to find between them a host of\n> intimate and delicate connections. I believe that the greatest happiness\n> will always result from the greatest harmony.\n\nHe wrote this not as a doting husband, but nine years before he met Camille\nFalte. He said that no decision he took as an artist was as clear and\nunshadowed by doubt as when he said \u2018yes\u2019 on his wedding day.\n\nIt seemed clear to me that buying one of these two portraits would be a\nfitting way to complete my wife\u2019s collection. They were happily not as\ndesirable to art buyers and investors as, say, Redon\u2019s famous noirs or his\nflower paintings; so they were affordable. And more so, I assumed, by being of\na subject he had painted many times. But which of them did I want, and which\nwas I more likely to get? I preferred the purpley close-up, but would have\nbeen happy with the sylvan scene. And here the jeopardy of the auction room\nkicked in. The problem was that the pictures were coming up in the wrong\norder. If the purple one had come up first, and I was outbid, then I would\nhave settled for the green one. But the green one came up first. What if I\npassed on it, and was then outbid on the purple one? I didn\u2019t want, and\ncouldn\u2019t afford, both. What if I ended up with neither?\n\nI signed up to bid online, and logged in on the appointed day. There is a\nspecific excitement and nervousness about bidding in this way. There are three\ntypes of bidder: those online like me; those on the telephone; and those in\nthe room itself, some of whom you can see. Your rivals, your opponents, could\nbe anywhere in the world: you naturally imagine them lolling about in a\npenthouse suite in a different time zone, filthily rich and filthily intent on\nthwarting you. But there is also a chumminess about the process. Auctioneers\n(apart from taking \u2018chandelier bids\u2019 from non-existent people) like to\nflatter, cajole, joke, wheedle, even beg: it is all part of their professional\ntraining. Whatever they sell, and whatever you buy, they are pleased for you.\nAs Wilde put it, \u2018it is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially\nadmire all schools of art.\u2019 So he or she will congratulate \u2013 and if the price\nis really high, thank \u2013 the successful bidder. My favourite memory of what can\nbe a fraught business came when I was bidding online for some photographs in a\nprovincial French auction. At the moment I saw off the (very few) rival\nbidders, the auctioneer brought down his hammer, beamed into the camera,\npointed at me and cried: \u2018C\u2019est l\u2019Angleterre!\u2019\n\nThe lot numbers ticked down towards the two Redons, with my forefinger\nhovering over the mouse. The green one first: the auctioneer imagined some\nbids, looking around hopefully until he reached the picture\u2019s reserve, and\nafter a wait uttered the French equivalent of \u2018pass\u2019, indicating that the work\nhad gone unsold. In the brief moments that followed, I naturally decided that\nmy unseen rivals were saving their money for the better picture. Again, the\nurgent patter of theoretical bids, then the expectant pause just below the low\nestimate. Well, I thought, I may as well start things off, and clicked on the\n\u2018bid\u2019 button. And waited; and waited. But I was the sole bidder, and the\nauctioneer was duly grateful to me. I was filled with a prideful exultation:\nuxoriously, I had completed my wife\u2019s collection.\n\nI paid, arranged shipment and awaited the arrival of Mme Redon. When she\nturned up, I received an unpleasant surprise, which made me think about the\nway we look at images of art, and what the brain does with them. I had seen\nthe picture in an online catalogue, its size there at most about three inches\nby two. It had not been held up and shown to bidders in the room and online\nduring the sale. I had imagined it as being a taut, concentrated picture of\nabout ten or twelve inches by six or eight. Of course, the actual dimensions\nwere printed in the catalogue, but I had paid them no attention because I knew\nthe picture\u2019s size, its exact, ideal size, without checking: it was a size\nwhich fitted in with the rest of my wife\u2019s collection. And then the parcel\narrived, and to my dismay I saw that it was larger, quite a bit larger, than I\nhad presumed. I left it wrapped for several days. And when I finally opened\nit, I was shocked. Twenty inches by sixteen: almost double my top assumption.\nThis was wrong in two ways: the image was too big, too loose, too\nimpressionistic. And adding this biggish painting to a collection of on the\nwhole smallish images felt bossy. I didn\u2019t like it, and my hoped-for coup had\nturned out a failure because of my own stupidity. I hung it on the wall with\nsome reluctance.\n\nBuying a work of art is often an instinctual business: you see it, you like\nit, it speaks to you and you may or may not think about its \u2018true\u2019 worth, as\nopposed to its worth to you. No wonder the rich have art advisers to guide and\nreassure them, not only that they have made an excellent purchase (and the\nadviser an excellent commission) but that, even if the collector subsequently\ngoes off the work, it will still have retained, if not increased, its value.\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t have any such back-up. And I decided, instinctively,\nthat Redon had painted his wife the wrong size. It would have been much better\nif he had painted her half or a third smaller, which I knew to be perfect.\nHowever \u2013 and fortunately \u2013 over a period of time, I realised the absurdity,\nif not borderline insanity, of the belief that I knew better than Redon how he\nshould have painted his own wife. And over the coming weeks I began to look at\nthe picture for itself. Mme Redon was sitting in a background swirl of\ncolours: old gold, brown, magenta, blue. Beneath her grave lectorial face was\na sharply white jabot, itself the centre of the picture around which the\ncolours played. These were sombre: Redon was concentrating unfrivolously on\nhis wife just as she was concentrating on her book. And then, suddenly, I saw\nwhere he had signed his homage: in tiny capital letters on one of her fingers\nwhich grasped the book. It was almost a secret signature. Somehow, this\nclinched things, and in half-embarrassed conclusion I agreed that the painter,\nand the husband, knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nThis falsifying of expectation hadn\u2019t happened to me before (except, of\ncourse, in the general area of life). It made me reflect on the distorting\ndistance that can invade between image and reality; between what we think we\nsee, or hope to see, and what is really there; also, more widely, on how the\nreproduced image can hamper the way we look at art. And this image of a wife\nmade me think of all those ambassadors who travelled to kneel before foreign\nkings bearing a miniature portrait of some princess of the realm whose parents\nintended her for marriage abroad. What instructions might have been given to\nthe painter in these diplomatic sales pitches (make her look modest,\nconcentrate on the eyes, minimise the squirrel chin, highlight the expensive\njewellery)? How might the king assess his putative bride on the basis of a few\nsquare inches of paint? Further, how pleased or disappointed might he be when\nhis princess finally arrived and he saw her in the flesh? Were some of them\nsent back, like unwanted Amazon goods?\n\nMore common than the falsifying effect of anticipation is the falsifying of\nmemory. Thirty or so years ago, I spent a semester teaching at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. On its campus is the Baltimore Museum of Art, which I used to\nvisit about once a week. Among the many Matisses and Picassos was a small\npainting by an artist whose name and work were unfamiliar. F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s\nThe Lie is an intense scene of sexual or emotional betrayal in burning shades\nof red and black, yellow and brown. It is forceful yet enigmatic, and stayed\nwith me powerfully. About ten years later, I saw it again, this time in its\nnative Switzerland, in a retrospective of Vallotton\u2019s work. I was genuinely\nshocked by how small it was \u2013 indeed, the smallest picture in the whole show.\nIts radiance in my memory must have swelled it to about four times the size of\nwhat was now in front of me.\n\nWe think we remember works of art rather well; and probably assume that the\ngreater the work of art, and the more powerfully it strikes us, the more\naccurate our mental image of it must be. Maybe this is the case with\nprofessional art historians: I assume that they have \u2013 must have \u2013 a better\nvisual memory than amateur art-lovers, and perhaps even artists. After all,\nliterary critics in my experience have a better memory of books than most\nreaders, and better even than that of many writers (and they have certainly\nread more than the average novelist, whose gaps are sometimes shocking). But\nmemory is such a shifty and shifting process, constantly duping us. As far as\nit is possible to generalise, I think we misremember small pictures as being\nlarger than they are, and large pictures as smaller. Also, what we are\nremembering is not just the painting itself but its effect on us; and some\nparts of it will inevitably remain fresher than others. At least, in this age\nof mass colour reproduction, we can always check our memories \u2013 or so we\nbelieve. In my early decades, going to an art gallery abroad always culminated\nin a good deal of time spent at the postcard carousels; and over the years I\nhave accumulated a vast collection of cards which I can use to check my\nmemory. This \u2018check\u2019 can only be partial, however: there is the question of\nsize (how accurately can and do we scale the image up?) and also of colour\nfidelity. I have a friend who, when she first started looking at art, would\nnever buy a postcard of a painting she admired, for fear that the original\nwould be supplanted in her memory. This was properly high-minded, but in\npractice, she reported, her remembered images were still subject to normal\ndeterioration.\n\nPostcard-sending has become a greatly diminished pastime: museum gift shops\nearn more money from, and hence give more space to, art-themed scarves,\nchildren\u2019s games, van Gogh mugs and repro jewellery. The decline of the\npostcard is of course intimately linked to the rise of the iPhone, which\nallows you to make your own postcards and send them worldwide without a stamp.\nMost galleries allow their use \u2013 either on principle, or because of the\nimpossibility of policing the crowds who will take pictures willy-nilly;\nindeed, for some, the very point of a famous work of art is the selfie you\ntake in front of it. The Prado is the only major museum I\u2019ve been to where\ncamera use is strictly prohibited. There is also a seductive danger in the\nmobile phone shot: you can frame and reframe it as you like \u2013 and, more\nperniciously, you can alter the colours. I\u2019ve never seen anyone doing so while\nstanding next to what they have just photographed; but they do it afterwards,\nand are therefore adjusting the colours to what looks best to their eye.\nThough \u2013 who knows? \u2013 they might actually be pumping up the colours to\nsomething closer to what the artist originally produced before those centuries\nof fade.\n\n\u2018Las Meninas\u2019 by Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nRecently, I went to the Prado with the intention of spending as much time as I\ncould in front of Las Meninas, which I had seen twice before. It is positioned\nso that you can see it through an enfilade of rooms, and slowly approach,\ngradually discovering (or rediscovering) its enormous size. It\u2019s one of the\nlargest pictures Vel\u00e1zquez ever painted, and also one of the most\nextraordinary in its visual cunning: stunned spectators may easily find\nthemselves losing authority, becoming victims of the picture \u2013 the characters\non the canvas seem to be interrogating us, rather than the other way round\n(even the dog has a quizzing expression). This time, as I came to a halt at a\nproper distance, I had two immediate thoughts: though monumental, it wasn\u2019t\nquite as big as I remembered; while the colours of the figures weren\u2019t quite\nas bright as I remembered. The latter effect was doubtless due to having\n\u2018seen\u2019 it over the last decades only in reproduction, in books and magazines\nwhich inevitably tend to glorify the colours (and it may be that the very\nprocess of reproducing a detail dissociates that detail from the background\nand thus makes it feel brighter). These initial responses \u2013 they were hardly\nthe size of \u2018objections\u2019 \u2013 gave way first to the novelising this picture often\nsets off: what exactly is the story, who is more powerful than whom, who are\nthe figures in the tiny mirror in the far background, and so on. Such\nnovelising isn\u2019t of course confined to novelists; most people do it as a\nnormal reaction to seeing images of other people. Proust, when he went round\nan exhibition, had a habit of comparing the long-dead subjects of portraits to\ncontemporary figures in Parisian high society. The other thing I noted about\nLas Meninas was that my memory of it was entirely confined to the bottom half,\nwith its frieze of quizzical figures; what gets forgotten is the upper half of\nthe painting, which is an enormous expanse of \u2013 what, exactly? The dark\nceiling of the grand room, plus a couple of large, dark, indecipherable\npictures hung high up on the back wall. But why does it take up so much space,\nother than because that was what the room looked like? I hadn\u2019t seen such a\nlarge empty \u2013 or perhaps otiose \u2013 top half to a painting since the huge\nscumbly area above the action in Courbet\u2019s L\u2019Atelier. I left with my memory of\nthe picture readjusted \u2013 until the next time.\n\n\u2018View of Delft\u2019 by Vermeer.\n\nProust called Vermeer\u2019s View of Delft \u2018the most beautiful painting in the\nworld\u2019, and made it central to a key scene in \u00c0 la recherche. He first saw the\npicture in The Hague in 1902, and then again in 1921 in Paris, when it brought\non an attack of dizziness. Vermeer is Swann\u2019s favourite painter; and Proust\nsends the dying writer Bergotte to see the picture when it comes on loan from\nThe Hague. As Bergotte approaches it, he has an attack of dizziness, just like\nhis maker. He fixes his gaze on the piece of yellow wall \u2018like a child upon a\nyellow butterfly he wants to catch\u2019. It seems to teach him a lesson about his\nown writing, which has always been too spare. \u2018I should have applied several\nlayers of colour, made my sentences precious in themselves, like this little\nsection of wall.\u2019 Repeating to himself \u2018Little patch of yellow wall, with a\nsloping roof, little patch of yellow wall,\u2019 he sinks onto a sofa, then rolls\noff it and expires on the floor of the gallery. However, if you look at the\npicture in modern colour reproduction (which Proust was unable to do, relying\ninstead on memory, and perhaps notes) it is quite clear that there isn\u2019t a\n\u2018little patch of yellow wall\u2019. There is a little patch of orange wall,\nsurmounted by a sloping yellow roof. We don\u2019t think that Bergotte is confused,\nbecause he is in front of the picture at the time. The only explanation is the\ngap between the painting and Proust\u2019s memory of it.\n\nI am now in my late seventies, and though not obsessively valetudinarian, I\u2019m\naware that I might be looking for the last time at some of my favourite\npictures. At the end of last year, I was in Palermo, and made a pilgrimage\n(not an exaggeration) to the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia to see what I\nmight allow a future character in a book of mine to call \u2018the most beautiful\npainting in the world\u2019: Antonello da Messina\u2019s portrait of the Virgin\nAnnunciate. I had seen it once before, about 25 years ago, when I had no idea\nwhat to expect, having never knowingly seen a reproduction of this picture.\nRather as with the Vel\u00e1zquez, I remember advancing through several rooms, at\nthe end of which a blue vertical oblong was slowly becoming clearer until I\nstood in front of her. Though irreligious, I have a great attachment to images\nof the Annunciation, perhaps because (unlike with other Christian scenes and\nimages) it feels possible to project myself back to being a believer in front\nof this primal image of the moment the world changed for ever. I prefer\nearlier images, which seem \u2018purer\u2019 \u2013 the Fra Angelico in Florence\u2019s San Marco\nis a special favourite. Or those rustic carved wooden figures, made to stand\non either side of the altar, in which the Virgin is represented as an innocent\nvillage girl, about to enjoy the sort of upward mobility no one had ever\nimagined before.\n\n\u2018The Virgin Annunciate\u2019 by Antonello da Messina\n\nAntonello\u2019s Virgin is shown at half-length, seated, with a reading stand in\nfront of her. A rich blue veil covers her head and shoulders, while a deep\ncrimson undergarment peeps through at wrist and chest. Her expression is one\nof otherworldly calm: she is not surprised at this moment of her destiny;\nthough her hands tell a slightly different story. Her right hand is raised, as\nif to ward off the angel (not now! not yet!) while her left hand pulls\nprotectively at her shawl. There is a theory that the first two fingers of her\nright hand are meant to evoke the two fingers which the Angel often points at\nher in recognition, so that she stands for both Virgin and Angel at the same\ntime (which seems a theory too far to me). In front of her, Antonello has\nwittily given the angled wooden book-stand and the table on which it rests an\nattack of woodworm \u2013 which has strangely \u2018spread\u2019 to the real wooden frame of\nthe picture itself. And there she is, resting, awaiting, by herself, the only\nfigure in the painting. This is an exhilarating, revolutionary act by\nAntonello: she is staring towards us, so that we are standing where the Angel\nis standing; she is looking at us both as spectator and as bringer of\nastounding news. Are there any other Annunciations from which the Angel is\nmissing? I know of only one other, also by Antonello, in Munich, in which the\nVirgin \u2013 not the same model \u2013 is slightly more perturbed by the news as she\nlooks past our left shoulder at the arriving Angel. But it seems to be an\nimage unique to Antonello, apart from a jocose Richard Hamilton print of a\nlounging naked model receiving the news on a mobile phone.\n\nWhen I saw her again, she wasn\u2019t, as she had been, visible from afar. The\npicture, and the room, and our arrival into it, and the lighting, had all been\nredesigned by a local architect. You didn\u2019t see her until you crossed the\nthreshold, and then she was over to your right, in a new, specially designed\nglass case. The window facing her was lightly covered, but there was now a\nreflection to cope with. And then there was the size of her. As with my Odilon\nRedon, though in retrospect rather than prospect, she was somewhat larger than\nI had expected \u2013 probably because my memory was based more on multiple\nexaminations of the postcard, from which I had scaled her up, but not enough.\nHer veil was a paler blue than in my postcard\u2019s memory; while the sunlit\nsurface of her table, and the page of the book she was reading, were brighter.\nAlso, I decided I had been wrong about the \u2018witty\u2019 woodworm in the reading\nstand: it looked instead as if there had been real woodworm at work on the\npicture itself over the centuries \u2013 there seemed to be other small holes in\nthe Virgin\u2019s veil and elsewhere. Finally, the protective glass inevitably\nreduced the previous sense of intimacy between spectator and subject. It took\nsome minutes before I could reattach the present reality to the remembered\nimage. But, eventually, as with Las Meninas, I got there.\n\nThe Vel\u00e1zquez and the Antonello are examples of smallish misrememberings which\ndisconcert mainly because of a perhaps sentimental expectation that you will\nrecall great paintings more exactly than less great ones (and that their\ninstallation will remain unchanged). But my final example is weirder, and much\nmore undermining to one who largely believes that memory of objects \u2013 rather\nthan of people, their doings and motivations \u2013 is generally reliable. In 2002\nI visited the Villa Borghese in Rome, and saw for the first time Bernini\u2019s\nsculpture of Apollo and Daphne \u2013 \u2018the greatest sculpture I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019, I\nwrote in my notebook, followed by \u2018Eat your heart out, Canova.\u2019 It depicts the\nmoment when Apollo has just caught and, with his left hand, touched the\nfleeing Daphne, who in self-defence is turning into a laurel tree. Daphne\u2019s\nmouth is open in a scream of terror, while Apollo, far from appearing a vile\nrapist, is portrayed as suave and dashing \u2013 in both senses. (The back story is\none of malign manipulation by Cupid, who has shot Apollo with a gold-tipped\narrow, which kindles love, and Daphne with a lead-tipped one, which puts love\nto flight.) The two life-size figures are naked, apart from a flowing robe\nApollo has over one shoulder and across his loins. But Daphne is in the\nprocess of being reclothed by branches and leaves and tree trunk which will\nprotect her from Apollo. Her fingers are turning into leaves, her toes into\nroots, while bark is growing around her: there is even a fierce clump of\nfoliage protecting her from Apollo\u2019s advancing sexual parts. It is an\nastounding image of the moment when fierce movement is suddenly frozen in\nstop-time, in turn depicted in the stop-time of a marble statue. I have seen\nit twice since, and each time walked around it in simple (and complicated)\nawe.\n\n\u2018Apollo and Daphne\u2019 by Bernini.\n\nBut after that first time, something bizarre occurred. Without realising what\nwas happening, the statue, fixed in its being and nature since 1625, began to\nsprout fiercely in my memory. Barely a couple of years later, two friends were\ngoing to Rome, and I urged them to visit the Villa Borghese. There, I told\nthem, they would find Bernini\u2019s amazing sculpture, which fills an entire room.\nYou come on it from behind, with a figure of Apollo pursuing, and then see an\nentire spreading tree which prevents him from reaching Daphne, whom you don\u2019t\nnotice until you have walked all the way round the piece. This was how\nviolently I had misremembered the piece. How, and why? I have no explanation,\nexcept perhaps that, having decided it was the greatest sculpture I had ever\nseen, my brain endorsed that judgment by making it the biggest, most room-\nfilling sculpture imaginable. And while I increasingly believe that memory \u2013\neven if accurate \u2013 is much closer to an act of the imagination than one of\nstraight physiological recall, I am still shocked by what my own brain did to\nme. As I put it in a note on second viewing in 2005, \u2018the greatest sculpture\nin the world \u2013 whose greatness had played a literally expansionist trick on my\nmemory\u2019. Perhaps, I suggested, \u2018all the forest growth and wind and speed and\ndrama I imagined came entirely from its compact force.\u2019 At least, when I saw\nit for the third time a few months ago, it had no more tricks to play on me.\n\nI don\u2019t have answers to the many questions proposed above, only further\nquestions. Is there something in the art itself which makes us remember it\nmore, or less, clearly? For instance, memory rarely lets you down with\nHockney\u2019s work, clean and clear, memorable in the best way, and normally just\nthe same when revisited, whereas you might be hard put to describe from memory\na Rothko \u2013 though you might better recall its overall effect on you. Is it the\ncase that the greater the work of art the better you remember it? Clearly not,\nfrom my examples above.
