Major publishers assert\nthat digitizing books without appropriate licensing amounts to infringement\nbut IA counters that the practice is in the public interest. It also fits\ncopyright's ultimate purpose; to promote the broad public availability of\nliterature and other arts.\n\nThe non-profit Internet Archive (IA) aims to preserve digital history for\ngenerations to come.\n\nThe organization literally archives key parts of the Internet, copying older\nversions of websites to preserve them for future generations. This information\nbecomes more and more valuable as time passes by.\n\nIA has plenty of other archive projects too. For example, it operates a\nlibrary that offers a broad collection of digital media, including books,\nwhich patrons can borrow upon request.\n\nThousands of libraries have digital lending services but IA\u2019s approach is\ndifferent. The organization doesn\u2019t license authorized digital copies from\npublishers; instead, its books are scanned and digitized in-house. Each copy\ncan only be loaned to one person at a time, to mimic the lending attributes of\nphysical books.\n\n## Lawsuit and Appeal\n\nInternet Archive believes that its approach falls under fair use but\npublishers Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley, and Penguin Random House\ndisagree. They filed a lawsuit in 2020 equating IA\u2019s controlled digital\nlending operation to copyright infringement.\n\nEarlier this year a New York federal court concluded that the library is\nindeed liable for copyright infringement. The court\u2019s decision effectively put\nan end to IA\u2019s self-scanning library, at least for books from the publishers\nin suit.\n\nIA is not letting go without a fight and in December the non-profit filed its\nopening brief at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, hoping to reverse the\njudgment. Among other things, IA argued that its lending activity causes no\nfinancial harm is substantially different from the ebook licensing market.\n\nFearing a \u2018Napster moment\u2019 for books, the publishers rejected the notion that\noutsiders can run their own digitization programs and operate distribution\nplatforms, without rightsholders being involved. Rightsholders should remain\nin control of all digital copies to be monetized on their terms.\n\nBoth sides were supported by amicus briefs from interested parties, a clear\nindication of what\u2019s at stake in this dispute. Before the court case moves\nforward, however, IA replied to the publishers\u2019 Napster comments and other\ncritiques.\n\n## IA Points Out \u2018Critical Misconceptions\u2019\n\nThe Archive maintains that its lending service is fair use. The organization\npoints out that the publishers have several misconceptions about its service.\n\nIA points out that it doesn\u2019t lend out digital copies without limits. For each\nphysical book, it will only lend a single digitized copy at the time. This\nfixed \u201cowned-to-loaned ratio\u201d sets it apart from many of the copyright-\ninfringing services mentioned by the publishers..\n\n\u201cControlled digital lending is not equivalent to posting an ebook online for\nanyone to read or copy or to peer-to-peer file-sharing by companies like\nNapster. Neither practice is based on use of a library\u2019s lawfully acquired\nphysical copy, and neither ensures that only the one person entitled to borrow\nthe book (or recording) can access it at a time.\u201d\n\nIA further notes that it has no profit motive, which differs from companies\nthat resell digital copies without permission. In addition, the enormous work\nthat goes into digitizing the books makes it hard for others to do the same,\nso fears of a flood of similar services are overblown.\n\n\u201c[B]ecause of the huge investment required to operate a legally compliant\ncontrolled lending system and the controls defining the practice, finding fair\nuse here would not trigger any of the doomsday consequences for rightsholders\nthat Publishers and their amici claim to fear,\u201d IA writes.\n\n## Libraries Have Broad Missions\n\nThe brief goes on to counter the publishers\u2019 \u201ccramped\u201d view of what libraries\nare for. Libraries are not just outfits that lend physical books to people\nnearby; their missions are much broader.\n\nIA says that libraries make books available to a broad public, no matter their\nsocial status or location. They also preserve books for future generations and\nensure that readers can enjoy books without giving up their privacy.\n\n\u201cLibraries provide readers more egalitarian access to a wider range of books,\novercoming socioeconomic and geographic barriers by sharing resources with\nother libraries through interlibrary loans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also build permanent collections to preserve books, including older\neditions, for future generations. And they protect reader privacy, preventing\ndisclosure of patron records that could chill access to information,\u201d IA adds.\n\nIA\u2019s lending service advances this mission and was launched, in part, because\nthe current ebook licensing schemes are seen as too restrictive.\n\n## A \u201cCopyright\u201d Balancing Act\n\nThe parties broadly agree on what the lending program entails and how it\noperates from a technical perspective. However, it\u2019s the purpose and\nconsequences that mostly determine whether a service is \u2018fair use\u2019, and here\nthey have diametrically opposing views.\n\nThe publishers have argued that IA offers digital copies of their books\nwithout permission, which directly competes with its legal licensing business.\n\nIA, in turn, doesn\u2019t deny that copyrights play a role but stresses that its\ncontrolled lending is fair use. The reply highlights several arguments to make\nthis point and concludes that the scale clearly tips in its favor.\n\nThe reply brief notes that the lower court didn\u2019t properly balance the\ninterests required by copyright law, largely overlooking the benefits the\nservice has to the public at large, while strongly focusing on the financial\naspect of copyright instead.\n\n\u201c[The District Court] decision barely mentions copyright\u2019s ultimate purpose of\n\u2018promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other\narts\u2019. Publishers do not deny that IA\u2019s use serves this purpose; instead, they\nask the Court to ignore that service and focus instead on copyright\u2019s\nfinancial incentives for creativity.\u201d\n\nIA cites the Warhol Supreme Court case which made clear that fair use is a\nbalancing act between the interests of the public and rightsholders. In this\ncase, it believes that the balance favors its lending service.\n\n\u201cCreative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must\nultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of\nliterature, music, and the other arts. The district court\u2019s failure to\nconsider the latter contravenes decades of precedent recognizing that rewards\nare a secondary consideration, while promoting availability is primary,\u201d IA\ninforms the court.\n\n\u201cHere, the record shows that the balancing act between these purposes is\nbetter served by allowing the use than by preventing it,\u201d IA concludes.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of the Internet Archive\u2019s reply brief, submitted at the Second Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, is available here (pdf)\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * IA\n  * internet archive\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Publishers Secure Widespread Support in Landmark Copyright Battle With\nInternet Archive\n\n  * March 25, 2024, 21:20 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Publishers Cite Napster and AI Training Threats in Legal Battle with the\nInternet Archive\n\n  * March 18, 2024, 11:53 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Record Labels: \u2018Hisses & Crackles\u2019 Are No License to Copy & Digitize Old\nRecords\n\n  * February 22, 2024, 22:37 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nU.S. House Passes Copyright \u201cSmall Claims\u201d Bill with Overwhelming Majority\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nHollywood Wins Pirate Site Blocking Expansion in Australia\n\nU.S. House Passes Copyright \u201cSmall Claims\u201d Bill with Overwhelming Majority\n\nUK Considers Throwing Persistent Internet Pirates in Jail\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14963\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
