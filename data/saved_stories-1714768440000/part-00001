It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots\napart. With the new API, a significant number of valid human users will pass\nthe reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA comes in\nthe form of a widget that you can add to your online forms to check if the\nuser is human or not. It works by presenting users with a challenge, such as\nidentifying all images with cars or traffic lights. By solving this challenge,\nthe user proves they are not a bot but a human.\n\n## The type of reCAPTCHA#\n\n  * reCAPTCHA v2 (also available as reCAPTCHA v2 Enterprise): This version asks users to perform a task, like selecting all images with cars or traffic lights, to prove they're human. There are two types of reCAPTCHA v2: \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox and Invisible reCAPTCHA badge. The first one requires the user to check a box, while the second one can decide on its own whether a user is a bot or not, and only in suspicious cases will it require additional confirmation.\n\n  * reCAPTCHA v3 (also available as reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise): This version returns a score based on the interactions with the website, allowing the website owner to decide what to do depending on the score. It doesn't interrupt the user flow because it doesn't require user interaction like v2 does. It's a more advanced and user-friendly system, but it requires more decision-making from the site owner.\n\n  * reCAPTCHA v3 (also available as reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise): This is designed specifically for mobile apps. It's essentially a version of reCAPTCHA v2 or v3 that's been optimized for mobile interfaces. It helps protect your app from spam and other abusive actions.\n\n## Bypass reCAPTCHA python api guide#\n\n1.sample code for solve recaptcha v2 with python\n\n    \n    \n    from nextcaptcha import NextCaptchaAPI api = NextCaptchaAPI(client_key=\"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY\") result = api.recaptchav2(website_url=\"https://example.com\", website_key=\"SITE_KEY\")\n\n2.sample code for solve recaptcha v2 enterprise with python\n\n    \n    \n    from nextcaptcha import NextCaptchaAPI api = NextCaptchaAPI(client_key=\"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY\") result = api.recaptchav2(website_url=\"https://example.com\", website_key=\"SITE_KEY\")\n\n3.sample code for solve recaptcha v3 enterprise with python\n\n    \n    \n    from nextcaptcha import NextCaptchaAPI api = NextCaptchaAPI(client_key=\"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY\") result = api.recaptchav2(website_url=\"https://example.com\", website_key=\"SITE_KEY\")\n\n4.sample code for solve recaptcha mobile with python\n\n    \n    \n    from nextcaptcha import NextCaptchaAPI api = NextCaptchaAPI(client_key=\"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY\") result = api.recaptchav2(website_url=\"https://example.com\", website_key=\"SITE_KEY\")\n\n## Conclusion#\n\nFor successful data retrieval, you need a powerful tool to rely completely on\nin order to handle CAPTCHA.
