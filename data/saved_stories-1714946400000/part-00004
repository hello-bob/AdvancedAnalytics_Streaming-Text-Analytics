It describes how energy\nefficiency gains can often lead to more energy usage rather than less.\n\nThis was something I'd often wondered about, and I'm very glad to now have a\nname for the thing.\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons\n\nJevons wrote: \"It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use\nof fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the\ntruth.\"\n\nHe was writing about coal consumption after the invention of the Watt steam\nengine. But once you know about his paradox you can see the effect everywhere.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * improving road network efficiency leads to more driving, not less congestion\n  * increasing crop yields results in more crop production, not less land usage\n  * building a reservoir leads to more water consumption, not less water scarcity\n  * improving data centre efficiency leads to more data centres not less energy usage\n\nThe effect isn't guaranteed but seems relatively common, especially in\nscenarios where there is latent, unmet demand for a resource.\n\nIn each case, a resource gets cheaper or more efficient, and we use that as an\nopportunity to consume more of it, rather than save money or conserve it.\n\nTo take the car example: adding a lane to a highway will reduce congestion\ninitially. But it'll also make driving a more effective option in comparison\nto public transport.\n\nPeople will then switch to driving, eventually bringing congestion back to\nit's former levels, or higher even.\n\nOnly now there are far more cars on the road. There's a kind of ratcheting\neffect with Jevons where we become ever more dependent on technology. It's\nhard to go back.\n\n## The automation myth #\n\nAnyway, all this got me thinking about a phrase I've heard many variants of\nduring my time in the public sector. It goes something like:\n\n\"If we do X, it'll free people up to do more valuable or meaningful work\"\n\nWhere X is some kind of efficiency gain produced by digital transformation,\nAI, automation or similar (we say it more often about other people's jobs than\nour own).\n\nI've been guilty of thinking it myself. I recently prototyped a tool for\ncoverting PDF forms into web forms with these kinds of efficiency gains in\nmind.\n\nBut how often does people's time actually get freed up? Could this be another\nJevons-like situation?\n\nIt's true that if we reduce how long it takes to do this kind of work, people\nwould in theory be able switch to doing something more meaningful (or work\nless intensively).\n\nBut other things are also possible: we might decide to pay those people less\nmoney, hire them less often or just give them loads more of the low value work\nto do.\n\nIn a world driven by cost savings and profit margins, which outcome is more\nlikely?\n\nAs a side note - I think we sometimes downplay these 'low value' activities,\nbecause they appear repetitive or trivial.\n\nBut the real value is what's happening in the minds of the people involved -\nthe ideas they're having, patterns they're spotting, decisions they're coming\nto.\n\n## Tech won't save us #\n\nUltimately it's not really about the technology, it's about incentives, and a\nmismatch of values.\n\nSome organisations prioritise making or saving money over improving the\nenvironment or delivering better services.\n\nSo, if we really want to address this, we shouldn't expect the solution to be\ntechnical.\n\nTo avoid the Jevons paradox, technological efficiency gains would need to be\npaired with the right governance, culture, funding, standards etc.\n\n\"Good, fast, cheap - pick two\" they say. Let's automate to make things better,\nnot just faster and cheaper.\n\n## It's complicated #\n\nOne more example. AI and automation is often promoted as a way of handling\ncomplexity. But handling complexity isn't the same as reducing it.\n\nIn fact, by getting better at handling complexity we're increasing our\ntolerance for it. And if we become more tolerant of it we're likely to see it\ngrow, not shrink.\n\nAgain, there's a ratcheting effect as the world becomes more and more complex,\nand harder for people without access to AI to navigate (Rachel Coldicott and\nothers have been making this point for a while now).\n\nBut something that can genuinely reduce complexity, rather than just mask it,\nis good design.\n\nGood, user-centred design is how we can deliver services with just enough\ncomplexity - enough to model the rich diversity of people's circumstances, but\nno more.\n\nUpdate: Turns out Benedict Evans has also written a much more detailed and\nwell informed thing on the same subject. You should go read that - it's very\ngood.\n\nTim Paul\n\n", "frontpage": false}
