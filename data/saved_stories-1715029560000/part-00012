I was doing triathlons\nat the time, and the swim was my weakest leg. The team I joined divided the\npool into four lanes: A (fastest swimmers), B (next fastest), C (next fastest)\nand D (slowest.) Workouts were organized accordingly; faster swimmers were\nassigned more and/or faster laps.\n\nI came to the team as a very strong swimmer compared to the average person.\nThese were not average people. I was nowhere near the level of these guys.\n(They were almost all men, though every so often there would be one other\nwoman at practice.) So I started in the D lane and got lots of remedial stroke\ncorrection. Everyone around me was very kind to me, I slowly improved, and\nfinally made it into the C lane. The people whom I had swam next to for months\nwelcomed me warmly.\n\nI noticed that when I swam next to the B lane swimmers, they were not nearly\nas kind and friendly as the C lane swimmers had been when they were my next-\nlane neighbours. The A lane swimmers were extremely nice, and were generous\nwith encouragement, praise and tips. This wasn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, but I\nstarted to notice a pattern: A, C, and D lane swimmers tended to be nice,\nfriendly, and helpful to pretty much everyone; B lane swimmers tended to be\nnice to A lane and other B lane swimmers but not so much to C and D.\n\nWhen I stopped doing tris and moved back to field sports, I started to notice\nthe same thing. The very top athletes were nice to everyone and so were the\nmiddle and bottom of the pack. The not quite top players, though, were less\nfriendly. They played more political games, and acted out their threatened\nfeelings of being not quite good enough by being snobbish to those below them.\n(In retrospect, I worry I did some of this, too, especially when I was playing\non a top team but was not a top player. I definitely felt a need to prove\nmyself.)\n\nI have since noted the same phenomenon in nearly every domain, including\nacademia. The truly great researchers are generous and friendly; so are many\nof the middle of the roaders. Those who have something to prove, though, and\nwho feel like they aren\u2019t quite managing to do it, show definite aspects of\nbeing B lane swimmers.\n\n### You may also like\n\nPublished October 20, 2009\n\n## Data, Information and Knowledge\n\n2 comments\n\nI\u2019m at a conference in LA at the moment; it feels so lovely and strange to be\nable to walk around outside [...]\n\nPublished May 8, 2023\n\n## Management lessons learned from 40 years with type 1 diabetes (T1D)\n\nIn January of this year, I reached 40 years of living with type 1 diabetes\n(T1D).
