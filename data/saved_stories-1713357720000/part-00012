In another sense, it contains an entire worldview.\n\nThe most basic meaning of \u201cprogress\u201d is simply advancement along a path, or\nmore generally from one state to another that is considered more advanced by\nsome standard. (In this sense, progress can be good, neutral, or even\nbad\u2014e.g., the progress of a disease.) The question is always: advancement\nalong what path, in what direction, by what standard?\n\n## Types of progress\n\n\u201cScientific progress,\u201d \u201ctechnological progress,\u201d and \u201ceconomic progress\u201d are\nrelatively straightforward. They are hard to measure, they are multi-\ndimensional, and we might argue about specific examples\u2014but in general,\nscientific progress consists of more knowledge, better theories and\nexplanations, a deeper understanding of the universe; technological progress\nconsists of more inventions that work better (more powerfully or reliably or\nefficiently) and enable us to do more things; economic progress consists of\nmore production, infrastructure, and wealth.\n\nTogether, we can call these \u201cmaterial progress\u201d: improvements in our ability\nto comprehend and to command the material world. Combined with more intangible\nadvances in the level of social organization\u2014institutions, corporations,\nbureaucracy\u2014these constitute \u201cprogress in capabilities\u201d: that is, our ability\nto do whatever it is we decide on.\n\n## True progress\n\nBut this form of progress is not an end in itself. True progress is\nadvancement toward the good, toward ultimate values\u2014call this \u201cultimate\nprogress,\u201d or \u201cprogress in outcomes.\u201d Defining this depends on axiology; that\nis, on our theory of value.\n\nTo a humanist, ultimate progress means progress in human well-being: \u201chuman\nprogress.\u201d Not everyone agrees on what constitutes well-being, but it\ncertainly includes health, happiness, and life satisfaction. In my opinion,\nhuman well-being is not purely material, and not purely hedonic: it also\nincludes \u201cspiritual\u201d values such as knowledge, beauty, love, adventure, and\npurpose.\n\nThe humanist also sees other kinds of progress contributing to human well-\nbeing: \u201cmoral progress,\u201d such as the decline of violence, the elimination of\nslavery, and the spread of equal rights for all races and sexes; and more\nbroadly \u201csocial progress,\u201d such as the evolution from monarchy to\nrepresentative democracy, or the spread of education and especially literacy.\n\nOthers have different standards. Biologist David Graber called himself a\n\u201cbiocentrist,\u201d by which he meant\n\n> ... those of us who value wildness for its own sake, not for what value it\n> confers upon mankind. ... We are not interested in the utility of a\n> particular species, or free-flowing river, or ecosystem, to mankind. They\n> have intrinsic value, more value\u2014to me\u2014than another human body, or a billion\n> of them. ... Human happiness, and certainly human fecundity, are not as\n> important as a wild and healthy planet.\n\nBy this standard, virtually all human activity is antithetical to progress:\nGraber called humans \u201ca cancer... a plague upon ourselves and upon the Earth.\u201d\n\nOr for another example, one Lutheran stated that his \u201cprimary measure of the\ngoodness of a society is the population share which is a baptized Christian\nand regularly attending church.\u201d\n\nThe idea of progress isn\u2019t completely incompatible with some flavors of\nenvironmentalism or of religion (and there are both Christians and\nenvironmentalists in the progress movement!) but these examples show that it\nis possible to focus on a non-human standard, such as God or Nature, to the\npoint where human health and happiness become irrelevant or even diametrically\nopposed to \u201cprogress.\u201d\n\n## Unqualified progress\n\nWhat are we talking about when we refer to \u201cprogress\u201d unqualified, as in \u201cthe\nprogress of mankind\u201d or \u201cthe roots of progress\u201d?\n\n\u201cProgress\u201d in this sense is the concept of material progress, social progress,\nand human progress as a unified whole. It is based on the premise that\nprogress in capabilities really does on the whole lead to progress in\noutcomes. This doesn\u2019t mean that all aspects of progress move in lockstep\u2014they\ndon\u2019t. It means that all aspects of progress support each other and over the\nlong term depend on each other; they are intertwined and ultimately\ninseparable.\n\nConsider, for instance, how Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen defined the term\nin their article calling for \u201cprogress studies\u201d:\n\n> By \u201cprogress,\u201d we mean the combination of economic, technological,\n> scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed\n> our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries.\n\nDavid Deutsch, in The Beginning of Infinity, is even more explicit, saying\nthat progress includes \u201cimprovements not only in scientific understanding, but\nalso in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every\naspect of human welfare.\u201d\n\nSkepticism of this idea of progress is sometimes expressed as: \u201cprogress\ntowards what?\u201d The undertone of this question is: \u201cin your focus on material\nprogress, you have lost sight of social and/or human progress.\u201d On the premise\nthat different forms of progress are diverging and even coming into\nopposition, this is an urgent challenge; on the premise that progress is a\nunified whole, it is a valuable intellectual question but not a major dilemma.\n\n## Historical progress\n\n\u201cProgress\u201d is also an interpretation of history according to which all these\nforms of progress have, by and large, been happening.\n\nIn this sense, the study of \u201cprogress\u201d is the intersection of axiology and\nhistory: given a standard of value, are things getting better?\n\nIn Steven Pinker\u2019s book Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science,\nHumanism, and Progress, the bulk of the chapters are devoted to documenting\nthis history. Many of the charts in that book were sourced from Our World in\nData, which also emphasizes the historical reality of progress.\n\n## So-called \u201cprogress\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees with this concept of progress. It depends on an\nEnlightement worldview that includes confidence in reason and science, and a\nhumanist morality.\n\nOne argument against the idea of progress claims that material progress has\nnot actually led to human well-being. Perhaps the benefits of progress are\noutweighed by the costs and risks: health hazards, technological unemployment,\nenvironmental damage, existential threats, etc. Some downplay or deny the\nbenefits themselves, arguing that material progress doesn\u2019t increase happiness\n(owing to the hedonic treadmill), that it doesn\u2019t satisfy our spiritual\nvalues, or that it degrades our moral character. Rousseau famously asserted\nthat \u201cthe progress of the sciences and the arts has added nothing to our true\nhappiness\u201d and that \u201cour souls have become corrupted to the extent that our\nsciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection.\u201d\n\nOthers, as mentioned above, argue for a different standard of value\naltogether, such as nature or God. (Often these arguments contain some\nequivocation between whether these things are good in themselves, or whether\nwe should value them because they are good for human well-being over the long\nterm.)\n\nWhen people start to conclude that progress is not in fact good, they talk\nabout this as no longer \u201cbelieving in progress.\u201d Historian Carl Becker,\nwriting in the shadow of World War I, said that \u201cthe fact of progress is\ndisputed and the doctrine discredited,\u201d and asked: \u201cMay we still, in whatever\ndifferent fashion, believe in the progress of mankind?\u201d In 1991, Christopher\nLasch asked:\n\n> How does it happen that serious people continue to believe in progress, in\n> the face of massive evidence that might have been expected to refute the\n> idea of progress once and for all?\n\nThose who dispute the idea of progress often avoid the term, or quarantine it\nin scare quotes: so-called \u201cprogress.\u201d When Jeremy Caradonna questioned the\nconcept in The Atlantic, the headline was: \u201cIs \u2018Progress\u2019 Good for Humanity?\u201d\nOne of the first court rulings on environmental protection law, in 1971, said\nthat such law represented \u201cthe commitment of the Government to control, at\nlong last, the destructive engine of material \u2018progress.\u2019\u201d Or consider this\nfrom Guns, Germs, and Steel:\n\n> ... I do not assume that industrialized states are \u201cbetter\u201d than hunter-\n> gatherer tribes, or that the abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle\n> for iron-based statehood represents \u201cprogress,\u201d or that it has led to an\n> increase in human happiness.\n\nThe idea of progress is inherently an idea that progress, overall, is good. If\n\u201cprogress\u201d is destructive, if it does not in fact improve human well-being,\nthen it hardly deserves the name.\n\nContrast this with the concept of growth. \u201cGrowth,\u201d writ large, refers to an\nincrease in the population, the economy, and the scale of human organization\nand activity. It is not inherently good: everyone agrees that it is happening,\nbut some are against it; some even define themselves by being against it (the\n\u201cdegrowth\u201d movement). No one is against progress, they are only against\n\u201cprogress\u201d: that is, they either believe in it, or deny it.\n\nThe most important question in the philosophy of progress, then, is whether\nthe idea of progress is valid\u2014whether \u201cprogress\u201d is real.\n\n## \u201cProgress\u201d in the 19th century\n\nBefore the World Wars, there was an idea of progress that went even beyond\nwhat I have defined above, and which contained at least two major errors.\n\nOne error was the idea that progress is inevitable. Becker, in the essay\nquoted above, said that according to \u201cthe doctrine of progress,\u201d\n\n> the Idea or the Dialectic or Natural Law, functioning through the conscious\n> purposes or the unconscious activities of men, could be counted on to\n> safeguard mankind against future hazards. ... At the present moment the\n> world seems indeed out of joint, and it is difficult to believe with any\n> conviction that a power not ourselves ... will ever set it right.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nThe other was the idea that moral progress was so closely connected to\nmaterial progress that they would always move together. Condorcet believed\nthat prosperity would \u201cnaturally dispose men to humanity, to benevolence and\nto justice,\u201d and that \u201cnature has connected, by a chain which cannot be\nbroken, truth, happiness, and virtue.\u201d\n\nThe 20th century, with the outbreak of world war and the rise of\ntotalitarianism, proved these ideas disastrously wrong.\n\n## \u201cProgress\u201d in the 21st century and beyond\n\nTo move forward, we need a wiser, more mature idea of progress.\n\nProgress is not automatic or inevitable. It depends on choice and effort. It\nis up to us.\n\nProgress is not automatically good. It must be steered. Progress always\ncreates new problems, and they don\u2019t get solved automatically. Solving them\nrequires active focus and effort, and this is a part of progress, too.\n\nMaterial progress does not automatically lead to moral progress. Technology\nwithin an evil social system can do more harm than good. We must commit to\nimproving morality and society along with science, technology, and industry.\n\nWith these lessons well learned, we can rescue the idea of progress and carry\nit forward into the 21st century and beyond.\n\nComment: Progress Forum, LessWrong, Reddit\n\n\u00ab Why you, personally, should want a larger human population\n\nGet posts by email:\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Jason Crawford.
