AI excitement\nobscures it a bit, but it\u2019s there.\n\nA feeling that:\n\n  * Growth has slowed everywhere (true overall. The average public SaaS company is now growing less than 20% a year!)\n  * Sales is so much harder, and the old playbooks aren\u2019t working well\n  * Folks don\u2019t want to work as hard anymore\n  * There are even more competitors than ever\n  * Every leader is competing with each other, trampling on their turf (Gong v. Outreach v. Salesloft v. Zoom, or Rippling vs. Deal vs. Gusto vs ....)\n  * Layoffs have become normalized\n  * Customers are angry from endless price increases and upsells\n  * Budgets are being cut to find budget for AI (true)\n  * Every renewal is not just a battle but a downgrade\n  * Profitability is all that matters\n  * VCs have checked out in a lot of non-AI SaaS\n  * A feeling we\u2019re in a massive \u201cdownturn\u201d, even as the overall U.S. economy still is booming\n  * A feeling products have fallen out of product-market fit, or at least, become more \u201cnice to haves\u201d vs. must haves\n  * Even healthy customers scrutinizing budgets in ways they haven\u2019t in many years\n  * Happy customers churning simply because they have to cut apps\n  * A feeling things actually won\u2019t ever get any better or easier in SaaS\n\n### The list goes on \ud83d\ude42\n\n### There\u2019s a lot of truth in all of this. What I think is really fueling it\nthough is the length of the \u201cdownturn\u201d in SaaS buying, in SaaS multiples, and\nSaaS valuations has been the longest of my career. Going on 3 Years:\n\nThe downturns in 2008, 2016 even were harder. They felt like the end of the\nworld. But they were shorter. Even the SaaS downturn of 2008-2009, when the\nglobal economy almost shut down, was shorter. SaaS actually came back faster\nthan we realized in retrospect then.\n\nThis downturn that started right around Oct-Nov 2021 is now in Year 3. Some of\nus didn\u2019t feel it until later, but that\u2019s when it started. And that\u2019s a long\ntime ago now.\n\nThat\u2019s the source of the real malaise I think.\n\nThat and the fact that revenue multiples are still not just below the peak of\nthe Go-Go Times of 2021, but about as low as they\u2019ve been since 2017. Roughly\nspeaking, the lower revenue multiples ... the harder everything just is in\nSaaS:\n\n### And in many ways, this malaise in multiples and in growth in SaaS has\nfueled an excessive boom in AI VC funding and more. AI looks like the part of\nB2B immune to malaise.\n\nIt\u2019s brimming with energy, and the epic top-line growth of OpenAI shows there\nare massive outcomes to be had. Massive losses, too \ud83d\ude42 But massive outcomes.\n\nWhat\u2019s to be done? I can\u2019t magically change enterprise buying patterns or\ncustomer appetites. But I can suggest learning into what\u2019s working:\n\n  * First, go all-in on driving true efficiency gains for your customers. We\u2019ve always sort of faked the efficiency of business software with ROI calculators and such. Now is the time to do it for real. If you can truly eliminate half the headcount in the support department, or half the SDRs, or truly make an engineer 2x as productive, now is the time. But prove it. For real. Nail this.\n  * At least be at \u201cAI Parity\u201d with the competition. Does AI today magically change every category? Maybe not. Is AI not quite there in some parts of SaaS? Maybe so. But no matter what, customers want improved efficiency from AI. There\u2019s huge momentum there. So at a bare minimum, don\u2019t lose deals due to not having competitive parity here.\n  * Close every customer. For the past 18-24 months, we\u2019ve been leaning in hard on the existing base. Raising prices multiple times. Forcing upgrades. Etc. Etc. Maybe that worked for you in the short term, maybe it didn\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t work forever, and it doesn\u2019t make customers happier. The best way to ensure a brighter future is literally to close every single prospect you get that you can make happy. Does that mean a cheaper edition? Maybe do it. Does that mean making your free edition ... more free? Do it. Does that mean letting folks downgrade instead of leave? Do it. Does that mean not forcing everyone to go through a qualification process if they don\u2019t want to? Then don\u2019t make them. Go long here. What\u2019s most important is that you increase your new customer count 20%-50% a year. That\u2019s your future.\n  * Grow usage faster than revenue. This is somewhat related to the prior point. Growing revenue at the end of the day is what matters. But if your usage isn\u2019t growing even faster than revenue, your future looks darker than your present. Pick your top 1-3 KPIs for usage, and make sure they are growing faster than revenue. MAUs, DAUs, revenue under management, API calls, records, whatever. Pick a core usage KPI or two and make sure their growth is even faster than revenue growth.\n\nTimes are tougher for many today, but not all. You can\u2019t fix everything. But\nthere is a lot you can do to invest in the future, right now.\n\nAt the end of the day, SaaS spending has grown > 10% a year every year, for\n... forever. Even now in 2024+, per Gartner, it still is, even if it doesn\u2019t\nfeel like it. Even at $200 Billion+ a year in SaaS annual spending already,\nand $1 Trillion in overall software spend, customers are still spending far\nmore each year than the last.\n\nRight now, that spend is being remixed in a way that is stressing the entire\nsystem. But the budgets are still there. If you truly make businesses more\nefficient than last year. And at least as well or better than the competition.\n\n> Gartner: 2024 Will be Tougher Than We Thought, But We\u2019ll Still Cross $1\n> Trillion in Software Spend\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * SaaS Multiples Are Down 75% From a Year Ago\n\n  * SaaStr #1 on Product Hunt!\n\n  * 61+ Companies That Are Hiring in SaaS\n\nJason Lemkin\n\nFounder SaaStr\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * SaaS Multiples Are Down 75% From a Year Ago\n\n  * SaaStr #1 on Product Hunt!\n\n  * 61+ Companies That Are Hiring in SaaS\n\n#### Get The Best SaaS Advice\n\nGet fresh insights, articles, and SaaS events delivered right to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n#### <img class=\"rss-widget-icon\" style=\"border:0\" width=\"14\" height=\"14\"\nsrc=\"https://www.saastr.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png\" alt=\"RSS\" /> Industry\nNews\n\n  * Solving RevenueCat's data ingestion challenges into Snowflake\n  * Scoop: Andreessen Horowitz closes $7.2 billion for new funds\n  * The Trade Desk's Moat Is Wide, But Also Vulnerable To Attack\n  * Could Datadog Become the Next Microsoft?\n  * Dear SaaStr: How Do You Build a Real Exit Strategy? | SaaStr\n  * SaaS unicorn Postman acquires Andreessen Horowitz-backed firm Orbit\n  * Fintech giant Stripe says raised $694-million in tender offer\n  * API startup Noname Security nears $500M deal to sell itself to Akamai\n  * Salesforce in Talks to Acquire Informatica, WSJ Reports\n  * StubHub eyes summer IPO, seeks $16.5 billion valuation\n\n## Subscribe to the SaaStr Newsletter\n\nGet from $0 to $100 Million in ARR with less stress and more success.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n#### Resources\n\nQ&A\n\nBlog\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nAcademy\n\nEbooks\n\n#### Events\n\nSaaStr Annual\n\nSaaStr Summit\n\nSaaStr Europa\n\nSaaStr Scale\n\n#### About Us\n\nSaaStr Fund\n\nCompany\n\nContact Us\n\nSitemap\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\n[caldera_form_modal type=\"button\" id=\"\" width=\"600\"]\n\n### Pin It on Pinterest\n\nShare This\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Buffer\n\n  * Gmail\n\n\u00d7\n\nWe Value Your Privacy\n\nSettings\n\nNextRoll, Inc.
