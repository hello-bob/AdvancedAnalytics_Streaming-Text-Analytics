It will continue collecting data on Mars until it dies but will\nnot transmit this data to Earth.\n\nIngenuity has flown 72 times on Mars. It was only initially expected to make\nfive trips on the Red Planet.

The record-\nbreaking robot will now spend the rest of its days collecting data that could\nbe used in future Mars missions \u2014 but only if future robots or astronauts go\nall the way to the Red Planet to get it.\n\nThe pigeon-size helicopter, or rotorcraft, first landed on the Red Planet on\nFeb. 18, 2021, alongside the Perseverance rover, and it successfully completed\nthe first-ever powered flight on an alien world on April 19 of the same year.\n\nThe Ingenuity mission's initial goal was to fly five missions across 30 days.\nBut the tiny chopper ended up flying 72 times on Mars, spending more than two\nhours in the air and traveling 14 times farther than initially planned,\naccording to a statement by NASA.\n\nHowever, during what turned out to be its final flight on Jan. 18 this year,\nthe flying robot crash-landed after briefly losing contact with NASA\ncontrollers. The helicopter only dropped from around 3 feet (1 meter) above\nthe ground, but it sustained irreversible damage to two of its four rotor\nblades, with part of one blade later spotted on the ground near the chopper.\nAs a result, the mission officially ended on Jan. 25.\n\nOn April 16, Ingenuity beamed back its final signal to Earth, which included\nthe remaining data it had stored in its memory bank and information about its\nfinal flight.\n\nRelated: Mars helicopter photographs wreckage of its own landing gear in\neerily desolate image\n\nIngenuity is currently stranded in Mars' Valinor Fields where it crashed in\nJanuary. It was photographed by the Perseverance rover on Feb. 4.

This\nspecial message had been sent to Perseverance the day before and relayed to\nIngenuity to send home.\n\nThe helicopter, which still has power, will now spend the rest of its days\ncollecting data from its final landing spot in Valinor Hills, named after a\nlocation in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" books.\n\nThe chopper will wake up daily to test its equipment, collect a temperature\nreading and take a single photo of its surroundings. It will continue to do\nthis until it loses power or fills up its remaining memory space, which could\ntake 20 years. Such a long-term dataset could not only benefit future designs\nfor Martian vehicles but also \"provide a long-term perspective on Martian\nweather patterns and dust movement,\" researchers wrote in the statement.\n\nMission scientists celebrated receiving Ingenuity's final signal on April 16.\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nHowever, the data will be kept on board the helicopter and not beamed back to\nEarth, so it must be retrieved by future Martian vehicles or astronauts.\n\n\"Whenever humanity revisits Valinor Hills \u2014 either with a rover, a new\naircraft, or future astronauts \u2014 Ingenuity will be waiting with her last gift\nof data,\" Teddy Tzanetos, an Ingenuity scientist at JPL, said in the\nstatement.\n\n\u2014Mars helicopter Ingenuity snaps epic photo of rover tracks\n\n\u2014Mars helicopter Ingenuity phones home, breaking 63-day silence\n\n\u2014Mars helicopter Ingenuity nails 8th flight on the Red Planet\n\nDespite the unfortunate end of the Ingenuity mission, it will go down in\nhistory as a massive success, researchers said.\n\n\"It is almost unbelievable that after over 1,000 Martian days on the surface,\n72 flights, and one rough landing, she still has something to give,\" Josh\nAnderson, leader of the Ingenuity team at JPL, said in the statement. \"Not\nonly did Ingenuity overachieve beyond our wildest dreams, but also it may\nteach us new lessons in the years to come.\"\n\nHarry Baker\n\nSenior Staff Writer\n\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.
