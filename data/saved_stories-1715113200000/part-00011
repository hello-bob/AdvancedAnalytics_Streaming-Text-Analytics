It was updated in\nMay 2024.\n\nRoughly eight billion humans live on the planet, and each one experiences the\n24 hours of the day a little differently. That amounts to 190 billion unique\nhours of human life lived during each rotation of the Earth.\n\nWhile each of us has a decent conception of how we spend our own time, the\nactions of our fellow humans \u2014 from our next-door neighbors to people living\nin faraway countries \u2014 can seem quite mysterious. Do they watch as much TV?\nWork as many hours? Fiddle with their smartphones as frequently? Cook as\noften? Spend as much time watching their kids?\n\nSimply stated, what does the average human do every day?\n\n## 9 hours of sleep, 2.6 hours of work\n\nIn an unprecedented analysis published in 2023 in the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, researchers from McGill University attempted to\nanswer that question. They aggregated data from 145 countries collected\nbetween 2000 and 2019. The data included time use surveys, national statistics\nof employment and working time, and international records of youth education\nand employment. This herculean effort revealed what the researchers termed the\n\u201cglobal human day\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201ca complete estimate of what humans are doing,\naveraged over time and across the entire population.\u201d\n\nSo what does this global human day look like?\n\nFirst and foremost, the average human spends about 9.1 hours sleeping or\nresting. That might seem like a lot to the sleep-deprived adults out there,\nbut remember that the study includes data from children as young as newborns,\nwho catch a lot of Zs.\n\nAccording to the research, people spend an average of 9.1 hours per day\nsleeping or resting. However, that figure includes newborns, who enjoy an\neasygoing 12-16 hours of shut-eye daily. (Credit: Dakota Corbin / Unsplash)\n\nWhile awake, the average person spends close to one-third of their day on\npassive, interactive, and social activities. These roughly 4.6 hours include\nreading, watching TV, making art, playing games, going to gatherings with\nfriends or family, or simply doing nothing at all. Eating and food preparation\naccounts for another 2.5 hours. Hygiene, including grooming, washing, and\ndressing, takes about 1.1 hours. Cleaning and maintaining the spaces we\ninhabit costs us 0.8 hours of the day.\n\nThough employment can be hugely time-consuming for working individuals, when\nlooked at through the lens of the global human day, it appears as a mere\nsliver of time, just 2.6 hours. Education also isn\u2019t very demanding, only 1.1\nhours. And fascinatingly, crafting goods, building homes and infrastructure,\nand mining and gathering the requisite materials for these endeavors takes 0.8\nhours of the average human day. Think about that: Our homes, all the things we\nsurround ourselves with, and the cities and towns where we live, require just\n3% of our collective time to create.\n\nThe researchers were also curious about how average human time use changes\nwith wealth. They found some glaring disparities. Residents of the highest-\nincome countries spend about 1.5 more hours each day than residents of the\nlowest-income countries on experiences, such as meals, physical recreation,\nand general leisure activities. Additionally, people in the richest countries\nspend an average of just five minutes a day growing and harvesting food, while\npeople in the poorest countries spend well over an hour doing so.\n\nOn average, people in the world\u2019s poorest countries spend over an hour a day\ngrowing and harvesting food. In wealthier countries, the average is 5 minutes.\n(Credit:Ch Maheswara Raju / Wikimedia Commons)\n\nBut the researchers found a lot of commonalities, too. Across the world, we\nall tend to spend about the same amount of time eating, preparing food,\ntransporting ourselves, and grooming and washing.\n\n## The Human Chronome Project\n\nThe immense analysis constituted the first published data of the Human\nChronome Project, an effort to create a database of global human activities.\nBy assembling the human chronome, the researchers say that we can compare\nourselves to civilizations from the past. More importantly, we can see from a\nhigh-level, empirical perspective what our species is doing on our planet and\nmake more informed decisions about reallocating our collective time to change\nthe world and society for the better.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how the global human system functions is crucial if we are to\nsustainably navigate planetary boundaries, adapt to rapid technological change\nsuch as artificial intelligence, and achieve global development goals,\u201d the\nresearchers wrote.\n\n\u201cTime, it has been said, is the coin of life \u2014 and in a globally connected\nsociety, it is essential to have a thorough global understanding of how that\ncoin is spent.\u201d\n\nTags\n\nEconomics & Worksociology\n\nIn this article\n\nEconomics & Worksociology\n\nRelated\n\nThe Learning Curve\n\nWe need an \u201corbital perspective\u201d to solve Earth\u2019s problems\n\nRetired astronaut Ron Garan believes that before we can begin solving our\nproblems, we must understand our interrelatedness through the \u201corbital\nperspective.\u201d\n\nThe Present\n\nThe case for \u201cco\u00f6perism\u201d: How we can solve global problems together\n\nIf we took the values and principles of cooperation to the next level, we\ncould effectively tackle many crises.\n\nThe Present\n\nIs a capitalist-socialist economy inevitable?\n\nThe status quo may be unsustainable.\n\nThe Present\n\nHow circular economics can make us happier and less stressed\n\nEntrenched business wisdom says that community-led economic systems are pure\nfantasy. Douglas Rushkoff disagrees.\n\n13.8\n\nHumanity is not even a Type 1 civilization. What would a Type 3 be capable of?\n\nThe Kardashev scale ranks civilizations from Type 1 to Type 3 based on energy\nharvesting.\n\nUp Next\n\nBusiness\n\nTech leadership reinvented: \u201cMove fast and break ignorance\u201d\n\nJoe Betts-LaCroix \u2014 co-founder and CEO of Retro Biosciences \u2014 talks to Big\nThink about invention, authenticity, and Sam Altman\u2019s \u201cart of the startup.\u201d\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nRecommended by\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nRecommended by\n\n## Footer\n\nSubscribe\n\nGet counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your\ninbox every Thursday.\n\nFollow Us\n\nView our Youtube channel\n\nView our Facebook page\n\nView our Instagram feed\n\nView our Twitter (X) feed\n\nView our LinkedIn account\n\nSections\n\n  * Neuropsych\n  * Thinking\n  * Leadership\n  * Smart Skills\n  * High Culture\n  * The Past\n  * The Present\n  * The Future\n  * Life\n  * Health\n  * Hard Science\n  * Special Issues\n  * Business\n\nColumns\n\n  * Starts With A Bang\n  * The Well\n  * Perception Box\n  * 13.8\n  * Strange Maps\n  * The Learning Curve\n  * Everyday Philosophy\n\nVideo\n\n  * The Big Think Interview\n  * Your Brain on Money\n  * Playlists\n  * Explore the Library\n\nAbout\n\n  * Our Mission\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Accessibility\n  * Careers\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * Free Newsletters\n  * Memberships\n\n  * The Weekly Crossword\n\nGet Big Think for Your Business.
