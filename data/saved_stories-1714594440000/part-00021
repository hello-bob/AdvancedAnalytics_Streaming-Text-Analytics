Like many of you, I can\u2019t afford to update every bit of Apple\nhardware every time the company revises one of its products. So I have to\ncarefully measure when my stuff has now become too old and needs to be\nreplaced with the shiny and new.\n\nOf course, Apple would love us all to buy new stuff all the time. But the\ncompany has to earn its sales the hard way. I might buy a new iPhone because\nof an upgraded camera or a new MacBook Air because of a new design and a\nfaster processor. I might bypass the latest Apple Watch because the new\nfeatures just don\u2019t matter to me.\n\nAs the heat from the iPhone\u2019s huge acceleration of growth begins to cool down\nand iPad and Mac sales drop from their pandemic-driven heights, Apple is\nlooking for reasons to sell new hardware. And now, it may have found a big one\nin a somewhat unexpected place: AI.\n\n## AI models eat RAM\n\nArtificial Intelligence algorithms are software, of course. Theoretically, all\ncurrent Apple hardware should be able to run AI stuff. Apple\u2019s been building\nNeural Engines into its chips for years, for example. And yet the rumored\naddition of major AI features to Apple\u2019s platforms starting this fall may fuel\na new wave of upgrades.\n\nThis is because when we discuss AI these days, we\u2019re largely discussing Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), things like OpenAI\u2019s Chat GPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\nApple is reportedly building its own LLM, intending it to run natively on\nApple devices rather than being outsourced to the cloud. This could increase\nspeed dramatically, as well as enhance privacy.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: LLMs really need memory. Google has barred Gemini Nano,\na model likely quite similar to what Apple is planning for the iPhone, from\nall but the largest Google Pixel phone, seemingly because of memory\nlimitations.\n\nThe most RAM ever in an iPhone is the 8GB of memory in the iPhone 15 Pro and\nPro Max. While iOS has proven generally to be better at managing memory usage\nthan Android, that\u2019s still a relatively small amount of RAM, and would seem to\nbe the bare minimum capable of running an on-device LLM of the kind Apple and\nGoogle are working on.\n\nGiven that Apple reportedly will unveil its AI efforts at WWDC in June, it\ncan\u2019t really show off iPhone features that don\u2019t work on any current models.\nBut it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that many of the iOS AI features might be\nlimited to iPhone 15 Pro models\u2013because they\u2019re the only ones with 8GB of\nmemory. (A new line of iPhones in the fall would presumably all ship with\nsufficient memory.)\n\nNeural Engines have been part of Apple silicon for a while, but is it enough\nto address the needs of generative AI?\n\nApple\n\nAnd just like that, Apple\u2019s AI announcements may provide a huge set of\nfeatures to motivate prospective buyers. Want to use Apple\u2019s most awesome new\nAI features? Unless you\u2019ve just bought the highest-end iPhone, you\u2019ll need to\nupgrade.\n\n## One step beyond\n\nOn the Mac, things will probably be a little easier. Macs are beefier than\niPhones, and it\u2019s likely that most Apple silicon Macs will do well with an\nApple-built LLM, though even there it may be the case that M1 Macs will lag a\nbit behind the M2 and M3 versions.\n\nStill, I\u2019m starting to think that the most compelling reason that someone who\nowns an Apple silicon-based Mac might have to upgrade will be the slow\nprocessing of AI models, which can demand lots of memory and many GPU cores.\nI\u2019m a big fan of M1 Macs, including the low-cost M1 MacBook Air, but Apple\u2019s\nnext-generation AI features may make the M1 feel old.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Apple Watch. Its hardware just got upgraded to support on-\ndevice Siri for the first time, which suggests that it might be a while before\nit\u2019s got enough oomph to support an on-device LLM. But the more I think about\nit, the more I realize that I would upgrade my Apple Watch in a heartbeat if I\ncould get access to a better, more responsive voice assistant.\n\nApple sold a ton of M1 Macs, but it\u2019s possible that it may not be powerful\nenough (or at least won\u2019t have enough memory) to handle on-device AI\nprocessing.\n\nQuelle: Apple\n\nOf course, it\u2019s still incumbent on Apple to ship AI features that people want.\nOne of Apple\u2019s most steadfast traits through the years is the company\u2019s\nability to take cutting-edge technology and build it into features that users\nactually value. Shipping an LLM and other AI features will not be a cure-\nall\u2013they need to be built into functionality that people will want to actually\nuse.\n\nBut if Apple can manage to infuse AI into its operating systems in ways that\nmake them more appealing, and by happy coincidence, it requires faster\nprocessors and more memory, that\u2019s going to motivate a round of hardware\nupgrades. And that\u2019s good for Apple, because while OS updates are free, new\niPhones absolutely are not.\n\nI\u2019m not thrilled about the idea of replacing my Apple hardware, but I\u2019d rather\ndo it because I\u2019m motivated by an awesome AI-based feature than because I\u2019m\ntired of the color of my laptop or the shape of my iPhone.\n\n### Author: Jason Snell\n\nJason has written for Macworld for 25 years, and was lead editor for more than\na decade.
