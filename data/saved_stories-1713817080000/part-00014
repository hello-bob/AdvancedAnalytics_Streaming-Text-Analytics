It was updated with new\ncontent on 3/28/2024.\n\nAs you think how to start an afterschool program, you must make sure you\u2019re\ncovering all the bases to fill a growing need. The demand for afterschool\nprograms is high. For every student in afterschool, two more would participate\nif a program were available, according to the Afterschool Alliance.\n\n\u201cDecades of research prove afterschool helps kids attend school more often,\nget better grades, and build foundational skills, like communication,\nteamwork, and problem solving,\u201d the alliance says, adding that afterschool\nprograms give parents peace of mind because they know their kids are safe \u2014\nonline and offline \u2014 and engaged in fun learning opportunities.\n\nLet\u2019s get an overview of what you must do to start an afterschool program and\nlook at six steps to make it happen.\n\n## What Is an Afterschool Program?\n\nAfterschool programs, which sometimes are called OST or out-of-school-time\nprograms, serve children and youth of all ages, according to youth.gov. These\nprograms include academic support, mentoring, positive youth development,\narts, sports and recreation, apprenticeships, workforce development programs\nand programs for opportunity youth, who are youth not in schools or the\nworkforce as well as youth experiencing homelessness.\n\nA high-quality afterschool program provides a safe, nurturing environment for\nschool age children by offering activities and homework help while fostering\nsafe social interactions.\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Afterschool Daycare and Afterschool\nPrograms?\n\nAfterschool daycare and afterschool programs are both child care. But there\nare a few key differences.\n\nThe main difference between daycares and afterschool programs is the focus and\nhours of operation, according to Ivy League Kids.\n\nDaycares typically care for children as young as infants while afterschool\nprograms are generally for school-aged children. Afterschool programs often\nhave a more educational or recreational focus, with activities designed to\nenrich children\u2019s learning and development.\n\n## Do You Need a License for an Afterschool Program?\n\nStates have minimum licensing requirements that apply to afterschool programs,\naccording to youth.gov. If you want to start a program, contact your state\u2019s\nlicensing agency to find out about the requirements. Private and public\nfunding may also have separate requirements.\n\nSome state requirements for school-age care include maintaining staff\ninformation, attendance records, staff to child ratios, immunizations and\nmore! With Procare, all this information is at your fingertips!\n\n## Six Steps to Start an Afterschool Program\n\n### 1\\. Secure a Designated Space\n\nWhen choosing the location for your afterschool program, keep travel and\nconvenience in mind. Consider securing a location that\u2019s close to the school\nwhere prospective students are enrolled and conveniently accessible to\nparents.\n\nAffordable options include schools, local libraries, churches or recreation\ncenters.\n\n### 2\\. Create a Business Plan\n\nDo your homework. Research the market you\u2019re entering, including competing\nafterschool programs and their curriculum. This will give you a foundation to\nbuild a business plan based on the community\u2019s needs.\n\nLocal parents can be a great resource for ideas and information about what\nthey value in an after-school program.\n\nSo how much does it cost to open an afterschool program? It depends on the\nsize, location and scope of your program. You\u2019ll need to factor in rent,\npurchasing furniture, insurance, marketing and vehicles to transport children\nfrom school to your program.\n\n#### Free eBook\n\n# Simplify the Management of Your Before & After School Programs\n\nIn this eBook, you\u2019ll see how Procare helped the Oregon City School District\nintroduce online registration and pre-pay for after school programs and camps.\n\nDownload Now\n\n### 3\\. Build Curriculum\n\nYou\u2019ll need to create a diverse set of curriculum options to appeal to\ndifferent age groups, including academic and recreational enrichment\nactivities. Start with the basics like art, music, math and science. You can\nthen supplement with homework help, recreational activities and plenty of free\ntime to let the kids in your care burn off steam as needed. Parents also value\nenhanced and differentiated programs such as martial arts, foreign languages,\ncooking classes and STEM activities. Unique class offerings can differentiate\nyour after-school program from competitors.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some afterschool program activities:\n\n#### 1\\. STEM Explorers Club\n\nObjective: Cultivate a passion for STEM through hands-on projects and\nexperiments.\n\n  * Activities: Building simple machines, coding rudimentary programs, engaging in basic chemistry experiments and participating in math challenges\n  * Learning Outcomes: Develops problem-solving skills and fosters an understanding of scientific principles and technology\n\n#### 2\\. Literacy Enrichment Program\n\nObjective: Enhance reading, writing and comprehension skills while instilling\na lifelong love of literature.\n\n  * Activities: Book club discussions, creative-writing workshops, poetry readings, interactive storytime sessions and vocabulary games\n  * Learning Outcomes: Increases literacy proficiency, expands vocabulary and encourages imaginative thinking\n\n#### 3\\. Young Artists Studio\n\nObjective: Provide a creative outlet for self-expression through various art\nmediums.\n\n  * Activities: Painting, sculpting, drawing, mixed media crafts, art history lessons and artist showcases\n  * Learning Outcomes: Stimulates creativity, develops fine motor skills and promotes an appreciation for the arts.\n\n#### 4\\. Global Cultures and Languages\n\nObjective: Expose students to diverse cultures and languages to foster global\nawareness and empathy.\n\n  * Activities: Basic language lessons, cultural crafts, international cuisine cooking sessions, traditional dance and music exploration as well as world geography\n  * Learning Outcomes: Builds cultural competency, encourages linguistic interest and nurtures an inclusive mindset\n\n#### 5\\.

Hire Qualified Staff\n\nHiring qualified and passionate staff is critical to help parents feel\nconfident that their child is receiving outstanding care as well as help you\nbuild and maintain enrollment. As you search for educators for your program,\nconsider reaching out to teachers and other staff at elementary schools who\nmay be seeking additional after-hours work. Since many of these individuals\nalready have relationships with local families and they are already employed\nin schools, you can be confident they\u2019ll greatly enhance your enrichment\nprogram.\n\n### 5\\. Use Technology to Simplify Processes\n\nOperating a successful after-school program requires juggling many\nresponsibilities that often compromise your primary focus of caring for\nstudents. Using child care management software simplifies time-consuming tasks\nsuch as collecting tuition, registering children, managing wait lists,\nprocessing employee time cards and tracking attendance. By simplifying\noperations with software designed for afterschool programs, your staff can\nfocus on fostering a caring environment that promotes students\u2019 growth rather\nthan worrying about paperwork and administrative tasks.\n\n### 6\\. Maintain a Safe and Secure Environment\n\nAfterschool programs are meant to provide a secure place for children when\nschool is not in session so ensuring your students\u2019 safety is priority number\none. Security solutions such as keyless entry, secure door controllers and\nfingerprint pads for electronic check-in help prevent unauthorized entry. They\nalso help you monitor who has entered secure areas so you can take appropriate\nmeasures to tighten security controls if necessary.\n\n## How Procare Can Help!\n\nProcare gives you the power to manage every aspect of your afterschool\nprogram, regardless of its size and structure.
