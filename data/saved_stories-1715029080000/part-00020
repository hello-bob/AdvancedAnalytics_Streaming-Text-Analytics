Why is Blackboard universally reviled? There\u2019s a standard story of\nwhy \"enterprise software\" sucks. If you\u2019ll bear with me, I think this is best\nappreciated by talking about... baby clothes! ^\n\nThere are two types of baby outfits. The first is targeted at people buying\ngifts. It's irresistible on the rack. It has no fewer than 18 buttons. At\nleast 3 people are needed to get a screaming baby into it. It's worn once, so\nyou can send a photo to the gifter, then discarded. ^\n\nOther baby outfits are meant for parents. They\u2019re marked \"Easy On, Easy Off\"\nor some such, and they really mean it. Zippers aren't easy enough so they\nfasten using MAGNETS. A busy parent (i.e. a parent) can change an outfit in 5\nseconds, one handed, before rushing to work. ^\n\nThe point is, some products are sold directly to the end user, and are forced\nto prioritize usability. Other products are sold to an intermediary whose\nconcerns are typically different from the user's needs. Such products don't\nHAVE to end up as unusable garbage, but usually do. ^\n\nOK, back to Blackboard! It\u2019s actually designed to look extremely attractive to\nthe administrators (not professors and definitely not students) who make\npurchase decisions. Since they can't easily test usability, they instead make\ncomparisons based on... checklists of features. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f ^\n\nAnd that's exactly what's wrong with Blackboard. It has every feature ever\ndreamed up. But like anything designed by a committee, the interface is\nincoherent and any task requires at least fifteen clicks (and that's if you\neven remember the correct sequence the first time). ^\n\nSoftware companies can be breathtakingly clueless when there's a layer of\nindirection between them and their users. Everyone who's suffered through\nBlackboard will have the same reaction to this: try having less functionality!\nedscoop.com/how-canvas-cam... ^\n\nThe grumbling about Blackboard has finally gotten loud enough that schools are\npaying a modicum of attention to usability when evaluating alternatives.\nBlackboard's market share has dropped dramatically and this will probably\ncontinue. Good. ^\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though. It's extremely likely that whichever vendor emerges\non top will fall into the same trap. The incentives almost guarantee it. Once\nprofs and students put down the pitchforks, committees will go back to their\nchecklists, and feature creep will resume. ^\n\nBlackboard is 20 years old. If Twitter is around in 20 years, let's see how\nthis prediction holds up. And now I have to go rescue a three-month old from\nan extremely cute and equally uncomfortable outfit. ^\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?

The newly released chapter is on testing systems\nfor discrimination.. fairmlbook.org/testing.html\n\nA few thoughts in this thread on why you might find this interesting and\nuseful.\n\n> https://twitter.com/mrtz/status/1199743101129986048\n\nAlgorithmic auditing has exploded in the last 5 years (there are about 50\nstudies in our references). This young community has a lot to learn from the\nclassic audit studies that date back to the 70s. The entire first half of the\nchapter is on traditional tests for discrimination.\n\nThe algorithmic bias conversation needs to move beyond simple measures of\ndisparity. We help the reader connect these measurements to moral notions of\nfairness, understand the harms that can result, and identify the sources and\nmechanisms that produce disparities.\n\nRead 5 tweets\n\nArvind Narayanan\n\n@random_walker\n\nNov 26th 2019\n\nToday I want to take a break from sharing research to share a personal story\ninstead. It\u2019s a story about my name, why I once decided to quit academia, why\nI came back, what I learnt from it, and why I\u2019m grateful to have an audience\nhere on Twitter.\n\nNear the end of my PhD, I had three main publications. I ran into someone at a\nconference whom I knew from previous events. He asked me about my work, and I\nbriefly mentioned my papers. His reaction was something I didn\u2019t expect...\n\nHe\u2019d seen and liked my papers, but the name hadn\u2019t registered. He didn\u2019t\nrealize the 3 papers had the same first author and that it was someone he\nknew. He was embarrassed and apologetic. If he\u2019d known, he said, he\u2019d have\nadvocated for me at his school for a faculty position(!)\n\nRead 14 tweets\n\nArvind Narayanan\n\n@random_walker\n\nNov 19th 2019\n\nMuch of what\u2019s being sold as \"AI\" today is snake oil. It does not and cannot\nwork. In a talk at MIT yesterday, I described why this happening, how we can\nrecognize flawed AI claims, and push back. Here are my annotated slides:\ncs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks...\n\nKey point #1: AI is an umbrella term for a set of loosely related\ntechnologies. *Some* of those technologies have made genuine, remarkable, and\nwidely-publicized progress recently. But companies exploit public confusion by\nslapping the \u201cAI\u201d label on whatever they\u2019re selling.\n\nKey point #2: Many dubious applications of AI involve predicting social\noutcomes: who will succeed at a job, which kids will drop out, etc. We can\u2019t\npredict the future \u2014 that should be common sense. But we seem to have decided\nto suspend common sense when \u201cAI\u201d is involved.\n\nRead 6 tweets\n\n# Related threads\n\nArborDayWorshipper\n\n@PollySpin\n\nJun 17th 2019\n\n#story\n\nRead 8 tweets\n\nLoose_Bull \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\n\n@loosebool\n\nMar 9th 2019\n\n#Story ... 1.\u2019Dada \u2018 was actually the name of the Dutch company that imported\nFake Ghee Called \u2018vanaspati ghee \u2018 into India in the 1930s as a cheap\nsubstitute for Pure \u2018desi ghee \u2018 Which was prepared from cow or Buffalo milk\nin India \ud83e\udd14\n\n2\\.
