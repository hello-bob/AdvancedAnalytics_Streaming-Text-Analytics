I was 19 years old, an Apple\nEmployee, and this was the eve of the original iPad release.\n\nThe two-seater table across from us against the large glass windows opening to\nthe west coast sun held host to Steve Jobs and Jony Ive.\n\nI had been around both Steve and Jony before, but today, on the brink of a new\nproduct launch, something felt different. Ryan was talking to me about a spec\nregarding the release while all I was trying to do was eat my yellowtail sushi\nand not think about how I was easily the littlest fish in this sea.\n\nSipping on the sparkling water Apple keeps on tap, I kept seeing Steve out of\nmy periphery. He and Jony were relaxed yet radiating energy as they traded\nstories. I went for another bite of fish, seaweed, and rice, as Steve Jobs and\nJony Ive got up from the sun soaked table. Continuing to converse, they began\nto walk.\n\nFor anyone who has not stepped on the paths among the grass and trees that\nmake up the courtyard of Apple\u2019s Infinity, it is humbling. Those paths have\nbeen worn by the feet of thousands of remarkable women and men as they\nconverse through the world sized challenges and decimal small details required\nto create something worth celebrating. From the iMac to the iPod and now the\niPhone and iPad, the stone serpentines and loops through those lawns will\nalways be a part of history.\n\nFully uninterested in the Japanese fare before my face, I did my best not to\nstare as our CEO and SVP of Industrial Design arrived at the end of their\nsaunter. The west facing windows of the cafe framed the scene where I could\nsee they were parting for the day. Then I witnessed them share a brief\nembrace.\n\nAll of this happened in a matter of minutes but over the years this memory has\nreplayed in my mind what must be a million times. Steve was one of the most\nsuccessful humans ever. Fortune had named him CEO of the decade; The Beethoven\nof Business. The Billionaire who resurrected the company he began building\naround my age.\n\nBut for me at 19, I didn\u2019t get it.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until the following year when Steve passed away that I began to\nlearn about what I saw that day. Something as simple as a hug between friends\nwas the statement of a lifetime and the greatest lesson I would learn from\nhim.\n\nIn one moment, Steve showed me life is about making something wonderful with\nyour friends.\n\nOr in Steve\u2019s own words:\n\n> I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you\n> all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.\n>\n> -The final sentence of Steve\u2019s resignation letter. August, 2011\n\nThat will always be what success looks like to me.\n\nUntil Friday,\n\n-Steven\n\nPS. If you haven\u2019t yet, go read Make Something Wonderful compiled by the Steve\nJobs Archive.
