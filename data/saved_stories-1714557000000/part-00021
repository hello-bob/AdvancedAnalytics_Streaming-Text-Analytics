But the conventional idea of \"CGI\" as we know today wouldn't start\nuntil the 1970s, were they started to generate 3D models for the first time. A\nnotable example from the time being \"Computer Animated Hand\" from 1972, which\nis considered the first 3D computer animation to be ever created.\n\nBy the 1980s, CGI began to technologically evolve at a faster rate and slowly\nbeing introduced to the mass public through advertisements and TV bumpers. It\nwas also during this time when the common attributes associated with Silicon\nDreams start to become a lot more apparent, with demos like Quest (1985),\nBrilliance (1985), Mental Images (1987), Deja Vu (1987), Polly Gone (1988),\nand the first Pixar shorts like Luxo Jr. (1986), Tim Toy (1988), and Knick\nKnack (1989).\n\nDuring the following decade, the 1990s, CGI starts to get into the mainstream\nmedia, with new blockbuster movies and TV shows beginning to adopt these\ntechnologies, since it was starting to get more commercially viable then ever\nbefore. All of that led to the release of the first CGI feature-length\nanimated film Toy Story in 1995, and Cassiopeia in 1996, which contributed to\nthe steady decline of the aesthetic, as well as the advancements in CGI that\nwere happening in the 90s. Silicon Dream went to a complete halt in the Early\n2000s when CGI and 3D animated movies became advanced enough and the norm of\nthe industry.\n\nDespite the leaps in CGI technology between the 80s and 90s, there was a\nconsistent visual identity that was present in 3D animation. It was\ncharacterized by sparse landscapes or architecture, low-resolution textures,\nsimple visual effects and objects, in situations, environments, and 3D models\nthat are surreal and \"out of this world\" in nature, like something that came\nout of a dream.\n\nAlthough the aesthetic ended in the early 2000s, it was brought to the\ninternet by the rise of aesthetics like Vaporwave and Seapunk, which ended up\nbeing used as a tool to complement the visuals of these aesthetics or to\ncreate a sense of nostalgia of a bygone time.\n\n## Visuals[]\n\nSilicon Dreams often includes images, artwork, and shorts made with early CGI\nfrom the 80s to 90s, a majority of them being either space or technologically-\nthemed, landscapes or even CGI architecture. A lot of imagery included\nsimplistic polygons, textures, and lighting, due to the technical limitations\nof the time.\n\nThe Silicon Dreams aesthetic was also commonly seen in Trapper Keepers of the\n90s; loose-leaf binders made by the stationary company Mead that were used for\nthe sake of organizing school supplies for students. This could also be seen\nas the connecting tissue between it and more modern-ish aesthetics such as\nVaporwave, Seapunk, Icepunk, Slimepunk, and ironically Cybercore.\n\n## Technology[]\n\nAt the time when Silicon Dreams started, many people used computers to\ngenerate imagery.\n\n  * Macintosh 128K (1984)\n  * Windows 1.0 (1985)\n  * Macintosh Plus (1986)\n  * PlayStation (1994)\n  * Sega Saturn (1994)\n  * Windows 95 (1995)\n  * Nintendo 64 (1996)\n  * Sega Dreamcast (1998)\n\n## Music[]\n\nSeveral Intelligent DnB/Jungle albums and YouTube mixes feature CGI by this\naesthetic, most notably, the Peshay Studio Set (1996), but in recent years,\nit's also come to be utilized as an element in Vaporwave aesthetics, be it\nfrom Oneohtrix Point Never's music video for Nobody Here (which some pinpoint\nas the very first example of Vaporwave music put out into the wild) as well as\nthe music video for Macintosh Plus's Lisa Frank 420. The Vaporwave connection\ncould be considered a carryover from when the Seapunk community gravitated\ntowards Vaporwave after its decline in popularity, where Seapunk was heavily\ninspired by many early works within the Silicon Dreams style of aesthetics\n(due to many members of the community being children at the time Silicon\nDreams was first conceived) which added to the sense of nostalgia that both\nSeapunk and Vaporwave evoke.\n\nDire Straits - Money For Nothing (Official Music Video)\n\nThe music video for Dire Strait's Money for Nothing included early CGI\nanimation in it, as well as Miley Cyrus's music video for We Can't Stop also\nutilizing clips from the earliest known example of CGI animation (a simple\ntalking face attempting to show emotion and \"talk\" that was made all the way\nback in 1974). Many Seapunk music videos (specifically from the likes of\nUltrademon) utilize a more \"high definition\" variation of the early Silicon\nDreams works of the 1990s.\n\n## Media[]\n\nIn terms of its usage in early media of the 90s, there was a certain level of\nwhat could be described as \"janky\" in this particular era of CGI animation,\ndue to the technology still being extremely new and, as such, still in an\nextremely primitive state.\n\n### Movies[]\n\n  * TRON (1982)\n  * The Adventures of Andr\u00e9 & Wally B.
