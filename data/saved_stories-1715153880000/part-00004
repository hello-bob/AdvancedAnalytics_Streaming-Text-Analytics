Imagine a\ntoilet that can be set up anywhere with no pipes to connect and no need for\nwater\u2014where waste is treated at the source, safely and cleanly.\n\nNearly 250 years after the invention of the flush toilet, 3.5 billion\npeople\u2014almost half the world\u2019s population\u2014have no choice but to use unsafe\ntoilets and sanitation facilities. For the population that lives above sewers,\nthe infrastructure is aging fast, prone to overflow, and wasteful. And\neverywhere, our sanitation systems will be tested by climate change.\n\nBut the world is poised to take a leap together. With innovations and improved\ntechnology, alongside investments from local governments and businesses, we\ncan ensure safe sanitation for all.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation designed this exhibition to share a vision\nfor resilient and sustainable sanitation. It features efforts the foundation\nhas funded to address both the outcomes of inequities in sanitation and their\nroot cause\u2014with a goal of protecting the health and dignity of everyone, no\nmatter where we live.\n\n> We are closer than ever to building a world where safe sanitation services\n> are a basic human right enjoyed by everyone, not just those with money and\n> access to water.\n>\n> Doulaye Kone Deputy Director, Water, Sanitation & Hygiene Bill & Melinda\n> Gates Foundation\n\n  * About us\n  * Visit\n  * Education\n  * gatesfoundation.org\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * X\n  * Linkedin\n  * Threads\n  * Email\n\n\u00a9 2023-2024 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
