A big\nthank you \ud83d\ude4f to everyone who has helped get us to this number - especially\nthose who have opened issues or PRs and contributed to this success!\n\nLooking forward to the next million! \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Extension Catalog\n\nTo make it easier to access extensions we added an item to the main navigation\nand completely revamped the Extensions page. You can now see and control all\nyour Podman Desktop and Docker Desktop extensions in a single place. If you\nwant to view more details, click on an extension to see the expanded readme.\n\nWith the growing number of extensions available we've also introduced a\ncatalog to make it easy to find and install them. Check the catalog regularly\nas we hear there are some exciting new extensions sailing in!\n\n### Podman v5 (5.0.2)\n\nNow that we've had some experience and time to test our migration tools, we're\nglad to make Podman v5 a recommended upgrade for all users. Podman Desktop\nwill help ensure you don't lose any data during the migration. In particular\nmacOS users will see a performance boost as we've switched to the native Apple\nHypervisor.\n\nFind out more details in the blog announcement for \ud83e\uddad Podman version 5 here.\n\n### Multi-platform Builds\n\nSticking to one platform keeping you down? Building on the work we did in a\nrecent release to allow building images for other platforms, you can now\nselect multiple platforms at once. When you do this we will automatically\nswitch to building an image for each selected platform and then creating a\nmulti-platform manifest to package them all together.\n\nWe still have work to do to allow seamlessly working with images or manifests,\nso stay tuned for more.\n\n### Extension API Improvements\n\nWe've added support for manifests (multi-arch images) to the extension API to\ngive upcoming extensions more capabilites and even better integration into \ud83e\uddad\nPodman Desktop:\n\n  * feat: add inspectManifest API endpoint #6812\n  * feat: add createManifest API #6630\n\n## Other Notable Enhancements\n\nWe've added lots of features this release, here are some other highlights:\n\n  * feat: add quick install of extensions providing authentication #6936\n  * feat: add alias for registry entries #6839\n  * feat: make recommendation have publishDate property #6912\n  * feat: suggest extensions if building or pulling from some registries report errors #6891\n  * feat: switch to using libpodapi for listImages #6736\n  * feat: add navigateTo resources and edit container connection #6733\n  * feat: adding dashboard extension banner #6708\n  * feat: adding internal logic to manage recommended extensions based on featured extensions #6681\n\n## Notable Bug Fixes\n\nWe squashed a lot of bugs this release, including the following:\n\n  * fix: default to rootful mode if unspecified #6968\n  * fix: boolean values should be true and not 'on' using forms #6967\n  * fix: handle deletion of all Docker Desktop extensions #6964\n  * fix: skip existing installed extensions when installing a pack #6914\n  * fix: hide cpu, memory, size sliders on WSL #6878\n  * fix: container details image link #6805\n  * fix: provider card layout #6797\n  * fix: kubectl-cli update error #6759\n  * fix: make flatpak metadata compliant with flathub #6635\n  * fix: airgap mode and default for podman v5 #6633\n  * fix: hide restart action for kubernetes pods #6620\n  * fix: increase default timeout for extension activation #7053\n  * fix: use podman machine inspect to know if machine is rootful #7024\n  * fix: edit button should be visible during started and stopped #7045\n  * fix: fix dashboard UI #7006\n  * fix: handle ids with spaces for extensions #6965\n  * fix: remove request for login after getting session programmatically #6665\n  * fix: LoadingIconButton consider failed state #6997\n\n## Documentation\n\nAlong with this new version of \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop the documentation has had the\nfollowing improvement:\n\n  * docs: add compose troubleshooting doc related to authentication #6928\n\n## Community Thank You\n\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped make \ud83e\uddad Podman\nDesktop even better.
