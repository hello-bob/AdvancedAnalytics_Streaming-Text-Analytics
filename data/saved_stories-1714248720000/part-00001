They are\nbased on nucleic acids, which is a component of our DNA. While they can be\neffectively delivered by injection, such as with the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, so\nfar there has been no successful way to deliver them orally as the drugs are\ndestroyed by the harsh conditions of the gut.\n\nIn a new study published in the Journal of Nanobiotechnology, Dr Driton\nVllasaliu found that tiny particles in cows\u2019 milk called extracellular\nvesicles (EVs) could effectively protect and deliver RNA drugs following oral\nadministration.\n\n> Oral administration of drugs is the most acceptable, convenient, and usually\n> the cheapest way to take medicines as it doesn\u2019t rely on healthcare\n> professionals. The ability to deliver \u2018biological\u2019 drugs, such as RNA\n> therapies, is often regarded as the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of drug delivery but has\n> remained a stubborn challenge. This study is significant as it suggests oral\n> delivery of RNA drugs using technology based on milk EVs may be possible.\"\n>\n> Senior Lecturer in Pharmaceutics, School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences\n\nHe added: \u201cThis could lead to the disruptive and sustainable manufacturing of\naffordable and accessible oral nucleic acid therapies for a plethora of\ndiseases, leading to great societal impacts.\u201d\n\nEVs are nanoscale transporters that carry biological molecules throughout the\nbody in a protective coat, controlling and regulating the access of molecules\ninto cells. While EVs have been investigated extensively for drug delivery,\nthe use of milk EVs for oral delivery of RNA drugs has not been widely\nreported. However, milk EVs are naturally suited for gut uptake as it is\nthought that these systems evolved as a means for the transfer of biological\nmolecules from mother to child.\n\nAfter extracting the EVs from cows\u2019 milk, Dr Vllasaliu and his collaborators\nloaded them with RNA molecules to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The\nEVs were able to transport the therapeutic RNA molecules across the gut\nbarrier in advanced laboratory models of the human intestine. In animal\nstudies (mice), the RNA-loaded milk EVs reduced IBD-related inflammation.\n\nThese results demonstrate the method as a proof-of-concept success with RNA-\nbased therapies for the first time. RNA-based therapies are a new therapeutic\nmethod that has already had a significant impact in the medical world, most\nnotably with the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine.\n\nRNA therapies work by influencing the production of proteins. They can block\nthe production of harmful proteins that cause diseases or encourage the\nproduction of proteins that are missing or deficient in the body. For example,\nthe Covid-19 vaccine provides mRNA, which subsequently produces a specific\nprotein to immune cells that stimulates the production of antibodies against\nthe virus.\n\nAlthough the study utilised IBD as a disease, it is thought that, following\noral administration, milk EVs are capable of delivering RNA payloads to the\nbloodstream. This would open the doors for the oral administration of RNA\ntherapies for an incredibly broad range of diseases including heart diseases,\ndiabetes, vaccines against other viral infections, and much more. The use of\nmilk EVs is a safe method of drug delivery as many people are already\nregularly exposed to these. Importantly, unlike synthetic nanoparticles\ncurrently used for RNA delivery (by injection), milk EVs are thought to not\ntrigger responses by the immune system which lead to adverse effects.\n\nDr Vllasaliu was recently awarded a \u00a31.4m UKRI grant to advance the work on\noral delivery of RNA therapies using milk EVs, with a focus on investigating\nan effective and scalable method of loading RNA molecules into EVs without\ndamaging them.\n\n### In this story\n\n### Dr Driton Vllasaliu\n\nSenior Lecturer in Pharmaceutics\n\n  * Health\n  * Technology & Science\n\n### Related departments\n\n  * Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine\n  * School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences\n  * Institute of Pharmaceutical Science\n\n##### Connect with King\u2019s College London\n\n##### Study\n\nDegree coursesFooter navigation linkPostgraduate taughtFooter navigation\nlinkPostgraduate researchFooter navigation linkInternationalFooter navigation\nlinkSummer schoolsFooter navigation linkStudent experienceFooter navigation\nlink\n\n##### Information for\n\nNew studentsFooter navigation linkCurrent studentsFooter navigation\nlinkStaffFooter navigation linkAlumniFooter navigation link\n\n##### Facilities\n\nStudent servicesFooter navigation linkAccommodationFooter navigation\nlinkLibraries & CollectionsFooter navigation linkKing\u2019s ITFooter navigation\nlinkAcademic CalendarFooter navigation link\n\n##### Discover King's\n\nNews CentreFooter navigation linkEventsFooter navigation linkStudent's\nUnionFooter navigation linkVisit King'sFooter navigation linkWork at\nKing'sFooter navigation linkKing's communityFooter navigation link\n\n##### Contact us\n\n+44 (0)20 7836 5454King's College London Strand London WC2R 2LS United Kingdom\n\nTerms & conditionsFooter navigation linkModern Slavery Act Transparency\nStatementFooter navigation linkSite helpFooter navigation\nlinkAccessibilityFooter navigation linkSitemapFooter navigation\nlinkCookiesFooter navigation link\n\n## Cookies on this site\n\nWe use cookies, including from our partners, to enhance and personalise your\nexperience.
