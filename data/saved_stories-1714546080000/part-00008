We recently fixed several minor issues we discovered\nthat impact running the benchmark.\n\nOne issue happened when running JetStream on fast hardware where the\nresolution of time to run a subtest, as measured by the timing code,\noccasionally returned 0. This caused problems when calculating subtest scores.\nTwo other issues were found in the sub-test segmentation, where the code\ndidn\u2019t create the initial Float32Array for the test and another race condition\nissue was fixed in the task queue code for that test.\n\nTwo other issues running JetStream via the command-line were found and fixed.\nThe first was specific to the Spider Monkey command-line shell and the second\nwas to fix the Wasm command-line script when running with both the D8 and\nSpider Monkey shells.\n\nWe are introducing JetStream 2.2, which fixes the issues mentioned above and\nincludes the same subtests as JetStream 2.1 as well as the original JetStream\n2. The fixes improve the stability of the benchmark. We measured JetStream\n2.2\u2019s benchmark scores from Chrome, Safari, and Firefox and found them to be\nas stable as JetStream 2.1. Measurements were performed using a 16\u201c MacBook\nPro with an M3 processor. The system was not running other applications and\nthe browser app being tested, configured without extensions enabled, was\nrestarted before each JetStream run. A total of 10 runs were performed for\neach browser app JetStream version combination. Scores produced from JetStream\n2.2 are not comparable to other versions of any JetStream benchmark.\n\nPreviouslyRelease Notes for Safari Technology Preview 193Learn more\n\n", "frontpage": true}
