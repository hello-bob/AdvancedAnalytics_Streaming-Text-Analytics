The 8-bit Z80 architecture debuted in\n1976 and powered a small-business-PC revolution in conjunction with CP/M, also\nserving as the heart of the Nintendo Game Boy, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Radio\nShack TRS-80, the Pac-Man arcade game, and the TI-83 graphing calculator in\nvarious forms.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nHappy 30th B-Day, Game Boy: Here are six reasons why you\u2019re #1\n\nIn a letter to customers dated April 15, 2024, Zilog wrote, \"Please be advised\nthat our Wafer Foundry Manufacturer will be discontinuing support for the Z80\nproduct and other product lines. Refer to the attached list of the Z84C00 Z80\nproducts affected.\"\n\nDesigners typically use the Z84C00 chips because of familiarity with the Z80\narchitecture or to allow legacy system upgrades without needing significant\nsystem redesigns. And while many other embedded chip architectures have\nsuperseded these Z80 chips in speed, processing power, and capability, they\nremained go-to solutions for decades in products that didn't need any extra\nhorsepower.\n\nZilog will continue to manufacture the eZ80 microcontroller family, which was\nintroduced in 2001 as a faster version of the Z80 series and comes in\ndifferent physical package configurations (pin layouts).\n\n## Powering a microcomputer revolution\n\nThe 8-bit Z80 microprocessor was designed in 1974 by Federico Faggin as a\nbinary-compatible, improved version of the Intel 8080 with a higher clock\nspeed, a built-in DRAM refresh controller, and an extended instruction set. It\nwas extensively used in desktop computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s,\narcade video game machines, and embedded systems, and it became a cornerstone\nof several gaming consoles, like the Sega Master System.\n\nEnlarge / The Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 (1977), which used the Zilog Z80.\n\nSSPL/Getty Images\n\nDuring the mid-late 1970s, the Z80 became a popular CPU for S-100 bus\nmachines, which were early personal computers with a 100-pin modular bus\nsystem that allowed swapping cards to build systems based on parts from\nvarious manufacturers. Digital Research targeted the Z80 as a key platform for\nits CP/M operating system, and the association between Z80 and CP/M stuck,\npowering dozens of small business computers until the mid-1980s, when IBM PC\nclones running Microsoft's MS-DOS became the new industry standard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft's first hardware product, the Z80 SoftCard for the\nApple II in 1980, added the famous Zilog CPU to the classic personal computer\nand allowed users to run CP/M on that machine. In 1982, Bill Gates claimed\nthat SoftCard installations represented the largest single user base of CP/M\nmachines.\n\n## Last call in June 2024\n\nZilog is notably discontinuing several Z84C00 chips that are still available\nin classic 40-pin DIP packages resembling the classic Z80 CPU chips of the\n1970s. (These standalone chips include a CPU and nothing else, unlike a\nmicrocontroller, which can include RAM and other accessory devices.) The DIP\ndesign features two rows of 20 pins with a plastic package in between that\ncontains the actual embedded silicon chip, resembling the classic Z80 CPU\nchips of the 1970s.\n\nAfter June 14, Zilog will stop taking orders, manufacture whatever orders are\navailable if they are sufficient in quantity, then ship the last runs of the\nchips to resellers like Mouser Electronics and Digikey.\n\nEnlarge / A classic dual inline package (DIP) version of the Z80 from the\n1970s. It features two rows of 20 pins in a ceramic package.\n\nBenj Edwards\n\nThe discontinuation list provided by Zilog in its letter includes 13 products\nfrom the Z84C00 series, which are chips in the Z80 family that run at clock\nspeeds from 6 to 20 MHz and maintain compatibility with the original Z80\narchitecture. Here's the full list of part numbers that will be discontinued:\n\n  * Z84C0006VEG\n  * Z84C0006PEG\n  * Z84C0010PEG\n  * Z84C0008AEG\n  * Z84C0020VEG\n  * Z84C0008PEG\n  * Z84C0010AEG\n  * Z84C0008VEG\n  * Z84C0010VEG\n  * Z84C0010VEG00TR\n  * Z84C0020AEG\n  * Z84C0020PEG\n  * Z84C0006AEG\n\nSo while the Z80 architecture will stick around in eZ80 form, it appears that\nthis is the last call for newly manufactured standalone 8-bit Z80 CPU chips in\nthe classic DIP form factor. We reached out to Zilog for clarification about\nits plans for the future of the Z80 platform but did not receive a response by\npress time.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n179\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
