Away from the keyboard.\n\nI didn't answer emails. Not even the ones that would normally prompt me to\nreply right away. Not even the ones that had a clear question for me.\n\nI didn't create my usual weekly log. I didn't post on Twitter. I didn't engage\nin my usual other communication channels. I didn't try to form new\nrelationships. I didn't grow existing relationships.\n\nI let tasks accumulate with \"overdue\" labels in my to-do app.\n\nI ignored the self-imposed routines and duties such as journaling and\nreading\u2014even the ones I enjoy doing.\n\nI kept communications with friends to a bare minimum. If a friend reached out,\nI replied but only initiated a few conversations.\n\nInstead, I played with the kids and fixed some stuff around the house. I also\nwashed the car twice this week.\n\nI was expecting anxiety to show up after a few days. It's common for me to\nfeel bad when I stay away from work for more than 2 or 3 days, especially when\nI have some unresolved issues. But this anxiety never came. I didn't feel\nguilty either, a feeling I'm all too familiar with when I stop working.\n\nMy original plan for this week was to slow down and do active thinking. The\nkind you do by typing stuff on the keyboard or, if you're a romantic, with a\npencil and a notepad.\n\nBut I didn't do any active thinking.\n\nInstead, I did passive, background task thinking.\n\nThis type of thinking is unguided and unprompted, and because of that, it can\nseem a bit pointless. But it isn't pointless; it allows you to distance\nyourself enough from your work to look at it more objectively.\n\nThis time, I won't rush back to work. Instead, I will go into active thinking\nmode and build upon the foundations laid out this week.\n\nP.S. Though I have been self-employed for a long time, it was one of the first\ntimes (if not the first?) that I allowed myself to take a full, unscheduled\nweek off. It was amazing. It's an undervalued perk of my line of business, and\nI intend to repeat this experience.\n\nGreg Gilbert's notes \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
