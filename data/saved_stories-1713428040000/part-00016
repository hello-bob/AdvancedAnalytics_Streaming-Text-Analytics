For the second time, a federal court banned the hazardous\nherbicide dicamba, which has been wreaking havoc on farmers, rural communities\nand the natural world for seven long years. The Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) re-approved dicamba after the first court action. Will it do so\nonce again?\n\nWhat about dicamba makes it so hazardous that courts have overruled EPA twice?\nIt\u2019s an incredibly volatile, drift-prone weed-killer, and extremely potent as\nwell: just one teaspoon over an acre stunts tomato plants. It vaporizes while\nbeing sprayed, but also evaporates from plant surfaces and soil days after a\nspraying operation. Once the vapor is airborne, it forms clouds that drift\nlong distances to kill or injure virtually any flowering plant in its path.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what happened following Monsanto\u2019s 2016 introduction of\nsoybeans and cotton genetically engineered (GE) to withstand dicamba\u2019s killing\neffects. Widespread planting of these new GE crops triggered a dramatic\nupsurge in use during late spring and summer, when heat enhances dicamba\u2019s\nvolatility.\n\nDicamba has drifted rampantly from these GE fields, damaging millions of acres\nof non-dicamba-resistant soybeans. Wave after wave of dicamba vapor drift\nkilled fruit trees, or left them with small, unsaleable fruit. Vegetable farms\nand gardens were devastated. Trees in natural areas suffered. And beekeepers\nreported steep drops in honey production where dicamba had devasted the\nflowering plants their bees require for nectar and pollen.\n\nEchoing many of his colleagues, North Dakota pesticide expert Andrew\nThostenson stated: \u201cWe are in unprecedented, unchartered territory. We\u2019ve\nnever observed anything on this scale since we\u2019ve been using pesticides in the\nmodern era.\u201d\n\nCenter for Food Safety and scientists warned EPA about the hazards of the\ndicamba crop system as early as 2010, but were ignored. So we teamed up with\nfamily farmers and environmental groups to sue the agency as soon as it\napproved three dicamba products for \u201cover-the-top\u201d spraying on dicamba-\nresistant GE crops in 2017. That lawsuit culminated in the first court\ndecision, which rescinded those dicamba approvals in June 2020. The 9th\nCircuit Court of Appeal\u2019s emphatic ruling reflected how egregious EPA\u2019s\nviolations of pesticide law had been. Among six major findings, the court\nnoted the \u201cenormous and unprecedented damage\u201d caused by dicamba drift, and the\nextraordinary fact that \u201cEPA refused to quantify or estimate the amount of\ndamage... or even to admit that there was any damage at all.\u201d\n\nRather than accept the decision, the Trump Administration\u2019s EPA assigned a\nteam of 50, working overtime, to resurrect the court-rescinded products in\nOctober 2020. The pretext for re-approval was a few more studies, and a few\nadditional control measures. The same groups sued EPA again, and after three\nmore years of devastating dicamba damage, the second court ruling was issued\non February 6^th of this year.\n\nLike the Ninth Circuit nearly four years ago, the District Court of Arizona\ncancelled three dicamba products. The court described how the continuing high\nnumber of dicamba drift episodes demonstrated that EPA had been wrong to put\nfaith in the efficacy of the additional control measures introduced in 2020,\nand noted EPA\u2019s continuing failure to \u201cassess costs from offsite movement.\u201d\nThe Court found that EPA, in re-approving dicamba in 2020, violated the public\ninput requirement of pesticide law. This violation was \u201cvery serious\u201d because\nit deprived farmers and others of the opportunity to tell EPA about the damage\nthey incurred from dicamba drift, which could have altered the Agency\u2019s 2020\ndecision on whether not to re-approve, and if so under what conditions.\n\nWhat will happen now? Well, EPA has issued an \u201cexisting stocks\u201d order that\npermits \u201cmillions of gallons\u201d of the three dicamba products that had already\nentered commerce prior to February 6^th to be applied this year, according to\nthe (otherwise cancelled) product labels: until June 30^th on soybeans and\nJuly 31^st on cotton. On March 11^th, Bayer applied to EPA for re-registration\nof its dicamba product, XtendiMax, for the 2025 season.\n\nIn making any decision for 2025 or beyond, EPA Administrator Michael Regan and\nhis staff must finally own up to the Agency\u2019s past errors, and account for the\nenormous toll dicamba has taken on rural America and the natural world.\n\nEPA must grapple with the fates of people like the Flamm family, whose fifth-\ngeneration, southern Illinois peach and apple orchard, founded in 1888, has\nbeen hit repeatedly with dicamba drift since 2018. Dicamba curls their trees\u2019\nleaves, which fall to earth prematurely, resulting in sunburned and stunted\nfruit. As of 2022, the Flamms had lost $1 million in apple production alone,\nand as many as 6,000 trees.\n\nThen there is Iowa farmer Rob Faux, who can no longer grow bell peppers nor\nrely on his farm for income thanks to devastating dicamba damage. South Dakota\ngrower John Seward, who has seen his vegetable farm decimated several times by\nairborne dicamba, may be forced to give up farming as a result.\n\nThat dicamba could shut down a farm is no news to Bill Bader, whose peach\norchard in the Missouri Bootheel was decimated by multiple exposures to the\nherbicide over years. Bader\u2019s farm has suffered not only from airborne drift,\nbut also from dicamba in the very rain that falls on this region.\n\nAnd Arkansas beekeeper Richard Coy was forced to move his operation to\nMississippi to escape the devastating impacts of dicamba drift on the\nflowering plants his bees require for sustenance.\n\nAll told, EPA has received reports of over 80 different types of plants\ndamaged by dicamba in 29 states, including pepper, squash, pumpkin, cucumber,\nmelon, peas, potato, rice, sugarbeet, peanut and grapes, among others.\n\nSoybeans are among the most dicamba-sensitive of crops, and according to USDA,\nup to 15.6 million acres were injured in 2018 alone. Depending on\ncircumstances, dicamba drift has triggered everything from moderate damage,\nsuch as the collective $7 million in lost yields incurred by 200 Minnesota\nsoybeans farmers, to the catastrophic, exemplified by Arkansas soybeans\ndamaged so badly by dicamba as to yield just 5 bushels per acre, versus a\ntypical 50 bushel/acre harvest.\n\nIf Administrator Regan decides to re-approve dicamba, he would not only be\naffirming the rightness of putting more farmers under financial stress and out\nof business, but also of stymieing new farmers before they even get started.\nThe already daunting prospect of starting a new farm is made next-to-\nimpossible if you are unlucky enough to break ground in the Land of Dicamba.\nConsider the case of Brad Miller, who purchased a small farm near Greenfield,\nIowa in 2021. Over the following two years, he has seen his newly planted\norchard, vegetable garden, alfalfa, canola and clover come to naught thanks to\ndicamba drift: trees were stunted; vegetables plants did not produce;\nradishes, turnips and canola died; alfalfa stopped growing. Neighbors lost all\ntheir tomatoes and similar vegetables. In a complaint lodged with EPA, Mr.\nMiller \u201cexpressed shock that this would happen,\u201d that \u201csomeone would be\nallowed to spray something ... that would come onto his property and damage\nit.\u201d We agree. How could EPA permit this?\n\nThese are just a sprinkling of the many thousands of cases of dicamba damage,\nnone of them acceptable. But the impacts go still deeper. Dicamba poisons not\nonly the air, but also farming communities. Dicamba drift damage has created\ndeep divisions in rural America, with those who spray the herbicide at\nloggerheads with those whose crops are damaged by it. In the words of the\nNinth Circuit, dicamba \u201chas torn apart the social fabric of many farming\ncommunities.\u201d\n\nWhy has it taken civil society groups filing lawsuits and court decisions to\ntake dicamba off the market? One might have expected better from the Biden\nAdministration\u2019s EPA, which in March 2021 proclaimed a commitment to\n\u201cscientific integrity\u201d in regulatory decision-making. The EPA acknowledged\nthat some important decisions had been corrupted by \u201cpolitical interference\u201d\nduring Trump\u2019s reign, citing dicamba as an example. Despite this commitment,\nand a damning EPA report laying out dicamba\u2019s many harms in December 2021, the\nAgency has failed to take the necessary step and cancel dicamba\u2019s\nregistrations. That cowardice has condemned farmers to three more years of\ncrop damage.\n\nI suspect EPA\u2019s inaction has something to do with the political clout of\ndicamba manufacturers Bayer and BASF, as well as the many Big Ag commodity and\ntrade groups that are joined at the hip to these companies. And not just their\nraw political power, but their false narratives as well.\n\nOne myth \u2013 that drift is attributable to older formulations of dicamba \u2013 is\ndecisively refuted by state investigators, for instance in Indiana, who\nestablished that 92% of dicamba damage incidents were in fact due to the\nformulations approved for use on GE crops.\n\nSimilarly, the industry has sought to convince EPA that agriculture will\nsuffer without dicamba. But nothing could be further from the truth. EPA\nscientists have identified dozens of alternative herbicides registered for use\nwith soybeans and cotton, while USDA\u2019s most recent survey of soybean farmers\u2019\nchemical use (2020) includes 53 herbicides other than dicamba or glyphosate.\nFarmers managed weeds before the dicamba system was introduced in 2017, and\nthey will do so without it.\n\nScare stories about potential yield loss without dicamba are equally\nridiculous. EPA found no evidence to support Bayer\u2019s claim that dicamba\nincreases yield, while impartial university field trials showed that dicamba-\nresistant soybeans yielded less than Roundup Ready varieties. Thus, it\u2019s not\nsurprising that average soybean yields have hardly budged since 2017, after\ngrowing substantially over the prior two \u201cdicamba-less\u201d decades.\n\nThe most perverse myth of all is that dicamba is needed to prevent the\ndevelopment of weeds resistant to other herbicides \u2013 perverse because it\nobscures the real story, which is that excessive reliance on dicamba is\nalready driving evolution of dicamba-resistant weeds in multiple states. This\ndevelopment is drawing comparisons to the explosive emergence of glyphosate-\nresistant weeds with the widespread planting of Roundup Ready crops. The only\nreal solution to weed resistance is less reliance on herbicides overall, and\nin particular abandonment of the GE herbicide-resistant crop systems that are\nsuch potent promoters of weed resistance. Greater use of cultural techniques\nlike complex crop rotations and cover crops can also suppress weeds.\n\nIn short, the sky will not fall if EPA does the right thing and abstains from\nresurrecting dicamba once again.\n\nGood things, however, would certainly follow. The legions of growers who have\npurchased Monsanto\u2019s expensive dicamba-resistant soybean seeds simply to avoid\ncrop injury, for self-protection, will regain the freedom to farm the seeds of\ntheir choice, and save money as well. Small seed firms that sell those\nalternative seeds will also benefit by regaining customers they lost to Bayer,\nwhich became the world\u2019s largest seed company when it bought Monsanto in 2018.\nAnd public sector soybean breeding programs will no longer see their\nexperimental plantings devastated by dicamba drift.\n\nPerhaps most important, courageous farmers who dare to diversify the\nMidwestern landscape of corn and soybean fields by growing fruits and\nvegetables or keeping bees will once again be able to farm without fear of\nseeing their livelihoods devastated by this herbicidal menace.\n\n(Opinion columns published in The New Lede represent the views of the\nindividual(s) authoring the columns and not necessarily the perspectives of\nTNL editors.)\n\nVermont advances bill targeting oil and gas companies for climate cleanup In\n\u201ccrucial step\u201d, EPA finalizes rule to reduce cancerous chemical plant\nemissions\n\n#### Related Posts\n\nOpinion\n\n#### When measuring a farm\u2019s carbon footprint \u2013 Britain has the right answer\n\nOpinion\n\n#### Postcard from California: The global plastics crisis is a threat to human\nhealth\n\nOpinion\n\n#### New book details rise of \u201cdystopian agricultural horror show\u201d\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nReceive the latest news and environmental insights by subscribing to our\nnewsletter.\n\nParaquat Papers\n\nDonate\n\n### Opinion\n\n### When measuring a farm\u2019s carbon footprint \u2013 Britain has the right answer\n\n### Postcard from California: The global plastics crisis is a threat to human\nhealth\n\n### New book details rise of \u201cdystopian agricultural horror show\u201d\n\n### Mexico\u2019s precaution on GM corn safety is justified\n\nBack To Top\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-\nNoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n\u00a9 Environmental Working Group 2024.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
