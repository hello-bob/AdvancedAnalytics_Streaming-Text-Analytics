officials are using AI to go after wealthy payers\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 15 20248:00 AM EDTUpdated Tue, Apr 16 20244:52 PM EDT\n\nRobert Frank@robtfrank\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * In New York, the tax department reported 771,000 audits in 2022, up 56% from the previous year, according to the state Department of Taxation and Finance.\n  * At the same time, the number of auditors in New York

Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer.\nSign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nEven as the IRS makes headlines for cracking down on the wealthy, state tax\ncollectors have become even more aggressive with audits of high earners,\naccording to tax attorneys and accountants.\n\nIn New York, the tax department reported 771,000 audits in 2022 (the latest\nyear available), up 56% from the previous year, according to the state\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. At the same time, the number of auditors\nin New York declined by 5% to under 200 due to tight budgets.\n\nSo how is New York auditing more people with fewer auditors? Artificial\nIntelligence.\n\n\"States are getting very sophisticated using AI to determine the best audit\ncandidates,\" said Mark Klein, partner and chairman emeritus at Hodgson Russ\nLLP. \"And guess what? When you're looking for revenue, it's not going to be\nthe person making $10,000 a year. It's going to be the person making $10\nmillion.\"\n\nKlein said the state is sending out hundreds of thousands of AI-generated\nletters looking for revenue.\n\n\"It's like a fishing expedition,\" he said.\n\nMost of the letters and calls focused on two main areas: a change in tax\nresidency and remote work. During Covid many of the wealthy moved from high-\ntax states like California, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to low-tax\nstates like Florida or Texas.\n\nHigh earners who moved, and took their tax dollars with them, are now being\nchallenged by states who claim the moves weren't permanent or legitimate.\n\nKlein said state tax auditors and AI programs are examining cellphone records\nto see where the taxpayers spent most of their time and lived most of their\nlives.\n\n\"New York is being very aggressive,\" he said.\n\nOn remote work, states like New York that have so-called \"convenience rules\"\nargue that if you are employed by a New York company, from their New York\noffice, you owe New York taxes \u2014 even if you live and work in Colorado.\n\nMany of the wealthy in New York City who moved kept their apartments with most\nof their belongings. State tax authorities are claiming that since they didn't\nmove with all of their household items, for tax purposes they didn't actually\nmove.\n\n\"The state says, 'Well, you didn't really move since all your TV and all your\nstuff is still in New York,'\" Klein said. \"They don't understand, the wealthy\ncan buy more stuff for the Florida home. They can buy another TV.\"\n\nSign up to receive future editions of CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with\nRobert Frank.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday's biggest analyst calls: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Boeing, First Solar, Schwab & more\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
