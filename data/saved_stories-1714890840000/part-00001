There are plenty of articles, books and documentaries out\nthere which deal with the subject of East German identity far better than I\never could \u2013 but I inadvertently came across some GDR Lab Beakers which sent\nme down an East German rabbit hole. I emerged a few days later with a box full\nof Superfest Gl\u00e4ser \u2013 a nearly unbreakable and forgotten glass from East\nGermany.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Ostalige and Capitalism\n\nIt all started when I was browsing through some film developing chemicals at\none of my preferred photo shops (Fotoimpex). They usually have a small table\nnear the back wall with discounted products and the odd junk that they are\ntrying to sell off. Now this table greeted me with the smiling face of Erich\nHonecker. Upon closer inspection I realized they were selling off some east\nGerman lab beakers for \u20ac10, happily advertising them with \u201cMade in GDR\u201d and a\npicture of Honecker.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure that the beakers themselves were probably of good quality, they\nwere nowhere near worth \u20ac10 a pop. The combination of Made in GDR and the\nHonecker photo made it quite clear to me that they were purely meant for\ngullible tourists looking for a bit of ostalgie.\n\nEverybody\u2019s got their hustle \u2013 so fair game if they manage to sell them off.\nAfter I left the shop my mind wandered and I began thinking about those\nbeakers. What if they WERE special? Were they Pyrex? Did they even have Pyrex\nin the GDR? I\u2019m no glass or lab expert, how would I know if they weren\u2019t some\namazing relic from the past? I began reading up a bit into the beakers, and it\nturns out I was right: at \u20ac10 a piece they were massively overpriced.\n\nStand von Jenaer Glas auf der Leipziger Messe (R\u00f6ssing, Sep. 1952) Von\nDeutsche Fotothek, CC BY-SA 3.0 de,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7953489\n\nA quick look at eBay will tell you that you can find an entire set of these\nglasses for the same price. What I also found out was that these beakers were\nmade of Borosilicate glass (invented by German glassmaker Otto Schott in the\nlate 19th century in Jena) and are known to the English speaking world as\nPyrex. The heat resistant glass was marketed from the 1920s onward as JENAer\nGLAS, and was a household name as it was produced both for industrial and home\nuses.\n\n## Superfest \u2013 Innovation through necessity\n\nHaving fallen down the rabbit hole of Jenaer Glass, I soon stumbled upon\nGerman term which I had not heard of before: Superfest.\n\nWhat sounds like a German music festival, is actually the name of a genius\neast German glass invention, a glass which could last up to 15 times longer\nthan normal glass. The origins of Superfest, literally SuperHard \u2013 were\ntwofold. East Germany was always a frugal country with a mindset of not\nwasting the limited resources it had, and it was driven by technological\nadvances.\n\nWhile the German Democratic Republic might suffer from the stigma today that\nit was technologically backward (which was true for certain fields), it was a\ncreative and adaptive country which produced world class products and\ntechnology that\u2019s still in use today (many of today\u2019s planetariums are still\nequipped by technology invented in the GDR).\n\nEast German pubs and restaurants suffered from a problem, which every pub and\nrestaurant around the world had to deal with \u2013 their drinking glasses kept on\nbreaking. This wasn\u2019t a unique east German or socialist problem (in fact, east\nGermany inherited a long tradition of superb glass making skills after the\nwar) \u2013 it was just a common occurrence of wear and tear.\n\nWith the advancement in glass making technology, East Germany developed a\ndoctrine (which actually applied to all industry fields) in which it sought to\nuse its own resources rather than import them from the outside, secure and\nsatiate the home market, improve the glass properties to prolong product life,\nsave energy, materials and labor through the longer life of glass products,\nincrease international reputation by developing new production processes, and\nmake some hard currency through the sales of licenses and property rights. Who\nknew that glass making could sound so important to a national economy.\n\n## Ceverit \u2013 an East German success\n\nThe Zentralinstitut f\u00fcr anorganische Chemie (Central Institute for Inorganic\nChemistry) in Adlershof, Berlin began its research into hardening glass,\nspecifically through the Ion-exchange process in the late 1960s. Patents for\nhardening glass through this ion exchange process were granted to the VEB\nKombinat Technisches Glas in Ilmenau. This research was then expanded on in\n1973 in Bad Muskau by Dr. S.Schelinski, Dr. D. Patzig, K. Heinrich and B.\nGrueger. They set up small and the large scale testing facilities, which\ncoincided with the delivery of a glass blowing / forming machine from Japan in\n1975.\n\nQuick detour: Did you know that Bad Muskau is home to the F\u00fcrst-P\u00fcckler-Park\nBad Muskau, a UNESCO World Heritage site? The park was created by (or better\nfor) Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von P\u00fcckler-Muskau also more commonly\nknown as F\u00fcrst P\u00fcckler. While many english speakers might be familiar with\n\u201cNeopolitan Ice Cream\u201d \u2013 it was actually invented by the Royal Prussian court\ncook Louis Ferdinand Jungius in 1839, and named after F\u00fcrst P\u00fcckler. To this\nday, the ice cream is known as F\u00fcrst P\u00fcckler Eis in Germany.\n\nBy 1977, Dr. Patzig and his colleagues achieved their breakthrough. They\ndeveloped and patented a chemical process that made thin-walled glasses (at\nleast 5 times) less prone to breaking than conventional ones. The team built\non the research from the Institute in Adlershof, and created a new\ncommercially viable process to produce what was dubbed CV Glass (Chemically\nHardened Glass).\n\nDuring the first stage, the glass would be produced like every other normal\nglass \u2013 with machines cooling the glass and sanding off the edges etc. After\nthis process, the glasses would be loaded off into a specialized glass holding\nmachine (a one-off custom construction) which would then shuffle the glasses\noff to be heated back up to a temperature of 420C.\n\nThe heated glasses would then be sprayed with a specialized potassium chloride\nsolution that fused with the glass surface. This Potassium chloride solution\nfilled in the micro ruptures within the glass that naturally occur during\nglass production, making the glass less prone to breaking. And that\u2019s the\nwhole process of \u201cIon Exchanging\u201d. A unique feature of this hardened glass was\nthat it bounced when you dropped it, essentially giving you a second chance to\ncatch the glass.\n\nThis newly created glass was then called \u201cCeverit\u201d. Ce stood for Chemisch\n(Chemically), \u201cver\u201d for verfestigt (hardened) and the \u201cit\u201d stood for the\nsilica component.\n\n## Superfest \u2013 a design icon\n\nAt the same time, the Generalkollektiv under Paul Bittner, Fritz Keuchel and\nTilo Poitz set out to design a universally versatile glass. It needed to be as\nlight as possible, take up as little space as possible and be as durable as\ncould be.\n\nBy 1978, the Generalkollektiv came up with a glass that essentially ushered in\na new standard of \u201ccatering\u201d glass in the GDR. They had come up with a newly\npatented way to reduce the weight and increase the durability of the glass by\nintroducing a special salt in the production process. The design and\npracticality of the glasses, especially their stackability (earning them the\nnickname stapelglas) was even recognized by the GDR, earning itself the \u201cGood\nDesign\u201d award in 1980.\n\nSo, with the design and the chemical process in place, the Ministry for Glass\nand Ceramic Industries gave the order to expand the glass production plant in\nSchewpnitz with a new production hall. A total of one million marks was made\navailable, and Ceverit glass production began in April 1980.\n\nAn estimated 110 million glasses were produced in all shapes and sizes in the\nfollowing 10 years, ranging from shot glasses to half liter beer glasses.\nInterestingly enough \u2013 the name Ceverit was phased out before production began\nand replaced with \u201cSuperfest (Super Hard), as someone noticed that \u201cCeverit\u201d\nwas a conjugated form of the Latin word \u201ccevere\u201d, which translates to\n\u201cwiggling your butt while having sex\u201d. Opportunity missed in my opinion.\n\n## Capitalism has no need for durability\n\nDespite their commercial success in East Germany, the production plant in\nSchewpnitz was shut down on the 1st of July, 1990. After German reunification,\nthe plant was sold off and scrapped piece by piece \u2013 as no manufacturer had\nany interest in the technology, or in a product which would actually \u201cslow\ndown\u201d sales. And that\u2019s (just one of many small) tragedies of German\nreunification. Superfest was an invention that maybe could have only been made\nunder a \u201csocialist\u201d system \u2013 it was a product that solved a problem, but\nwasn\u2019t dependent on inflated sales figure due planned obsolescence.\n\nWhile commercial manufactures might not be interested in producing a glass\nthat\u2019s more durable, pub owners and users of Superfest glasses swear on the\nproduct. Thankfully they were produced in such quantities that they can still\nbe found for reasonable prices online and in flea markets. Grab them while you\ncan \u2013 they won\u2019t be available forever.\n\nEpilogue While the Superfest glass is by far more durable than normal glass,\nwhen they shatter \u2013 the burst into a million fine pieces and are a total\nnightmare to clean up. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of their potassium\nchloride coating or because they are made to be super thin, my advice is to\nnot drop them.\n\nAfter dropping the glass for the 5th time to get the right shot \u2013 it finally\ncouldn\u2019t handle anymore abuse\n\n#### 111 Places in Berlin \u2013 Nr 205: The Spitteleck\n\nSpittelmarkt.

How much time would it have taken to call a few glass\nmanufacturers and asked them why they don\u2019t use \u201csuperfest\u201d anymore? Is it\nbecause it was too expensive, or perhaps not easily adaptable to modern\nfactories, or because they have something better at the same price, or the\n\u201cshattering problem\u201d when it does break turns consumers off?\n\nYou may be perfectly right that evil wicked capitalism is at fault, but as it\nstands, your article reeks more of propaganda and agenda pushing than facts.\nIt would have been so easy to support with just a few phone calls.

To your first point: there are enough newspaper\narticles out there \u2013 including interviews and documentaries with former\nworkers and production managers about this very topic (which actually might be\nworth adding tbh). Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the collapse of the\nGDR is well aware of the destruction that the \u201cTreuhandanstalt\u201d wreaked over\nthe country, selling off and scrapping businesses and factories that could\nhave been saved if given enough time to adjust the initial turbulences of\nreunification. The ramifications of those decisions still affect this country\nto this day. If youd like another good example, take a look at what happend in\nRussian in the early 90\u2019s.\n\nConcerning your \u201cpropaganda and agenda pushing\u201d comment -> LOL. Im not sure\nwhat you think this blog is or who I am, but the only agenda that im pushing\nis that I write about topics that I find interesting, in this case East German\nglass production.

Consider T34 tanks for instance \u2013 brutal\nquantity in lieu of quality is what soviets did too, whenever it made sense\nfor em. Simply put, it\u2019s cheaper for everyone to make more glasses (or tanks)\nthan make em durable \u2013 for as long you can trade in the manufacturing\ncapacity.\n\nCapitalism can definitely produce incentive for longevity, but only under\ncomparable constraint \u2013 input resource supply is so scarce you can\u2019t afford\nthe waste, and thus have to offset by better process. That alone drives demand\nfor durable goods.\n\nFor genuine conspiracy we\u2019d need to talk cartels. Those happen too, from light\nbulbs to LCD screens, but tend to be so short lived it\u2019s a stretch to say\nthose are all that rampant ailment of capitalism.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for my unbreakable phone screen. It can easily be made,\npeople even did until 2010s or so. However scratchable screens (inevitable\naesthetic tradeoff) are not all that mass-marketable anymore. This might\nchange once e-waste policy (ie taxes on it) tightens up.\n\n  4.
