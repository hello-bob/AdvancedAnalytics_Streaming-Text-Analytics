It wasn't and still isn't, unsurprisingly. But now Apple is doubling down\non the 8GB shizzle, claiming that it's \"suitable for many tasks\", including\nbrowsing, video streaming and even \"light\" video and image editing.\n\nIt remains, of course, the case that many entry-level models of Mac computers\nare still configured with just 8GB. That includes all MacBook Air laptops, the\nMac Mini and most egregiously of all, the MacBook Pro 14.\n\nThat might have been OK were it not for the fact that Apple charges a\nridiculous $200 to upgrade any of those machines from 8GB to 16GB. And thanks\nto the unified memory architecture of Apple silicon, you're stuck with\nwhatever factory config you go for. More RAM cannot be added at a later date.\n\nSpeaking to IT Home, Apple rep Evan Buyze, Mac product marketing team leader,\ndoubled down on the notion that 8GB is just dandy for many Mac users,\nexplaining that 8GB of memory is suitable for many tasks, such as browsing the\ninternet, doing some streaming, and messaging. To that was added, slightly\nless plausibly, light editing of photos and videos and casual gaming.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nWhat exactly \"light video editing\" or \"casual gaming\" really means is hard to\npin down. Does casual gaming mean tolerating 15fps, for instance? Whatever,\nhere's the thing. Even if there is such a thing as light video editing or\ncasual gaming and even if an 8GB Mac does those tasks tolerably well, 8GB\nstill isn't acceptable.\n\nThat's because a Mac with 8GB can easily run out of memory just browsing the\nweb. That's particularly true with Chrome, which just so happens to be the\nmost popular browser around.\n\nRegular Chrome users will know what a memory hog Chrome can be. Right now, I\nhave about 15 tabs open, which is actually pretty low for me. Often, my tab\ncount can blow well past 50 in multiple windows.\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHandily, Chrome shows you memory usage if you mouse-over a given tab. And\nthree of my current tabs are chewing up over 500MB each. So, that's 1.5GB for\njust three Chrome tabs. Add a couple more, plus MacOS's underlying memory\nfootprint for just being up and running and you're bang out of RAM.\n\nYour next machine\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nBest gaming PC: The top pre-built machines. Best gaming laptop: Great devices\nfor mobile gaming.\n\nOverall, I'm using 12.5GB of memory and the only application I have open is\nChrome. Oh, and did I mention I'm typing this on a 16GB MacBook Air? I used to\nhave an 8GB Apple silicon Air and to be frank it was a nightmare, constantly\nrunning out of memory just browsing the web.\n\nThat's the point most observers miss. The usual narrative is that 8GB isn't\ngood enough for serious workflows. It isn't but that completely misses the\nmore important point. 8GB isn't even enough for browsing the web.\n\nMac laptops and computers have lots of appealing attributes. I won't go into\nthem here for fear of being set upon en masse by my co-workers and pummelled\ninto a quivering puddle of blood and hair. I do, it has to be said, have\nsomething of a track record of evangelising the virtues of Macs for basic day\nto day tasks.\n\nBut even I, most fanboyish of fanboys for Mac computers in a certain non-\ngaming context, will tell you that 8GB being \"suitable\", even for light or\ncasual computing\", is complete and utter nonsense.
