Unfortunately, developing tacit\nknowledge is usually bottlenecked by apprentice-master relationships. Tacit\nKnowledge Videos could widen this bottleneck. This post is a Schelling point\nfor aggregating these videos\u2014aiming to be The Best Textbooks on Every Subject\nfor Tacit Knowledge Videos. Scroll down to the list if that's what you're here\nfor. Post videos that highlight tacit knowledge in the comments and I\u2019ll add\nthem to the post. Experts in the videos include Stephen Wolfram, Holden\nKarnofsky, Andy Matuschak, Jonathan Blow, Tyler Cowen, George Hotz, and\nothers.\n\n# What are Tacit Knowledge Videos?\n\nSamo Burja claims YouTube has opened the gates for a revolution in tacit\nknowledge transfer. Burja defines tacit knowledge as follows:\n\n> Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can\u2019t properly be transmitted via verbal\n> or written instruction, like the ability to create great art or assess a\n> startup. This tacit knowledge is a form of intellectual dark matter,\n> pervading society in a million ways, some of them trivial, some of them\n> vital. Examples include woodworking, metalworking, housekeeping, cooking,\n> dancing, amateur public speaking, assembly line oversight, rapid problem-\n> solving, and heart surgery.\n\nIn my observation, domains like housekeeping and cooking have already seen\nmany benefits from this revolution. Could tacit knowledge in domains like\nresearch, programming, mathematics, and business be next? I\u2019m not sure, but\nmaybe this post will help push the needle forward.\n\nFor the purpose of this post, a Tacit Knowledge Video is any video that\ncommunicates \u201cknowledge that can\u2019t properly be transmitted via verbal or\nwritten instruction\u201d. Here are some examples:\n\n  * Neel Nanda, who leads the Google DeepMind mechanistic interpretability team, has a playlist of \u201cResearch Walkthroughs\u201d. AI Safety research is discussed a lot around here. Watching research videos could help instantiate what AI research really looks and feels like.\n  * GiveWell has public audio recordings of its Board Meetings from 2007\u20132020. Participants include Elie Hassenfeld, Holden Karnofsky, Timothy Ogden, Rob Reich, Tom Rutledge, Brigid Slipka, Cari Tuna, Julia Wise, and others. Influential business meetings are not usually made public. I feel I have learned some about business communication and business operations, among other things, by listening to these recordings.\n  * Andy Matuschak recorded himself studying Quantum Mechanics with Dwarkesh Patel and doing research. Andy Matushak \u201chelped build iOS at Apple and led R&D at Khan Academy\u201d. I found it interesting to have a peek into Matushak\u2019s spaced repetition practice and various studying heuristics and habits, as well as his process of digesting and taking notes on papers.\n\nFor information on how to best use these videos, Cedric Chin and Jacob\nSteinhardt have some potentially relevant practical advice. Andy Matushak also\nhas some working notes about this idea generally. @Jared Peterson, who\n\"researches and trains tacit knowledge\" recommends the book Working Minds\n\"which teaches how to do Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) which is a major\ninterviewing technique for uncovering tacit knowledge.\"\n\n# How to Submit\n\nShare links to Tacit Knowledge Videos below! Share them frivolously! These\nvideos are uncommon\u2014the bottleneck to the YouTube knowledge transfer\nrevolution is quantity, not quality. I will add the shared videos to the post.\nHere are the loose rules:\n\n  1. Recall a video that you\u2019ve seen that communicates tacit knowledge\u2014\u201cknowledge that can\u2019t properly be transmitted via verbal or written instruction\u201d. A rule of thumb for sharing: could a reader find this video through one or two undirected YouTube searches? If not, share it.\n  2. Post the title and the URL of the video.\n  3. Provide information indicating why the expert in the video is credible. (However, don\u2019t let this last rule stop you from sharing a video! Again\u2014quantity, not quality.)^[1]\n\nTo make the comments easy to navigate, please format your comment as\nfollows:^[2]\n\n> Domain: Programming, Game Design\n>\n> Link: Programming livestream VODs\n>\n> Person: Jonathan Blow\n>\n> Background: Creator of Braid and The Witness.\n>\n> Why: Blow livestreams himself coding games and creating a programming\n> language. I imagine people who do similar things would find his livestreams\n> interesting.\n\n# List of Tacit Knowledge Videos\n\n(last updated 04-16-2024)\n\nTo receive ~monthly updates with lists of new videos, add your email to this\nemail list.\n\n## Software Engineering\n\n### Machine Learning\n\n  * Andrej Karpathy, Neural Networks: Zero to Hero.\n\n    * 10+ years: Stanford PhD, research scientist at OpenAI & Tesla.

Why: The channel is nice because he includes all his\nfailures, and goes into articulate detail on how he debugged them. I feel like\nlearned some implicit knowledge about repair strategies. I particularly\nrecommend the series of videos in which he purchases, accidentally sets on\nfire, and revives an ancient boom lift truck.

Why: The\nYouTube channel of Andrew Camarata communicates a great deal about small\nbusiness, heavy machinery operation and construction. Some of it he narrates\nwhat he\u2019s doing, but he mostly just does it, and you say \u201cOh, I never realized\nI could do that with a Skid Steer\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s how to keep a customer happy\u201d.\nLots of implicit knowledge about accomplishing heavy engineering projects\nbetween an hour and a week long. Of course, if you\u2018re looking for lessons that\nwould be helpful for an ambitious person in Silicon Valley, it will only help\nin a very meta way.

She\nnarrates how she explores learning someone's technique or strategy.\n\nMore than any particular technique, these videos show someone's learning\nprocess.

She also won the SFX category at the world\nBodypainting championships at least once so I think she\u2019s pretty indisputably\nworld-class at it.\n\nHer entire YouTube channel demonstrates a tonne of her tacit knowledge with\nrespect to sculpting and SFX in general, but this is one good example of her\nshowing her work on a small sculpture:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1NwYbC5t-9w?si=r0zGFKQXIiQkoLac\n\nReply\n\n1Parker Conley17d\n\nThanks!
