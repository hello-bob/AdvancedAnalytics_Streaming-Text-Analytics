Regards, Politics Stack Exchange\n> Moderation Team\n\nThis is the third time I've received a message like this. The first was for\nusing the word \"fascist\" to describe a politician who used violence to force\neveryone to obey his religious beliefs. It was also for pointing out the Nazis\nwere right wing. The second time was for complaining about someone else\nwanting to exterminate a race. The third time was for mentioning that nations\ncould have chosen to bomb Israel. Are you seeing a pattern?\n\nCan you guess the context to the comment mentioned above? It was about what\nother nations are doing to help Palestinians escape from Palestine. \"Why don't\nthey just donate money to help them get out?\" one user asked. \"Because no\namount of money would open the border crossing. You'd need bombs for that.\"\nBanned.\n\nOn Stack Exchange it's entirely kosher, but not halal, to talk about Israel or\nother nations dropping bombs on Palestine. But if you even dare to mention the\npossibility that a nation could drop one on Israel as well, you are a\nterrorist just for mentioning it, and you get banned.\n\n\"Why is Germany the country that Nicaragua is suing at the ICJ?\" reads another\nquestion. \"Because Germany is supporting war crimes: here is the evidence.\" -\nnegative 2 votes at the time of writing this, and the person who wrote it is\nbanned too. \"Because Nicaragua is attention-seeking and hopes to curry the\nfavour of the high-ranking anti-German politicians who support Palestine.\" -\npositive 5 votes. Presumably, people who would have downvoted this are already\nbanned.\n\nNaturally, I figured this was just one bad volunteer moderator, and appealed\nto Stack Exchange itself, an option provider on all moderator-applied\nsuspensions. Here's their response:\n\n> I have looked into your situation and are happy to address your concerns. In\n> your correspondence you mentioned concerns over bias in the enforcement of\n> our Code of Conduct. I investigated this situation fully and hope I can\n> provide some clarity and guidance moving forward.\n>\n> During my investigation I saw a couple of comments that were discussed the\n> the moderator messages. Moderators have given you specific instances which I\n> can affirm are violations of our Code of Conduct. Such as:\n>\n\n>> The problem is not a lack of money. No amount of money will open the border\ncrossing. Bombs will, but who's going to risk that? One day where the\nPalestinian people tried to defend themselves was October 7 2023.\n\n>\n> These comments violate our CoC, specifically our dangerous speech and\n> extremism policies. Please understand that we at Stack Exchange do not\n> condone the violence that occurred on October 7th 2023. Historically we do\n> not allow statements of direct support of acts of terrorism or mass violence\n> as they fall under the intimidation and harassment policy in our CoC.

In the future, please do not use\n> rhetorical questions to allude to the usage or advocacy of violence as\n> further violations could result in longer suspensions being applied to your\n> profile.\n\nCan you guess the context for the second quote? That's right: it was \"Why\ndidn't Palestine take more drastic actions to defend itself?\" And naturally,\nthe answer is \"because look what happens when it does.\" Straightforward\nquestion, straightforward answer. Yes, it's a quick half-answer in the\ncomments section, but it's not like that's particularly unusual on SE.\n\nSo, it's systemic. I guess the only question left is whether to DMCA my own\ncontributions on the way out or not. Remember that time Stack Exchange fucked\nup the Creative Commons licensing and removed their own permission to\nreproduce contributed content?\n\n", "frontpage": false}
