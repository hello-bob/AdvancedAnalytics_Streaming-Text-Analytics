But the text has poor information scent and is bad for accessibility.\nWith a little effort, transform this filler copy into descriptive labels that\nhelp users confidently predict what the next page will be.\n\nSome trends are subtler than others. Much like low-contrast text, the use of\nLearn More as a standalone link label has been quietly trending. The web now\nhas an abundance of links with this generic label, largely tacked on to\ninformation of secondary or tertiary importance. (A Google search finds 1.4\nbillion instances of this term, though some admittedly might be from proper\nuse of the term in general content.) Typically, these links are placed after a\nshort paragraph that briefly introduces a topic, feature, or service, so that\nthe Learn More points the visitor to the detail page. Usually, these links are\nnot the main calls to action on the page, which partly explains why this\ncopywriting detail doesn\u2019t get as much attention or A/B testing as other calls\nto action.\n\nMost of you have surely seen this pattern. Below is an example of what we\u2019re\ntalking about:\n\nSmartthings.com: As a standalone label, Learn More lacks descriptive keywords\nto help users understand what to expect from the next page.\n\nThe proliferation of Learn More links is likely mobile driven: mobile-\noptimized sites are getting better at deferring secondary content. That is,\ninstead of making all the details available by default, headings and short\nparagraphs provide an easy-to-scan, digestible overview of essential content.\nWhen users decide they want more information, they can tap a link or expand an\naccordion to get to the less important content. This design pattern is\ndefinitely beneficial on mobile, and our article is a critique of the link\nlabel only, and not of the general practice of deferring less important\ncontent.\n\nWe\u2019ll first look at why this phrase is problematic when used by itself, and\nwhy it\u2019s worthwhile to be more descriptive. Then we\u2019ll explore how to figure\nout what to say instead, with examples of sites that have done it well. You\u2019ll\neven have a chance to try rewriting labels yourself. For that final part, we\nrecommend you have a writing utensil handy, because, yes, there will be a\nquiz.\n\n## In This Article:\n\nWhy Learn More Is a Problem\n\n  * Why Learn More Is a Problem\n  * What to Say Instead: 3 Solutions\n  * Examples of Effective Alternatives\n  * Now You Try\n  * Conclusion\n\n## Why Learn More Is a Problem\n\nLet us first acknowledge that if the text that precedes the link makes it\nobvious what\u2019s to come, then a Learn More label isn\u2019t devastating to the user\nexperience. Remember, this article is about how to do better. Descriptive text\ndoes help clarify and set expectations. However, even in that situation, there\nis often ambiguity about the scope of the link. Does the link go to a full\npage dedicated to the topic? Or does it lead to a landing page where the user\nwill have to choose from a dozen other links? Does it point to an external\nsite or an app store? These are all questions that an informative link label\ncan help answer.\n\nThe phrase is most dangerous when used alone because of its ambiguity and poor\ninformation scent. It creates uncertainty, because users don\u2019t know what to\nexpect if they click, or whether it will be worthwhile to wait for a new page\nto load. That feeling of uncertainty can cause users to hesitate and shift\ninto a state of cognitive strain. Some may resort to page parking for\nevaluating unclear links.\n\nIf a webpage has several Learn More links, users may wonder if the links point\nto the same page or to different pages. Once again, uncertainty and cognitive\nstrain have a negative impact on the user experience. Worse, when they do\npoint to the same page, users may waste clicks and be disappointed to discover\nthat the same page is provided. That adds disappointment and confusion to the\nmix.\n\nFinally, as a standalone link, the lack of descriptive keywords is a serious\nproblem for accessibility. People who are visually impaired and using a screen\nreader or magnifier aren\u2019t able to quickly glance back to the preceding-\nparagraph text to see what the Learn More link may refer to. Most screen-\nreader users will hear a list of links read to them, with no visual context to\nhelp them make sense of different generic Learn More or Read More links.\n\nSo, if you use descriptive labels instead of standalone Learn More text, your\ncopy will benefit in several ways:\n\n  * Links will be more accessible.\n  * Links will be more enticing to users and potentially more persuasive.\n  * Users will feel more confident as they click from page to page.\n  * More keywords on the page will help search-engine optimization.\n  * Meaningful links will stand alone and help users who are scanning the page.\n\n## What to Say Instead: 3 Solutions\n\nNow that you\u2019re on board with rewriting those link labels, let\u2019s see some\nsuggestions for what to write instead. Below are the three most common\napproaches.\n\n### Option 1: Use keywords that describe the link\u2019s destination.\n\nThis is the most common and, typically, the best approach. To do this, you\nhave to look at the destination page and see what it\u2019s about. Don\u2019t skip that\nstep. When rewriting the labels, remember to try to front-load the link text\nby putting the most relevant keywords at the beginning of the text. For\nexample, instead of \u201cLearn How Professional Chefs Cook Squash\u201d, try \u201cCook\nSquash Like The Pros.\u201d Front-loading text makes it much faster for users to\nscan the page and decide what to do next.\n\n### Option 2. Retain the Learn More format and add descriptive keywords.\n\nThere are times when it is acceptable to retain Learn more, if you qualify it\nwith information about what is to be learned (e.g., Learn more about our\nservices). The downsides to this approach are space constraints for the longer\nlabel, and reduced scannability because the relevant keywords appear at the\nend instead of the beginning of the phrase. Nevertheless, a long link does\ncreate a larger target, which is faster for users to click and tap than a\nsmall target. In some cases, you might try only linking the descriptive\nphrase, for example: \u201cLearn more: How a Link is a Promise.\u201d\n\n### Option 3: Convert the preceding-paragraph heading into the only link.\n\nIf the heading of the preceding paragraph is obviously styled to look like a\nlink and the copy clearly describes what the link points to, then a Learn More\nlink is probably redundant.\n\n## Examples of Effective Alternatives\n\nIn each of the examples below, you can see how easy it would have been for the\ndesigners to fall back on Learn More or Read More. Instead, they put a bit of\nextra effort into the copy, and it pays off. Use these as inspiration for your\nown sites.\n\nPugetsound.edu: The three featured stories might otherwise all have had a Read\nMore or Learn More link below them. Instead, descriptive links clarify what\nusers will see if they click. For example, Class of 2019 Facebook group, and\nRead Elena\u2019s updates on the SOAN blog.Rei.com email: Users can scan the orange\nunderlined links and know what to expect, even without reading the larger\nheadings in white. Instead of Learn More, REI used descriptive and enticing\nlabels: More camping hacks, Read the blog, and Find camping & hiking\nclasses.Barclays.co.uk: Users might not have expected to be able to donate to\ncharity using an app. Or they might not know that Barclays Pingit is a mobile\napp to send and receive money. Either way, the About the app button helps\nteach users about the service.Mq.edu.au: Using the 3rd approach from above,\nthis page uses the headings as links instead of creating repetitive links to\nlearn more about each topic.\n\n## Now You Try\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen how to do better than just Learn More, it\u2019s time to try\nit yourself. (I wasn\u2019t kidding about that quiz. After all, we are in the\nbusiness of giving UX exams, you know. Sorry, this exercise doesn\u2019t count for\ncredit.)\n\nBelow are a few examples of copy and a description of the destination page.\nTry your hand at coming up with a better link label. As with all writing,\nthere isn\u2019t just one right answer. (But we have included some of our own\nsuggestions below; just don\u2019t look before you\u2019ve tried on your own first.)\n\n### Part 1: First, read the original copy below and guess what the Learn More\nlinks might lead to.\n\nThis step should help put you in the shoes of your users, who don\u2019t know what\neach page is about before they click. Note that headings are in bold and\ncapitalization is retained from the original website.\n\n### Part 2: Next, using the information from the destination page, try\nrewriting the link label.\n\nOriginal Copy| From the destination page| Your Alternative  \n---|---|---  \nA.| Plays Well with OthersIn addition to SmartThings' own family of sensors,\nyou can also control hundreds of connected devices from other brands through\nthe SmartThings open platform.LEARN MORE| An Open Smart Home Platform...In\naddition to SmartThings own family of sensors, the products listed below are\nexamples of officially certified devices that deliver the best customer\nexperience.  \nB.| Build.
