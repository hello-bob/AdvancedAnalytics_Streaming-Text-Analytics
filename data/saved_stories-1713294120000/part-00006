Who Are They Helping?\n\nSmall start-ups and big professional platforms are using AI to find and\nrecruit new hires\u2014but these tools can reinforce bias\n\nBy Shubham Agarwal\n\nMoor Studio/Getty Images\n\nSeattle-based user experience consultant Torrey Podmajersky received a cold\ne-mail in January from a recruiter called Jennie Johnson. The message said\nJohnson had created a career profile for Podmajersky and suggested a few\nmatching openings, but the profile was too broad and left out several\nimportant pieces of her professional history. Podmajersky, who hadn\u2019t been job\nhunting in the first place, figured it was a scam.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she scrolled to the bottom that she discovered Johnson wasn\u2019t\neven a human. The e-mail had come from an artificial intelligence bot; the\ncompany behind it described it as an \u201cAI representation of an elite career\ncoach.\u201d \u201c[I felt] a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach,\u201d Podmajersky\nrecalls, \u201cbecause I recognized that it\u2019s designed to make someone feel seen,\nspecial, cared for, advocated for\u2014and all of that is a lie.\u201d\n\nDouglas Hamilton, a retired sales and marketing executive in Albany, N.Y.,\nalso got a Jennie Johnson e-mail. \u201cWrong roles, wrong industry, wrong level,\u201d\nHamilton says of the bot\u2019s job digest. He had opened the e-mail because the\nrecruiter\u2019s headshot, an unusual inclusion in hiring correspondence, caught\nhis eye. That photograph, too, was artificially generated.\n\nThe Jennie Johnson bot, part of a tool developed by the generative AI company\nHyperleap, has sent unsolicited e-mails to many professionals in the past few\nmonths. It\u2019s just one example of how recruiting platforms, from small start-\nups to LinkedIn, are increasingly using AI to find, filter and recruit new\nhires. As these tools become more sophisticated, experts worry they may make\nnavigating the employment market even more dehumanizing for job seekers\u2014and\ncould reinforce existing biases.\n\nHyperleap, based in Park City, Utah, created Jennie Johnson as an online job\nsearch tool that sends automated job digests to users who sign up for the\nservice. The company\u2019s chief operating officer, Kevin Holbert, says this AI\nsystem scours online job boards and businesses\u2019 websites to build a searchable\ndatabase. It then combs through a person\u2019s LinkedIn profile, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and work\nhistory and matches this information to its database to recommend\nopportunities.\n\nAlthough anyone can sign up for the service, people such as Podmajersky and\nHamilton got their unsolicited e-mail during Hyperleap\u2019s early campaigns to\nacquire new users in partnership with a jobs platform, according to Holbert.\nAnyone who registered on that platform received alerts from the Jennie Johnson\nbot as well, he says\u2014though neither Podmajersky nor Hamilton recall signing up\nfor any jobs platform around that time. The company has since \u201cstopped this\npartnership,\u201d Holbert says. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to clean out our list [and]\nremoving any users who are not engaging.\u201d\n\nServices like Jennie Johnson are a natural expansion of automated technology\nthat recruiters have been using for more than a decade. This includes\napplicant tracking software that screens r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for keywords, says Regan\nGross of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), who advises human\nresources professionals on recruitment practices. More than 97 percent of\nFortune 500 companies already rely on such tools to screen applicants. And a\n2022 survey by SHRM found that 42 percent of surveyed organizations with 5,000\nor more employees reported using automation or AI in HR-related activities,\nincluding recruitment and hiring.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### AI Chatbots Will Never Stop Hallucinating\n\nLauren Leffer\n\n  * ### Chatbots Struggle to Answer Medical Questions in Widely Spoken Languages\n\nAnanya\n\n  * ### Inside the Race to Protect Artists from Artificial Intelligence\n\nRachel Feltman & Lauren Leffer\n\n  * ### What Google\u2019s New AI Fruit Fly Can Teach Us about Real Behavior\n\nCharlotte Hu\n\nGross sees potential benefit in some of these tools but says they have their\nlimits. For example, while AI applications can help with basic tasks such as\nsummarizing an applicant\u2019s skills, they cannot yet capture personality and\nunique traits that are important to recruiters. Gross predicts that widespread\nAI use will force job seekers \u201cto find [new] ways to set themselves apart.\u201d\n\nAI applications are steadily automating more and more of the hiring process.\nFor example, like Jennie Johnson, larger platforms such as LinkedIn can now\nautomatically match candidates\u2019 work experience and skills to available jobs.\nSome, including ZipRecruiter, also offer anthropomorphized chatbots that can\nrespond to queries about a listed job, reach out to potential candidates and\nconduct personality assessments. New generative AI even lets employers\noutsource entire portions of the recruitment process to algorithms, including\nsearching for candidates and conducting preprogrammed interviews.\n\nHolbert says Hyperleap built a human persona for its AI to make it \u201cmore\nrelatable\u201d so that people would \u201cact more natural.\u201d Zahira Jaser, who\nresearches organizational behavior at the University of Sussex Business School\nin England, says that a lack of clarity in an automated hiring process can\nhave the opposite effect, however.\n\nJaser contends that uncertainty about whether one is dealing with a human\naffects candidates\u2019 performance during the hiring process\u2014and can also prevent\nrecruiters from getting an accurate read on candidates\u2019 normal behavior. In\nher research on AI-based interviews, Jaser has found that applicants often\nbehave less naturally if they think they\u2019re talking to an online bot instead\nof a human; they tend to keep a fixed gaze on the screen, for example, and\navoid moving their hands.\n\nJaser\u2019s research also indicates that AI-based interviews often penalize\ncandidates who are first-generation graduates, speak with an accent or come\nfrom a less privileged background. Without enough human oversight, these AI-\nbased recruitment systems can reinforce existing biases, Jaser adds. \u201cAdopting\nthese kinds of systems might be great from a cost-control perspective but, if\nunchecked, might create issues with diversity and inclusion,\u201d she says.\n\nDevelopers of AI recruitment tools have often said their algorithms have the\npotential to be more objective than humans\u2014if these tools are trained on data\nthat are inclusive and diverse enough. But such claims are misleading and show\na lack of understanding about how bias operates in the real world, says\nEleanor Drage, an AI ethics researcher at the University of Cambridge.\n\nBecause AI-based recruitment systems are trained on past hiring trends and\npractices, which have often been found to be biased and discriminatory, they\nwill invariably repeat those same patterns by constructing associations\nbetween words\u2014even if companies explicitly exclude factors such as race and\ngender, Drage says.\n\nThough the hype surrounding these AI recruitment tools is high right now, many\nHR departments are waiting for them to prove their efficacy before adopting\nthem, Jaser says. Hopefully, she adds, they won\u2019t be adopted en masse unless\nor until they are proven to be useful, fair and reliable.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nShubham Agarwal is a freelance technology journalist who has written for the\nWall Street Journal, Business Insider, Fast Company, the Verge, MIT Technology\nReview, Wired, and more.\n\nMore by Shubham Agarwal\n\n# Popular Stories\n\nSpace Exploration April 12, 2024\n\n##\n\nSuspected Space-Junk Strike in Florida Signals New Era of Orbital Debris\n\nThree years ago astronauts threw out the largest piece of trash ever tossed\nfrom the International Space Station.
