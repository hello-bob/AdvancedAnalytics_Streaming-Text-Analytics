That\ncomes from two factors: First, many of the country\u2019s firms have held onto\nproperties for decades, each year writing down the cost of fixed assets due to\nannual depreciation, a common accounting practice. But at the same time,\nproperty prices have soared.\n\nThe result is that billions in value can be unlocked by pressuring companies\nto sell off these holdings, a tactic that activist funds are now employing.\nThis was illustrated last week when Japan developer Mitsui Fudosan announced\nit would aim to sell off \u00a52 trillion in real estate assets over the next three\nyears as part of a new business plan \u2014 just two months after news that New\nYork-based activist hedge fund Elliott Management had built a stake in the\ncompany.\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
