Integration fails every time as well even though the\n> app says the integration has been installed. All other buttons such as\n> \u201cWrite a review\u201d are nonfunctional. Very disappointed.\n\nctlockey , 04/22/2024\n\n### Stuck loading the Pro upsell\n\n> Looks really promising but until they fix this loading screen for the Pro\n> upsell the app is literally unusable.\n\n## App Privacy\n\nThe developer, Alberto Moral, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may\ninclude handling of data as described below.
