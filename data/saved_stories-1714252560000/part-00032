Moon landers typically survive for one\nlunar day \u2013 about two Earth weeks \u2013 because night on the moon is so cold that\nit ruins spacecraft batteries and electronics.\n\nVery few moon landers are built to survive nighttime temperatures on the moon,\nwhich can dip as low as -133\u00b0C (-208\u00b0F). SLIM is no exception to this \u2013 it has\nno heaters or special insulation designed to keep the spacecraft\u2019s electronics\nwarm.\n\nThe original plan was that lunar night would mark the end of the lander\u2019s\nmission, so when night fell less than two weeks after SLIM\u2019s 19 January\nlanding, nobody expected it to wake up again. But on 25 February, the sun rose\nover SLIM\u2019s resting place near the south pole of the moon, and it turned back\non.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprised, SLIM\u2019s operating crew on Earth got to work instructing the lander\nto take images and measurements of its surroundings until the next lunar\nnight, when surely the mission would truly be over. In late March, the sun\nrose once again, and once again the lander turned on and began transmitting\ndata back to Earth.\n\nBy all metrics, that made the mission a shocking success, even after a\ndifficult landing that left the spacecraft sitting on a slant. It still had\nanother surprise waiting, though \u2013 on 23 April, after a third lunar night,\nSLIM was resuscitated once again.\n\nThe official SLIM account on X posted, \u201cSLIM has maintained its primary\nfunctions even after three overnight stays, which was not anticipated in its\ndesign.\u201d A new picture of the surface of the moon, accompanying that post,\nindicates that the lander is hard at work once again gathering data that will\nnot only help us understand the moon, but also how to build a spacecraft that\ncan survive lunar night.\n\n#### Sign up to our Launchpad newsletter\n\nVoyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month.\n\nSign up to newsletter\n\nTopics:\n\n  * the moon/\n  * spacecraft\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Sign up to our weekly newsletter\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!
