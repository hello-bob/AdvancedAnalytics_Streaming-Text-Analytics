(Image: NCCR\nSPIN)\n\nThe race to build a practical quantum computer is well underway. Researchers\naround the world are working on a huge variety of qubit technologies. So far,\nthere is no consensus on what type of qubit is most suitable for maximizing\nthe potential of quantum information science.\n\nQubits are the foundation of a quantum computer: they handle the processing,\ntransfer and storage of data. To work correctly, they have to both reliably\nstore and rapidly process information. The basis for rapid information\nprocessing is stable and fast interactions between a large number of qubits\nwhose states can be reliably controlled from the outside.\n\nFor a quantum computer to be practical, millions of qubits must be\naccommodated on a single chip. The most advanced quantum computers today have\nonly a few hundred qubits, meaning they can only perform calculations that are\nalready possible (and often more efficient) on conventional computers..\n\n#### Electrons and holes\n\nTo solve the problem of arranging and linking thousands of qubits, researchers\nat the University of Basel and the NCCR SPIN rely on a type of qubit that uses\nthe spin (intrinsic angular momentum) of an electron or a hole. A hole is\nessentially a missing electron in a semiconductor. Both holes and electrons\npossess spin, which can adopt one of two states: up or down, analogous to 0\nand 1 in classical bits. Compared to an electron spin, a hole spin has the\nadvantage that it can be entirely electrically controlled without needing\nadditional components like micromagnets on the chip.\n\nAs early as 2022, Basel physicists were able to show that the hole spins in an\nexisting electronic device can be trapped and used as qubits. These \u201cFinFETs\u201d\n(fin field-effect transistors) are built into modern smartphones and are\nproduced in widespread industrial processes. Now, a team led by Dr. Andreas\nKuhlmann has succeeded for the first time in achieving a controllable\ninteraction between two qubits within this setup.\n\n#### Fast and precise controlled spin-flip\n\nA quantum computer needs \u201cquantum gates\u201d to perform calculations. These\nrepresent operations that manipulate the qubits and couple them to each other.\nAs the researchers report in the journal Nature Physics, they were able to\ncouple two qubits and bring about a controlled flip of one of their spins,\ndepending on the state of the other's spin \u2013 known as a controlled spin-flip.\n\u201cHole spins allow us to create two-qubit gates that are both fast and high-\nfidelity. This principle now also makes it possible to couple a larger number\nof qubit pairs,\u201d says Kuhlmann.\n\nThe coupling of two spin qubits is based on their exchange interaction, which\noccurs between two indistinguishable particles that interact with each other\nelectrostatically. Surprisingly, the exchange energy of holes is not only\nelectrically controllable, but strongly anisotropic. This is a consequence of\nspin-orbit coupling, which means that the spin state of a hole is influenced\nby its motion through space.\n\nTo describe this observation in a model, experimental and theoretical\nphysicists at the University of Basel and the NCCR SPIN combined forces. \u201cThe\nanisotropy makes two-qubit gates possible without the usual trade-off between\nspeed and fidelity,\u201d Dr. Kuhlmann says in summary.\n\n\u201cQubits based on hole spins not only leverage the tried-and-tested fabrication\nof silicon chips, they are also highly scalable and have proven to be fast and\nrobust in experiments.\u201d The study underscores that this approach has a strong\nchance in the race to develop a large-scale quantum computer.\n\nOriginal publication\n\nSimon Geyer, Bence Het\u00e9nyi, Stefano Bosco, Leon C.
