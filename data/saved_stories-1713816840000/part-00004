The filing is the second attempt for 24X, which withdrew a proposal\nlast year over operational and technical issues.\n\nAs of Friday, there were no letters raising issues with 24X\u2019s latest proposal.\nThe SEC has several months to scrutinise the plans.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how much volume they\u2019re going to be doing in the middle of the\nnight. But it\u2019s really not up to the SEC to decide whether it\u2019s commercially\nviable or not,\u201d said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown\nUniversity, who filed a letter supporting 24X\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favour of letting the market decide. If it succeeds, we\u2019re all better\noff and if it doesn\u2019t, well, the exchange\u2019s investors lost.\u201d\n\nThe committee that oversees the consolidated tape has begun meeting, according\nto two sources, to examine the issues involved in shifting to 24-hour trading\n\u2014 including who should bear the costs. Clearing houses, which help settle\ntrades, also operate within set hours.\n\nRecommended\n\nEquities\n\nSmall stocks, big problems\n\nInstitutional interest in overnight trading has been muted because of the\nrelatively poor liquidity on offer and concerns around settlement risk, among\nother issues.\n\nCurrent night owl offerings only allow retail traders to put in \u201climit\u201d orders\nwhere they state the price at which they would buy or sell. If that is not\nmet, the order expires, unfilled, the next morning.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s demand for 24-hour trading, but it's not necessarily from the entire\nmarketplace,\u201d said one institutional broker, who warned that basic staffing\ncould prove another thorny issue.\n\n\u201cThings already happen outside regular hours and you need to keep on top of\nthat to some degree \u2014 but that\u2019s very different to something happening to,\nsay, Apple at 2am or even 4pm on a Saturday. What do you do then?\u201d\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
