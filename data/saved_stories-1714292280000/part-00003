We\u2019ve\ncovered a lot of ground since FOSDEM 2024, where we presented draft 0.0.5.\nThis month we presented at Open Source Summit North America (OSS NA 24) and\nran a co-design workshop at the Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) in\nGothenburg. We\u2019re very close to a \u201cfeature complete\u201d: below are the next steps\nand ideas on how you might get involved.\n\n## Opportunities to meet in person\n\nWe are taking the draft definition on the road and coming to a town near you!\nOr, kind of, that is if you live in any of the following cities or happen to\nbe there on the given dates:\n\n  * North America\n\n    * USA, Pittsburgh, PyCon US (May 17)\n    * USA, NYC OSPOs for Good (July 9 \u2013 11)\n    * USA, Raleigh, All Things Open (October 27 \u2013 29)\n  * Europe\n\n    * France, Paris, OW2 (June 11 \u2013 12)\n    * France, Paris, Data Governance event (September)\n  * Africa\n\n    * Nigeria, Lagos, Sustain Africa (June 7)\n  * Asia Pacific\n\n    * Hong Kong, AI_Dev (August 23)\n  * Latin America\n\n    * Argentina, Buenos Aires, Nerdearla (September 24 \u2013 28)\n\nIt\u2019s important for you to catch up.\n\n## Draft v.0.0.5 at FOSDEM 2024\n\nThe talk \u201cMoving a Step Closer to Defining Open Source AI\u201d (click here to\nwatch the recorded live stream) by Stefano Maffulli presented draft v.0.0.5,\nreleased a few days before. The process at the time was focusing on finding\nthe required components to \u201cuse, study, share and modify\u201d an AI system.\n\nMaffulli quickly summarized why OSI started the Deep Dive: AI process, after\nCopilot not only demonstrated machines\u2019 ability to write functioning code but\nalso highlighted the new role of data as input to the machine learning system.\nRecognizing there is no simple answer to the question \u201cwhat is the source code\nof Copilot?\u201d Maffulli focused OSI\u2019s attention to finding the Open Source\nprinciples applied to AI together with stakeholders from academia, legal\ncommunities, tech companies, and civil rights groups.\n\nBuilding the framework\n\nOSI defined a process to co-design the Open Source AI Definition in public.\nThis framework encompasses a clear definition of AI systems, a preamble\noutlining the rationale behind open source AI, a concise articulation of the\nfreedoms users should enjoy, and a checklist for evaluating AI components and\nassociated legal documents.\n\nHe highlighted the rapid progress and policy decisions that shaped the\ntrajectory of software development, emphasizing the need to compress decades\nof evolution into a few months in the realm of AI. Stefano emphasized the\nimportance of community feedback and collaboration in refining the definition\nof Open Source AI. With monthly draft releases, bi-weekly town halls, and an\nactive forum, we gather diverse perspectives and insights to craft a robust\ndefinition.\n\n### OSS North America 2024 and next steps\n\nSince FOSDEM, the Definition has reached version 0.0.8. First, working groups\nanalyzed Pythia, OpenCV, Llama2 and Bloom to find the preferred form of making\nmodifications to the AI system, the fundamental unit for users to exercise\ntheir freedoms. Later, the groups shifted focus to reviewing the legal\nframeworks used by the components used by Pythia, OpenCV, Llama2 and Bloom.\nTogether with the definition of AI system provided by the OECD, the preamble,\nout-of-scope issues and four freedoms, this draft looks very close to a full\ndocument. A new version is expected to be released very soon now. On the 16th\nof April, Ofer Hermoni of the Linux Foundation and Mer Joyce (OSI/DoBigGood)\npresented the work at the OSS NA 24 meeting in Seattle. A huge part of our job\ncurrently is getting this definition reviewed by as many stakeholders as\npossible. A far-reaching and diverse perspective is necessary as we aim for a\nglobal impact. To participate in shaping the definition of Open Source AI and\nstay updated on the latest developments, visit opensource.org/deepdive and\nengage with the ongoing discussions, participate and watch previous town hall\nmeetings and draft releases.
