He is also an Editor at Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and\ndoes not necessarily reflect the views of Kraken or its management. This\nopinion is not investment advice.\n\n## Bitcoin \u2013 a computer science invention \u2013 is a world first that will never\nrepeat\n\nBitcoin wasn\u2019t created out of thin air. Decades of prior electronic cash\nprojects failed, but each one built on the incremental progress the others had\nmade. Bitcoin was the culmination of this process, a triumph shared by an\nentire scientific community.\n\nSome predecessors, like DigiCash, were too reliant on trusted authorities and\nso never gained market acceptance. Others, like HashCash, created working\ncurrencies backed by computer networks, but couldn\u2019t hold value over time.\n\nFinally, there were horror stories like Liberty Reserve, where the operators\nof working e-currencies were outright arrested and jailed for their work.\n\nAll of these projects shared a common aim \u2013 to disrupt the government\u2019s\nmonetary monopoly and create a viable internet currency free from central\ncontrol.\n\n## Here are 5 ways Bitcoin succeeded where these projects failed\n\n  * Issuing its asset, BTC, in a fair and transparent way, without a central issuer\n  * Allowing users to join in and benefit from the operation of its network\n  * Providing strong property rights guarantees via cryptography\n  * Adopting a fixed monetary policy that can\u2019t be altered\n  * Giving users the tools to continually improve Bitcoin\n\nMany in the digital assets space agree that Bitcoin has achieved all of the\nabove \u2013 and this makes it incredibly unlikely Bitcoin will ever be outcompeted\nby a government or private market alternative.\n\nTogether, these accomplishments represent a value proposition that exceeds the\nsum of its parts. Even among thousands of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains\nunique.\n\n## A fair launch\n\nSatoshi\u2019s stroke of genius was the decision to use a prior invention called\nproof-of-work (PoW) to distribute bitcoin to any user willing to secure the\nnetwork with computing power.\n\nTo issue new bitcoins, Bitcoin users compete to solve mathematical puzzles\nusing computer equipment, validating their work by expending electricity and\nresources. In return, they receive newly minted BTC in a process referred to\nas mining.\n\nThis distribution created a level playing field and fostered a global\ncommunity.\n\nCrucially, this system meant Nakamoto didn\u2019t need to sell, issue or market\nbitcoins. In 2011, he even turned over the operation of Bitcoin\u2019s software to\nan open-source developer community, none of whom he paid directly, or that\nreceived any form of financial compensation.\n\nUsers earned bitcoins by offering a service to the protocol, trading energy\nfor ownership, or by trading with each other directly. This design ensured\nthat work was required to receive Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s success was about more than creating a new money; it was about\ncreating a system to distribute value in a way that couldn\u2019t be gamed and that\ndidn\u2019t unfairly advantage any user. Even Satoshi mined all the Bitcoin he\nreceived, just like everyone else.\n\nToday Bitcoin\u2019s issuance remains a fair contest, but that is not the case for\nthe many alternative cryptocurrencies circulating, which are still searching\nfor an alternative to PoW.\n\nMany of them allocate the scarce data within their networks\ndisproportionately, often via insider sales. This provides these advantaged\nusers the ability to accrue more of the currency or to have a direct say in\nboth the network\u2019s development and economic policies.\n\nBitcoin is free from these fairness and manipulation concerns.\n\n## An open network\n\nAt its core, Bitcoin is a system of rules for governing a global, distributed\ndatabase that tracks the ownership of the data within its economy.\n\nFor the network to operate effectively, many participants must retain and sync\ntheir copies of the database and agree that those copies are without\ndiscrepancies. Otherwise, like the electronic currencies of old, there is a\nrisk that a user might be able to allocate data they don\u2019t own or didn\u2019t earn\n\u2013 fraudulently creating new coins and issuing them into circulation.\n\nEvery Bitcoin competitor faces a problem: There is a direct relationship\nbetween the size of the database and the ability of network users to maintain\ntheir own copy of that database.\n\nBitcoin makes thoughtful tradeoffs to keep this critical functionality\naccessible. You can think of every blockchain network as consisting of three\ntypes of actors:\n\n  * Miners, who receive rewards for helping to secure the network by discovering new blocks and chaining them to previous ones (building the blockchain)\n  * Nodes, who keep the process honest by tracking transaction history and verifying new transactions\n  * Users, who make transactions based on confidence in these checks and balances\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, these essential functions have barriers to entry.\nCrucially, however, Bitcoin\u2019s barriers are not the product of the protocol,\nbut of market forces. Any user who wants to secure the database can do so by\nfinding access to electricity and computing power. Any user who wants to\nverify the database can do so by downloading and storing its ledger.\n\nBoth activities are influenced only by the market for computing resources.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies add features that increase the cost of executing these\nfunctions. Some allocate the ability to determine their cost to specific\nusers, allowing the users that secure the database to dictate that their peers\nhold a certain amount of the cryptocurrency, or to meet some other criteria\nthey dictate in order to receive the cryptocurrency.\n\nThese sacrifices tend to reward wealth and influence \u2013 similar to government-\nrun economies where the supply and distribution of money is not governed by\nmarket forces, but by a small number of individuals. Bitcoin, again, is free\nof these compromises.\n\n## Strong property rights\n\nProperty rights are defined as the exclusive right of an individual or\norganization to use, manage and dispose of a resource that they earned through\ntheir labor at their own discretion.\n\nWhile this may be intuitive to anyone living in a country that protects these\nrights, not everyone around the world is entitled to them. In some countries,\neven democratic ones, governments can freeze the bank accounts of individuals\nby using (or abusing) the legal system.\n\nThis is another dilemma common to other cryptocurrencies. It is possible to\nadd features to any cryptocurrency, or to change the rules, altering the\nallocations of ownership by forcing users to download a new, incompatible\nsoftware.\n\nBitcoin relies on making backwards-compatible upgrades to its software. This\nmeans that its developers prioritize changes that do not force users to\nupgrade. Users can run any software that is compatible with the Bitcoin\nnetwork without sacrificing functionality (though this may come at the cost of\nsecurity).\n\nOther cryptocurrencies often introduce incompatible changes to their software,\nwhere those who dissent from the change may no longer be able to enjoy the\nsame benefits as others. Should you choose to reject the upgrade, your coins\nmay not be accepted within the economy.\n\nDevelopers may measure user opinion when proposing incompatible softwares,\nbut, ultimately, every user is at the mercy of the majority of other users.\n\nWith Bitcoin, minority groups can stick with the older version, keeping their\nBitcoin and its value intact, though they face security trade-offs. This\nallowance for differing opinions sets Bitcoin apart as a champion of property\nrights.\n\nAs long as you hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you are guaranteed\nownership over these coins. As long as you are running any Bitcoin-compatible\nsoftware, you can be sure you will be able to transact with those keys within\nthe Bitcoin economy. Likewise, you can be sure there will never be more than\n21 million Bitcoins.\n\n## Fixed monetary policy\n\nAll money is based on a social contract. Users agree to exchange their labor\nfor a medium that they can use to freely acquire products and services at a\nlater date.\n\nMonetary history has been dominated by two types of systems, both with\ndifferent kinds of social contracts.\n\n  * Market-based monies, like gold, which are based on a limited-quantity asset which can\u2019t be created by man\n  * Government-based monies, which are prone to inflation because these currencies can be printed at will as governments use them to pay for expenses\n\nBitcoin is a market-based money, and it has all the characteristics that\ndetermine money:\n\n  * It is durable: as long as there is internet and electricity, there will be bitcoin\n  * It is portable: you can access your funds from anywhere in the world\n  * It is scarce: all users can know, with certainty, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins\n\nBecause of its fair launch, open network, and strong property rights,\nBitcoin\u2019s monetary policy isn\u2019t just fixed, it\u2019s credible. Users can be\nassured it will remain unchanged, unless all of its millions of users agree on\nthe change, however unlikely.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, by contrast, offer variable monetary policies, with\nless credibility.\n\nSome change so often they are not dissimilar from government-managed monies,\nwhose value can be subject to the whims of politics. Like central banks, they\ncontrol the money supply and take actions that aim for price stability and\neconomic growth.\n\nOthers have no limits on their issuance, undermining their credibility.\n\nLikewise, global central banks use monetary policy tools to control the supply\nof their national currencies. As the Federal Reserve has shown, these\ninstitutions are vague about when and why these rates change. Often only\ninsiders aid in the decision making.\n\nThose using stablecoins, dollar-backed crypto assets, or some formal form of\ncentral bank digital currency (CBDC), similarly, are only opting into this\nexisting system.\n\n## Limitless improvement\n\nWhile the above qualities lay a strong foundation for Bitcoin, these\nattributes alone aren\u2019t enough to ensure it will never be replaced by an\nalternative. This is why its last attribute is perhaps the most important:\nBitcoin\u2019s ability to change and improve.\n\nIt appears unlikely Bitcoin can scale to provide its benefits to the world\u2019s\neight billion people as constructed. Work needs to be done to develop\nadditional, transactional layers that can expand Bitcoin\u2019s foundational\ncapacity \u2013 without sacrificing its core value propositions.\n\nIn the past year alone, Bitcoin developers have achieved feats never before\nthought possible, without changing the core code, unlocking Turing-complete\nsmart contracts as well as new ways to transform bitcoins into non-fungible\ntokens.\n\nThe ability of Bitcoin users to successfully implement compelling new features\nmakes existing crypto networks that offer similar functionalities redundant.\n\nIn an expanding sea of competing cryptocurrencies and government-managed\nmonies, with diverse and ever-changing policies, Bitcoin stands alone.\n\nGet started with Kraken\n\nInvesting in crypto assets is risky and each token can have its own set of\nrisks. Below is a list of risks that generally apply to all crypto assets:\n\nVolatility: The performance of crypto assets can be highly volatile, with\ntheir value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared to lose\nall the money you invest in crypto assets.\n\nLack of protections: Crypto asset investments are unregulated and neither the\nFinancial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) nor the Financial Ombudsman\nService (FOS) will assist or protect you in the event that something goes\nwrong with your crypto asset investments.\n\nLiquidity: Some crypto asset markets may suffer from low liquidity, which\ncould prevent you buying or selling your crypto assets at the price that you\nwant or expect.\n\nComplexity: Specific crypto assets may carry with them specific complex risks\nthat are hard to understand. Do your own research, and if something sounds too\ngood to be true, it probably is.\n\nDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket: Putting all your money into a single\ntype of investment is risky. Spreading your money across different investments\nmakes you less dependent on any one to do well.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Related Posts\n\n## Expanded margin pairs available for NEAR and SEI!\n\n3 min read\n\nJanuary 5th, 2024\n\n## How Kraken Wallet addresses challenges in mobile crypto security\n\n11 min read\n\nApril 17th, 2024\n\n## Simple, secure, powerful: Introducing Kraken Wallet\n\n4 min read\n\nApril 17th, 2024\n\n## Announcing Kraken\u2019s $100M+, $250M+ and $500M+ volume fee tier trial\n\n4 min read\n\nJune 29th, 2023\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not\ninvestment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, stake or\nhold any cryptoasset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.
