Either HELL YEAH! or no.\n\n2009-08-26\n\nUse this rule if you\u2019re often over-committed or too scattered.\n\nIf you\u2019re not saying \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d about something, say no.\n\nWhen deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than \u201cWow!\nThat would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!\u201d \u2014 then say no.\n\nWhen you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw\nyourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d\n\nEvery event you get invited to. Every request to start a new project. If\nyou\u2019re not saying \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d about it, say no.\n\nWe\u2019re all busy. We\u2019ve all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way\nout.\n\n\u00a9 2009 Derek Sivers.\n\n# Copy & share: sive.rs/hellyeah\n\n", "frontpage": false}
