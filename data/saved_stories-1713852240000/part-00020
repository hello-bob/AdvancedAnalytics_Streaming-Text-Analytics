Levine\n\nForbes Staff\n\nI'm a senior writer covering social media and online culture.\n\nFollowing\n\nClick to save this article.\n\nYou'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account.\n\nMar 22, 2023,06:30am EDT\n\n## A U.S. ban on the world\u2019s most popular social media app would affect far\nmore American businesses and people than just the 150 million using the\nplatform here.\n\nCasey Evertsen drove down a suburban Utah street lined with trash bins,\nspeaking into his phone\u2019s camera as he gave a tour of the brightly-colored\ntruck he uses for his garbage can-cleaning business.\n\n\u201cIf you like seeing dirty stuff get cleaned and watching how cool stuff works,\nfollow along,\u201d he said in the video shared on TikTok. \u201cLet\u2019s clean some bins!\u201d\n\nEvertsen\u2019s service, Bin Blasters, had for a whole year struggled to get\ntraction through Facebook and Instagram. So taking a cue from his teenage\ndaughter, he decided to try promoting it on TikTok instead. On his eighth\nvideo, just one month in, Evertsen \u201cblew up.\u201d\n\n\"I went out and just started cleaning bins that day, started on our route, and\nI look at my phone like an hour later, and there's 17,000 views,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cThen it just got in the millions.\u201d\n\nEvertsen rode the viral TikTok wave to grow Bin Blasters from a fledgling\nbusiness into a large and lucrative operation spanning four states and a host\nof employees. His nine locations across Utah, Arizona, Nevada and Illinois are\nsupported today by franchise owners, truck drivers, customer service workers,\na digital marketing agency, legal consultants and contractors focused on\ndesign and online strategy. Next, as he continues posting daily to the video\nplatform, he\u2019s looking to bring on a CEO.\n\n\u201cI went from being a guy that cleans garbage cans to a franchisor trying to\nfigure out how to be a franchisor and growing this business,\u201d he told Forbes.\n\u201cTikTok changed it all.\u201d\n\n#### CASEY EVERTSEN, FOUNDER OF BIN BLASTERS\n\n#### His garbage can cleaning company spans nine locations in four states\n\nThis TikTok success story is not unique to Evertsen; as the platform becomes\nan ever-more-powerful discovery engine and shopping hub, many of the app\u2019s 150\nmillion American users have used it to launch businesses and careers. The\ncompany says 5 million U.S. businesses use TikTok to reach customers. And some\ncreators have themselves morphed into mini-industries supported by dozens\u2014even\nhundreds\u2014of staff, from managers, agents, lawyers and publicists down to\neditors, producers and assistants.\n\nThe $100 billion creator economy, and the supply chain of jobs that come with\nit, are staring down a potentially enormous upheaval as the Biden\nadministration threatens to ban TikTok over national security concerns. The\nU.S. government has long feared that the wildly popular app, owned by Beijing-\nbased ByteDance, could be used by China to surveil and manipulate Americans.\nFollowing three years of negotiations on a deal that would address those\nconcerns, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has demanded that\nTikTok\u2019s Chinese owner sell its stake in the platform\u2014or face a ban.\n\nSome lawmakers, meanwhile, are pushing to simply shut the app down. The House\nForeign Affairs Committee this month voted to advance a Republican-led bill\nthat would enable President Joe Biden to ban TikTok, and 18 senators\u2014nine\nDemocrats and nine Republicans\u2014are also cosponsoring broader legislation\ngiving the Department of Commerce the ability to ban communications\ntechnologies, including TikTok, built by foreign adversaries. (The White House\nendorsed that proposal, the RESTRICT Act.) The leader of the House committee\nholding the first-ever congressional hearing with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew on\nThursday also supports an outright ban.\n\n\u201cI went from being a guy that cleans garbage cans to a franchisor trying to\nfigure out how to be a franchisor and growing this business,\u201d Casey Evertsen,\nfounder of Utah-based Bin Blasters, told Forbes. \u201cTikTok changed it all.\u201d\n\nChristian Tisdale\n\nBut as the prospect of a ban intensifies, so too does the chorus of voices\nfighting against it. A former top intelligence official has warned a ban might\nbe both politically unpopular and could fuel a geopolitical nightmare. Civil\nliberties activists have argued it would do more to silence Americans than\nprotect them. A new Forbes investigation on TikTok\u2019s continued access to\nIndians\u2019 data, even after their government banned the app in 2020, indicates\nthat a U.S. ban could fail to address concerns about user data the company has\nalready collected. Even a former TikTok employee who took his complaints about\nthe company\u2019s data security practices to Congress described a nationwide ban\nas unnecessary. And people who\u2019ve built their livelihoods around the app say\nthe political crossfire has largely overlooked not only the opportunities\nafforded them because of TikTok, but also the sprawling ecosystem of\nbusinesses and jobs that exist because of it. (TikTok sent some creators to\nCapitol Hill this week to raise awareness about that.)\n\n> \u201cThere are so many other horrible things happening in the world right now,\n> why are we talking about [a ban]? Why are we focusing on an app? I don't\n> understand.\u201d\n>\n> TikTok creator Drew Afualo\n\n\u201cWe have to have tough conversations on: Who is using it now? What kind of\nvalue does it bring to them? What does it mean if we just, like, rip it out of\ntheir hands?\u201d Chew, the TikTok CEO, said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cI'm the creator, and I'm the face of what you see, but there's still so many\nmoving parts in the background that you don't see\u2014and so much work that has to\nhappen before I post a video,\u201d said Robert Lucas, who left his IT job\ninstalling Wi-Fi around Georgia to build a cake decorating business on TikTok.\nSince a video he made in his living room went viral two years ago, the\n29-year-old has drawn an audience of 2.5 million and hired a manager to\noversee relationships with advertisers, one assistant to help with video\nediting and another to prep ingredients for each recipe. (He\u2019s now looking for\na second full-time editor and someone to shop for groceries and bake for him.)\n\nBeyond his direct employees, Lucas has also worked with an outside team\nhelping him start a product line of cake decorating and cooking utensils, and\ndozens at a company producing the show he\u2019ll soon be starring in for a \u201cmajor\nstreaming platform,\u201d where he\u2019ll be coaching individuals who don\u2019t know how to\nbake on how to become top cake artists. He said he\u2019s gone from earning $65,000\nsetting up Wi-Fi to bringing in half a million dollars a year through the\nvarious moving parts of his business that stemmed from TikTok.\n\nA potential ban \u201cwould definitely be a great blow to everything that I have\ngoing right now,\u201d Lucas said, adding that he wouldn\u2019t be able to employ the\nsmall army of people working for him. \u201cThey're supporting me, but I also have\nto support them financially. And if that happens...I may have to basically lay\noff [or say to them], 'I'm sorry, I'm not able to keep you around like I\ninitially planned.\u2019\u201d\n\n#### ROBERT LUCAS, CREATOR OF THE SWEET IMPACT\n\n#### He\u2019s turned a cake design side hustle into a job, product line and TV\nshow\n\n### \u2018It Takes A Village\u2019\n\nMany successful creators have a handful of staff helping them, while others\nhave turned their internet stardom into million-dollar companies and careers.\nThe 50 Top Creators identified by Forbes last year made a combined $570\nmillion in 2021.\n\nMrBeast, the world\u2019s top earning creator who\u2019s on track to become the first\nYouTuber billionaire, has at least 60 full-time employees\u2014more if you count\ncontractors\u2014working behind the scenes on his social media, candy bar brand\nFeastables, restaurant chain MrBeast Burger, merch and other projects. (And\ndon\u2019t forget his bodyguard, life coach and private chef.) He told Rolling\nStone he has \u201cliterally worked with over a thousand people\u201d and that he\u2019s\nangling to turn creatordom into an entire industry in his home state of North\nCarolina.\n\nMahzad Babayan, a digital talent agent at United Talent Agency, which works\nwith creators like TikTok stars Charli and Dixie D\u2019Amelio and Nick DiGiovanni,\nsaid that of the agency\u2019s digital talent roster, about half have full-time\nemployees like assistants, editors and producers\u2014and that the volume of\ncreators with more than a dozen employees is growing.\n\n\u201cIt takes a village,\u201d said creator Drew Afualo, whose audience of 8 million on\nTikTok has helped her land paid gigs and brand partnerships, and most\nrecently, ink an exclusive deal with Spotify for a podcast. Afualo estimates\nher stable of workers\u2014from the literary team, merch company and tour manager\nto her stylist and hair and makeup artists\u2014includes more than 30 people.\n\nAsked about a ban on the app that put her on the map, Afualo added: \"There are\nso many other horrible things happening in the world right now, why are we\ntalking about that? Why are we focusing on an app? I don't understand.\u201d\n\n#### DREW AFUALO, CREATOR\n\n#### She\u2019s parlayed TikTok fame into a Spotify podcast, The Comment Section\n\n### Small business boom\n\nTikTok has moved the needle just as much for small businesses, industry\ninsiders say.\n\nAs more and more people use the app as a search engine\u2014Google last year\nconceded that it\u2019s seeing a growing share of 18 to 24-year-olds using TikTok\nand Instagram in lieu of Google search\u2014it\u2019s becoming a quintessential\ndiscovery tool for small sellers, no-name brands and niche products. The\n#TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag, with 47 billion views, is emblematic of TikTok\u2019s\npower as a commerce platform as much as a vehicle for entertainment. (The app\nhas driven approximately $1.8 billion in U.S. consumer spending to date, per\nanalytics firm Data.ai.)\n\n\u201cBecause TikTok's a discovery engine, it's giving power to these small brands\nto be able to get discovered if they have great products. Instagram is not\nbased on discovery, it's based on connections, so it really favors the\nexisting big brands that have money to dump into it,\u201d said Eric Dahan,\ncofounder and former CEO of Open Influence, a top creator marketing firm based\nin Los Angeles. A ban \u201ccould potentially wipe out a whole host of new emerging\nbrands\u2014 some as they're getting started, and some before they even get a\nchance.\u201d\n\nTikTok has also flooded the economy with even more creators, which means\nsmall-time entrepreneurs just starting to sell a product are more likely to be\nable to afford viral marketing on TikTok that wouldn't have been attainable in\nthe past. For much of the last decade, that marketing was done largely through\nmega influencers and social celebrities that mom-and-pop and mid-size players\n\u201ccouldn't afford to tap into,\u201d Dahan said.\n\nSome also fear that banning TikTok would exacerbate the antitrust issues that\nU.S. regulators have for years been struggling to address, eliminating\narguably the fiercest competitor of Meta, Google and Amazon\u2014all targets of\nantitrust scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe pressure on YouTube and Facebook goes away, and that's really important\nfor driving innovation and shifting some of the power back to brands and small\nbusinesses and creators,\u201d Dahan said. \u201cWe're creating less competition, and\nwhenever you have less competition, no one wins except for the one who's not\nhaving to compete. That's what I would say the biggest loss is gonna be.\u201d\n\nAZ Taco King is another small business that, like Evertsen\u2019s Bin Blasters,\nstruggled on Facebook before exploding on TikTok. Owner Jaz Sears said she is\n\u201cscared\u201d of what a TikTok ban could mean for her family.\n\n\u201cIf it were to go away... it would be so hard for us,\u201d she told Forbes.\n\u201cFacebook is not doing what TikTok is doing for us. Instagram is not doing it,\nGoogle. I've been paying for ads all over social media for the last five\nyears, and I don't have to pay for an ad on TikTok\u2014TikTok does its thing for\nme.\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, Sears made a living cleaning houses in her small Arizona\nsuburb. She and her husband, who had a warehouse job at a local mail company,\nwere supporting their family of six on less than $60,000. But when Covid hit\nand they lost their jobs, the couple set up a food stand on a street corner\noutside the neighborhood liquor store. A month later, a customer posted a\nshort TikTok of the taco stand. The next day, 300 cars showed up.\n\n#### JAZ SEARS, FOUNDER OF AZ TACO KING\n\n#### She\u2019s turned a taco stand into three restaurants and an online shop\n\n\u201cLiterally for the next month, people were just pulling up from all over\nArizona waiting three hours in line,\u201d Sears said. \u201cCrazy amounts of people\nwere showing up every day.\u201d\n\nSears and her family in September 2020 moved the viral taco stand into an\nabandoned bar, where she personally cooked 300 pounds of birria de res every\nday. Since then, the family business has evolved to a team of nearly 30\nemployees across three locations and a food truck.\n\nWhen Sears isn\u2019t posting AZ Taco King\u2019s kitchen happenings on TikTok, she is\nrunning its e-commerce arm shipping tamales to customers around the world. She\nsaid AZ Taco King had $1.8M in revenue last year, which brought in almost\n$200,000 for her family. \u201cEverybody here in our town is like, 'Oh my gosh,\ntacos did that? You sold tacos?\u201d\n\n\u201cTikTok just is like, going beyond all platforms,\u201d she added. \u201cIf I didn't\nhave that platform, I would not have the business I have today.\u201d\n\n#### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBESIndia Banned TikTok In 2020.
