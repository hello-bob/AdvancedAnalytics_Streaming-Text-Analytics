Filled with both\nhighly-credentialed career engineers and propulsion hobbyists, APEC is an\norganization The Debrief once referred to as the World\u2019s Most Exclusive (And\nStrange) Anti-Gravity Club.\n\nCover image of Dr. Buhler\u2019s APEC Presentation. Image Credit: Exodus Propulsion\nTechnologies, Buhler et al.\n\nIn conjunction with that presentation, \u201cThe Discovery of Propellantless\nPropulsion: The Direct Conversion of Electrical Energy into Physical Thrust,\u201d\nDr. Buhler also sat down with APEC co-founder and moderator Tim Ventura to\nexplain how his past in electrostatics, which is his primary area of\nexpertise, ended up being a key component of his discovery of this new force.\n\n\u201cYou are NASA\u2019s subject matter expert in electrostatics,\u201d Ventura clarified in\nthe first part of the interview. \u201cSo, if anyone would know about conventional\nexplanations for anomalous measurements (for the measured thrust), it would be\nyou, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Buhler conceded with an outwardly humble shrug.\n\nA quick look at Dr. Buhler\u2019s background confirms that he is indeed one of\nNASA\u2019s top experts in electrostatics. In addition to overseeing the management\nof electrostatic discharge (ESD) and ESD safety for the Space Shuttle, the\nISS, and Hubble, Dr. Buhler also established NASA\u2019s Electrostatics and Surface\nPhysics Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nHis Exodus Propulsion Technologies team is equally impressive. According to a\nslide from his APEC presentation, \u201cthe Team consists of a mix of engineers and\nscientists from NASA, Blue Origin, Air Force, ExxonMobil as well as successful\nlegal and businessmen.\u201d\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Buhler says that when he and his colleagues first began\nlooking into propellantless propulsion ideas over two decades ago, they did\nnot expect electrostatics to be the answer. Instead, he and his team explored\nother avenues for as many as 25 years before landing on electrostatics as the\nkey to unlocking the door of this new force.\n\n\u201cNature has its own way of doing things,\u201d Buhler explained, \u201cand it is our job\nto uncover what nature does. It just happened to fall into my lap in what I\u2019m\nthe expert in.\u201d\n\n## The Device and The Thrust\n\nThroughout his APEC presentation, Buhler highlights his team\u2019s long chain of\nexperiments, with a more detailed focus on the last decade. That in-depth\naccount, which includes a lot of the mathematics behind what they discovered,\nnot only shows how he and his team developed different models and\nconfigurations of their propellantless propulsion drive but also the\nsignificant breakthroughs many of these steps uncovered.\n\nFor example, from 2016 to the end of 2020, their best devices were producing a\nlittle more than one hundred thousandth of a gravity. In the coming years,\nthat would go up exponentially. For clarification, Buhler told The Debrief\nthat measuring thrust in terms of a percentage of gravity reflects the force\ngenerated divided by the test article.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to approach and exceed unity,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhich means the\narticle would generate enough thrust to lift itself in Earth\u2019s gravity, and\nthat\u2019s defined as 1 gravity of thrust.\u201d\n\nBuhler says they commonly measured the forces in milliNewtons, but they prefer\nto describe the thrust in terms of gravity since that is the ultimate goal of\npropulsion physics.\n\n\u201cThe highest we have generated on a stacked system is about 10 mN,\u201d Buhler\ntold The Debrief. \u201cThe magnitude is not important, really, since anything\nabove zero would work in space!\u201d\n\nIn the years and months leading up to the breakthrough thrust measurement,\nBuhler and his team took great care to methodically eliminate anything else\nthat could account for the tiny yet measurable force they were seeing. This\ndetailed and painstaking work resulted in the team\u2019s overriding design patent,\nwhich was granted in 2020.\n\nWith fresh momentum, Buhler says they also began construction of a custom-made\nvacuum chamber that would allow them to simulate the environment of deep\nspace. If something else was causing the force, this chamber was built to\nidentify it.\n\nAccording to the APEC presentation, that chamber was completed at the end of\n2020. Between January and September 2021, 146 separate articles were tested,\neach seemingly confirming the presence of measurable thrust. The team also\ntested different configurations that eliminated the old designs using\nasymmetrical capacitors and instead employed models with opposing asymmetrical\nplates.\n\nThis slide from Dr. Buhler\u2019s APEC presentation shows the custom-made vacuum\nchamber built to test their propellantless Propulsion drive in a simulated\nspace environment.

The team once again confirmed the thrust, but the new\napproach resulted in an order of magnitude jump to one ten-thousandth of a\ngravity. This was still not enough to leave the planet, but it was enough to\nknow they were on the right track.\n\n## Breakthrough in 2023 Produces One Gravity of Thrust\n\nWith an end seemingly within sight, the team immediately began to try newer\nand better designs. They continued to measure thrust while also pretty much\nruling out every conventional explanation they could come up with. This was\nnot anything they had ever measured before.\n\nThen, in 2022, something astounding happened. According to Buhler, his team\nbegan to see significant jumps in the force being generated.\n\nA quick look at a chart he presented to APEC shows that tests performed\nbetween early 2022 and November 2023 resulted in a rapid climb, moving from\none thousandth, one hundredth, and even one-tenth of gravity all the way up to\none full Earth gravity. This means that their current devices, which Buhler\ntold The Debrief \u201cweigh somewhere between 30-40 grams on their own\u201d without\nthe attached test equipment, were producing enough thrust to counteract the\nfull force of one Earth gravity.\n\nA slide from Dr. Buhler\u2019s APEC presentation highlights just a few of the\nhundreds of tests his team ran on their propellantless propulsion drive\nbetween 2016 and 2023. Image Credit: Exodus Propulsion Technologies, Buhler,\net al.\n\nAfter decades of research, Buhler says he and his team had shown unequivocally\nthat a new, fundamental force was at work and that his devices were tapping\ninto that force to produce thrust without emitting any mass or propellant.\n\n\u201cEssentially, what we\u2019ve discovered is that systems that contain an asymmetry\nin either electrostatic pressure or some kind of electrostatic divergent field\ncan give a system of a center of mass a non-zero force component,\u201d Buhler\nexplained. \u201cSo, what that basically means is that there\u2019s some underlying\nphysics that can essentially place force on an object should those two\nconstraints be met.\u201d\n\n## Exodus Looking to Partner with Other Propellantless Propulsion Drive\nCompanies\n\nWhile a potentially game-changing breakthrough, Dr Buhler\u2019s team is not the\nfirst to claim the ability to generate thrust with only an electrical charge\nand no propellant. The Debrief previously covered some of the most notable\nentries, including the EM Drive and IVO LTD\u2019s Quantum Drive.\n\nAlthough the former has had its thrust confirmed by NASA Warp Drive specialist\nHarold G. \u201cSonny\u201d White\u2019s EagleWorks Lab and a second test in China, both of\nwhich still remain controversial, neither has yet to be tested in space. The\nQuantum Drive came close after a launch last November, but a failure in the\nsatellite\u2019s electrical systems unrelated to the drive scuttled that test\nbefore it could confirm the drive\u2019s thrust.\n\nWhen asked by The Debrief about competing companies working on similar\npropulsion concepts, Buhler said he believes his work could actually explain\nthe effects some of these other concepts are seeing. However, he did concede\nthat there is some concern that some of the more recent devices could violate\nhis team\u2019s patent.\n\nA slide from Dr. Buhler\u2019s APEC presentation highlights some of the other\npropelantless propulsion concepts and scientific mysteries that may be\nexplained by his team\u2019s findings. Image Credit: Exodus Propulsion\nTechnologies, Buhler, et al.\n\n\u201cThe thing that we worry about are the companies that have appeared out of\nnowhere after the patent came out and had instant success without the years of\nrigor and no acknowledgment of our patent,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Buhler believes companies interested in this type of potential\npropulsion breakthrough should contact Exodus so he and his team can share\ntheir experience and expertise.\n\n\u201cKnowledge of gas breakdown, corona generation, brush discharges, streamers,\nglow discharges, plasma physics, etc., is usually too much for engineers to\nbear alone,\u201d he told The Debrief, \u201cand the number of experts in Electrostatics\nis very, very few.\n\n\u201cWe hope companies will want to license our technology, which is mutually\nbeneficial,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can help their technology and gain some funding for\nour time to do so.\u201d\n\nSee Also\n\n### China\u2019s SETI Program Will Find Alien Life First, Says Chinese Astronomer\n\nIf there are companies interested in working with Exodus Propulsion\nTechnologies, Buhler asks that they contact him and his team via their\nLinkedIn page.\n\n## Understanding the Physics is a Job for Science\n\nAnother unusual result from their tests was that sometimes the tested devices\ndid not require a constant input of electrical charge to maintain their\nthrust. Given that the device already appears to violate the known laws of\nphysics by creating thrust without propellant, this result even stumped Dr.\nBuhler and his team.\n\n\u201cWe can see some of these things sit on a scale for days, and if they still\nhave charge in them, they are still producing thrust,\u201d he told Ventura. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery hard to reconcile, from a scientific point of view because it does seem\nto violate a lot of energy laws that we have.\u201d\n\nUp next, Buhler says his team is seeking funding to test their devices in\nspace to better understand the force at work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to do some demos,\u201d said Buhler. \u201cSome space demos. That\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re trying to get some funding to do. I think that would be a great way to\nshow off the technology.\u201d\n\nBesides proving once and for all that the force they are seeing is real, the\naccomplished engineer believes that such tests could encourage other\nscientists to search for an explanation of what exactly it is they are seeing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good opportunity for people to run these tests, look at them,\nwatch them go in space, watch it move in space, and then say, \u2018what does it\nimply? What are the implications?\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil that time, Buhler says he believes his work proves that the force they\nare seeing is \u201cfundamental\u201d and that understanding it is the next logical\nstep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t deny this,\u201d he told Ventura. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to this. You\u2019re\njust charging up Teflon, copper tape, and foam, and you have this thrust.\u201d\n\nSo, while his team believes their experiments speak for themselves, the\nveteran scientist says he also believes it is the job of science to analyze\nand understand this discovery. If successful, he thinks it may even address\nsome of the harder questions in science, including the nature of dark energy\nor even space/time itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to make these things,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s a tool for the scientific\ncommunity to use to try to explore those hard questions.\u201d\n\nAs far as his own thoughts about the nature of the force his team has\nuncovered, the refreshingly honest NASA veteran demurred, saying only that he\nbelieves scientists besides himself are in the perfect position to test and\nstudy their results and to come up with the answers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a physicist much smarter than me to come up with all of\nthat,\u201d Dr. Buhler quipped.\n\n\u201cBut the QED is there.\u201d\n\nChristopher Plain is a Science Fiction and Fantasy novelist and Head Science\nWriter at The Debrief.
