Over time her\ncondition worsened until she was having whole-body fits and being rushed to\nhospital. But her local hospital, in Durham, England, was dismissive,\nsuggesting she had anxiety, a mental-health condition, and that she was\nprobably spending too much time watching videos on TikTok. Her mother\ndescribes the experience as \u201cbelittling\u201d. In fact, Jessica had an autoimmune\ncondition brought on by a bacterial infection with Streptococcus. The\ncondition is known as Paediatric Autoimmune-Neuropsychiatric Disorders\nAssociated with Streptococcus (PANDAS). When the infection was identified and\ntreated, her symptoms finally began to improve.\n\nMs Huitson is not alone in having a dysfunction in the brain mistaken for one\nin the mind. Evidence is accumulating that an array of infections can, in some\ncases, trigger conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics,\nanxiety, depression and even psychosis. And infections are one small piece of\nthe puzzle. It is increasingly clear that inflammatory disorders and metabolic\nconditions can also have sizeable effects on mental health, though\npsychiatrists rarely look for them. All this is symptomatic of large problems\nin psychiatry.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
