This drops a full roundtrip, on every new connection.\nThis reduces the time to connect to the relays, in general, but dramatically\nspeeds up connections to farther-away relays.\n\nUnfortunately, this means the new relays can not talk to 0.13.0 nodes. To\nsmooth out the upgrade path, we will keep the old relays running for at least\nanother 4 weeks.\n\nThe new relays are available under these DNS entries. Please ensure any custom\niroh config files you use are updated appropriately.\n\n  * US: use1-1.relay.iroh.network\n  * EU: euw1-1.relay.iroh.network\n\nFor more details checkout the PR: Simplify relay handshake (#2164)\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Basic Author API\n\nAuthors are an important part of how documents are managed in iroh. We have\nfinally provided an API to manage them!\n\n    \n    \n    // Setup an in-memory iroh node. let node = Node::memory().spawn().await?; // Create a new author. let author_id = node.authors.create().await?; let authors_stream = node.authors.list().await?; // List of current authors, which is currently just the one we created above. let authors: Vec<_> = authors_stream.try_collect().await?; // Export the author for external usage. let author = node.authors.export(author_id).await?.unwrap(); // I didn't like the author, let's delete it. node.authors.delete(author_id).await?; // Ah wait I still need it, import it again. node.authors.import(author).await?;\n\nFor more details checkout: Implement basic author api (#2132)\n\n## \ud83d\udcbe Upgrade redb to v2.0\n\nIroh relies on redb, both for storing data in iroh-bytes and storing document\nstructure in iroh-sync. With the release of redb@2.0 we gained a nice\nperformance boost, and smaller features under the hood, allowing us to\nsimplify the code in our storage implementations.\n\nFor more details checkout: Update redb to v2 (#2120)\n\n## \ud83e\udd2f But wait there\u2019s more!\n\nMany bugs were squashed and smaller features added. For all those details you\ncan checkout the full changelog:\nhttps://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/releases/tag/v0.14.0.\n\nIf you want to know what is coming up, checkout the 0.15.0 milestone, and if\nyou have any wishes let us know in the issues!\n\nIf you need help using iroh or just want to chat, please join us on discord!\n\n## Footer\n\nLess net work for networks.\n\nTwitterGitHubYouTube\n\n### Build\n\n  * Documentation\n  * iroh.network\n  * Github\n\n### Learn\n\n  * Blog\n  * Examples\n  * dumbpipe\n  * sendme\n\n### Connect\n\n  * Discord\n  * Discussion\n  * Twitter\n\n\u00a9 2024 n0, inc.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
