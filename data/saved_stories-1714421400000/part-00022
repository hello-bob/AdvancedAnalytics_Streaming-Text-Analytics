In the U.S., we were still swiping credit cards while they were\ncreating faster, borderless, and intuitive payments infrastructure. Why?\n\nMobile was several step functions better than what they had \u2013 it felt like\nmagic compared to the status quo. Meanwhile, the U.S. had such things as\ncredit cards and digital bank accounts, which were totally adequate, and we\nhad little incentive to close the gap from good to great.\n\nWhere are we going with this?\n\nAI, of course.\n\nWe believe that the same way mobile payments leapfrogged credit cards in some\nmarkets, and mobile phones leapfrogged desktop computers in developing\neconomies, AI too will (at least initially) leapfrog more legacy technologies\nthat don\u2019t have a \u201cgood enough\u201d palliative (I mean alternative) in place.\n\n> Founders are eager to apply AI to digitized industries that seem \u2018the most\n> ready for it.\u2019 But that\u2019s not where we\u2019re going to make the biggest impact.\n\nWhere will this happen? The majority of the productivity gains from the past\ndecade of digitization were realized by a few major verticals (tech, media,\nand finance). But there are still many verticals where protocols and software\nhaven\u2019t changed much in 20+ years, and the SaaS revolution didn\u2019t leave a\nmark. There are still industries that, quite literally, still use pen and\npaper.\n\nSpaces like agriculture, hospitality, education, legal, construction, and\nmanufacturing are primed for what we call \u201cAI leapfrogging.\u201d If executed\ncorrectly, AI has the potential to reach new demographics of users who were\nbypassed by the previous software revolutions.\n\nIf packaged intuitively, AI can go where no software has gone before.\n\n## What is leapfrogging?\n\nTechnological leapfrogging occurs when an industry or market (usually an\noutmoded industry or emerging market) skips a step along the technology\ntransformation chain.\n\nInstead of learning to use a personal computer and then a mobile phone, you\nskip right to mobile. In many emerging markets, mobile is the dominant\ncomputing paradigm. It started as early as 2010, just three years after the\niPhone\u2019s debut. By the end of 2010, the number of broadband subscriptions for\nmobile overtook the number of subscriptions for fixed technologies in many\nemerging markets.\n\nLeapfrogging has also happened in the mobile payments space. While the US\nstill struggles to adopt mobile payments and digital currency, Kenya and China\nhave gone directly to mobile, bypassing the credit and debit step. Just four\nyears after digital payment technologies were developed, 70 percent of Kenya\u2019s\npopulation was using M-Pesa, the SMS based mobile payments platform. (This was\na big inspiration for Libra... but we\u2019ll leave that box closed for now.)\n\nBetween 2013 and 2018, China\u2019s two major mobile payment platforms, AliPay and\nWeChat, completely bypassed credit cards as the dominant payment scheme.\nAliPay\u2019s active users increased from 100 million in 2013, to 900 million in\n2018. WeChat grew from 350 million to 1.1 billion.\n\nThis was a mobile eclipse of the credit paradigm \u2013 a leapfrogging event. By\n2020, 90 percent of people in China\u2019s largest cities used WeChat and AliPay as\ntheir primary payment method. Cash was second, and credit third.\n\nKenya and China jumped from A to C with mobile payments. And it\u2019s no surprise\nthat they were also first to really embrace crypto too. Decentralized finance\nwas a perfect fit for countries that had already sidestepped the issues of a\ntraditional, centralized financial system.\n\nIn 2021 Kenya led the world in P2P crypto trading \u2013 a hedge against inflation\nof local currency, and a way to avoid remittance costs. Non-bank wallets\ncontinue to perform in markets (Kenya, Ghana, the Philippines) that bypassed\ntraditional payments infrastructure and went straight to digital.\n\nLeapfrogging is a one way door. That\u2019s one reason we\u2019ve seen so many crypto\nfounders rediscover the problems of traditional finance. Often, they\u2019re trying\nto use a new technology to recreate a bypassed step in the tech transformation\nchain (Think: \u201cPlaid for EMs\u201d). It\u2019s like trying to re-create a credit card\nwhen the whole population is already using mobile. Instead we need to be\nthinking about how we move forward from C to D.\n\nDespite these recent examples, leapfrogging isn\u2019t common across the history of\ntechnology, but when it happens, it\u2019s seismic. And the conditions for AI to\nleapfrogging traditional SaaS are especially clear in many \u201clagging\u201d\nindustries right now.\n\n## The value of the change must greatly outweigh the burden of the change.\n\nOur NFX colleague James Currier recently outlined a mental model for massive\ntechnology revolutions: take someone who is a non-transactor, and through the\nright tool, turn them into a transactor.\n\nUber and Lyft wouldn\u2019t have been transformative for cab drivers. That\u2019s\nincremental. Instead, it made anyone with a car into a potential cab driver.\nThat\u2019s transformative.\n\nIn China, there was an laggard social credit system that opened the door for\nmobile \u2013 only about 20 percent of people over 15 had credit cards. In emerging\nmarkets pre-mobile, desktop computing wasn\u2019t accessible. In both cases when\nseamless mobile payments or ubiquitous internet access became possible, it was\na natural fit.\n\nThe overarching idea here is that switching costs must be as low as possible\nto facilitate a major leapfrog event. Think of it as two sides of a balancing\nscale. On one side you have the burden of change. On the other, the value of\nthe change.\n\nThe value of the change must greatly outweigh the burden of the change. You\ncan tweak this balance by:\n\n  1. Creating huge value with a change\n  2. Lightening the burden of the change itself\n\nIdeally, you want to do both.\n\nNon-transactors have very low switching costs because they have a zero on the\nburden side of the scale. There\u2019s no existing system to displace. It\u2019s all\nupside.\n\nIf we apply this model to the AI space, we have to ask ourselves:\n\n  * Who are the current non-transactors in the current software space?\n  * How can we tweak the switching cost scales?\n\n## The AI leapfrogging opportunity\n\nThe first step to creating an AI leapfrog event is to identify our non-\ntransactors. In this case, we\u2019re looking for places where there are\nhistorically low levels of SaaS adoption: construction, legal, manufacturing,\nhospitality, agriculture are good places to start.\n\nLet\u2019s look at agriculture as an example. Agriculture employs between two and\nthree million workers in the US alone. On-farm activity alone contributes\nabout $164.7 billion to US GDP. But there\u2019s still a labor shortage on American\nfarms. H2-A workers could fill this gap, but the application process is\narduous, predatory, and fragmented across many different workflows.\n\nSeso, an NFX portfolio company, jumped into this space from a SaaS perspective\nand has created a system to streamline the H2-A visa process.\n\nSeso found a group of non-transactors who had been underserved by SaaS, and\nused it to solve a core problem for this group: a shortage of farm labor.\n\nBut there are still many \u201cnon-transactors\u201d in agriculture. And in\nconstruction, legal, manufacturing, hospitality, etc:\n\n  * Construction is one of the largest industries in the global economy. But it\u2019s highly fragmented, and is one of the slowest to digitize.\n  * Legaltech was notoriously lagging and slow to take off due to technological, security and cultural barriers (but is now racing into a leapfrog event).\n  * Negative sentiment is high in the hospitality industry, leaving lots of room for improvement of CX via seamless digital products.\n  * And the digital transformation of manufacturing processes has been stalled in \u201cpilot purgatory.\u201d\n\nThe conditions are right. Which means we need to ask ourselves: How do we\nlower switching costs enough to turn these people into transactors?\n\nAt this point, any industry that lacks a SaaS solution probably lacks it for a\nreason.\n\nFor years, we have underestimated the burden that changing to SaaS platforms\nrepresents for many technologically outdated verticals. For years, SaaS has\nbeen too expensive for many of these companies. The onboarding has been\ncomplex and unintuitive.\n\nIf you\u2019ve run your books on pen and paper or a legacy software system for\ndecades, why would you switch to a new system unless you would guarantee a\nhuge change in productivity or return? If you have always written your briefs\nin Microsoft Word, why would you switch to a system that didn\u2019t integrate\nseamlessly?\n\nRemember: the value of the change must outweigh the burden of changing. The\nvalue proposition of semi-automation isn\u2019t strong enough to justify the\nswitching costs for industries reliant on entrenched, analog processes.\n\n> Members of these industries know that they\u2019re way behind when it comes to\n> automation. Generative AI is the first time we have had an opportunity to\n> package full automation in a way that is efficient, cost-effective, and\n> intuitive.\n\nGenerative AI is an instantaneous push-button solution. It generates a legal\nbrief or construction plan from scratch. Interacting with software is like\nchatting to a friend. You don\u2019t have to re-learn your whole process \u2013 you\nsimply remove tedious tasks from your to-do list.\n\nPackaged correctly, Generative AI will be the end of complex onboarding\nprocesses and unintuitive workflows that have kept switching costs high.\n\nIt sweetens the value prop immensely. It has created a tipping point by both\nreducing the burden of a shift to digitization, and enhancing the value of\nthat change 100x.\n\n## EvenUp + delivering instant value\n\nWe\u2019ve called this approach \u201cAI inside.\u201d Your selling point is not the \u201ccool\nfactor\u201d of AI technology, but the ease of use, and the value that AI brings to\nyour organization. It\u2019s about delivering instant value, seamlessly on day 1.\n\n\u201cAI inside\u201d is the technique that will allow generative AI to \u201cleapfrog\u201d SaaS\nin archaic industries.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this happen with NFX portfolio company EvenUp.\n\nEvenUp is an AI-driven platform that uses medical records and legal data to\nspeed up the process of personal injury law.\n\nThe whole personal injury law process is kicked off by the submission of a key\ndocument: a demand letter that outlines injuries and makes the initial demand\nfor compensation. Lawyers spend years perfecting the process of drafting this\nformulaic, but key document.\n\nEvenUp offered lawyers a push-button simple solution: use generative AI to\ncreate an instant, near perfect demand letter.\n\nEvenUp\u2019s selling point isn\u2019t its workflow. It\u2019s the demand letter itself.\nEvenUp takes at least five hours off of the demand letter writing process, and\nreduces the costs of generating that letter by 50 percent.\n\nEvenUp is a masterclass on the power of AI leapfrogging. And there\u2019s plenty\nmore opportunity out there.\n\n## Recap: The advantages of AI leapfrogging\n\nLeapfrogging doesn\u2019t happen often. And it\u2019s not easy to execute. Many of the\nindustries we\u2019ve highlighted (construction, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.)\nare the ones that scare people away because of burdensome processes.\n\nYou may face high CAC initially as you look to displace multi-generational\noperating systems. But the rewards for doing so will show themselves in long-\nterm value. Ultimately, these are industries with very low churn. Customers in\nthese spaces only switch operating systems every 5, 10, or 20 years.\n\nThat\u2019s because once you become a dominant paradigm, the value proposition\nscale recalibrates: you need another extremely big technological change to\nlower switching costs enough to justify another shift.\n\nThis is one reason the US continues to lag behind many EMs when it comes to\nmobile payments. For places like China and Kenya, who had undeveloped credit\nsystems, leapfrogging to mobile didn\u2019t require ripping out a sophisticated\nsystem.\n\nThe US, however, developed a robust credit and debit infrastructure system\nfrom the 1950s to the 1980s. Today, debit and credit is still the dominant\npayment method in the US and has proven nearly impossible to remove. It\u2019s a\n\u201cgood enough\u201d system with high switching costs.\n\nThat\u2019s the inherent value of a leapfrog event: once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re hard to\nremove.\n\nThe same processes that have made archaic industries so hard to overhaul\nbecome defensibilities for you, long-term.\n\nIf history is any indication, these leapfrogging opportunities don\u2019t last\nlong. We saw it with the emergence of mobile, and with digital payments.\nWithin three to five years, the major players had already executed the jump.\n\nRight now, the AI leapfrogging window is wide open.\n\nSubscribe for more Generative AI insights\n\nGet our weekly newsletter that 260K+ startup teams read\n\nMorgan Beller\n\nGeneral Partner\n\nDaniel Museles\n\nAssociate\n\nAs Founders ourselves, we respect your time.
