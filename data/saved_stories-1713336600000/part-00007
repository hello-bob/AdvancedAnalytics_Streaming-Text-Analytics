Mark Evers, director of the Markey Caner Center at the University of\nKentucky, and Jason Chesney, director of the Brown Cancer Center at the\nUniversity of Louisville.\n\n\u201cA well-funded fact-based tobacco control program is needed to counteract the\n$251 million per year that tobacco companies are spending to market their\ndeadly and addictive products in Kentucky,\u201d that letter stated. \u201cAs Big\nTobacco has been working hard to addict future generations with e-cigarettes\nand other tobacco products, the need for more funding for tobacco prevention\nprograms has never been greater.\u201d\n\nAccording to that letter, Kentucky sees $55 savings for every $1 it spends on\ntobacco control programs.\n\nThis session, lawmakers passed a bill touted as a way to curb underage vaping.\nThe bill limits vaping products that can be sold in Kentucky to those that\nhave approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have applied for FDA\napproval or are challenging denial of FDA approval.\n\nAdvocates said that by limiting available vaping products, the bill could\nresult in more Kentuckians turning to cigarettes. Tobacco cigarettes are worse\nfor bodily health.\n\nVaping has eclipsed traditional smoking among Kentucky youth, advocates say,\nthough Kentucky\u2019s rates for both are higher than the national average.\n\n\u201cThe only effective strategy is to adequately fund evidence-based programs,\u201d\nthe Cancer Society\u2019s Hogan said, \u201cthat have a meaningful, measurable track\nrecord of success.\u201d\n\nAlicia Whatley, policy and advocacy director for Kentucky Youth Advocates,\nsaid the state needs a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d battle against nicotine use in general.\nThe roughly $2 million going toward cessation is \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to\naccomplish that goal.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just want a database of who\u2019s selling vape products,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\nwant something comprehensive that tells us who\u2019s selling any of those\nproducts\u201d \u2014 traditional cigarettes, chew tobacco, nicotine patches, vapes, she\nsaid.\n\nUnder a new law, the Kentucky secretary of state is required to keep a list of\nretailers that sell vaping products. That law, HB 11, is meant to curb\nunderage vaping by limiting sales to \u201cauthorized products\u201d or those that have\n\u201ca safe harbor certification\u201d based on their FDA status.\n\nIn the final days of the session, this bill absorbed Senate Bill 344, which\ncreated an e-cigarette registry. The combined bill was signed into law by Gov.\nAndy Beshear on April 5. It goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cIt really should be more comprehensive, but I did not see that that was the\ncase this year,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cI saw a lot of people just talking about\nvaping.\u201d\n\nAnother new law, HB 142, directs boards of education to distribute tobacco\nprevention and cessation materials to students every year. It also requires\nschools to confiscate tobacco and vaping products and allows them to suspend\nstudents for subsequent violations of the ban on smoking and vaping on school\nproperty. It was delivered to Beshear in late March and he signed it on April\n9.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the state budget for tobacco prevention?\n\nThe legislature\u2019s two-year budget slightly cut funding for tobacco control in\n2025, according to Cara Stewart, the director of policy advocacy at Kentucky\nVoices for Health. The funding then flattens out in 2026.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s about $2 million per year set for tobacco prevention\nefforts, said Hogan. That number drops by about $130,000 for the first year of\nthe new budget. Then, for 2025-2026, it is restored to $2 million.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s outrageous that lawmakers ignored the urgent need for a\nsignificant investment in tobacco prevention and cessation,\u201d Hogan told the\nLantern in early April. \u201cLives are at stake. The health of our next generation\nis at stake with e-cigarettes and other products.\u201d\n\nCiting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, Stewart said Kentucky\nshould be putting closer to $56.4 million every year into tobacco control,\nconsidering the state\u2019s population and smoking rate.\n\nTwo bills that did not advance this session \u2014 HB 813 and SB 335 \u2014 would have\nassisted that goal by moving Juul settlement dollars from the General Fund to\nthe Department for Public Health to support the Smoking and Vaping Cessation\nProgram. Both were dead on arrival.\n\nPublic health advocates think that money should indeed be spent on tobacco\nprevention.\n\n\u201cTobacco use is our number one preventable cause of disability, disease and\ndeath,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cEvery single county in the state has a smoking rate\nabove the national average.\u201d\n\n\u2018All smokers want to quit\u2019\n\nThe CDC reports that \u201cmost\u201d vaping products have nicotine in them, an\n\u201caddictive\u201d chemical that is \u201ctoxic to developing fetuses.\u201d\n\nVaping products can also harm lungs and brain development in youth, the CDC\nsays. E-cigarettes are not safe, the CDC says, though they\u2019re safer than\nsmoking traditional cigarettes, which the CDC reports is a leading cause of\npreventable death in the country.\n\nSome research suggests vaping can help people quit traditional smoking. That\nhope helped push Louisville businessman Troy LeBlanc into the vape business.\n\nAbout 11 years ago, it worked in getting \u2014 and keeping \u2014 him off cigarettes.\n\n\u201cAll smokers want to quit,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cI went through Chantix. I did the\ngum. I did the patches. I did cold turkey. I did all these different things\nthat never worked. Well, you know what did work? Vaping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point of electronic cigarettes\u201d is to get people weaned off, he\nsaid, by tapering down their intake over time, eventually stopping.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that every person that walks into my store is doing it with this\nspecific plan to quit vaping,\u201d he said. But he has seen \u201cmultiple people quit\nvaping completely.\u201d\n\nLeBlanc told a legislative committee that the new law\u2019s limits on vaping\nproducts \u201cis essentially creating a monopoly for Juul,\u201d an e-cigarette\ncompany.\n\nWill anti-vape bills help public health?\n\nIt remains to be seen what effect anti-vaping legislation like HB 11, which\ntakes effect Jan. 1, will have on public health.\n\nSome in the vaping industry say it will drive consumers back to traditional\ntobacco products \u2014 an assertion buttressed by reports from Altria, the parent\ncompany of tobacco giant Phillip Morris USA, the leading manufacturer of\ncigarettes in the United States.\n\nAltria is lobbying legislatures around the country to enact laws like the one\nKentucky just passed. Altria also has moved aggressively into marketing its\nFDA-approved e-cigarette products.\n\nIn a February earnings call. Altria CEO Billy Gifford said that \u201cillicit\ne-vapor\u201d sales last year reduced Phillip Morris cigarette sales by 1.5% to 2%.\n\nThe February earnings report said a successful clampdown on disposable e-cig\ngrowth could increase Altria\u2019s earnings per share between 5 cents and 15\ncents, according to an analyst for Barclays, \u201cif cigarette volumes improve and\ne-cigs decline or remain steady.\u201d\n\nSince January 2022, Altria has spent more than $500,000 lobbying the Kentucky\nlegislature, according to reports filed with the Legislative Ethics\nCommission.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that this drives people back to smoking, how does this help\npublic health?\u201d said Greg Troutman, a lawyer for the Kentucky Smoke Free\nAssociation, which represents vape retailers.\n\nTroutman said the new law will \u201cblack-market\u201d vape products that have unknown\ningredients.\n\nPeople who smoke increase their risks of heart disease and strokes, according\nto the CDC. But it doesn\u2019t hurt just them. Nonsmokers who breathe secondhand\nsmoke are much more likely \u2014 20% to 30% \u2014 to end up with heart disease or\nstroke, the CDC says. Kentucky already has dismal rates of heart disease\nmortality and stroke.\n\nIn 2021, a California-based study found that when flavored e-cigarettes were\nbanned, minors turned to traditional cigarettes. At that time, researchers\nfoundthat \u201creducing access to flavored electronic nicotine delivery systems\nmay motivate youths who would otherwise vape to substitute smoking.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, study author and assistant professor of health\npolicy at Yale School of Public Health Abigail Friedman, urged caution when\npassing legislation attacking vapes only.\n\n\u201cWhile neither smoking cigarettes or vaping nicotine are safe per se, the bulk\nof current evidence indicates substantially greater harms from smoking, which\nis responsible for nearly one in five adult deaths annually,\u201d said Friedman.\n\u201cEven if it is well-intentioned, a law that increases youth smoking could pose\na threat to public health.\u201d\n\nPrevious ArticleBills to become law on vaping, pharmacy reform, vaccinations,\ndrugs, at-home blood testing, coverage of cancer screening, more\n\nNext ArticleLegislature rejects pleas, cuts tobacco-prevention spending;\npasses vape bill some say could spur youth smoking\n\nCategories\n\nArchives\n\nPopular Tags\n\nhospitals drug abuse Affordable Care Act children's health prescription drug\nabuse state government research children General Assembly smoking ban\nlegislature nutrition tobacco health insurance Medicaid schools insurance\nexchange smoking Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act rural health\npolitics health reform legislation obamacare obesity\n\nPopular Posts this Week\n\n  * Advocates of using psychedelic drug ibogaine to treat addiction say its risks to the heart can be mitigated in a controlled study under DRUGS, EVENTS, FEATURED, HEALTH BUSINESS, HEALTH POLICY, YOUR HEALTH\n  * Several Ky. water systems exceed new federal limits for \u2018forever chemicals\u2019; all systems must test for 3 years, correct if needed under FEATURED, HEALTH POLICY, YOUR HEALTH\n  * Study finds kids eat too much pizza, too often, and it\u2019s bad for their health under YOUR HEALTH\n\nCategories\n\n  * CORONAVIRUS\n  * DRUGS\n  * EVENTS\n  * FEATURED\n  * HEALTH BUSINESS\n  * HEALTH POLICY\n  * OPINION\n  * TOBACCO\n  * YOUR HEALTH\n\nApril 2024M| T| W| T| F| S| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  \n8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14  \n15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21  \n22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27| 28  \n29| 30  \n  \nKentucky Health News is an independent news service of the Institute for Rural\nJournalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Media\nat the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy\nKentucky.\n\nRepublication of any KHN material with proper credit is hereby authorized, but\nif the republication is longer than a news brief we ask that it contain the\nfirst sentence of this paragraph.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Kentucky Health News.
