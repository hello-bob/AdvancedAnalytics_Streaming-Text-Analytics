We\u2019re actively\nparticipating in it,\u201d said Rep. Rashida Tlaib.\n\nBy\n\n    Sharon Zhang ,\n    Truthout\n\nPublished\n\n    April 22, 2024\n\nDemonstrators rally and march through downtown to show support for the\nPalestinian people on October 11, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.Scott Olson /\nGetty Images\n\nThe House passed a bill to send $26.4 billion in unconditional military and\nother assistance to Israel on Saturday, with only 37 Democrats voting against\nthe package, which would aid the genocide in Gaza and escalate tensions across\nthe Middle East.\n\nThe bill passed 366 to 58 on a bipartisan basis, with 21 Republicans joining\nthe three dozen Democrats in voting against the passage. The legislation,\nwhich now goes to the Senate for consideration, would allow Israel to access\nU.S. weapons stockpiles held in other countries as Israel prepares a raid of\nsouthern Gaza. The legislation also bans the funds from being used to\ncontribute to Palestinians\u2019 primary humanitarian relief agency, the UN Relief\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), even as U.S. officials warn\nthat famine is spreading across the region.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the bill\u2019s passage, which,\nif signed into law, will likely help Israel further inflame tensions with Iran\nwhile continuing its genocide, in which over 34,000 Palestinians, including at\nleast 14,500 children, have been killed so far.\n\nThe funding is significantly higher than previous proposals for aid to Israel.\nShortly after Israel\u2019s current assault on Gaza began in October last year,\nPresident Joe Biden had requested $14 billion in unconditional aid; the new\nHouse bill nearly doubles that request. The U.S. is already the largest single\nforeign funder of Israel and has provided the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with\ntens of thousands of weapons over the decades, including thousands of bombs\nand munitions just in recent months.\n\nAmong the Democrats who voted against the bill were cosponsors of Rep. Cori\nBush\u2019s (D-Missouri) ceasefire legislation, as well as a number of other\nDemocrats who have seemingly come around on the issue in recent months as the\nU.S. sanctions the slaughter of Palestinians.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nWar & Peace\n\n## Under UN Charter, Iran\u2019s Attack Was a Legal Response to Israel\u2019s Illegal\nAttack\n\nIran\u2019s attack on Israel was lawful self-defense carried out in compliance with\ninternational humanitarian law.\n\nBy\n\n    Marjorie Cohn ,\n    Truthout\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nNineteen of the Democrats, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n(New York), Baarbara Lee (California) and Pramila Jayapal (Washington), who\nvoted against the bill put out a statement saying that they support funding\nfor Israel\u2019s Iron Dome and its \u201cright to self-defense,\u201d but do not support\n\u201cmak[ing] ourselves complicit in this tragedy.\u201d\n\nOthers put out statements that were stronger in their condemnation of Israel.\n\n\u201cI refuse to be a party to an ongoing genocide that Netanyahu, his far-right\ngovernment, and the United States are inflicting on the Palestinian people,\u201d\nsaid Bush. \u201cWe find ourselves at a dangerous and pivotal moment in the history\nof our country and world. It is imperative that we invest in diplomacy,\ndemocracy, and peacebuilding, rather than death, destruction, and mass human\nsuffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not support unconditional military aid that further escalates the\nalready horrific humanitarian situation. It\u2019s unconscionable to provide a\nblank check to the Israeli military while the genocide of Palestinians\nconsinue[s],\u201d wrote Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota).\n\nIn addition, Bush and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) held a press conference\ncondemning the funding last week, highlighting statements from doctors who had\nserved in Gaza in recent months.\n\nThere, Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, said: \u201cOur country\nisn\u2019t just complicit in this genocide. We\u2019re actively participating in it.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has pledged to oppose the funding package by\noffering amendments to oppose unconditional military funding to Israel and\nrestore funding to the UNRWA.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to make sure the United States does not send\nmore unconditional military aid to Netanyahu\u2019s war machine and does not allow\nany more children to starve in Gaza,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
