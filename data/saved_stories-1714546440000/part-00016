It was only in the\nair for around an hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA warning on the flight deck and a \"non-routine sound from near the right\nwing\" alerted the crew to a problem before the missing slide was observed upon\nlanding, a Delta spokesperson previously told Business Insider.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBissell-Linsk, a partner at law firm Labaton Keller Sucharow, told the Post he\nwas looking out the window of his oceanfront home in Queens when he spotted\nthe slide.\n\n> The Missing emergency escape slide that fell off Delta Air Lines Boeing\n> 767-300 aircraft (N176DN) on 27 April, have been found, as it washed up in\n> front of house of lawyer whose firm is suing Boeing.\n>\n> \ud83d\udcf8By : Katie McFadden @KatieMcFaddenNY#aircraft #airlines #safety\n> pic.twitter.com/CA5f3mIj7D\n>\n> \u2014 FL360aero (@fl360aero) April 29, 2024\n\n\"We are right on the beach and I saw it was sitting on the breakers,\" he\nadded. Bissell-Linsk said a crew of Delta workers turned up to pull it out of\nthe water about five hours later.\n\nA Delta spokesperson confirmed to the Post that it had retrieved the slide and\nadded, \"we will fully cooperate with all relevant investigations.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBissell-Linsk's firm is representing Boeing shareholders in a case, filed on\nJanuary 30, that claims the planemaker made misleading statements about safety\nfollowing the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nThat incident, which saw a door plug come off a 737 Max 9 in midair, has\nmarred Boeing's reputation and resulted in its CEO resigning.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that since the Delta Boeing 767 was built in 1990,\nthe incident points to a maintenance issue rather than the planemaker's fault.\nBy contrast, the Alaska 737 was delivered to the carrier just 66 days before\nthe blowout.\n\n\"We haven't decided if the slide is relevant to our case,\" Bissell-Linsk told\nthe Post.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Warning light came on 3 times before plane wall blew out\n\nBoeing Delta Aviation\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
