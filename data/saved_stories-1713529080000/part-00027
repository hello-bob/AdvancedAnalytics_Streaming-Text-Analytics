Different desktop environments2. Better command line package management3.\nMore flexibility4. Desktop Cube5. Middle click paste6. Snap or Flatpak\n\nAdam Breeden/ZDNET\n\nI use both Linux and MacOS. Linux is my primary OS, whereas I use MacOS for\nvideo editing and when I'm on my MacBook Pro (because I haven't found a\nsuperior Linux laptop). Every time I'm on MacOS, I find myself wishing it had\ncertain capabilities and features found on Linux. After all, MacOS already has\nsome foundation features (such as similar command line tools) borrowed from\nLinux.\n\nAlso: 6 Apple Notes features I rely on to stay organized and save time\n\nBut there's always more, and I firmly believe that if MacOS would adopt even\nsome of these features, it would become a bigger force than it already is.\n\nRead on... if you dare (because you might see just how good Linux is).\n\n## 1\\. Different desktop environments\n\nFor me, this is a big one. I also understand just how hard it would be to\nimplement. For one thing, Apple wants its users to work with MacOS in a very\nparticular way. But the MacOS desktop isn't quite as efficient as some you\nfind on Linux. For years, I've wished I could install different desktop\nenvironments on MacOS, similar to GNOME, KDE Plasma, Enlightenment, etc.\n\nAlso: Don't like your Linux desktop? Here's how to install an alternative\n\nBut, no, Apple has pretty much locked down the desktop and only offers a few\nconfiguration options for users. Imagine what MacOS would be like if you could\nhighly customize the desktop to look and behave exactly how you want it. Linux\ncan do that.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\n## 2\\. Better command line package management\n\nLinux has multiple ways you can manage software. There are the GUI package\nmanagers (such as Software and Discover) but there's also the command line\n(with the likes of apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, etc.). MacOS has Homebrew but you\nhave to install it manually and it can be a bit confusing when you have to add\ncask into the mix. If MacOS had something similar to apt, it would make\ninstalling, removing, updating, and purging applications so much easier (at\nleast for those who prefer the command line).\n\nAlso: Two tricks that make using the Linux command line a lot easier\n\n## 3\\. More flexibility\n\nSimilar to number 1, it would be nice if MacOS could be a bit more flexible.\nThe flexibility of Linux is one of its main selling points (along with\nsecurity and reliability). With Linux, you can change just about anything you\nwant (all the way down to the kernel). MacOS doesn't enjoy nearly that level\nof flexibility. Imagine what MacOS would be like if you could change anything\nyou wanted.\n\nAlso: The first 5 Linux commands every new user should learn\n\nYes, that type of flexibility could also make it less stable, so Apple would\nwant to add those options behind something like the Android \"developer\noptions\" feature, so users knew what they were getting into. One of the\nbiggest reasons why I use Linux is because I can turn any distribution into\nexactly what I want.\n\n## 4\\. Desktop Cube\n\nI remember the days of using Compiz and getting the Desktop Cube to work. It\nwas always one of my favorite methods of switching desktops and apps. On top\nof that, it looked so cool. Some desktop environments (such as KDE Plasma)\nhave brought back Desktop Cube and I couldn't be happier. Yes, it's just eye\ncandy but I cut my teeth on Linux in the late '90s and early 2000s when the\nLinux desktop had so much eye candy that you risked suffering from digital\ndiabetes. Also, wobbly windows were a lot of fun.\n\nAlso: Linus Torvalds takes on evil developers, hardware errors and 'hilarious'\nAI hype\n\n## 5\\. Middle click paste\n\nUntil you've experienced middle-click paste, you have no idea what you're\nmissing. Here's how it works:\n\n  * Highlight some text with your cursor.\n  * Place your cursor where you want the pasted text.\n  * Click the middle mouse button (or left/right buttons simultaneously).\n  * Enjoy the pasted text.\n\nNo other operating system enjoys such an efficient means of copying and\npasting text. Even better, you could do the standard highlight one bit of\ntext, hit Ctrl-c, highlight another bit of text, and then hit Ctrl-V to paste\nthe first string and middle mouse click to paste the second.\n\n## 6\\. Snap or Flatpak\n\nLinux enjoys several universal package managers but Snap and Flatpak are the\nleaders of that pack. With these package managers, everything necessary to run\nthe application is contained within, so it doesn't matter what distribution\nyou use, it'll work. If MacOS could adopt a universal package manager, that\nwould not only make app installation even easier but also (maybe) allow the\ninstallation of Linux snaps or flatpak packages possible, it would be an\nabsolute game changer. That could also go both ways, with MacOS universal\npackages capable of being installed on Linux. Imagine what that would be like.\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why desktop Linux is finally growing in popularity\n\nYes, I realize some of the above either aren't possible or would take far too\nmuch work to create. But why not dream? If Apple could see how beneficial the\nabove features could be (and make them a reality), MacOS could become an\nunstoppable force.\n\n#### Featured\n\nI tested Lenovo's dual-screen laptop and it improved my productivity in\nprofound ways\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book 4 Ultra review: Should Windows users consider anything\nelse?\n\nNothing's new $99 earbuds are the most stylish ones I've tested (and almost\nperfect)\n\nThe most charming projector I've tested has now replaced my TV for movie\nnights\n\n  * I tested Lenovo's dual-screen laptop and it improved my productivity in profound ways\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Ultra review: Should Windows users consider anything else?\n\n  * Nothing's new $99 earbuds are the most stylish ones I've tested (and almost perfect)\n\n  * The most charming projector I've tested has now replaced my TV for movie nights\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### iOS 18 wishlist: 5 features I'd like to see Apple bring to the iPhone\n\n### Apple is exploring helping users work seamlessly across devices\n\n### 6 Apple Notes features I rely on to stay organized and save time\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
