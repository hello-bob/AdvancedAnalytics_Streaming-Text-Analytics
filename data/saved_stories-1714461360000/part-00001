But California \u2014 a leader\nin EVs \u2014 says that isn\u2019t too much of a problem for its residents.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHas Tesla Already Won the EV Charging War?\n\nTesla Update Aims to Help Owners Who Can\u2019t Unplug Their Charging Cables in the\nCold\n\nThe TikTok Ban is Law.

Gavin Newsom announced last week that there is now one EV\ncharging station for every five gas stations in the state, which is home to\nmore than 39 million people. There are now 105,000 public or shared private\nelectric charging stations in California and 500,000 at-home chargers.\nCalifornia has also approved a $1.9 billion investment plan to help deploy\n40,000 additional EV chargers across the state. California had already put\n$1.8 billion into efforts to improve its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV)\ninfrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHas Tesla Already Won the EV Charging War?\n\nTesla Update Aims to Help Owners Who Can\u2019t Unplug Their Charging Cables in the\nCold\n\nThe TikTok Ban is Law.

What Now?\n\n\u201cCalifornia dominates in this space,\u201d Newsom said Friday in a video posted on\nX, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWe want to maintain that leadership \u2014 maintain\nthat dominance \u2014 as we transition from dirty tailpipes to a low-carbon, green\ngrowth future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lack of easy access to charging is one of the most commonly cited obstacles\nto growing EV sales. Everyone from Ford Motor Co.\u2019s CEO to the U.S. secretary\nof energy has run into issues finding an electric charger. And even if you can\nfind a charger during a road trip, JD Power has found that 1 in 5 attempts to\nuse a public EV charger fail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lack of access could be a major wrinkle in California\u2019s plan to phase out\nthe sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035. The process will start in 2026,\nwith a new mandate that requires 35% of all news cars sold to be electric or\nplug-in hybrid cars.\n\nMore than 1.84 million ZEVs have been sold in California to date, according to\nthe governor\u2019s office. More than a third of all ZEVs sold in the U.S. are sold\nin California. If California seceded from the U.S. and became its own country,\nit would be the fourth-largest seller of EVs worldwide, behind Germany, the\nU.S., and China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of the push from carmakers to expand EV charging access for their\ncustomers, every major Western automaker has made deals to adopt Tesla\u2019s North\nAmerican Charging Standard (NACS). Exact amounts vary, but those companies\u2019\ncustomers will gain access to more than 15,000 Tesla Superchargers across\nNorth America under their respective deals.\n\n\u201cThis move will improve the public charging experience by giving our customers\neven more choice and is a vital part of our growth as an EV brand,\u201d Ford CEO\nJim Farley said in a statement earlier this year after his customers gained\naccess to Tesla\u2019s chargers. Ford was the first major automaker to sign a deal\nwith Tesla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven automakers \u2014 including Stellantis, GM, and Mercedes-Benz \u2014 have also\nformed a joint venture to launch the IONNA charging network, which aims to\nhave at least 30,000 charging stations across North America by 2030. Those\nstations will be compatible with Tesla\u2019s NACS and the Combined Charging System\n(CCS).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Quartz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
