In part because the kind of terrible brunchlord managers in\ncharge of many institutions primarily see AI as a way to cut corners and\nattack labor.\n\nIt\u2019s been a particular problem in healthcare, where broken \u201cAI\u201d is being\nlayered on top of already broken systems. Like in insurance, where error-prone\nautomation, programmed from the ground up to prioritize money over health, is\nincorrectly denying essential insurance coverage to the elderly.\n\nLast week, hundreds of nurses protested the implementation of sloppy AI into\nhospital systems in front of Kaiser Permanente. Their primary concern: that\nsystems incapable of empathy are being integrated into an already\ndysfunctional sector without much thought toward patient care:\n\n> \u201cNo computer, no AI can replace a human touch,\u201d said Amy Grewal, a\n> registered nurse. \u201cIt cannot hold your loved one\u2019s hand. You cannot teach a\n> computer how to have empathy.\u201d\n\nThere are certainly roles automation can play in easing strain on a sector\nfull of burnout after COVID, particularly when it comes to administrative\ntasks. The concern, as with other industries dominated by executives with poor\njudgement, is that this is being used as a justification by for-profit\nhospital systems to cut corners further. From a National Nurses United blog\npost (spotted by 404 Media):\n\n> \u201cNurses are not against scientific or technological advancement, but we will\n> not accept algorithms replacing the expertise, experience, holistic, and\n> hands-on approach we bring to patient care,\u201d they added.\n\nKaiser Permanente, for its part, insists it\u2019s simply leveraging \u201cstate-of-the-\nart tools and technologies that support our mission of providing high-quality,\naffordable health care to best meet our members\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d The\ncompany claims its \u201cAdvance Alert\u201d AI monitoring system \u2014 which\nalgorithmically analyzes patient data every hour \u2014 has the potential to save\nupwards of 500 lives a year.\n\nThe problem is that healthcare giants\u2019 primary obligation no longer appears to\nreside with patients, but with their financial results. And, that\u2019s even true\nin non-profit healthcare providers. That is seen in the form of cut corners,\nworse service, and an assault on already over-taxed labor via lower pay and\nhigher workload (curiously, it never seems to impact outsized high-level\nexecutive compensation).\n\nAI provides companies the perfect justification for making life worse on\nemployees under the pretense of progress. Which wouldn\u2019t be quite as terrible\nif the implementation of AI in health care hadn\u2019t been such a preposterous\nmess, ranging from mental health chatbots doling out dangerously inaccurate\nadvice, to AI health insurance bots that make error-prone judgements a good 90\npercent of the time.\n\nAI has great potential in imaging analysis. But while it can help streamline\nanalysis and solve some errors, it may introduce entirely new ones if not\nadopted with caution. Concern on this front can often be misrepresented as\nbeing anti-technology or anti-innovation by health care hardware technology\ncompanies again prioritizing quarterly returns over the safety of patients.\n\nImplementing this kind of transformative but error-prone tech in an industry\nwhere lives are on the line requires patience, intelligent planning, broad\nconsultation with every level of employee, and competent regulatory guidance,\nnone of which are American strong suits of late.\n\nFiled Under: ai, automation, health care, hospital systems, labor, llm,\nnurses, patient care Companies: kaiser permanente\n\n3 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Catholic AI Priest Stripped Of Priesthood After Some Unfortunate Interactions\n  * Effective Altruism\u2019s Bait-and-Switch: From Global Poverty To AI Doomerism\n  * How I Use AI To Help With Techdirt (And, No, It\u2019s Not Writing Articles)\n  * Ctrl-Alt-Speech: The Bell Tolls For TikTok\n  * French Collection Society Wants A Tax On Generative AI, Payable To Collection Societies\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cNurses Say Hospital Adoption Of Half-Cooked \u2018AI\u2019 Is Reckless\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n3 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 5:42 am\n\n\u201cKaiser Permanente, for its part, insists it\u2019s simply leveraging \u201cstate-of-\nthe-art tools and technologies that support our mission of providing high-\nquality, affordable health care to best meet our members\u2019 and patients\u2019\nneeds.\u201d\u201d\n\nWhat a bunch of bullshit.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 6:54 am\n\n# Re:\n\nAgreed.
