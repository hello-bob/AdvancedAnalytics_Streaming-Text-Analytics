And while a lot of that money will be put to good\nuse shoring up fiber, a lot of it is being dumped in the laps of regional\nmonopolies with a long, long history of taking subsidies in exchange for\nbroadband networks they repeatedly, mysteriously, leave half completed.\n\nCompanies like AT&T, Charter, and Comcast that, thanks to years of anti-\ncompetitive behavior and lobbying, enjoy regional monopolies, limited\noversight, and all that results (spotty access, high prices, slow speeds, and\ncomically terrible customer service).\n\nSo not too surprisingly, there\u2019s some fairly basic requirements affixed on\nthis infrastructure bill money. The feds are preferring that the money be used\nto help build future-proof fiber networks. Some states (like Washington) are\nalso urging the construction of \u201copen access\u201d networks, which allow numerous\nISPs to come in and compete in layers, driving down prices.\n\nTo be clear, the NTIA rules affixed to the $42 billion in infrastructure\nsubsidies allow states to ask that in exchange for this massive handout, ISPs\nmake an effort to ensure they\u2019re providing low-income users in those areas\nsome kind of lower-cost option. And telecom giants like AT&T, Comcast,\nCharter, and Verizon are successfully lobbying states to have those\nrequirements killed.\n\nThe feds themselves aren\u2019t engaging in \u201crate regulation,\u201d though this is how\nit\u2019s been framed by telecom lobbyists and the politicians who love them. AT&T\nlobbyists have gone state by state, having success in states like Virginia\nthreatening them to eliminate requirements that ISPs provide lower-cost\nservice for poor people, or they\u2019ll take their ball and go home:\n\n> \u201cIn Virginia, AT&T warned the state in a legal filing last September that\n> strict pricing requirements \u201cwould be contrary to good public policy, lead\n> to litigation and more importantly will discourage provider participation.\u201d\n> The company requested that \u201cany rate regulation language be removed\u201d from\n> Virginia\u2019s blueprint.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular Techdirt reader, you probably know that AT&T has an\nextremely long history of taking taxpayer money, subsidies, tax breaks, and\nother federal favors, then making a sort of farting sound when asked to do\nmuch of anything (including actually delivering on a broadband network or new\njobs).\n\nThat they\u2019re being asked to do some basic things to get taxpayer money\nshouldn\u2019t be seen as onerous notes Gigi Sohn, the popular telecom sector\nreformer whose nomination to the FCC, you might recall, was scuttled by a\ncoordinated GOP and telecom industry smear campaign:\n\n> \u201cThis is a requirement in exchange for a humongous government benefit,\u201d said\n> Gigi Sohn, executive director of the American Association for Public\n> Broadband, which advocates for low-cost options. \u201cThe kind of notion that\n> government can require something in exchange for giving out billions of\n> dollars, that\u2019s standard.\u201d\n\nThe state requirements aren\u2019t a big deal. And decades of lobbying and dodgy\ncourt rulings have left most states without the staff or regulatory firepower\nto actually enforce requirements anyway, so it\u2019s unlikely that telecoms would\nhave faced any real penalty should they have half-assed it.\n\nBut big ISPs are absolutely terrified of even the faintest idea that anybody\nin government would so much as think about \u201crate regulation\u201d (or any attempt\nto stop them from exploiting their regional monopolies to rip off captive\ncustomers). Even if, thanks to regulatory capture and widespread U.S.\ncorruption, that hasn\u2019t been a serious threat to their regional fiefdoms any\ntime in the last quarter century.\n\nMost state and federal regulators are so corrupt and captured, they can\u2019t even\npublicly admit that monopoly power and consolidation has resulted in\ncompetitive market failure, much less propose any real solution to it. So what\nwe get instead are these sort of bare minimum half efforts; and even that\nresults in no limit of ceaseless whining by these pampered, widely disliked\ntelecom giants.\n\nGiants who find it trivially easy to throw a few hundred thousand dollars at\ncorrupt state and federal officials to ensure that even the most basic\nrequirements affixed to taxpayer money are rendered inert.\n\nFiled Under: affordable access, broadband, infrastructure bill, subsidies,\ntelcos Companies: at&t, charter, comcast, verizon\n\n2 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual Problem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power\n  * New Net Neutrality Rules Won't Harm Telecom Giants In The Slightest\n  * AT&T Stops Pretending It Had Nothing To Do With A Massive Data Breach Impacting 73 Million Customers.

I went to Harvard.\n  * further proof 18 year olds shouldn't be trusted with major decisions.\n  * BentFranklin: Hah I was going to guess that\n  * Mike Masnick: and somehow you made it all this time without mentioning it. you must have trained that out of yourself.\n  * John Roddy: I went to Rice.*\n  * (I went on a tour of the campus)\n  * mildconcern: I try to avoid dropping the H bomb as much as I can.\n  * That aversion also helps explain why I didn't much enjoy going there, I think. \"Oh no. I'm surrounded by a pack of assholes.\"\n  * That said, the art of sounding right while being wrong is surely a featured curriculum at many US universities.\n  * BentFranklin: Keeping your data from Apple is harder than expected [article]\n\nhttps://www.aalto.fi/en/news/keeping-your-data-from-apple-is-harder-than-\nexpected\n\n  * mildconcern: And keeping the federal government running with the 5th Circuit around is also harder than expected.\n  * John Roddy: I'm waiting for the fifth circuit to issue a nationwide injunction on nationwide injunctions from the fifth circuit.\n  * mildconcern: If that causes the circuit to disappear in an internal contradiction, I'm all for it\n  * candescence: As usual, Elon is being a hypocrite about his whole \"well I'll follow the law\" stuff now that he's having beef with Brazil\n  * Mostly because it involves a left-wing government taking down right-wing content and banning right-wingers for breaking hate speech laws in the wake of Bolsonaro trying to stage a coup\n  * Meanwhile he's \"too busy\" to look into Twitter bowing to India and banning Modi's critics, as well as banning people connected to Alexei Navalny and voicing doubts about the Russian government's role in his death\n  * mildconcern: @Mike Masnick did you get to see totality? Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\".
