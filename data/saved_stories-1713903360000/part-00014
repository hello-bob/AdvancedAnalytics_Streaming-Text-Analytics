Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes.

The lenders aren\u2019t ready to sign\non.\n\nCredit...Monica Garwood\n\nSupported by\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Jordyn Holman and Ben Casselman\n\n  * April 23, 2024\n\nShoppers in recent years have embraced \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d loans as an easy,\ninterest-free way to purchase everything from sweaters to concert tickets.\n\nThe loans typically are not reported on consumers\u2019 credit reports, however, or\nreflected in their credit scores. That has stoked concerns that users might be\ntaking on an outsize amount of debt that is invisible to both lenders and\nfinancial regulators.\n\nSo in February, when Apple announced it would start reporting loans made\nthrough its Apple Pay Later program to Experian, one of the three major U.S.\ncredit bureaus, it looked like a watershed moment for the fast-growing \u201cbuy\nnow, pay later\u201d category.\n\nBut none of the other major pay-later providers have followed Apple\u2019s lead.\nAnd while credit bureaus and lenders say they are interested in finding a way\nto work together, the gulf between the two sides remains wide \u2014 so much so\nthat some pay-later firms are exploring creating an alternative credit bureau\nto handle their loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen really meaningful progress,\u201d said David Sykes, chief\ncommercial officer of Klarna, one of the largest pay-later firms.\n\n\u201cBuy now, pay later\u201d loans allow consumers to pay for purchases over time,\noften in four installments over six weeks, interest free. They surged in\npopularity during the pandemic, when they helped fuel an online-shopping boom.\nThe rapid growth has continued: The retail industry attributed its record-\nsetting holiday sales in part to the popularity of pay-later products.\n\nBut economists at Wells Fargo warned last year that \u201cphantom debt\u201d from pay-\nlater loans \u201ccould create substantial problems for the consumer and the\nbroader economy.\u201d\n\n## Five U.S. Cases Targeting Big Tech\n\nCard 1 of 5\n\nFor years, Apple, Google, Meta and other tech giants operated unfettered. Now,\nregulators around the world are taking steps to compel them to make major\nshifts to their products and businesses. In the United States, several cases\ncould result in orders for the companies to change their practices. Here\u2019s\nwhat to know.\n\nApple. The Justice Department joined 16 states and the District of Columbia in\nfiling a lawsuit against Apple, arguing that it had violated antitrust laws\nwith practices that were intended to keep customers reliant on their iPhones\nby preventing other companies from offering applications that compete with\nApple products.\n\nAmazon. The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states have sued the e-commerce\ngiant, accusing it of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by\nsqueezing merchants and favoring its own services. The outcome could alter the\nway Americans shop online.\n\nMeta. The Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states have accused\nFacebook of buying up its rivals, particularly Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp\ntwo years later, to illegally squash competition that could have one day\nchallenged the company\u2019s dominance. They have called for the deals to be\nunwound.\n\nGoogle. The Justice Department has targeted the tech giant with two separate\nlawsuits. In 2020, the agency accused Google of illegally protecting its\nmonopoly over search and search advertising. In 2023, the Justice Department\nand a group of eight states accused it of illegally abusing a monopoly over\nthe technology that powers online advertising.\n\nThe credit bureaus argue that incorporating pay-later loans into the reporting\nsystem would benefit consumers, who could build credit by repaying the loans\non time, and lenders, who would gain fuller insight into consumers\u2019 borrowing.\n\nThe pay-later providers agree \u2014 in theory. But they worry that reporting the\nloans would end up hurting their customers. Existing scoring models penalize\nborrowers who take out many loans in a short period. That could be a problem\nfor the pay-later industry because, unlike credit card purchases, each pay-\nlater transaction is treated as a loan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome consumer advocates share that concern.\n\n\u201cThe credit reporting system is a system that assumes monthly payments, it\nassumes longer-term loans, and it just isn\u2019t really cut out to handle \u2018buy\nnow, pay later,\u2019\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, senior attorney at the National Consumer\nLaw Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a square-peg, round-hole kind of thing.\u201d\n\nThe consumer reporting industry in the United States has evolved over the\ndecades to become a complex web of independent and sometimes competing\nplayers. Financial institutions \u2014 banks, mortgage brokers, auto lenders and\nothers \u2014 report information on loans to three major credit bureaus: Equifax,\nExperian and TransUnion. Those bureaus compile the data and provide it to\nlenders and consumers, and also to companies like FICO and VantageScore, which\nuse it to produce credit scores.\n\nThe major credit bureaus say they addressed the pay-later industry\u2019s concerns\nmore than two years ago when they created a category for the loans. That\nshould allow FICO and VantageScore to adjust their models to account for those\nloans\u2019 unique characteristics \u2014 and ultimately to incorporate them into credit\nscores without penalizing users. (For now, the loans would be included on\nconsumers\u2019 credit reports but not visible to lenders or incorporated into\nscoring models.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road, but I think that we are finally hitting a turning\npoint in the momentum toward getting the data reported,\u201d said Liz Pagel, a\nsenior vice president at TransUnion who oversees the company\u2019s consumer\nlending business.\n\nOur business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct\nfinancial stake in companies they cover.\n\nThe pay-later industry, however, argues that the credit-reporting system still\nisn\u2019t ready. For one thing, the credit bureaus primarily receive data from\nlenders monthly, whereas pay-later loans are typically paid biweekly. (All\nthree major credit bureaus said that while monthly reporting was the default,\nlenders could report more frequently if they wish.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fit-for-purpose yet,\u201d Mr. Sykes of Klarna said. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t\nseen anything from the bureaus that suggest it\u2019s about to be.\u201d\n\nKlarna reports loans to TransUnion and Experian in Britain, where the system\nworks somewhat differently. A rival, Affirm, reports some longer-term loans to\nExperian in the United States and says it hopes to report shorter-term loans\n\u201ceventually.\u201d\n\nOther major pay-later providers, like Afterpay, PayPal and Zip, said their\nconcerns with the credit reporting system\u2019s handling of pay-later loans had\nnot been resolved.\n\n\u201cOur members continue to say it\u2019s still inadequate,\u201d said Penny Lee, president\nof the Financial Technology Association, which represents many of the largest\npay-later companies.\n\nThat argument took a hit in February, however, when Apple announced that it\nwould begin reporting loans made through its \u201cApple Pay Later\u201d product \u2014\nessentially a copy of the pay-in-four loans offered by Klarna, Afterpay and\nsimilar firms \u2014 to Experian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple declined to comment, but in an earlier news release said that while the\nloans would not immediately be incorporated into credit scores, it saw the\nmove as a step toward \u201cproviding users with the opportunity to further build\ntheir credit.\u201d\n\nSilvio Tavares, chief executive of VantageScore, said in an interview that\nApple\u2019s announcement showed the credit-reporting system\u2019s ability to handle\npay-later loans.\n\n## Inside the World of Tech\n\n  * iPhone Repairs: Apple said that it would relax limits on repairing newer iPhones with used parts like screens, batteries and cameras, a reversal from its previous practice of using software to encourage people to work with new and more expensive Apple-approved parts.\n  * Employees Feud Over War in Gaza: Google executives, after watching employees snipe about the war in Gaza, are making big changes to turn down the temperature on their company\u2019s beloved message board.\n  * Stopping a Huge Cyberattack: A Microsoft engineer noticed something was off on a piece of software he worked on. He soon discovered someone was probably trying to gain access to computers all over the world.\n  * \u2018Twitter Menace\u2019 or True Believer?: The deep-pocketed tech investor Garry Tan says he wants to save San Francisco. But his pugnacious online habits are making him enemies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to be more sophisticated than Apple,\u201d he said.\n\nFar from joining Apple, however, pay-later providers appear to be exploring a\nsystem outside the traditional credit reporting infrastructure. Last year, two\nformer industry executives founded Qlarifi, a data-aggregation platform\nspecifically for pay-later loans. (Mr. Sykes of Klarna is an investor.)\n\nAlex Naughton, who left Klarna last year to help found Qlarifi and is now its\nchief executive, portrays the company as a nimble, more tech-savvy credit-\nreporting approach. It will be able to collect and share data in real time\nrather than monthly, the standard for the major credit bureaus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the existing infrastructure is able to adapt as quickly,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThe lenders and the credit agencies agree that pay-later loans are unlikely to\nremain outside the credit scoring system forever. But it is unclear what will\nbreak the logjam. Ultimately, industry experts said, it will probably boil\ndown to one of two things: Either regulators will force pay-later firms to\nstart reporting or market forces will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEither it\u2019s going to be a market shift or it\u2019s going to be a regulatory\nshift,\u201d said Shane Foster, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig who specializes in\nfinancial regulation.\n\nRegulatory action seems unlikely soon, at least at the federal level. The\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau has hinted that it would like to see pay-\nlater loans incorporated into the credit reporting system. But while the\nagency oversees the credit reporting industry \u2014 enforcing policies to ensure\nthat the data is accurate and that consumer rights are protected \u2014 it hasn\u2019t\ntried to require private companies to provide data to the bureaus.\n\nSeveral states, including California, have taken action to regulate the pay-\nlater industry, and others, including New York, are considering doing so. But\nthose efforts wouldn\u2019t immediately require the loans to be reported to credit\nbureaus.\n\nBanks and other traditional lenders report to the credit bureaus because the\ndata is helpful in lending decisions and because it provides a stick to\nencourage borrowers to repay: If they don\u2019t, their credit scores will suffer.\n\nPay-later providers may not feel much pressure to begin reporting because\ntheir business is growing and most consumers are making their payments, said\nTed Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. But if the economy slows and\nmore consumers start falling behind on payments, lenders might decide they\nneed to join the credit reporting system to judge borrowers\u2019 reliability.\n\n\u201cDelinquencies are pretty low, the job market\u2019s been solid, so maybe that\u2019s\nnot created the same urgency,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Buy now, pay later\u2019 has yet to have\nits real delinquency reckoning. People keep warning about it. Maybe that will\nultimately be what spurs change here.\u201d\n\nJordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail\nindustry and consumer behavior.
