For senior executives, existing noncompetes can remain in force. Existing noncompetes with workers other than senior executives are not enforceable after the effective date of the final rule.\n\n    * Fewer than 1% of workers are estimated to be senior executives under the final rule.\n    * Specifically, the final rule defines the term \u201csenior executive\u201d to refer to workers earning more than $151,164 annually who are in a \u201cpolicy-making position.\u201d\n  * The FTC estimates that banning noncompetes will result in:\n\n    * Reduced health care costs: $74-$194 billion in reduced spending on physician services over the next decade.\n    * New business formation: 2.7% increase in the rate of new firm formation, resulting in over 8,500 additional new businesses created each year.\n    * Rise in innovation: an average of 17,000-29,000 more patents each year for the next ten years.\n\n      * This reflects an estimated increase of about 3,000 to 5,000 new patents in the first year noncompetes are banned, rising to about 30,000-53,000 in the tenth year.\n      * This represents an estimated increase of 11-19% annually over a ten-year period.\n    * Higher worker earnings: $400-$488 billion in increased wages for workers over the next decade.\n\n      * The average worker\u2019s earnings will rise an estimated extra $524 per year.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission develops policy initiatives on issues that affect\ncompetition, consumers, and the U.S. economy.
