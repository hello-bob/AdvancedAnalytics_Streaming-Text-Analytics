We need policymakers that\nunderstand the cultural, social, and political dynamics of their communities.\nWe need civil society organizations that understand the dynamics of activism,\nof accountability, and about how you actually build policy and ideas in the\nfirst place. And we need that everywhere,\" Shuchi Talati, the founder of The\nAlliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, an organization\npushing for more inclusive solar geoengineering research, told ABC News.\n\nTalati says the vast majority of the conversation about solar geoengineering\nis coming from countries like the United States, so her organization does\noutreach to communities in the Global South that are being impacted by climate\nchange to share awareness about solar geoengineering as a growing area of\nresearch.\n\n### MORE: These geoengineering technologies could help combat the climate\ncrisis, scientists say\n\nThe increased attention on solar geoengineering research has brought increased\nscrutiny from critics concerned that mere research makes it more likely a\ncountry could choose to deploy these technologies. In 2022, more than 60\nclimate scientists and experts from around the world signed a letter calling\nfor an agreement to not pursue solar geoengineering.\n\nIn the U.S., Tennessee and several other states have considered laws to make\nit illegal to release chemicals or other substances with the intention of\nchanging the weather or intensity of the sunlight.\n\nABC News chief meteorologist and chief climate correspondent Ginger Zee joined\ntwo teams investigating methods that could one day reflect enough sunlight to\nhelp drop temperatures on Earth -- marine cloud brightening and stratospheric\naerosol injection.\n\n## Marine cloud brightening\n\nWhile solar radiation modification as a possible climate solution is still at\nan early stage of research, humans have been unintentionally altering Earth's\nradiation balance for more than a century.\n\nSarah Doherty, program director of the Marine Cloud Brightening Project and\nassociate professor at the University of Washington, says that emissions from\nships traversing the globe have already been triggering a similar process.\n\nOver the northeastern Pacific Ocean, low clouds form the backdrop for\ndoz...Show more ---\n\nMODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC\n\n\"You can see where ships go over the ocean. The sulfur they're producing from\ntheir engines produce small particles in the atmosphere and often leave\nbrightened cloud streaks and we call them ship tracks,\" Doherty told ABC News.\n\nShe says that the marine cloud brightening project that she oversees is\nstudying ways to duplicate the process by essentially making a \"clean ship\ntrack out of sea salt.\"\n\nScientists from the University of Washington and a group called Silver Lining\nrecently began a first of its kind outdoor study to better understand how\nmarine cloud brightening technology could work.\n\nThe study consists of blowing tiny particles of salt water into the air and\nusing a variety of research instruments to study the evolution of a sea-salt\naerosol plume as it rises higher into the atmosphere.\n\nIn San Francisco, California, ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief\nClim...Show more ---\n\nABC News\n\nScientists say that once the sea-salt aerosols reach stratocumulus clouds in\nthe targeted area, they hope to find the perfectly sized sodium molecules that\nwill give the already existing clouds a boost.\n\nThe molecules will help attract more water vapor in the sky to form new water\ndroplets in the cloud. This will effectively make the cloud brighter meaning\nit can reflect more sunlight. By reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches\nthe Earth's surface, the temperature in that location will effectively\ndecrease.\n\nKelly Wanser, executive director at the non-profit Silver Lining which\nadvocates for more research around the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere,\nsays that this technology is still really far from being a full-scale,\noperational technology and would likely cost billions of dollars to research\nand develop.\n\n\"If we understand the science of what particles do to clouds and how that\naffects the climate system, it's a win-win, whatever that science turns out to\nbe, because we need to know it to know about pollution and what happens in the\nnear term. And it's what you need to know to know whether marine cloud\nbrightening might be something that you would consider for, you know,\nlessening climate impacts,\" Wanser told ABC News.\n\n## Stratospheric aerosol injection\n\nWhile marine cloud brightening would have more localized impacts, another\napproach to cooling temperatures could have broader impacts.\n\nDavid Keith, professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences at the\nUniversity of Chicago, has been at the forefront of research for an idea\ncalled stratospheric aerosol injection. While research on the topic has been\nrelatively rare, over the last few years, more scientists are studying the\ntopic with some governments also starting to take a closer look.\n\nKeith says that sulfur in the stratosphere can be very effective at offsetting\nthe heating effects of carbon dioxide by reflecting more sunlight. But he\nemphasized that solar geoengineering alone is not a cure for climate change.\n\n\"Any complicated problem like climate change rarely has just one solution. So\ncutting emissions is certainly a necessary piece. But cutting emissions\ndoesn't solve climate change, because climate change is due to the amount of\nCO2 that's in the air, and cutting emissions just stops the amount we're\nadding each year,\" Keith told ABC News.\n\n\"So solar geoengineering can, in combination with emissions cuts and\neventually with carbon removal, reduce the overall damage of climate change.\nThat's its promise.\"\n\nWhile more research is needed, one company says that the effects of climate\nchange are becoming so dire that more drastic approaches could now be\nwarranted.\n\nMake Sunsets is a company run by founders Luke Iseman and Andrew Song that\nsells what they call a \"cooling credit\" where people can pay them to send\nsulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Ze...Show\nmore ---\n\nABC News\n\nThe company says it sends sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere by launching a\nballoon filled with sulfur dioxide and helium aiming for it to reach the\nstratosphere, over 60,000 feet in elevation. At this height, the balloon pops\nand releases the sulfur dioxide into the air.\n\nThe goal is to use sulfur dioxide to mimic the cooling effects that volcanic\neruptions can have on Earth's global temperature. The United States Geological\nSurvey says that the release of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere following a\nvolcanic eruption can have one of the most significant climate impacts because\nthe particles reflect sunlight back into space, lowering Earth's temperature.\n\nMake Sunsets say the company has, in total, put less than 75 pounds of sulfur\ndioxide into the stratosphere over the last year. Iseman admits this is a\n\"negligible\" amount but it's just a start.\n\nAcademic researchers and governments argue they need to be thorough and\nproceed with caution, but the two company founders argue we don't have that\nluxury anymore.\n\n\"I summarize it as we've done such a poor job of geoengineering our climate\nwith our carbon emissions over the last several hundred years, that we now\nneed to geoengineering in a positive direction to offset that,\" Iseman said.\n\nWhile solar geoengineering discussions continue to heat up, current solar\nradiation modification efforts are still at a very small scale compared to\nwhat would be needed to make a significant impact on Earth's radiation balance\nand actually cool global temperatures.\n\nBut there's a push to focus on researching solar geoengineering as a possible\nway to address warming and understand the consequences before considering\ntaking these methods full-scale and operational.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Climate Change\n\n## Top Stories\n\n### Trump trial updates: Trump assistant recalls seeing Stormy Daniels in\nTrump Tower\n\n  * 40 minutes ago\n\n### In Howard Stern interview, Biden says he's 'happy' to debate Trump\n\n  * 3 hours ago\n\n### Golden retriever steals the show as wedding ring bearer\n\n  * Apr 26, 3:42 PM\n\n### Ex-official told investigators Trump had 'no standing declassification\norder'\n\n  * Apr 25, 10:55 PM\n\n### Walmart US CEO talks inflation, self-checkout, and non-college degree\nworkers\n\n  * Apr 25, 11:51 PM\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nABC News Network\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\nContact Us\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n", "frontpage": false}
