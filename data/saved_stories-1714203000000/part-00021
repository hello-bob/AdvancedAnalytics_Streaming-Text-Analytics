Detailing the rollercoaster of potential acquisitions and\njudicial setbacks, Dr. Burg shares insights into the company\u2019s rebirth under\nthe new stewardship of Science, promising a second chance for its PRIMA\nsubretinal implant.\n\n#### Brian Burg, Pixium Vision\n\nDr. Burg, thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s start from the top. How did\nyou get into bionic vision and how did you find your way to Pixium?\n\n[Brian Burg (BB)]: I was born and raised in Luxembourg. Luxembourg doesn't\nhave a university, so like Michael here, I went to study at ETH Zurich in\nSwitzerland. My PhD in Mechanical Engineering focused on interfacial transport\nphenomena and thermodynamics, which allowed me to gain significant experience\nin cleanroom processing. Post-PhD, I studied the transition between heat\nconduction and heat radiation at MIT, and a bit later joined IBM's Research\nLab in Zurich, where I worked on hot-water cooling for data centers with\nsubsequent heat reuse. When IBM sold their server business to Lenovo, I sought\nbetter prospects and joined a project between ETH Zurich and the University\nHospital Zurich on liver perfusion, requiring my fluid manipulation skills.\nThis venture led me into medical devices. After a few years, I relocated to\nParis as my wife was pregnant with our first child.\n\nMy first position in Paris was with a pre-clinical startup developing a\ncardiac assist device, before joining another startup in the structural heart\nspace, this time at a clinical stage. Ultimately I was drawn to Pixium who\nwere looking to fill a project manager position. This role was a perfect\nmerger of my expertise in microfabrication\u2014essential for implant\nfabrication\u2014and active implantable medical device development, which are among\nthe more challenging projects in the field.\n\nCould you tell us more about your first position at Pixium and how it led to\nyour current responsibilities?\n\n[BB]: I had been working as a project manager on the next generation of our\nproduct for about a year, when my boss, Guillaume Buc, who had hired me,\ndecided to leave for an opportunity outside of Paris in the south-west of\nFrance. That\u2019s when I was propelled into his position as the Director of R&D.\n\nAt that point, PRIMA, our major project, was already in clinical trials.\nTechnically speaking, my contribution to the pre-clinical phase was minimal,\nas it began around 2014. The implant was licensed from Stanford, invented and\ndesigned by Prof. Daniel Palanker based on photovoltaic cell principles. The\nkey role of Pixium\u2019s original employees, of which a number are still around,\nwas in the realm of industrializing the microfabrication processes. This\ninvolved refining semiconductor manufacturing and MEMS processing to meet\nstringent quality requirements. Additionally, a surgical delivery system had\nto be developed to implant the device, including its sterilization process.\nCustom wearables were created to stimulate the implant via a laser source,\nincorporating components such as laser diodes, fiber optics, lenses,\nmicroprocessors, data transmission cables, printed circuit boards, batteries,\ncameras, projectors and embedded software.\n\nThe first human implantation took place in 2017, and by the time I joined,\nnine patients had already been implanted. During the pivotal study that\nstarted in 2021, we managed to implant an additional 38 patients to our 9\npatients from our first in human studies, and we recently reached our primary\ndata endpoint in February this year. So, the journey from project manager to\nDirector of R&D at Pixium has been deeply involved with both the development\nand execution of critical technological advancements.\n\nCould you give us a preview of the PRIMAvera trial results that will be\npublished soon?\n\n[BB]: Yes, although some details must remain confidential for now. Currently,\nwe have only the raw data from the study, which hasn\u2019t yet been statistically\nanalyzed. To clarify, we have some patients who, due to unrelated reasons and\ntheir advanced age, unfortunately passed away during the study. The data\naccounting for these events has not been fully processed, and the\ncomprehensive report is still pending.\n\nHowever, I can share that the preliminary results are promising. The initial\npublished findings from the first human study have not only been confirmed but\nin some cases exceeded. A significant outcome is that we've been able to\nrestore form vision, enabling patients to read and significantly improve their\nvisual acuity on an ETDRS chart. In fact, we target to achieve our primary\nendpoint, which was improving visual acuity by at least two lines on an ETDRS\nchart for more than 70% of the participants.\n\nRegarding safety, which is crucial for any implant, all adverse events have\nbeen reviewed by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) which recommended\ncontinuing the study.\n\nCould you explain what it means for participants to be able to read with the\nimplant? With previous implants, users could recognize large-print letters\nafter looking at them for a while, which is quite different from what most\npeople think of as 'reading'.\n\n[BB]: I know what you mean, but I can assure you our patients can really\nread\u2014although the reading speed is still slower than for natural readers. Our\nimplant has a resolution of roughly 20x20 pixels, which allows for the\nprojection of two to three letters at a time on the implant. The projected\nimage on the retina covers a larger area than the size of the implant. This\nsetup facilitates some degree of eye scanning over what is projected,\nenhancing the user\u2019s ability to perceive more complex visual stimuli.\n\nHowever, there is definitely a training phase where users have to learn how to\nuse PRIMA. To clarify, our patients undergo a rehabilitation phase after\nimplantation to adapt to the device. This involves learning to focus their\ngaze directly into our projector, where the laser exits, and aligning the\nentire system, including the glasses. It\u2019s crucial for patients to learn to\nmaintain a straight gaze, particularly because they often still possess some\nperipheral vision, which can make fixing their gaze challenging without\ntraining.\n\nAfter patients become accustomed to the system, anecdotally speaking, a\ncertain number of them can read entire pages, such as books to their\ngrandchildren. It represents a significant improvement over prior devices,\noffering a more natural reading experience, though still not at the speed of\nunassisted reading.\n\nGoing back to your role as Director of R&D, could you give us a glimpse into\nthe general research direction and what improvements the team was focusing on\nfor the next generation of PRIMA?\n\n[BB]: The primary limitation of today's devices is the field of view. There\nare two ways to increase it: by increasing the implant size or by decreasing\nthe pixel spacing. Daniel Palanker\u2019s group has been working on this,\npublishing and patenting their findings, which we have licensed. This will\nrequire a new implant design to achieve the necessary penetration depth to\nstimulate the bipolar cells. The ultimate goal would be to project more\nbroadly across the iris, allowing patients to scan and capture images\nprojected onto the retina. This would, however, introduce new challenges, such\nas higher radiation levels, which in turn would raise safety concerns due to\npotential heat generation on the retina. Eye tracking may also be considered\nin this context.\n\nAnother improvement involves the wearables, which we are aiming to make more\nminimalistic and smaller in size. Ideally, we would integrate everything into\nthe glasses to eliminate the apparent projection module, thereby reducing the\nstigma for AMD patients who were accustomed to seeing normally prior to being\nstruck by the disease.\n\nAs for commercialization, the plan has always been to first launch the current\nmodel. Given that these AMD patients currently have no other viable treatment\noptions, introducing this initial version of the implant would be highly\nbeneficial. I\u2019m convinced that it will provide significant benefits to a\nsubstantial number of patients. The revenue generated from this would then\nfund the development of the next generation, which could potentially meet the\nneeds of the entire patient population.\n\nIt seems like everything was going well: you had a successful clinical trial\nand were developing a new device, but then suddenly the company faced\nfinancial issues. What happened?\n\n[BB]: The timing was most unfortunate. To answer this question, I need to give\na bit of a backstory. As you know, Pixium was founded in 2011, and one of the\nfirst major steps was acquiring a German company called IMI, which was\ndeveloping the IMI implant that would later become IRIS II. This implant\nreached commercialization a few years after Pixium went public on the French\nstock market. However, we soon encountered reliability issues with the IRIS II\nimplant, forcing us to withdraw it from the market and refocus our efforts on\ndeveloping a new implant, PRIMA.\n\nBeing a public company in Europe, and particularly in France, presented\nsignificant challenges in raising funds. This was compounded by the fact that\nwe had already spent about 130 million Euros, and our historical investors\nwere unwilling to invest further. Their reluctance raised questions among\npotential new investors about why the original backers were no longer\nsupporting us. Additionally, the public company status added complexity to how\nwe could distribute shares.\n\nOver the last 9 months, this situation led us into a safeguard procedure, and\nwe ultimately had to file for a state similar to U.S. Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nThe goal was to transition back to being a private company, with a plan for a\nnew investor to buy out Pixium's assets and start afresh. However, this\nprocess was highly regulated due to our public status, and ultimately, the\ncourt rejected the investor\u2019s bid due to insufficient proof of funding for\nfuture operations. The court decided to put us directly into liquidation on\nJanuary 31, 2024, a decision that surprised everyone involved, including\nlawyers and judicial administrators. All employees were furloughed at that\npoint.\n\nThe very next day after this decision, we closed the data for the primary\nendpoint of our clinical study\u2014it felt like something out of a movie. Now,\nwe\u2019re in liquidation but there\u2019s still an opportunity to purchase the assets\nand integrate them into a new company. That\u2019s what we got working on, under an\nextremely tight deadline. The urgency was because we need to resume the\nclinical trial, which is ongoing beyond the primary endpoint at 12 months. If\nsuccessful, this transition would allow us to start with a clean slate\u2014no\ndebt, no history\u2014as a private company, but the time pressure was intense.\n\nOur first contacts with Science stem from November 2022, whom we had\napproached for funding. After having passed twice, the raw data of our\nclinical study ultimately convinced them of the viability of the technology\nand its place in the market. Following reciprocal visits, they decided to hand\nin an offer the day bidding closed. Between competing bids, an opportunity to\nimprove offers, a judge who had fallen ill and needed to be replaced, the\nassets were finally awarded to Science on April 15, 2024.\n\nThis story has all the ingredients for a John Grisham thriller - apart from\nthe deaths! (laughs)\n\nGoing forward, what can people look forward to under this new stewardship?\n\n[BB]: The clearly stated objective is to bring the PRIMA technology as quickly\nto the market as possible. To this end the entire Paris team will be\nreinstated and incorporated in Science, namely product development, operations\nand manufacturing, clinical, and quality and regulatory affairs. Rehiring is\ncurrently ongoing, while the liabilities of Pixium will be liquidated. Ongoing\nclinical trials will be resumed and with funds now available, pivotal clinical\ntrials in the US initiated and the applications of the PRIMA technology to\nother pathologies studied.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to show the world what PRIMA is capable of. This\ntechnology has the potential to change the lives of millions of people. There\naren\u2019t that many missions out there more noble than giving back vision to the\nblind. This cause fills us with pride and we are determined to deliver.\n\nBack to all spotlights\n\n### Article Information\n\n##### April 26, 2024 5:12 AM\n\n#### The following people contributed to this page:\n\n  * ##### Michael Beyeler, PhD\n\n###### UC Santa Barbara\n\n  * ##### Lily M.
