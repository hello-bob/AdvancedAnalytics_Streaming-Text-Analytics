Congratulations to our\nfriends at Canonical. I\u2019d say it\u2019s an auspicious day, but it is more noble\nthan that! In fact, it is the first time that a .NET release is available from\nday one in the official Ubuntu feeds. There is no need to wait, you can start\nusing .NET with Ubuntu 24.04 now.\n\nYou may remember that .NET 6 was added to Ubuntu 22.04, a few months after the\nUbuntu 22.04 release. We\u2019ve learned a lot since then and significantly grown\nthe partnership between Canonical and Microsoft. Starting with Ubuntu 24.04,\nUbuntu feeds will be the official source of packages for .NET.\n\n.NET installation docs have been updated to reflect the latest instructions.\n\nUbuntu 24.04 container images are already available, for .NET 8+. They include\nnoble, noble-chiseled, and noble-chiseled-extra image flavors.\n\nUbuntu LTS releases are always quite popular. We\u2019re excited that .NET is part\nof Ubuntu 24.04 and expect a lot of .NET developers will start using these new\npackages and container images in the coming weeks and months.\n\nWant to learn more? Sign up for Microsoft Build 2024, it\u2019s free, and watch our\nsession with experts from Canonical and Microsoft.\n\n## Packages\n\nInstalling .NET 8 on Ubuntu 24.04 is straightforward.\n\n    \n    \n    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0 $ dotnet --version 8.0.104\n\nInstalling .NET 8 is the same as installing any other package available in\nUbuntu. There are no extra feeds to configure.\n\n.NET 6 and 7 are available in the Ubuntu .NET backports package repository\n(also maintained by Canonical).\n\nHere\u2019s how to install .NET 6 using the dotnet/backports repository.\n\n    \n    \n    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports $ sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0 $ dotnet --version 6.0.129\n\n.NET 7 can be installed using the same pattern, although the dotnet/backports\nrepository only needs to be registered once.\n\nIn all cases, the gestures are simpler than registering the\npackages.microsoft.com feed.\n\nNotes:\n\n  * Install the software-properties-common package if add-apt-repository isn\u2019t found.\n  * The installation may also install tzdata, which has an interactive install.\n\n## Containers\n\nThe noble container experience is much the same as jammy. The new images\nsupport non-root, chiseled, and are globalization-ready.\n\nThe upgrade is quite straightforward. I can demonstrate with a sample\nDockerfile targeting `jammy-chiseled.\n\n    \n    \n    $ grep jammy Dockerfile.chiseled FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0-jammy AS build FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0-jammy-chiseled $ sed -i \"s/jammy/noble/g\" Dockerfile.chiseled $ grep noble Dockerfile.chiseled FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0-noble AS build FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0-noble-chiseled\n\nThe images are currently in nightly.\n\n    \n    \n    sed -i \"s;/dotnet/;/dotnet/nightly/;g\" Dockerfile.chiseled\n\nWe can now build and run a container.\n\n    \n    \n    $ docker build --pull -t aspnetapp -f Dockerfile.chiseled . $ docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8080 -m 50mb --cpus .5 aspnetapp warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Repositories.FileSystemXmlRepository[60] Storing keys in a directory '/home/app/.aspnet/DataProtection-Keys' that may not be persisted outside of the container. Protected data will be unavailable when container is destroyed. For more information, go to https://aka.ms/aspnet/dataprotectionwarning warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.XmlKeyManager[35] No XML encryptor configured.

They are about the same.\n\n    \n    \n    $ docker images aspnetapp REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE aspnetapp jammy-chiseled d938d8ee1104 51 seconds ago 118MB aspnetapp noble-chiseled e59689894c68 35 minutes ago 119MB\n\n## Security and support\n\nMicrosoft and Canonical are collaborating on servicing and support. To that\nend, Microsoft gives security and functional fixes (via a private channel) to\nCanonical ahead of Patch Tuesday releases, with time for building and testing.\nWe do the same thing with Red Hat. It\u2019s our goal that .NET fixes are available\neverywhere, simultaneously.\n\nThe official source of .NET packages will be via Ubuntu feeds, as already\nstated. That raises the question of support. You can file issues for .NET on\nthe dotnet8 launchpad or in the appropriate dotnet repo. If there is any\nambiguity on which organization should resolve the issue, we\u2019ll handle that\nthrough our partnership.\n\n## Build 2024 Talk\n\nTitle: Seamlessly leverage .NET on Ubuntu from development to deployment\n\nDescription: Discover how Canonical and Microsoft streamline .NET development\non Ubuntu. Learn about .NET packages in latest Ubuntu releases, the evolution\nof .NET containers, and the benefits of ultra-secure, optimized chiseled\nUbuntu containers.\n\nRegister now!\n\n## Closing\n\nWe\u2019re excited for .NET to be so well integrated in Ubuntu or for the strong\nsupport of our friends at Canonical. We\u2019ll continue to find and explore new\nways to improve the experience of .NET on Ubuntu.\n\n### Richard Lander Product Manager, .NET Team\n\nFollow\n\nPosted in .NET Cloud Native Lifecycle LinuxTagged .net 7 .net 8 Containers\nUbuntu\n\n### Read next\n\nIntroducing .NET MAUI Community Tookit v8: TouchBehavior support is here!\n\nThe .NET MAUI Community Toolkit version 8.0 has been released with the highly\nanticipated TouchBehavior on board!\n\nGerald Versluis April 24, 2024\n\n1 comment\n\nRefactor your C# code with primary constructors\n\nExplore C# 12's primary constructors through incremental refactoring of a\nWorker service.\n\nDavid Pine April 23, 2024\n\n25 comments\n\n## 4 comments\n\n### Leave a commentCancel reply\n\nLog in to join the discussion or edit/delete existing comments.\n\n  * Ji\u0159\u00ed Z\u00eddek April 25, 2024 3:52 pm 0\n\nAre you sure -noble docker images are available ?

Nobody from Microsoft has ever declared the\nrelease day of Windows 11 an auspicious day. Then again, Windows 11\ndeliberately doesn\u2019t bundle .NET 8, 7, 6, or 5.\n\nLog in to Vote or Reply\n\n  * S\u00e9rgio Terenas April 25, 2024 6:26 pm 0\n\nRichard, is there any plan to have this easy way to install/update NET8+ on\nRaspberry Pis?\n\nLog in to Vote or Reply\n\n##### Code Block\n\nFeedback\n\nYour Privacy Choices Consumer Health Privacy\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": true}
