This study introduces YaART, a novel\n> production-grade text-to-image cascaded diffusion model aligned to human\n> preferences using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). During\n> the development of YaART, we especially focus on the choices of the model\n> and training dataset sizes, the aspects that were not systematically\n> investigated for text-to-image cascaded diffusion models before. In\n> particular, we comprehensively analyze how these choices affect both the\n> efficiency of the training process and the quality of the generated images,\n> which are highly important in practice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\n> models trained on smaller datasets of higher-quality images can successfully\n> compete with those trained on larger datasets, establishing a more efficient\n> scenario of diffusion models training. From the quality perspective, YaART\n> is consistently preferred by users over many existing state-of-the-art\n> models.\n\nComments:| Prompts and additional information are available on the project\npage, see this https URL  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.05666 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.05666v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.05666arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sergey Kastryulin [view email] [v1] Mon, 8 Apr 2024 16:51:19 UTC (9,138\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled YaART: Yet Another ART Rendering Technology, by\nSergey Kastryulin and 22 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
