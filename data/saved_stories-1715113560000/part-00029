But, if you don\u2019t have access to the data\ndirectly, there are other options. As a bonus, these options help you\nunderstand more about the software and how users actually use the software to\naccomplish something. This can help you present your feature consistently with\nthe rest of the software. Below are a few ways to glean information.\n\n## Bug Repository\n\nReview existing bugs submitted for the area you are working on (new work) or\nareas like your feature. Screenshots, videos, and explicit text strings show\nwhere users are adding data in the system, onscreen user tips for\nrequirements, and validation information (required fields, validation\nmessages).\n\nFor example, if you are changing the password requirements, you might know\nabout setting the password on account creation and password reset. Reviewing\nsome existing bugs, you see a screenshot of a password reset after the\npassword expires. That way, you learn the password can be null if your account\nwas created before passwords were required. You also learn that you must\nupdate the validation text to include the change.\n\n## Create a Trial Account\n\nIn addition to giving you a bird\u2019s eye view of the application, you can add\ndata that you know the state of. And, you can learn about ways the data is\nlimited, cleansed, or validated that may apply to your code.\n\n  * Like reviewing bugs, creating an account will show you field labels, and more.\n  * How are dates formatted for the user and numbers (like phone numbers) displayed?\n  * How are lists sorted? Is there pagination? (See Alphabetical? Chronological? Best Ways to List Data in Your App by\n\nPhil Kirkham)\n\n  * Does any information persist as you navigate around?\n  * Does the app truncate text fields after some number of characters?\n  * Are there any special calculations, such as taxes?\n  * Are there any due dates? If so, is there a grace period behavior?\n\n## Training Videos/User Documentation\n\nLook at training videos and user documentation for the existing software.\nYou\u2019ll see how the application is intended to be used and may find regression\ntest cases to cover. While reviewing these materials, look for any cyclical\nevents (calendar/fiscal year, payroll, tax cycles) that occur. Teams often\nforget about these until the software changes are almost done, and then the\nmissing requirement(s) rear their ugly heads.\n\n## YouTube/Customer Reviews\n\nUsers may have posted videos or reviews on how to do something in the app more\neasily or shared any hacks they\u2019re using. This will give more insight into\nwhat to keep and things you may want to change or avoid in your updates.\n\n## Other Internal Support Teams\n\nAsk for contacts to other teams supporting ancillary parts of the app. Ask\nCustomer Support if they know of bugs in the area of the app you are working\non. Then ask Operations about any cron jobs (batch jobs like emails, data\npurges after a specific number of days, clearing connections on regular\nintervals, required password resets every 30/60/90 day, etc.) that are run to\nsupport the app. Then consider if that has any impact on your work. Do they\nuse a different Content Delivery Network (CDN) for different regions? Also ask\nthem if there are any other systems integrated with the app to consider, such\nas push notifications.\n\nSometimes you are tasked with making changes in unfamiliar code and it can be\ndifficult to understand where your code might break other code. I hope these\nsuggestions help you learn more about the software to help reduce introducing\nregression issues.\n\npasswordscodeapp\n\nMiranda Michalski Quality Analyst | Delving, diving, driving and careening along to inform a high-quality user experience.
