Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promises \"with a high degree of scientific certainty\"\nthat GPT-5 will be smarter than the \"mildly embarrassing at best\" GPT-4\n\nNews\n\nBy Kevin Okemwa\n\npublished May 3, 2024\n\nOpenAI's GPT-5 model promises better performance and accuracy when using\nChatGPT.\n\n(Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\n## What you need to know\n\n  * OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is the dumbest it will ever be right now.\n  * He promises better performance and accuracy with the long-anticipated GPT-5 model.\n  * Altman had previously indicated that OpenAI's GPT-4 model \"kind of sucks.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was at Stanford University earlier this week, where he\nhad a lengthy discussion about his vision for the company and future advances\nin AI (via Tom's Guide). As you may know, Altman has been championing the AGI\nsuperintelligence beat for a hot minute now.\n\nIt takes an arm and a leg to keep a supercharged AI-powered chatbot like\nChatGPT on a daily basis. Last year, we learned that OpenAI spends up to\n$700,000 per day to keep its ChatGPT operations running. Interestingly, the\ncost implication to keep these operations afloat doesn't seem to be a major\nconcern for Altman. Instead, he's more focused on providing users with capable\ntools that will make work easier and let them achieve incredible feats.\n\n## A ChatGPT that's \"really good, like materially better\"\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile speaking about ChatGPT, Altman boldly said, \"GPT-4 is the dumbest model\nany of you will ever have to use again by a lot.\" It isn't the first time the\nCEO has made such a comment about the model. He admitted GPT-4 \"kind of sucks\"\nwhile rumors swirling the air indicating OpenAI is working on a new model,\npotentially GPT-5, which is expected to be \"really good, like materially\nbetter.\"\n\nWhen asked about the cost of running each subsequent model that OpenAI unveils\nand how it capitalizes on it, Altman indicated:\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentral\n\n\"I think giving people really capable tools and letting them figure out how\nthey're going to use this to build the future is a super good thing to do, and\nis super valuable, and I am super willing to bet on the ingenuity of you all\nand everybody else in the world to figure out what to do about this. There is\nprobably some more business-minded person than me at OpenAI somewhere that is\nworried about how much we're spending, but I kind of don't.\"\n\nAltman was also asked about spending over $520 million on ChatGPT last year\nand indicated GPT-4 is \"mildly embarrassing at best.\" He added the company is\nworking towards improving the LLM's performance and accuracy with new versions\nof the model.\n\n> GPT-4 is the dumbest model any of you will ever have to use again by a lot.\n> It's important to ship early and often and we believe in iterative\n> deployment.\n>\n> OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman\n\nAltman concluded his remarks by indicating with \"a high degree of scientific\ncertainty that GPT-5 is going to be a lot smarter than GPT-4.\" He further\nadded that GPT-6 would, naturally, be better than GPT-5, indicating the nature\nof AI and software development in general.\n\n## Get the Windows Central Newsletter\n\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nToday's Best Office 365 Deals\n\nMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 Business Premium - Abonnement-Lizenz -\ngehostet - Charity, Non-Profit - CSP\n\n\u20ac25.54\n\nView\n\nat JACOB Elektronik DE\n\nMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 and Windows Azure explained by\nexamples\n\n\u20ac29.99\n\nView\n\nat Udemy\n\nMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 f\u00fcr Einsteiger: Der ultimative\nLeitfaden zur Nutzung von Office wie ein Profi (einschlie\u00dflich Excel, Word,\nPowerPoint, OneNote, ...
