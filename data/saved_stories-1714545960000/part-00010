With\nan increasing demand for sustainable and carbon-neutral energy sources, HTC\nhas attracted considerable attention in the literature. However, a successful\ntransition from laboratory-scale to large-scale industrial applications\nentails notable challenges. This review critically assesses the upscaling of\nhydrothermal carbonization processes, emphasizing the challenges, innovations,\nand environmental implications associated with this transition. The challenges\ninherent in upscaling HTC are comprehensively discussed, including aspects\nsuch as reactor design, process optimization, and the current treatment\ntechnology for process water. This review presents recent innovations and\ntechnological advancements that address these challenges and explores\nintegrated solutions to enhancing hydrothermal carbonization\u2019s scalability.\nAdditionally, this review highlights key companies that have developed and\nimplemented HTC plants for commercial purposes. By overcoming the obstacles\nand achieving advancements in the upscaling of hydrothermal carbonization,\nthis review contributes to the ongoing efforts to realize the full potential\nof HTC as a sustainable and scalable biomass conversion technology and\nproposes future directions.\n\nKeywords:\n\nhydrothermal carbonization; upscaling; pilot scale; industrial scale; process\nwater\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn the last four to five decades, researchers have conducted extensive studies\nto find innovative technologies with which to develop sustainable methods to\nmitigate the environmental pollution caused by organic waste and convert it\ninto renewable energy and valuable products. Landfill and compost are two\naffordable technologies for treating waste in terms of the economic aspects\n[1]. However, compost has a large footprint and elicits a lot of complaints\nfrom neighbors due to odor issues, and it also generates greenhouse gases such\nas N_2O and CH_4. Landfills are also not a suitable solution for the future\ndue to the lack of available land and the potential risk of second-hand\ncontamination such as groundwater and soil pollution. The thermochemical\ncarbonization of biomass has more benefits compared to biochemical treatment.\nInstead of taking days or moths by the biochemical treatment, this process\ngenerally takes only several hours. There are a variety of thermochemical\nprocesses for converting biomass into various products with higher carbon\ncontent, such as dry pyrolysis and wet pyrolysis which is called as\nhydrothermal carbonization. Pyrolysis can only be used to treat feedstock with\na low moisture content (under 20%), at high temperatures, and with oxygen\nlimitation [2]. However, most organic waste has a high water content and a\nhigh degree of heterogeneity in form and composition. To utilize this method,\nan additional pre-drying step is required, resulting in high energy\nconsumption and increasing operating costs. Nevertheless, hydrothermal\ntreatment can overcome these drawbacks. It enables the treatment of wet waste\nwithout pre-drying, saving up to 70% energy consumption via the recirculation\nof wasted heat [3]. As Kruse et al. [4] mentioned, subcritical water\nhydrothermal treatment can be \u201can excellent reaction environment, reactant,\nand solvent for a diverse range of reactions\u201d. Hydrothermal processes include\nthermal hydrolysis (THP), hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), hydrothermal\nliquefaction (HTL), and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) under different\noperating conditions [5]. In Table 1, four different (dry) pyrolysis and four\ndifferent wet pyrolysis methods are compared in terms of their operating\nconditions and final products.\n\nFurthermore, thermal hydrolysis, an example of successful upscaling to\nindustrial and commercial scales, has drawn significant attention for treating\nsewage sludge, which is not easily degradable because of its glue zone or\nsticky phase zone. The thermal hydrolysis treatment process (THP) breaks down\nthe organic structure of feedstock through the process of cracking under high-\npressure and high-temperature steam [6]. This process is known as the pre-\ntreatment process of anaerobic digestion (AD) for producing biogas and\nfertilizer from sewage sludge, and it is applied in wastewater treatment\nplants. Meanwhile, there is always an argument for a clear cut between the THP\nand HTC, but the authors want to define the THP as an endothermic reaction\nthat absorbs heat from its surroundings, while HTC is an exothermic reaction\nthanks to its decarboxylation reaction [7]. For its energy consumption\nefficiency and the high demand for renewable fuel, HTC stands out as a\ndeveloping technology in contrast to the other thermochemical methods used for\ntreating wet biomass. HTC was known to researchers over a century ago and was\nfirst discovered by Friedrich Bergius, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913\nfor the transformation of cellulose, through wet thermochemical conversion,\ninto different products with various applications [7,8]. HTC is a complicated\nsimultaneous process involving hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation,\ncondensation, aromatization, and polymerization [9,10,11]. Zhung et al. [11]\npresented the details of the mechanisms of lignocellulose and non-\nlignocellulose biowastes during the HTC process. In this process, some organic\ncompounds are present, such as acetic acid, alkenes, aldehydes, and aromatics\nlike phenolic compounds and furan. The decarboxylation process inevitably\nproduces CO_2 gas. The major solid product of HTC, hydrochar, has an enriched\ncarbon content with different characteristics, different yields and a wide\nrange of HHVs, depending on the feedstock and process conditions, such as the\ntemperature, residence time, catalyst, and pH [12,13,14,15]. A higher\ntemperature and a longer residence time result in a decrease in the yield rate\nof hydrochar, while a higher carbon content in hydrochar with a higher heating\nvalue results in lower hydrogen and oxygen content [4,7,8,9,10,15]. In the HTC\nprocess, one type of feedstock is normally used as an input, but reliance on a\nsingle feedstock boosts the uncertainties regarding the sustainability of\nindustrial production methods. Recently, co-hydrothermal carbonization has\nbeen identified as a promising method for treating two or more types of\nfeedstock combinations such as biomass\u2013biomass, biomass\u2013PVC, and biomass\u2013coal\n[16,17]. Most studies have reported that co-HTC treatment can enhance the\ncarbon content of hydrochar, increase its solid yield, and yield higher\nheating values (HHVs), as well as provide higher\ndechlorination/desulfurization efficiency when compared to a single feedstock.\nHTC is an elaborate thermochemical process dealing with many reaction\nmechanisms and pathways that result in changes in the chemical and structural\ncompositions of hydrochar, as reported by Xue Y. et al. and Fakudze S. et al.\n[18,19,20]. Microwave-assisted HTC is also a new way of addressing the\nlimitations associated with the traditional HTC methods, such as heat loss,\nuncontrolled side reactions, and non-selective heating. This technology\ndemonstrated the capability to generate hydrochar with characteristics\ncomparable to those of solid fuel with energy efficiency [21,22]. To further\ndevelop this method, more large-scale trials need to be conducted.\n\nDue to the demand for the upscaling of the HTC process to the pilot and\nindustrial scales, it is necessary to review the current upscaling scenario,\naccounting for its challenges in terms of the technical aspects and\nenvironmental and economic effects. There are some review papers discussing\nthe status of industrial-scale HTC by Romano et al. and Child, M. [8,14]. In\nthese papers, the current trend of upscaling from the lab to the industrial\nscale and new approaches to designing and implementing an HTC plant at a large\nscale are reviewed to explore the potential of HTC technology\u2019s expansion in\nthis industry. Additionally, different combinations of HTC with other\ntechnologies and solutions for treating process water are presented, alongside\nthe future direction of HTC technology.\n\nTable 1.

Upscaling Case of HTC and Challenges\n\nAlthough HTC technology has attracted significant attention from numerous\nresearchers on producing hydrochar with various applications, the\ncorresponding approaches are mostly implemented in batch mode with a lab-scale\nautoclave, bench scales, and a few pilot scales. A review of the HTC process\nfrom the lab to pilot scale is presented in Table 2 below to reveal the\nchallenges and perspectives at a large scale.\n\nTo obtain the intended physical-chemical characteristics of the HTC product,\nit is crucial to adjust the specific process conditions. These parameters\ntypically include temperature, residence time, pressure, catalyst,\nbiomass/water ratio (BWR), and other relevant factors.\n\nThe relations of process parameters at the lab and pilot scales are useful for\nobtaining more favorable working circumstances on an industrial scale.\nAreeprasert C. et al. used a pilot-scale cylindrical batch-type reactor with a\ncapacity of 1 m^3 to apply the optimal conditions, which can be determined\nfrom lab-scale experiments on a vertical reactor with a size of 500 mL [26].\nThe optimal process condition of the lab-scale process was 200 \u00b0C, whereas 197\n\u00b0C with the same holding time of 30 min is optimal for the pilot scale. The\nfuel recovery of the pilot scale has a larger gap than that of the lab scale\ndue to the mass loss. However, 15.4% of the required energy for the whole HTC\nprocess is reduced when scaling up due to the utilization of a part of the\nobtained hydrochar as boiler fuel. The heating value of hydrochar at the pilot\nscale was slightly higher than that at the lab scale; this result is in\nagreement with the findings of the study by Gusman, M. H. et al. [27].\nTeribele, T. et al performed an experiment on a pilot plant involving the\ntreatment of corn stover residues in a cylindrical reactor at 250 \u00b0C,\nemploying a duration of 1\u20134 h with different BWRs [28]. Pre-treatment of some\nfeedstock, such as corn stoves, wood waste, or green waste, before\ntransferring it to the HTC reactor is sometimes required to ensure operating\nefficiency and stability. Reducing biomass size can enhance the reaction\nkinetics when the feedstock is milled or sieved to achieve a specific particle\nsize. The results also demonstrated that a higher BWR resulted in a higher\nhydrochar yield, a result that is in agreement with other research [29,30,31],\nwhile a longer residence time reduced the solid yield but increased the carbon\ncontent in hydrochar [32,33]. The optimal conditions for decomposing corn\nstover in this study were achieving a BWR of 1:10 in 4 h. In many studies, the\nuse of catalysts in the HTC process demonstrated the ability to increase the\nheating value (HHV) of hydrochar and decrease the reaction time and\ntemperature [34,35,36,37,38]. Shin et al. [39] produced bio-coal products from\nwood waste and conducted a comparative study with and without catalysts in HTC\nprocess at lab and pilot scales. The pilot plant was a binary reactor system\ndesigned by Kinava Co. and presented in the previous research reported by\nMackintosh et al. [40]. The hydrochar produced through the pilot-scale HTC\nprocess at a temperature of 220 \u00b0C with a 1.5 h residence time and a catalyst\nshowed a high calorific value of over 27 MJ/kg, which is 18% higher than that\nof coal. It also satisfied the hazardous substances standard, similar to the\nlab experiment\u2019s results, but required a 1.5-times higher catalyst\nconcentration. This study indicated that the development of catalysts for each\nfeedstock was crucial for industrial applications to increase the value of\nhydrochar. The mixture of different feedstocks to add in the HTC process\ncalled co-HTC is an innovative method for treating different wastes at the\nsame time. A pilot-scale plant involving a reactor volume of 200 L was used to\nperform the co-HTC process of a 20kg mixture of paper waste and food waste\naccording to the optimal condition at the lab scale [41]. The results\nindicated that the mixture ratio with the higher mixture ratio of paper waste\nsignificantly increased the carbon content and calorific value of hydrochar.\nThis should be studied to attain the optimal ratio when upscaling, and the\nmixture of different types of biomass waste will contribute to not only\nreducing large amounts of waste but also enhancing the properties of HTC\nproducts.\n\nBased on the above experiments, the optimal temperature and catalyst\nconcentration could have a minor gap between the lab and pilot scales, and\nthis discrepancy extends to the residence time and BWR as well. The mixture of\ntwo or more different feedstocks could affect upscaling in terms of hydrochar\ncharacteristics and yield rate. Determining the trend of temperature after\nconducting many trials at both the lab scale and pilot scale is important\nbefore designing a large plant. These determinants can predict the trend of\nthe characteristics of final products and operating conditions and be used to\npropose the optimal design for upscaling HTC plant. Choosing between a batch\nreactor and a continuous reactor is a significant factor in large-scale\nhydrothermal carbonization. In small-scale experiments or some of the above\npilot-scale trials, a batch reactor was mostly used due to its easy handling\nand ability to connect to various feeding systems. However, the drawback of a\nbatch reactor is the interruption of the process required to fill an empty\nreactor [42]. Meanwhile, continuous reactors are more complex and require a\nspecial design to handle the flow stream of a feedstock [43].\n\nHoekman S. et al. [44] reported the fabrication of a larger-scale process\ndevelopment unit (PDU) with a V-shaped tubular design in order to carry out a\nsemi-continuous HTC process for bio-fuel production from 3 kg of wood chips.\nThe hydrochar properties in this system were aligned with the results obtained\nin a batch reactor. A twin-screw extrusion system (TSE) developed by Hoekman\nS.\u2019s group was used to perform a fast HTC to treat loblolly pine feedstock in\ncontinuous mode [45]. The biomass was fed and then carbonized and cooled in\none direct flow. This approach allowed for a slight reduction in reaction\ntime, but the reaction temperature of this system is higher, amounting to 290\n\u00b0C, compared to the batch process\u2019 reaction temperature of 230 \u00b0C in 30 min.\nIts hydrochar, however, was produced in a higher yield than the batch process\nwith similar process conditions (54.2\u201369.7% vs. 50.9\u201363.7%). In another study,\nIpiales, R.P. et al. performed a swine manure treatment (TS 5%) experiment to\ncompare batch and continuous operation [46]. HTC in batch mode was carried out\nin a cylinder-type Zipper Claver pressure vessel with a volume of 4L at the\ntemperature in range of 180 to 250 \u00b0C for 45 min, while other reactors were\nused in continuous mode. The continuous-type pilot reactor comprises a feeding\ntank with stirring capacity and employs a screw pump to convey the feedstock\nto the reactor. The reactor, made of stainless steel, is a tube equipped with\na mixing system designed to prevent the settling and buildup of solids on its\nwalls. The tube reactor is divided into five zones, namely, two for pre-\nheating and three for the reaction, which allows the process to run\ncontinuously and be more complex than the batch system. The hydrochar\ncharacteristics that were obtained at similar operating conditions from batch\nand continuous reactors were compared. The HHV and carbon content were similar\nin both modes, but continuous operation provided a much higher yield of\nhydrochar than that of the batch process (22.7\u201371.8% vs. 19.9\u201342.9%). The\nprocess water of the continuous reactor was also more biodegradable than that\nof the batch reactor. These results indicated that the HTC process induced\nusing a continuous reactor provides higher quality in terms of both solid and\nliquid products than batch reactors. However, a continuous reactor has a more\ncomplex system to deal with inputting the feedstock with a high-pressure pump\nworking against the inner pressure of the reactor. Therefore, continuous\nreactors are not profitable because of high CAFEX when upscaling in a large\nplant for commercial/industrial purposes. On top of this, the pipe-type\ncontinuous processes inevitably have inherent limitations regarding capacity.\nThe various solutions to treat biomass waste through HTC process using batch\nreactor and continuous/semi-continuous reactor are presented in Section 3.\n\nFor the post-process of HTC, the solid phase and liquid phase are separated\nfor further treatment. The final solid product, hydrochar, can usually be used\nas solid fuel. For other applications, hydrochar should be treated in more\nsteps so that it can be utilized in different applications. Ketwong, T. et al.\n[47] produced activated carbon in a pilot-scale reactor through the activation\nprocess adding to the HTC of an empty fruit bunch. Moreover, hydrochar could\nbe used as fertilizer [48,49] and biochar [50,51,52], which should be more\nreadily implemented in upscaling projects. Process water is one of the\ndrawbacks of HTC and is hard to manage on a large scale, so the valorization\nof process water (PW) is critical. The main characteristic of PW is that it is\nhighly acidic, with a pH in the range of 2.7\u20134.5, and contains toxins with\nhigh COD and TOC, alongside complex recalcitrant organic compounds\n[53,54,55,56]. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a possible method for treating PW\nto produce biogas for energy applications [57,58,59,60]. This combination was\ndemonstrated in a 25 L reactor by Oliveria, L. et al. [61] for producing\nbiogas, although it eslimits the biogas generation due to recalcitrant\nchemicals. The recirculation of PW into the HTC process is applied to mostly\nreduce the amount of fresh water, increase the hydrochar yield, improve the\nenergy efficiency, and make the HTC process more environment-friendly\n[62,63,64,65,66]. HTC PW can be used for nutrient recovery [67,68], liquid\nfertilizer [69], bio-chemical production [70], and algae cultivation [71,72].\nWet oxidation has recently become well-known as an advanced technology for\ntreating HTC process water in order to decompose the organic compounds,\noffering the ability to reduce COD by 50\u201370% and allowing for the recovery of\nenergy or valuable byproducts from the treated water [73,74,75]. In fact, the\nuse of HTC PW reformation to produce hydrogen and clean water may play a\npromising role in the future [76,77].\n\nTable 2.

Attasophonwattana, P. et\nal. [78] integrated a HTC pilot-scale involving 1 m^3 reactor with\ngasification of AD system to process the oil palm fruit bunch (EFB) based on a\ncircular-economy. This pilot-scale project showed a potential for energy\nrecovery, a positive environmental influence, and economic efficiency when\ncombining these technologies in one process to treat waste.\n\nOne essential method for upscaling from the small scale to the large scale is\nsimulation. After obtaining data from numerous experiments on a small scale,\nthe results can be used to predict the trend of operation for the HTC process\non a large scale. The simulation of the HTC process represents an innovative\napproach that consolidates findings from extensive experimental HTC\ninvestigations involving diverse feedstocks. Using Comsol and Multiphysics for\nthe reactor design allows for the evaluation of the reaction kinetics, mass,\nand heat transfer and the prediction of the optimal reaction conditions\n[79,80]. Modeling the whole HTC process or its combination with other\ntechnologies has been attempted using Aspen simulation (Aspen Plus V11.1)\n[81,82] or artificial neural networks [83,84]. Ismail et al. [85] conducted a\nnumerical evaluation of HTC process parameters to evaluate the efficiency of\nHTC in converting municipal waste into hydrochar on a commercial scale. The\nbenefit of such simulations is their ability to reduce experiment fees by\nestimating mass and energy balance, reaction conditions, solid yield, and even\nthe properties of products. The simulations can be integrated with life cycle\nassessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis to evaluate environmental and\neconomic implications in a general way [86,87,88]. Mohammadi, A. et al. [89]\nperformed an LCA analysis on two different scenarios for a combination of HTC\non a large scale and combined heat and power systems (CHP), which can offer a\nsynergistic approach to sustainable energy production and waste management.\nFurther research is required to enhance the reliability of the models,\nensuring their accuracy through comparisons with real-world applications.\n\nAn overview of upscaling challenges has been presented, revealing that the\nchallenges to upscaling are the optimal operating conditions for the process,\nthe reactor type or process type, the post-treatment of process water from the\nHTC reactor, and the method used to efficiently enhance the HTC process using\nother facilities. To provide a more comprehensive viewpoint, Section 3\nexplores commercial HTC companies and their technologies to resolve the\naforementioned challenges when operating at an industrial scale.\n\n## 3\\. Industrial-Scale Review\n\nThe commercialization of hydrothermal carbonization involves addressing\ntechnical, economic, and regulatory challenges. By strategically navigating\nthese factors, businesses can unlock the full potential of HTC technologies\nand contribute to sustainable and environment-friendly solutions. After\nconducting numerous trial tests, several companies have developed processes\nfor creating commercial HTC technologies on a large scale. An overview of\nrecent commercial HTC technology is shown in Table 3.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 2, the drawback of the batch reactor during a scale-up\nis the interruption of the process required to fulfill an empty reactor, so\nthe multi-batch concept is the practical solution to this problem in terms of\nheat and water recovery ability. The industrial plant of AVA-CO_2 operates HTC\nprocess parallel reactors as a multi-batch system and can treat different\ntypes of feedstock together in the range of 25\u201370 wt%. A modular design with a\nmulti-batch concept is the key feature of AVA-CO_2, which can scale up based\non the desired capacity. A process diagram for AVA-CO_2 is presented in Figure\n1a. The feedstock is mixed with water and then pumped into the mixing tank to\npreheat at 160 \u00b0C and 10 bar. Then, the preheated mixed feedstock is pumped\ninto the HTC reactor for carbonization. After reaction, the HTC slurry enters\nthe cooling tank, then heat and steam are recovered to preheat the next batch.\nThe cooled slurry is filtered to separate into the solid and liquid fractions\nfor hydrochar production and wastewater treatment. A part of the process water\nis recirculated to mix in the input feedstock, contributing to reducing\nfreshwater consumption. The heat recovery and steam-recycling system utilized\nmake the whole process of the AVA-CO_2 plant more efficient in terms of energy\nconsumption [90]. The commercial HTC plant of AVA in Relzow, Germany, has a\nplant size of two reactors for 8000 T/year of biomass feedstock and 2664\nT/year of biocoal production, which can be scaled up to six reactors [91].\nAnother process developed by AVA-CO_2 called \u201cAVA Cleanphos\u201d enables the\nrecovery of phosphorus from the hydrochar of HTC sewage sludge, achieving\nyields of up to 80% and lowering energy cost [92]. Moreover, HTC process water\nis exploited to produce bio-based chemical products. AVA Biochem is one of the\nplants of AVA-CO_2, producing 5-HMF at purity levels up to 99.9% [93,94]\nthanks to the extraction and purification steps that make the process more\neffective, as shown in Figure 1b. The main challenges in HMF production are\nthe formation of side-products, especially solid humins, and the separation of\nHMF from the reaction media, as well as its subsequent purification. These\nside products not only affect the purification but also the economic\nfeasibility of the HMF production [94].\n\nTable 3. Global HTC commercialization businesses.\n\nFigure 1.

Ingelia\u2019s HTC\nprocess can also treat different feedstocks with a moisture content in the\nrange of 30\u201390% inside inverted flow reactors for a continuous process and\ngenerate biocoal and liquid fertilizer [103,104,105]. Different from the AVA-\nCO_2 plant, a pretreatment process is employed in the Ingelia HTC plant to\nmill the input feedstock into a particle size of below 8mm and then pump it\ninto the reactor through a long pre-heating tube. The pre-treatment process\nmakes the feedstock transfer to the HTC reactor more stable and increases the\ncarbonization efficiency. This pre-heated feedstock is fed from the bottom of\nthe cylindrical vertical reactor like in the AVA-CO_2 process. Hydrochar\nslurry is also removed from the bottom, and the gases are collected from the\ntop [3,106]. The Ingelia HTC process is shown in Figure 2. Like in AVA-CO_2,\nthe process water is recycled to mix the input feedstock and used to produce\nbio-based chemicals or throughout some treatments for liquid fertilizer\napplication. Ingelia S.L. ran many trial plants in different countries,\nespecially in the UK. They installed the first HTC commercial-scale plant in\ncollaboration with CPL industries and subsequently installed a 78,000 T/year\nbiomass plant in Italy for the life cycle assessment. In terms of\nenvironmental impact, the number of reactors is greater due to the modular\nnature of this plant, which is located near waste sources, and it does not\ncause any odor issues. The total CO_2 emissions of green waste is 0.0624 T\nCO_2 equivalent, which is very low. Moreover, carbon recovery from the waste\nis high, amounting to around 64.04%, which makes Ingelia technology very\nimpactful [103]. As a promising technology, Ingelia S.L. was entered into the\nNEWAPP European project for converting biomass residues into high-quality\ncarbonaceous products with an HHV of 24 MJ/kg and an over-58% carbon content\n[107].\n\nFigure 2. HTC process of Ingelia [8,103].\n\nHTCycle also has modular units of multi-batch systems akin to AVA-CO_2 and\nIngelia L.S. HTCycle provides plants with two kinds of capacity: 8000 T/year\nand 16,000 T/year [108,109]. Figure 3 illustrates the HTCycle process. The\nmixture feedstock is pumped into the pulper tank to preheat at 90 \u00b0C for 1 h\nand then transferred to the reactor tank. Steam is injected directly into the\nreactor to increase the mixing capacity until it reaches the reaction\ntemperature. A part of the process water is recycled for mixing with the input\nfeedstock, or it can be used as liquid fertilizer. One of the main advantages\nof the HTCycle process is phosphorus extraction via leaching HTCycle coal with\nsulfuric acid. Process water can be used as liquid fertilizer, but there is no\nreported data from HTCycle about its toxicity and nutrient content which was\nsuitable for fertilizer applications. According to the report titled \u201cSewage\nSludge Reuse Phosphate Recovery with an Innovative HTC Technology\u201d, the\nproject of HTCycle for 50,000 tons of biomass, including sewage sludge, can\ngenerate up to 11,000 tons of HTC coal, up to 1750 tons of activated carbon,\n1200 tons of phosphorus recovery, or 2000 tons of sulfur [110].\n\nFigure 3. HTCycle AG technology process [8,108].\n\nLike AVA-CO_2, Ingelia, and HTCycle, the SunCoal HTC plant has a batch-reactor\nmodular design with a capacity of producing 50,000 T/year of raw material in a\nsemi-continuous process [113]. This HTC process can transform green or organic\nwaste into a solid biofuel called SunCoal. This biofuel exhibits\ncharacteristics comparable to dry brown coal [8]. Moreover, upgraded hydrochar\ncan be used to produce bio-based chemicals, biochar, or activated carbon. The\npre-processing of feedstock by crushing to achieve a uniform size of 60 mm and\nremoving impurities, is required in the SunCoal HTC process. The low- and\nhigh-pressure steam used for heating is recycled, along with the process\nwater. For other applications, to attain bio-based filler for rubber\ncompounds, CarboREN technology is used to convert hydrothermally treated\nlignin biomass into functional bio-based filler for rubber compounds via the\naddition of silane coupling agents [114].\n\nAnother technology from Carbon Solutions (CS-HTC90) in Germany provides a\nsemi-continuous HTC process [115]. The biomass is mixed with a part of the\nprocess water and preheated before entering from the top of the HTC reactor.\nThis process can convert 10,000 tons of biomass into biocoke. In comparison\nwith other company processes, the Carbon Solutions process uniquely involves\nthe use of CarbonPure, their proprietary technology, to treat process water\nafter filter pressing. CarbonPure converts the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of\nthe process water from 50\u201380 g/L to less than 2 g/L, recovers energy in a\nsteam generator, and produces liquid fertilizer [116].\n\nThe C-700 HTC plant process is another industrial-scale semi-continuous HTC\ntechnology of CarboRem. It can treat 5000 T/year of sludge with a solid\ncontent in the range of 2\u201310 wt% [95]. This containerized plant comprises a\nstainless-steel HTC plug flow reactor, a diathermic oil boiler for supplying\nthermal energy, a heat exchanger, a PLC, and two storage tanks. The HTC\nprocess of the C-700 plant is illustrated in Figure 4. The digestate sludge is\nfed by a pump against the pressure inside the HTC reactor. The heat exchanger\nplaced before the reactor is used to recover heat from the hot HTC slurry\nafter the reaction; it then preheats the input flow pumped into the reactor.\nThis HTC process is conducted at 190 \u00b0C for 1 h. The HTC slurry of the\ndigestate is then treated by using different acids like HCl, H_2SO_4, or\ncitric acid to remove the heavy metal content, releasing phosphorus into the\nliquid phase upto 97% and enhancing dewaterability. The separated solid\nhydrochar with a high solid yield of 80\u201389 wt%, showing potential for\napplication in soil fertilizer, has a high carbon concentration, consisting of\nup to 16.8% fixed carbon, and low heavy metal content. The struvite\nprecipitation technology is applied for the recovery of P in the liquid phase\nat up to 91 wt% when compared to the digestate sludge [96]. The HTC liquid can\nbe transferred to the AD system for waste management to increase biogas\nproduction and generate energy for heating the diathermic oil in the HTC\nsystem. This combination of AD and HTC enhances the process efficiency.\n\nFigure 4. Schematic of diagram of the C-700 HTC plant [96].\n\nLike CarboRem, TerraNova in Germany also serves as an example of a semi-\ncontinuous HTC plant that has a similar process with some different parts\n[100]. This entails a clever integration of high-pressure pumps, a continuous\nstirred-tank reactor that employs heat exchanger tubes and acts as a tubular\nreactor, dewatering, and drying equipment. In this semi-continuous system, a\nheat exchanger used to recover heat from HTC slurry plays an important role in\nimproving the efficiency of HTC production, as shown for both the CarboRem and\nTerraNova systems. Note that the heating systems of the two technologies use\ndiathermic oil. Compared to steam, diathermic oil is safe and simple for\noperations and can reach up to 350 \u00b0C while the pressure remains low. However,\nit requires a more complex and expensive heat regulation system. Notably, a\ncatalyst such as H_2SO_4 is added into the HTC reactor to accelerate the\nprocess. An HTC process flow diagram is presented in Figure 5. A commercial\nHTC plant produced by TerraNova Energy was introduced in 2016 and installed in\nJining, China for sewage sludge treatment. A total of 14,000 tons/year of\ndewatered sewage sludge with 68% dry matter content was treated to generate\nsolid fuel or up to 80% of phosphorous recovered by adding calcium silicate\nhydrate to the filtrate or via acid leaching [101,102]. It also contributed to\nreducing the mass of sewage sludge by 75%, which is typically disposed of,\nproviding a new approach for efficient P recovery.\n\nFigure 5. An illustration of TerraNova HTC technology process [8,100].\n\nDifferent from other technologies, the OxyPower HTC, C-Green, provides an\ninnovative process by uniquely integrating a semi-continuous HTC reactor with\nwet oxidation (WO) technology in a semi-continuous process to convert sludge\nfrom wastewater treatment into valuable products such as nitrogen fertilizer,\nsolid fuel, or hydrochar for soil improvement. The sludge is heated two times\nwith the steam fraction before entering the HTC reactor and reacted at 180\u2013250\n\u00b0C. Then, the obtained HTC slurry is mixed with an oxidizing agent such as\noxygen gas, which may be added directly into the reactor, and the gas goes\ntowards the gas treatement chamber. The oxygen is provided through an oxygen\ncompressor to the filtrate oxidizer. A wet oxidation reaction occurs\npreferably at 220\u2013260 \u00b0C, and the energy can be self sustained. The wet\noxidized slurry is subjected to flashing to recover the steam for preheating\nthe input sludge and then cooled; then, it is separated into solid and liquid\nphases [97]. Applying the wet oxidation method not only results in a lower COD\nof 15 g/L [102] in HTC process water but also decreases the volume of the\nsolid fraction and enriches the nitrogen and phosphorous. The first HTC plant\nof C-Green was erected in Finland in 2020 and can treat pulp and paper sludge\nat a capacity of 18,000 T/year, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by\nup to 77% [98]. Wet oxidation contributes to reducing wastewater generation\nand improving energy efficiency. The innovative combination of HTC and wet\noxidation with other methods such as AD should be further investigated. The\nprocess of OxyPower HTC technology is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Schematic diagram of the OxyPower HTC^TM process [99].\n\nA study comparing the efficiency in energy recovery and economic performance\nobtained by integrating HTC utilizing TerraNova and C-Green with other\ntechnology was presented by Bagheri, M. et al. [102], involving the\ncombination of AD and CHP; AD, CHP and WO of C-Green or AD, CHP and HTC of\nTerraNova (using H_2SO_4 as a catalyst) for the wastewater treatment process.\nOverall, adding WO can balance the investment costs, self-heating ability, and\npower output, but it is still not attractive for profitable investments.\nHowever, the combination of HTC and AD, when HTC process water is directly\nadded in AD, can improve biogas production and reduce the disposal cost of\nsewage sludge, resulting in a significant investment opportunity.\n\nThe technology produced by Antaco uses continuous processes with a tube-type\nreactor, which makes their process different from other companies\u2019 approaches.\nIt can deal with 30,000 to 150,000 T/year of feedstock on a dry and wet base,\nrespectively. The distinct aspect of this process is that after the completion\nof the reaction, the energy present within the slurry is efficiently recycled\nto facilitate the processing of incoming biomass. Following this, the HTC\nslurry is subjected to a series of steps, including dewatering, drying, and\npelletization, ultimately yielding biocoal. The biocoal has a heat value of 23\nMJ/kg, like fossil coal [111]. Just like CarboRem, Antaco also applies an\nanaerobic digestion system to process the wastewater. Campbell, B. S., et al.\nreported on the HTC of spent coffee grounds integrated with an Antaco\nanaerobic digestion plant to investigate the stability of an AD system.\nProcess water resulted in a higher yield of methane and higher COD degradation\nthroughout the 190 days of operation [112]. The main issue with the Antaco AD\nsystem is that it is only 25% efficient in biogas production, which falls\nsignificantly short of industry standards.\n\nYoshikawa, K. et al. [117] implemented a commercial demonstration plant in\nIndonesia. The plant produced biocoal from municipal solid waste using HTC in\na single year. The treatment capacity of this plant was 50 T/day. The\nprocedure utilizing the steam generator was completed in a 10 m^3 batch-type\nreactor. The hydrochar that was obtained had an HHV greater than 17 MJ/kg.\nUsing 15% of the obtained biocoal was sufficient for providing the necessary\nsteam during the HTC process, making the overall process more energy\nefficient.\n\nBy reviewing the HTC processes employed by different commercial companies, one\nmay conclude that HTC on a large scale brings many advantages to the\nenvironment and economy by reducing the amount of biomass waste, reducing\nwastewater treatment costs, and producing valuable end products like\nfertilizer, biofuel, biochar, biogas, and bio-chemicals. A number of factors\nneed to be considered when operating a plant on a large scale: the selection\nof a suitable HTC reactor, either batch or continuous; the number of cycles\nper day or the capacity of treatment; the necessity of pretreatment for\nfeedstock; the heating system, i.e., steam- or diathermal-oil-based; an\nefficient waste-heat recovery system; proper control of odor during the\nprocess; and the optimal operation conditions, such as temperature, residence\ntime, and catalyst. Combining HTC and other technologies like AD and WO to\ntreat process water not only creates a new energy source but also reduces\nwastewater treatment costs and makes the HTC process more eco-friendly with\nhigher performance efficiency. However, a number of non-technical issues\nshould be addressed and assessed in a systematic way, such as life cycle\nassessment or techno-economic analysis.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nBased on recent studies about upscaling from the lab scale to pilot scale, it\nis evident that reaction temperature, pressure, residence time, type of\nfeedstock, reactor type, energy recovery, mass balance, and energy balance are\nthe crucial process parameters for designing an industrial scale HTC plant.\nDetermining the optimal process parameters related to a cost\u2013benefit analysis\nis also necessary when carrying out the HTC process on a large scale. Many\ncompanies like Ingelia, AVA-CO_2, CarboRem, SunCoal, Antaco, Carbon Solution,\nTerrNova, HTCycle, and C-Green have successfully developed industrial-level\nplants, but they still face several challenges, particularly in terms of plant\ndesign and in the sector of wastewater treatment plant. Innovative reactor\ndesigns intended to improve productivity, such as continuous systems and\nmulti-batch reactors, should be carefully chosen for suitable processes to\naccommodate different purposes of production. Upscaling is necessary because\nit can optimize resource utilization through increasing process efficiency,\nleading to reduced cost and labor requirements. Moreover, larger-scale HTC\noperations should meet the demands of industries and markets for\ncommercialization. When upscaling HTC technology, a significant quantity of\norganic waste from landfills can be diverted to valuable products, reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the environmental impact. However, the\nchallenges and caveats to upscaling should be recognized. The treatment of\nprocess water will need more research to address valorization and reducing\nwastewater treatment costs on an industrial scale. By integrating HTC\n(Hydrothermal Carbonization) with other waste treatment methods like anaerobic\ndigestion, combustion, and wet oxidation can indeed offer several potential\nbenefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nData collection, T.T.-T.H.; Conceptualization, T.T.-T.H. and K.C.; Design of\nthe work, T.T.-T.H. and A.N.; Writing and draft preparation, T.T.-T.H. and\nA.N.; writing, review, and editing, T.T.-T.H., A.N. and K.C.; Critical\nrevision of the article, K.C.; Final approval of the version to be published,\nK.C.; supervision, K.C.
