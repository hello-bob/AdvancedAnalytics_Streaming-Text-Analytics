And, no, the fix isn't just a software\nupdate.\n\nBy Matt Binder on April 19, 2024\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard\n\nEvery Cybertruck is being recalled by Tesla due to a serious issue which\ncaused the accelerator pedal to get stuck. Credit: Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nImagine you're driving down the road in your brand new Tesla Cybertruck, and\nsuddenly, the vehicle won't stop accelerating.\n\nFor some Cybertruck customers, this frightening scenario became a reality\nbecause of an accelerator pedal cover that would slide up and become lodged in\nthe vehicle's interior trim. The cover would get stuck when the pedal was\nalready pressed down, holding it in that position so that the car would\ncontinue to accelerate even if the driver took their foot off the pedal.\n\nNow, Tesla has recalled every Cybertruck that has been delivered to a customer\n\u2013 all 3,878 of them.\n\nSEE ALSO: Analysis: The Cybertruck's failure is now complete\n\n## Cybertruck recalled\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla\nis recalling the Cybertruck due to \"Unintended Acceleration from Trapped\nPedal.\" The agency describes the issue as \"a trapped accelerator pedal can\ncause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a\ncrash.\"\n\nIt's not completely out of the ordinary to see a Tesla vehicle being recalled.\nHowever, as Elon Musk fans and Tesla owners are usually quick to point out,\nthose recalls usually require a fix that can be made with a software update.\nThere's normally no need to bring your vehicle to a Tesla service location.\n\nHowever, that's very much not the case with the Cybertruck. The accelerator\npedal fix will require owners to take their vehicle to a Tesla service center.\n\nThe NHTSA says that Tesla intends to \"replace or repair the accelerator pedal\nassembly, free of charge.\"\n\nWhat is causing the problem? According to Tesla, during testing, it discovered\nthat \"an unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component\nassembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal\" and that \"residual lubricant\nreduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.\"\n\nAs previously reported, earlier this week, Tesla quietly stopped Cybertruck\nproduction and deliveries shortly after social media videos from Cybertruck\ncustomers who had experienced the accelerator pedal cover dislodging began to\ngo viral.\n\nAccording to the recall, Tesla first heard about the incident happening to a\ncustomer on March 31. Just days later, on April 3, another customer reported\nthe same issue to the company.\n\nTesla says it decided to issue a recall on April 12. The company will be\nsending notification letters to current Cybertruck owners in the coming\nmonths. Cybertrucks that are awaiting delivery will receive the fix as well.\nFinally, Tesla is equipping Cybertruck vehicles in production with a new\naccelerator pedal component.\n\nTopics Electric Vehicles Tesla Elon Musk\n\nRecommended For You\n\nSave $100 on the Amazon Kindle Scribe with Premium Pen\n\nRead, sketch, annotate, and check off the to-do list.\n\n03/27/2024\n\nBy Lauren Allain\n\n'Dune: Part Two': What does Paul tell Baron Harkonnen?\n\nAnd why does it matter?\n\n03/01/2024\n\nBy Belen Edwards\n\nElon Musk's X suspends users who post alleged name of alt-right comic creator\n\n'StoneToss' webcomics frequently feature antisemitism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ\nsentiment.\n\n03/20/2024\n\nBy Matt Binder\n\n'Speak No Evil' trailer: James McAvoy is an awful host in chilling horror\nremake\n\nWorst vacation ever.\n\n04/11/2024\n\nBy Amanda Yeo\n\nThe best sexting apps for safe NSFW fun in 2024\n\nBurn after reading.\n\n04/04/2024\n\nBy Amy-Mae Turner and Tabitha Britt\n\nTrending on Mashable\n\nThe Cybertruck's failure is now complete\n\nTesla's latest vehicle was widely mocked even before its accelerator pedal\nproblem.
