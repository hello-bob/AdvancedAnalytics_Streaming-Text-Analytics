Some are enormously difficult. The fools\nwho write the textbooks of advanced mathematics \u2014 and they are mostly clever\nfools \u2014 seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations\nare. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous\ncleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.\n\nBeing myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the\ndifficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not\nhard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do,\nanother can.\n\nNext \u2192 Main Page \u2191\n\n", "frontpage": true}
