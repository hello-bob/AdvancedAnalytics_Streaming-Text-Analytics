The sunlight causes carbon dioxide ice at the bottom of the layer to\nturn into gas, which subsequently builds up and breaks through slabs of\noverlying ice. The gas bursts free in martian springtime, dragging dark\nmaterial up to the surface as it goes and shattering layers of ice up to a\nmetre thick.\n\nThe emerging gas, laden with dark dust, shoots up through cracks in the ice in\nthe form of tall fountains or geysers, before falling back down and settling\non the surface. This creates dark spots of between 45 m and 1 km across. This\nsame process creates characteristic \u2018spider-shaped\u2019 patterns etched beneath\nthe ice \u2013 and so these dark spots are a telltale sign that spiders may be\nlurking below.\n\nExoMars TGO view of ice spiders on Mars\n\nAnother of ESA\u2019s Mars explorers, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), has\nimaged the spiders\u2019 tendril-like patterns especially clearly (see below). The\nspiders captured by TGO lie near, but outside, the region shown in this new\nMars Express image. The Mars Express view shows the dark spots on the surface\nformed by escaping gas and material, while the TGO perspective also captures\nthe spidery, web-like channels that are carved into the ice below.\n\nThe aforementioned dark spots can be seen all over the Mars Express image,\ncreeping across towering hills and expansive plateaus. However, most can be\nseen as small spots in the dark region to the left, which sits just at the\noutskirts of a part of Mars nicknamed Inca City. The reason for this name is\nno mystery, with the linear, almost geometric network of ridges being\nreminiscent of Inca ruins. More formally known as Angustus Labyrinthus, Inca\nCity was discovered in 1972 by NASA\u2019s Mariner 9 probe.\n\nThis new view of Inca City and its hidden arachnid residents was captured by\nMars Express\u2019s High Resolution Stereo Camera. A version with labels is also\navailable; click on the image below to explore the region and discover more\nabout the different features you can see here.\n\nMars Express sees traces of \u2018spiders\u2019 in Mars\u2019s Inca City (click to zoom)\n\n### A mysterious origin\n\nWe\u2019re still not sure exactly how Inca City formed. It could be that sand dunes\nhave turned to stone over time. Perhaps material such as magma or sand is\nseeping through fractured sheets of martian rock. Or, the ridges could be\n\u2018eskers\u2019, winding structures related to glaciers.\n\nPerspective view of Mars's Inca City\n\nThe \u2018walls\u2019 of Inca City appear to trace part of a large circle, 86 km in\ndiameter. Scientists therefore suspect that the \u2018city\u2019 sits within a large\ncrater that itself formed as a rock from space crashed into the planet\u2019s\nsurface. This impact likely caused faults to ripple through the surrounding\nplain, which were then filled with rising lava and have since worn away over\ntime.\n\nTowards the middle section of the image the landscape changes somewhat, with\nlarge roundish and oval swirls creating an effect reminiscent of marble. This\neffect is thought to occur when layered deposits are worn away over time.\n\nTo the right-centre of the frame lie a few prominent steep-flanked, flat-\ntopped mounds and hills that rise up for more than 1500 m above the\nsurrounding terrain. These form as softer material is eroded over time by\nflows of wind, water or ice, leaving behind the harder material that forms\nthese hills.\n\nThe ground towards the right (north) becomes increasingly covered in smooth,\nlight-coloured dust. Some signs of spiders can be seen scattered across the\nplateaus here, lurking amongst various canyons and troughs.\n\nTopography of Angustus Labyrinthus\n\n### Exploring Mars\n\nMars Express has revealed a great deal about Mars in the last two decades and\ncounting. The orbiter continues to image Mars\u2019s surface, map its minerals,\nexplore the composition and circulation of its atmosphere, probe beneath its\ncrust, and study the martian environment.\n\nThe spacecraft\u2019s HRSC has shown us everything from wind-sculpted ridges and\ngrooves to sinkholes on the flanks of colossal volcanoes to impact craters,\ntectonic faults, river channels and ancient lava pools. The mission has been\nimmensely productive over its lifetime, creating a far fuller and more\naccurate understanding of our planetary neighbour than ever before.\n\nMars\u2019s Inca City and south polar region in 3D\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!\n\nEuropean Space Agency\n\nFAQ Contacts Terms and conditions Privacy notice Careers at ESA Subscribe\n\n", "frontpage": false}
