The third is the Ethereum token\nis both utility & \u201cequity.\u201d Last, Ethereum trades at 100x revenue compared to\n7-17x for Salesforce & Snowflake.\n\nBut Ethereum demonstrates the compelling value that web3 blockchains can\ncreate.\n\n#### Read More:\n\n# The Market Size Mistake\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 - 2024 Tomasz Tunguz.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
