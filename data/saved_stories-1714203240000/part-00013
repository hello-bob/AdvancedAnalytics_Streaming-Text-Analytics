With my family history of diabetes, and occasional powerful\ncravings for chocolate, I knew this was coming and what it would mean: To\nsatisfy my sweet fix, I\u2019d have to turn to sugar substitutes. Ughhhh.\n\nDupes such as aspartame, stevia, and sucralose (the main ingredient in\nSplenda) are sweet and have few or zero calories, so they typically don\u2019t\nspike your blood sugar like the real thing. But while there are now more sugar\nalternatives than ever, many people find that they taste terrible. The\naspartame in Diet Coke leaves the taste of pennies in my mouth. And in large\namounts, substitutes are bad for you: Last year, the World Health Organization\nwarned that artificial sweeteners could raise the risk of certain diseases,\nsingling out aspartame as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic.\u201d\n\nBut last week, I sipped a can of Arnold Palmer with a brand-new sweetener that\npromised to be unlike all the rest. The drink\u2019s strong lemon flavor was\nmellowed by a light, unremarkable sweetness that came from brazzein, a sugar\nsubstitute green-lighted by the FDA last month. Oobli, a California-based\ncompany that sells the lemonade-iced tea and manufactures brazzein (which\noccurs naturally in West Africa\u2019s oubli fruit), has billed it as a \u201crevolution\nin sweetness.\u201d Yet like everything that came before it, brazzein is far from\nperfect: To help mask its off taste, the can had some real sugar in it too.\nFor now, Eric Walters, a sweetener expert at Rosalind Franklin University,\ntold me, brazzein is just \u201can alternative\u201d to the many options that already\nexist. None has come even close to the real deal.\n\nThe ideal sugar alternative is more than just sweet. It must also be safe,\ntaste good, and replicate the distinct way sugar\u2019s sweetness develops on the\ntongue. In addition to aspartame and other synthetic sugar alternatives that\nhave existed for more than a century, the past two decades have brought\n\u201cnatural\u201d ones that are plant-derived: sweeteners made with stevia or monk\nfruit, which the FDA first approved in 2008 and 2010, respectively, can now be\nreadily found in beverages such as Truly hard seltzer and Fairlife protein\nshakes. Stevia and monk fruit have been used \u201cfor hundreds of years by the\npeople who live in the regions where they grow, so I don\u2019t have huge worries\nabout their safety,\u201d Walters told me.\n\nAll of these sweeteners work in basically the same way. Chemically, molecules\nother than just sugar can bind to the tongue\u2019s sweet receptors, signaling to\nthe brain that something sweet has landed. But the brain can tell when that\nsomething is not sugar. So far, no sweetener has accomplished that trick; off\nflavors that sometimes linger always give away the ruse.\n\nThe problem is that sugar alternatives are like celebrity impersonators:\naesthetically similar, reasonably satisfying, but consistently disappointing.\nTake stevia and monk fruit: By weight, they\u2019re intensely sweet relative to\ntable sugar\u2014monk fruit by a factor of up to 250 and stevia by a factor of up\nto 400. Because only a tiny amount is needed to impart a sweet taste, those\nsweeteners must be bulked up with another substance so they more closely\nresemble sugar granules. Manufacturers used to add carbohydrates such as corn\nstarch\u2014which are eventually broken down into sugars\u2014but they now use\nerythritol, a calorie-free sugar alcohol, which \u201cdoesn\u2019t count as sugar at\nall,\u201d Walters said.\n\nThe end products look and feel similar to sugar, but not without downsides.\nErythritol has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\nAnd stevia and monk-fruit sweeteners come with an aftertaste that has been\ndescribed as \u201cbitter,\u201d \u201cunpleasant,\u201d and \u201cdisastrous.\u201d When Walters first\nhelped produce stevia 35 years ago, \u201cthe taste quality was so awful that we\nthought no one would buy it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we underestimated how much people\nwould put up with it because it was \u2018natural.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrazzein is yet another natural option. Unlike other sugar substitutes,\nbrazzein is a protein, but it is still intensely sweet and low in calories. It\nis so sweet\u2014about 1,000 times sweeter than sugar\u2014that some gorillas in the\nwild have learned not to waste their time eating it. That protein has become a\nhealth buzzword certainly won\u2019t hurt Oubli\u2019s sales, but its products won\u2019t\nbolster any biceps: Its teas contain very little\u2014about 1 percent\u2014because\nbrazzein\u2019s sweetness is so potent.\n\nLast month, Oobli received a \u201cno questions asked\u201d letter from the FDA, which\nmeans that the agency isn\u2019t concerned about the product\u2019s safety. Oobli\u2019s iced\nteas and chocolates are the first brazzein-sweetened products to be sold in\nthe U.S., although the sweet protein was identified three decades ago.\nThaumatin, another member of the sweet-protein family, has been in use since\nthe 1970s, though mostly as a flavor enhancer. One reason it took brazzein so\nlong to be marketable is that it occurs at such low levels in the oubli fruit\nthat mass-producing it was inefficient. Instead of harvesting brazzein from\nfruit, Oubli grows the protein in yeast cells, which is more scalable and\naffordable, Jason Ryder, Oobli\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, told\nme.\n\nOne distinction between brazzein and other sweeteners is its chemical size.\nCompared with sugar, stevia, and monk fruit, brazzein molecules are relatively\nlarge because they are proteins, which means they aren\u2019t metabolized in the\nsame way, Ryder said. The effects of existing sweeteners on the body are still\nbeing investigated; although they are generally thought to not hike blood\nsugar or insulin, recent research suggests that they may in fact do so. That\nmay never be a concern with brazzein, Grant DuBois, a sweetener expert and the\nchief science officer at Almendra, a stevia manufacturer, told me.\n\nThe most compelling upside of brazzein may be that it tastes pretty good. My\npalate, which is extra sensitive to artificial sweeteners, wasn\u2019t offended by\nthe taste. Would drink again, I thought. But the glaring caveat with Oobli\u2019s\nteas is that they do contain some actual sugar\u2014just less than you\u2019d expect\nfrom a regular drink. The sugar helps mitigate a feature of brazzein\u2019s\nsweetness, Ryder said.\n\nOne of the enduring problems with brazzein and many other popular sugar\nalternatives is that their sweetness takes more time than usual to develop,\nthen lingers longer than expected. Indeed, although I liked the Arnold Palmer\nas it went down, I felt a peculiar sensation afterward: a trace of sweetness\nat the back of my throat that intensified, and felt oddly cool, as I exhaled.\nIt was not unpleasant, but it was also reminiscent of having accidentally\nswallowed minty gum. If Diet Coke were made with brazzein instead of\naspartame, Walters explained, you\u2019d taste caffeine\u2019s bitterness and the\ntartness of phosphoric acid before any sweetness, and when all of those\nflavors dissipated, the sweetness would hang around. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what you\nwant your beverage to be,\u201d he said.\n\nBalancing brazzein with a touch of sugar achieves the goal of reducing sugar\nintake. But most of the time, people who seek out products sweetened with\nsugar alternatives want \u201czero sugar,\u201d DuBois said, \u201cso that\u2019s not really a\ngreat solution to the problem.\u201d The perfect sweetener would wholly replace all\nof the sugar in a food, but brazzein probably won\u2019t get there unless the\npeculiarities of its sweetness can be fully addressed. \u201cIf I knew how, I could\nprobably make millions of dollars,\u201d Walters said.\n\nThe future of sugar substitutes may soon offer improvements rather than\nalternatives. Last year, DuBois and his colleagues at Almendra published a\npeer-reviewed paper describing a method to speed up slow-moving sweetness by\nadding a pinch of mineral salts to sweeteners, which helps them quickly travel\nthrough the thick mucus of the tongue, resulting in a vastly improved\nexperience of sweetness. \u201cIt works with stevia, but also aspartame, sucralose,\nmonk fruit\u2014it works very well with everything we\u2019ve tried,\u201d Dubois said,\nnoting that it would probably also work with brazzein. With the right\ntechnology, sweeteners, he said, can become \u201cremarkably sugarlike.\u201d\n\nYet searching for the perfect sugar alternative is a fool\u2019s errand. No matter\nhow good they get, a single substance is unlikely to satisfy all tastes and\nexpectations about health. As my colleague Amanda Mull wrote when aspartame\nwas deemed carcinogenic over the summer, there\u2019s always something. Much is\nleft to be learned about the health effects of natural sweeteners, which may\nnot be as natural as they seem; some stevia products, for example, are\nchemically modified to taste better, Walters told me\n\nMore than anything, sweeteners exist so that people can indulge in sweet\ntreats without needing to worry about the consequences. They can address most\nof sugar\u2019s problems\u2014but they can\u2019t do everything. \u201cIf you pick one sweetener\nand put it in everything, and drink and eat it all day long, that\u2019s probably\nnot a good thing for you,\u201d Walters said. A sugar-free, flawlessly sweet\nchocolate may someday come to exist, but I\u2019ll probably never be able to gorge\non it without dreading my next blood test.\n\nYasmin Tayag is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
