I\nunderstand why.\n\nEvery design comes with assumptions about how much content will be seen by\npeople because the space in which people access our designs is the one thing\nwe cannot control. Even with responsive design and scaling techniques, we\ndon\u2019t really know how much of what we make will appear on the screens of\neveryone who will look at it.\n\nHowever, we do know that people will scroll.\n\n## Evidence that People Won\u2019t Scroll...Doesn\u2019t Exist\n\nOver twenty-five years ago, Jakob Nielsen pointed out that web users were\nalready becoming accustomed to scrolling, and his studies were showing a\nmeaningful shift in that behavior that should reduce the concern that\ninformation \u201cbelow the fold\u201d would not be seen.\n\nTake note, however, that in an update to that article made in 2010 and then in\n2018, his firm\u2019s eye tracking studies were showing that attention to\ninformation below the fold was much less focused. Specifically, information\nabove the fold received 57% of a user\u2019s viewing time and everything else \u2014\nevery \u201cscreenful of content\u201d below the fold \u2014 received 17% or less. That is a\nsignificant drop. The study took into account that a web page\u2019s vertical size\nis experienced differently across devices, and so they also measured pages in\n20% segments. Again, the majority of viewing time was spent within the top 20%\nof the page.\n\nBut let\u2019s be careful with our conclusions here. Nielsen\u2019s studies do not show\nthat users don\u2019t scroll. What they show is that a user\u2019s attention, as\ninferred by time spent looking at the screen, erodes quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, in a piece written for TIME, Tony Haile from Chartbeat wrote that\n66% of attention happens below the fold. Now that is interesting. What\u2019s going\non here?\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here has little to do with scrolling and everything to do with\nattention.\n\n## Good Interaction Design is Entirely About Managing Attention\n\nWhat people do with their hands is less important than what they do with their\nminds.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding how people engage with your designs on screens,\nyou should be asking about attention, not scrolling. (Clicking is another\nmatter \u2014 and not what this article is about \u2014 but I\u2019ll tell you what: Google\n\u201cheat mapping\u201d and \u201crage clicks\u201d and tell me that any of that information\nhelps you understand people better or design more useful interfaces. It\nwon\u2019t.)\n\nScrolling is an inattentive act. Scanning is partial attention. Reading is\nfocused attention.\n\nThe question is not \u201cwill they scroll?\u201d It\u2019s will they scroll slowly enough to\nprocess the information they see. They will do this if your design uses\ninformation architecture and visual language in a way that persuades them \u2014 on\na nearly subconscious level \u2014 to give more of their attention to it.\n\nRemember, within the first second or two of viewing your screen, people are\nasking and answering three critical questions:\n\n  1. What is this information?\n  2. Is it relevant to me?\n  3. What should I do next?\n\nAnswers to those questions are reached almost entirely making subconscious\njudgements about visual information through scanning \u2014 assessing how a\nscreen\u2019s content is arranged and processing bits and pieces of it. Keep in\nmind that this is all happening while the elements you designed to sit still\nare in motion. Viewers are almost always scanning and processing while\nscrolling.\n\nWhen a person is able to identify the nature of the information on a screen\nand assess its relevance they are then able to decide whether to actually\nstart reading.\n\n## Information Architecture Matters\n\nWhere information is placed on a screen is probably the most important design\ndecision you can make. Sizing it is a close second.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the Chartbeat study that showed that 66% of attention happens\nbelow the fold. Coupled with Nielsen\u2019s ongoing studies that conclude the\nerosion of attention below the fold, it appears \u2014 initially \u2014 that we have\nconflicting information. But remember, Nielsen\u2019s studies measured the decline\nof time spent looking as a person scrolled further down a page. They did not\nmention \u2014 and probably didn\u2019t measure \u2014 the speed of that scrolling, whether\nthere were pauses, or how long those pauses were. I\u2019d wager that the majority\nof an initial scroll through a page was largely unbroken. Again, that puts the\nmajority of a page\u2019s content in continual motion.\n\nThe Chartbeat study, on the other hand, measured the amount of aggregate\nattention paid to a web page\u2019s content, and that the majority of it \u2014 however\nlong a tail of scrolling attention segments it is \u2014 is spent below the fold.\nThis makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nIn my observation, scrolling starts immediately \u2014 even before all the screen\u2019s\nelements can fully load. People are accustomed to the cloying, top-crowding\ndesign choices made to capture attention above the fold, and the resulting\ndisarray that comes from it. Per Chartbeat\u2019s conclusion, they often scroll\nright past the first \u201cscreenful\u201d and settle below, where there is more space,\nless information, and more clarity.\n\nThis is why I so frequently compare good information architecture to the\nsimplicity of a text outline. A productive scan of information will lead to\nconclusions about what the information is and what is important based upon how\nit is arranged.\n\nSo, a few simple tips:\n\n  * First, remember that scanning is a reaction; reading is a choice. The majority of people who look at your screens will never read their contents.\n  * Anchor your most important information in a consistent place. For example, since most text is left-aligned, consider maintaining a left-alignment of text (with imagery floating right) so that a user can more quickly process that information by maintaining their scan on a single axis.\n  * Repetition is information. Repetition of smaller structures and arrangements helps a scanner understand the larger structure of your screen\u2019s contents. Being able to immediately identify a list, for example, helps a scanner understand how some content supports other content as well as recognize potential choices and actions available to them.\n  * Empty space is not neutral. Intentional use of space enables scanners to quickly identify clusters of related information, as well as gives a scanner the ability to process the information they see. The less empty space a screen has, the greater its information density. The greater a screen\u2019s information density, the less porous it is to attention and understanding.\n\nEach of these tips has two important things in common.\n\nThe first is that they all relate to structure. These ideas will help the\nchoices you make for where to put information lead to a greater ease in\nengaging with it. The second thing they have in common is that, when they work\ntogether, they create the rhythm of your screen.\n\n## Length is not the problem; lack of rhythm is.\n\nYour screen can be as \u201clong\u201d as it needs to be. Length is not the problem;\nlack of rhythm is. When you establish a structure, you can imbue that\nstructure with rhythm. The rhythm of a structure is defined by the repetition\nof arrangements and the spaces between them.\n\nA screen without intentional rhythm will lose attention as it is being\nscanned. One with controlled rhythm will not only retain attention, it will\ndeepen it.\n\n###### Written by Christopher Butler on May 20, 2023, In Essays\n\n###### Next Entry\n\nAttention Degrowth Sometimes I think that may be the most important insight\nbeneath any design decision.
