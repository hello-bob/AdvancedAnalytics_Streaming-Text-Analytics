That is not exactly how Apple behaved with\nthe EU was it. Just goes to show how important China is to Apple because when\nChina say's 'jump' Apple replies with 'how High'. When the EU tells Apple to\n'jump', Apple replies with 'F off, we'll see you in court'.\n\nScore: 27 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\npugxiwawa\n\n5 hours ago at 10:24 am\n\nTime to make the decision, keeps kissing up to CCP or do the right thing?\n\nScore: 17 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nmarkfc\n\n5 hours ago at 10:21 am\n\nDon\u2019t worry.
