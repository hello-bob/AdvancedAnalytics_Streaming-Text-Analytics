Let\u2019s work through what that means.\n\nFOTO SALE/Shutterstock\n\nA few weeks ago, Redis changed its license from the Open Source Initiative\n(OSI)-approved BSD 3-Clause license to the Redis Source Available License\n(RSALv2). This move echoed Elastic\u2019s earlier license change for Elasticsearch,\nwhich switched from the Apache License 2.0 to the Elastic License (ELv2).\nThen, just as OpenSearch was forked from open-source Elasticsearch, Valkey has\nbeen forked from open-source Redis.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last two years at AWS working as a developer advocate for open-\nsource OpenSearch and rebuilding the community trust shattered by Elastic\u2019s\n2021 license change for Elasticsearch. I spoke daily with the companies whose\nlivelihood had been put at risk because of the license change. Their fear for\nthe future sticks with me to this day.\n\nHow will the move from an open-source license to a source-available license\naffect the Redis open-source community? I\u2019ll try to answer that question here.\nI\u2019ll be taking the perspective from OpenSearch as it relates to Elasticsearch.\nas that\u2019s the perspective I\u2019m most qualified to write about. I\u2019ll leave it up\nto others to share their own perspectives as everyone has a different\nviewpoint.\n\n#### [ The best open source software of 2023 ]\n\n## Everyday users of open-source Redis\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the everyday users I\u2019m talking about here are the\nenterprises that use open-source Redis internally. Many of these companies\nright now are scrambling to have their legal teams review the new license.\nMore established companies have internal policies that allow them to deploy\nsoftware with the well-understood OSI licenses. New licenses mean they will\nneed to re-evaluate whether or not they can continue using Redis.\n\nIf your company doesn\u2019t have a lawyer with the time or confidence to evaluate\nthe RASLv2 license and determine how the terms apply within your company, you\nmay need to re-architect your entire application stack. These are the\ndevelopers described by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols in his article, \u201cSoftware\nvendors dump open source, go for the cash grab.\u201d\n\nAs developer advocate for OpenSearch at AWS, I heard a similar story from\nseveral users about why they switched to OpenSearch. Their company\u2019s legal\nteam just did not have the experience needed to evaluate the ELv2 license, or\nthey were unwilling to take the risk by allowing a new license with no prior\ncourt cases to show whether their use was deemed acceptable. Despite the\nclaims made by my fellow InfoWorld contributor Matt Asay, that cloud providers\nwould be the only ones effected, many other companies also will be hurt by the\nchange.\n\n## Specialized users of open source\n\nOne of the hard-to-measure impacts of changing the Redis license will be the\nloss of specialization. In the case of Elasticsearch, the ecosystem supported\nentire companies that created specialized distributions to fill different\nniches that Elastic couldn\u2019t adequately serve on its own.\n\nBonsai is a perfect example of one of these specialized users. The developers\ngot their start as the first Elasticsearch-as-a-service provider in 2012. At\nBonsai they provide tools and customizations that allow search practitioners\nto focus on delivering great search experiences. In 2021 they became the first\ncompany to offer a managed OpenSearch service specializing in search\napplications.\n\nAnother excellent example of a specialized user is Logz.io, which offered a\nhosted version of Elasticsearch that focused on log collection and analytics.\nFounded in 2014, the company staked its entire future on open-source\nElasticsearch. Over the years Logz.io has contributed many bug fixes and\nimprovements that help users specializing in log collection and analytics.\n\nNo one company can adequately cover all of the different niches where the\nproduct may be used. This is where the open-source community becomes so vital.\nThe community offers different perspectives, bug fixes, issues, and even\nfeatures that one company alone could not provide. In this way, so many use\ncases can be covered by a single open-source project.\n\n## Reading between the lines\n\nThe narrative that cloud providers were \u201cstealing\u201d from Redis by not\ncontributing to Redis is plainly false. Of the top seven contributors to Redis\nover the last two years, only three of them are affiliated with Redis.\n\n  1. Oranagra \u2013 Redis\n  2. enjoy-binbin \u2013 Tencent Cloud\n  3. yossigo \u2013 Redis\n  4. Soloestoy \u2013 Alibaba Cloud\n  5. Madolson \u2013 AWS\n  6. Guyube7 \u2013 Redis\n  7. Hwware \u2013 Huawei\n\nThese seven contributors have contributed the majority of the code written to\nRedis over the last two years. I also want to stress the word affiliated here.\nThese individuals are hired by their employer because they were passionate\nabout Redis, not the other way around. I interviewed Madelyn, a Redis\nmaintainer employed by AWS, a few years ago about her experience as a\nmaintainer. You can view the interview here on YouTube.\n\nFor those who may be confused about why there are so few active contributors\nto Redis, I will share a surprising secret. Redis wasn\u2019t putting a majority of\nits engineering hours into the open-source Redis. Most of the company\u2019s\n700-plus employees work on its paid offerings such as Redis Enterprise or\nRedis Cloud, which operate in a manner very different from the open-source\nproduct.\n\nOpen-source Redis relies heavily on the client to find the appropriate server\nto read and update the keys and values, whereas the Redis Enterprise offering\noperates more like a proxy with a single entry point. The interesting thing is\nthat the cloud providers were not recreating the work done with Redis\nEnterprise. They were providing a convenient way to deploy open-source Redis.\n\n## So what\u2019s next?\n\nConsidering what\u2019s happened over the last few years, I hope we are witnessing\nthe end of single-vendor-backed open-source projects. Many of these companies\nsee open source as a vehicle to drive the adoption of their software and then\nswitch to a prohibitive license once the software starts to reach massive\nadoption through a cloud provider. This has happened more times in recent\nyears than I care to count.\n\nThere are only a few companies that can reliably provide open-source software\nwithout hurting their own bottom line. These are the software giants like AWS,\nGoogle, and Microsoft. They can comfortably contribute to open-source software\nand collaborate with companies who specialize in some of the more niche use\ncases. They may not have been able to cover these niches on their own, but\nwith the help of the community they can. And at the end of the day, even the\nsmaller companies who provide managed offerings need somewhere to host them,\nright?\n\nI see a bright future for Valkey, the open-source fork of Redis. It\u2019s starting\noff right in the Linux Foundation, where companies contribute freely without\nfear of a single company dictating the direction of a project. So far AWS,\nGoogle Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap have announced they will be helping\nto support Valkey.\n\nI am not saying these companies are benevolent. They are making a long-term\ninvestment in driving the adoption of cloud services. Despite this I have a\nlot of faith in the individuals I know who are leading the open-source\ninitiatives at these companies. People like Matthew Wilson (or msw as he is\ncommonly known) who are fighting to keep their employers doing the right thing\nfor open source.\n\nDavid Tippett is the former senior developer advocate for OpenSearch at AWS.\nNow he works as a freelance search data and infrastructure consultant at\nTippyBits.\n\n\u2014\n\nNew Tech Forum provides a venue for technology leaders\u2014including vendors and\nother outside contributors\u2014to explore and discuss emerging enterprise\ntechnology in unprecedented depth and breadth.
