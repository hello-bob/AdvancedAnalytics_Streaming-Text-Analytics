Cavanaugh May 06, 2024\n\nThe Eucharist is many things, not least of which is a profound reflection on\nand practice of the relationship of humans and God to the material world.\nCatholics in recent decades have not been particularly good at spelling out\nthose connections. There tends to be a divide in parishes between the devotees\nof Eucharistic adoration on the one hand, and the social justice committee on\nthe other.\n\nFor a certain kind of Catholic, the point of the Eucharist is transcendence of\nthe material world, an evacuation of the substance, the breadness of bread and\nthe wineness of wine, and its replacement with Christ. The Eucharist is a\nmiraculous portal for the individual soul to achieve spiritual oneness with\nGod despite the person\u2019s material circumstances. For another kind of Catholic,\nthis sounds like escapism; Eucharistic piety, if it is to be relevant, must be\ntranslated into a symbol for more pressing ethical concerns. The first type of\nCatholic suspects the second of secularizing the Eucharist, reducing it to\nmere worldly concerns. The second type of Catholic suspects the first of\ncollusion with injustice, fiddling while the world burns.\n\nWhat I hope to do in what follows is to present a view of the Eucharist that\nis simultaneously transcendent and deeply implicated in the material world,\nthat both worships the real presence of Christ in the elements and is directly\nrelevant to the day-to-day realities of our economic system. I will do so by\naddressing the fetishism of commodities, that is, the investing of material\nthings with transcendent powers.\n\nCommodity fetishism is a critique of the deification of material things in our\ncurrent economic system; it is famously associated with Karl Marx, but I will\nargue that it is a theme also found, at least implicitly, in Catholic Social\nTeaching. But the investment of divinity in the material is also precisely\nwhat is at stake in the Eucharist. So I want to explore the possibility that\nthe Eucharist provides a better practice of God in things that can help heal\nthe distortions produced by commodity fetishism.\n\nI will begin by exploring the theme of commodity fetishism, both in Marx and\nin Catholic Social Teaching. I will then turn to sacramental theology and\nsuggest that a worthy practice of the Eucharist can help restore the fractured\nrelationships between and among people, the material world, and God.\n\n## I. The Fetishism of Commodities\n\nWe misunderstand Marx\u2019s famous idea of commodity fetishism if we think of it\nas a manifestation of materialism, a consumer society\u2019s obsession with things\nand the favoring of the material over the spiritual. According to Marx,\ncommodity fetishism is the opposite of materialism. In a capitalist economy,\nhe writes, things have double lives; a table can be used to write on or it can\nbe exchanged in a market for money. As a commodity in the market, what matters\nis not what it can be used for, but its exchange value, how much money it can\nfetch. Its materiality is transcended: \u201cas soon as it emerges as a commodity,\nit changes into a thing which transcends sensuousness.\u201d[1]\n\nTo grasp what Marx is saying here, think about when farmers dump milk or the\ngovernment stores cheese in warehouses in order to support the price of dairy.\nWhat matters is not the material nourishment that these products could give to\nhungry people; what matters is their exchange value. A commodity, then, is\ndematerialized by the market; it is \u201ca very strange thing, abounding in\nmetaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.\u201d[2]\n\nBesides a product\u2019s use value, the other thing hidden by the market is the\nlabor that went into its production. The social relationships among human\nbeings that go into the production of things\u2014who is laboring for whom, under\nwhat conditions, and for what pay\u2014are all hidden. All we see are the products\nthat enter into relationships of exchange with one another and with consumers.\n\n> It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which\n> assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In\n> order, therefore, to find an analogy we must take flight into the misty\n> realm of religion. There the products of the human brain appear as\n> autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into\n> relations both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the\n> world of commodities with the products of men\u2019s hands. I call this the\n> fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labor as soon as they are\n> produced as commodities.[3]\n\nBy \u201cfetishism\u201d Marx does not simply mean the way people obsess about material\nthings. He is using a term first pejoratively applied by Portuguese colonizers\nto describe the way small wooden figures or amulets were invested with divine\npowers by certain African peoples, as if the rosaries and scapulars carried by\nthe Portuguese had nothing in common with such items. Marx uses the term to\ndescribe the way that capitalism invests powers in material items that appear\nto give them an agency beyond human control. The actual humans that make the\nitems, at the same time, are subjected to market forces. \u201cCommodities, in\nshort, appear as the purchasers of persons. It is not the worker who buys the\nmeans of production and subsistence, but the means of production that buy the\nworker to incorporate him into the means of production.\u201d[4] Marx calls this\n\u201cthe conversion of things into persons and the conversion of persons into\nthings.\u201d[5] It is what Alexandra Dobra calls the symmetrical deification of\ncommodities and reification of human beings.[6] This exchange is central to\nMarx\u2019s analysis of alienation.\n\nMarx wrote before the full emergence of a consumer society, and well before\nthe appearance of online shopping, but what he is writing about here can be\nillustrated by the dominance of Amazon. When one shops on Amazon, all one sees\nare pictures of products, with prices and reviews. Entirely absent are the\nhuman beings that make the products and any information about where they work,\nhow the materials that went into the product are sourced, how much workers are\npaid, how they are treated, the environmental consequences of the process of\nproduction and distribution, and so on. Human beings have been eliminated from\nour view. All we see are products. With one click, they can be summoned to\nappear on our doorstep\u2014abracadabra!\u2014without having any contact, even\nvirtually, with another human person. The Amazon packages mysteriously arrive\nat our doorsteps wearing a smile; on the Amazon commercials, they sing and\ndance. Things, as Marx says, have been converted into persons.\n\nThis process takes flight in the late nineteenth century. Until the Industrial\nRevolution, people made most of the things they owned or knew the person who\nmade them. Even after the shift to a cash economy, stores sold generic goods,\noats from a barrel, chairs and shirts without names. Only in the 1880s did\nbranded and packaged items start to replace locally produced bulk items. The\nQuaker Oats man appears in 1888, and from then on products take on personality\nand life: Tony the Tiger, Kylie Jenner, the iconic Oscar Mayer ad (\u201cMy baloney\nhas a first name\u201d). There is an extensive scholarly literature exploring brand\npersonality, animism, anthropomorphism, and fetishism in consumer products.\nBut why is this the case? Why does my baloney have a first name?\nAnthropologists and economic historians think that once products were\ndisembedded from social relationships\u2014once we no longer knew the producer or\nthe shopkeeper\u2014advertising encouraged us to develop relationships with\nbrands.[7] The human need for relationships would be transferred to things in\norder to better sell products. We are meant to relate to the commodities; this\nhas the added advantage of dampening our curiosity about the people who make\nand deliver commodities to us.\n\nIf we peek behind the curtain of the consumer economy, however, we will see\nthat the people are still there, despite all the efforts to make them\ndisappear. Globalization has moved much manufacturing overseas, far from our\nview. Transnational corporations seek places where they can pay the least and\nbe free from labor and environmental regulations. As of 2021, the minimum wage\nfor garment workers in Sri Lanka was $54 per month, about an eighth of the\nestimated living wage in that country. Outsourcing means that even the\ncorporations that brand and sell the products often do not have direct\noversight or knowledge of the manufacturing process. This is a feature and not\na bug in the system; many corporations have deliberately distanced themselves\nfrom responsibility for working conditions and environmental impacts. Rivers\nin Bangladesh and China have turned black, red, and blue from the garment\nindustry\u2019s waste, one environmental cost of our colorful wardrobes.[8] The\nenvironmental cost of growing and harvesting and mining the materials used in\nmanufacturing are often even worse, but they too remain largely invisible to\nthe consumer in the global North.\n\nWe need not go that far from home to understand the hidden nature of labor in\nour consumer economy. Here, even the minimal human contact involved in buying\nitems at a store has been greatly diminished by the surge in online shopping.\nThousands of stores and other small businesses have gone out of business or\nbeen forced to sell through Amazon Marketplace, thus surrendering a\nsignificant portion of their profits to a company that is not only a\ndisproportionately large actor in the market, but actually owns the market. In\nan Amazon warehouse, unlike in a store, there is no downtime, no waiting for\ncustomers to come, no chitchat with co-workers or customers.\n\nAmazon \u201cfulfillment center\u201d workers are monitored by handheld scanners:\nnineteen seconds to pick the next item four aisles over. Bathroom breaks and\nother drags on productivity are monitored and punished. Injury rates and\nturnover at Amazon warehouses are twice the industry average. A third of\nAmazon workers qualify for SNAP food assistance. In 2020\u2014a year when Jeff\nBezos\u2019 net worth increased by $67 billion dollars, or $183 million dollars per\nday\u2014Amazon reported its workers\u2019 median annual salary was $28,848, meaning\nhalf its workers earned less. According to an extensive series of reports in\nthe New York Times in 2021, human resources at Amazon are highly automated,\nwith humans absent from most decisions to hire, manage, discipline, and fire\nworkers.[9] People are both supervised by and treated like robots. According\nto James Bloodworth, who worked at an Amazon fulfillment center, \u201cIt was all\nobsessed with productivity. People were told off for taking five minutes to go\nto the bathroom. They started treating human beings as robots, essentially. If\nit proves cheaper to replace humans with machines, I assume they will do\nthat.\u201d[10]\n\nAll of this, I hope, will put flesh on the twin notion of the conversion of\nthings into people and people into things. This is not only Marx\u2019s concern but\nI think also captures a central dynamic in Catholic Social Teaching. Marx\nhimself uses biblical language, identifying capital both with the Beast of the\nbook of Revelation, and with Moloch, the Canaanite god associated in both the\nOld and New Testaments with child sacrifice. The idea in Marx that inanimate\nobjects come alive by taking life from us is found first in the Bible\u2019s\ncritique of idolatry. In Isaiah 6, those who craft idols out of wood and stone\nbecome as deaf and dumb and mute as their creations, though they imagine that\ntheir creations take on life.\n\nIn Isaiah 44, a man uses half a block of wood to cook his dinner and the other\nhalf to make an idol, to which he bows down and pleads, \u201cSave me, for you are\nmy god!\u201d Though he imagines that the idol lives, in fact it drains life from\nhim. The narrator comments, \u201cAll who make idols are nothing, and the things\nthey delight in do not profit.\u201d Likewise, Psalm 135 says \u201cThe idols of the\nnations are silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths, but\nthey do not speak, they have eyes, but they do not see. . . . Those who make\nthem and all who trust them shall become like them.\u201d The attribution of life\nto inanimate objects steals life from the humans who make them or trust in\nthem.\n\nPope Benedict XVI refers to this exchange in his commentary on Psalm 135,\nadding, \u201cThis description of idolatry as false religion clearly conveys man's\neternal temptation to seek salvation in the \u2018work of his hands,\u2019 placing hope\nin riches, power, in success and material things.\u201d[11] In Centesimus Annus,\nPope John Paul II warns of the \u201c\u2018idolatry\u2019 of the market, an idolatry which\nignores the existence of goods which by their nature are not and cannot be\nmere commodities.\u201d[12] No pope has been more insistent than Pope Francis on\ncritiquing the investment of divinity into material things. His first\nencyclical Lumen Fidei makes clear that abandoning belief in God does not mean\nabandoning belief, but rather the proliferation of gods, \u201can aimless passing\nfrom one lord to another . . . Those who choose not to put their trust in God\nmust hear the din of countless idols crying out: \u2018Put your trust in me!\u2019\u201d[13]\nFrancis frequently uses language of idolatry when he talks about the current\neconomic system, decrying the \u201cidols of profit and consumption\u201d[14] and \u201cthe\nroad of covetousness, which ends in idolatry.\u201d[15] We are subject to an \u201cidol\ncalled money,\u201d or to \u201cthis god-money.\u201d[16] Our economic system, in Francis\u2019s\nthought, is not secular; in Evangelii Gaudium, Francis refers to a \u201cdeified\nmarket\u201d[17] and \u201cthe sacralized workings of the prevailing economic\nsystem.\u201d[18]\n\n> We have created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf (cf. Ex\n> 32:1\u201335) has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money\n> and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose.\n> The worldwide crisis affecting finance and the economy lays bare their\n> imbalances and, above all, their lack of real concern for human beings; man\n> is reduced to one of his needs alone: consumption.[19]\n\nThe animation of material things and their elevation to the status of\ndivinities is accompanied necessarily by the degradation of the human person\nto the status of a thing. The death of human beings is what gives life to\nthese new gods. Francis denounces the \u201ceconomic model which is idolatrous,\nwhich needs to sacrifice human lives on the altar of money and profit.\u201d[20]\n\nThis language of idolatry and deification of material things is powerful for\nseveral interrelated reasons. First, it makes clear that the problem is not\nmaterialism as such, not the rejection of the spiritual for the material. A\nconsumer culture instead transfers a kind of spirituality to the material;\nthere is a migration of the holy in which people seek transcendence in\nmaterial things. Second, the language of deification is also useful because it\nmakes clear that the problem is not simply people having bad values or being\nselfish; the problem is rather more systemic. The entire system has been\narranged so that relations of production are hidden, and consumption is\ncentered. We spend our days immersed in marketing, building relationships with\nbrands and products because labor has been disappeared (to use an expression\ncoined in Latin America to describe human rights abuses under military\nregimes). We are subjected to this system as to a god to whose will we must\nsubmit.\n\nIn a world in which there are huge and growing inequalities between the owners\nof capital and the rest of humanity, however, the sense in which people are\nsubject to this new god admits of wide variations. For consumers with money to\nspend, there is a sense of alienation. In Centesimus Annus, while rejecting\nMarxism, John Paul II acknowledged that Marx\u2019s theme of alienation is indeed a\nreality in Western countries. \u201cThis happens in consumerism, when people are\nensnared in a web of false and superficial gratifications rather than being\nhelped to experience their personhood in an authentic and concrete way.\u201d[21]\nPersonhood is a central theme for John Paul II; a person has dignity not\nbecause they have autonomy (as in Kant) nor because they have money (which is\nthe situation today de facto), but because they are capable of loving and\nbeing loved, by God and by other persons.\n\nBefore he became pope, Karol Wojtyla defined the norm of personalism in this\nway: \u201cthe person is a good towards which the only proper and adequate attitude\nis love.\u201d[22] A person who relates to things rather than to people has lost\nsome of their humanity. Pope Francis referred to this depersonalization in a\nspeech to economists and financiers, in which he compared being a cog in the\neconomic system to being passed through an \u201corganizational still\u201d such as that\nfor making grappa. Just as what results is no longer wine, the person \u201cpasses\nthrough this still and ends up . . . losing humanity and becoming an\ninstrument of the system, the social system, economic system, a system where\nimbalance reigns . . . And when humanity is not at the center, another thing\nis at the center and [the human person] is at the service of this other\nthing.\u201d[23]\n\nHowever, Pope Francis\u2019s main concern is not managers or consumers with money\nbut the people who are excluded from sharing in economic abundance. The\n\u201cthrowaway culture\u201d is a theme to which Francis often returns; it is a central\nmetaphor that refers to trashing the earth\u2019s resources but also and especially\nthe discarding of people. The metaphor captures the treatment of persons as\nthings, \u201cto treat others as mere objects.\u201d For Francis the throwaway of human\nbeings can refer to the exploitation of labor for profit, but also refers to\nthe premature death of millions of poor people,[24] to the status of\nmigrants,[25] to forced labor,[26] to racism,[27] to abortion,[28] and a host\nof other economic and social problems. In Evangelii Gaudium, Francis writes,\n\u201cHuman beings are themselves considered consumer goods to be used and then\ndiscarded. We have created a \u2018throw away\u2019 culture which is now spreading.\u201d[29]\nHe continues on to say, \u201cIt is no longer simply about exploitation and\noppression, but something new.\u201d\n\nFrancis has expanded the category beyond Marx; the excluded are not only the\nexploited, but the outcast. In other words, the only thing worse for many\npeople than having a job in a sweatshop is not having a job in a sweatshop.\nRobotics and artificial intelligence are making increasing numbers of people\nredundant.[30] When the ideal is more consumption and less work, the reality\nis a small inner circle of consumers and their commodities, and a vast expanse\nof discarded humanity whose labor is not even necessary anymore.\n\n## II. The Eucharist\n\nSo far we have examined the interrelated deification of things and reification\nof people in the contemporary economy. Now I want to suggest that the\nEucharist offers resources for countering both these dynamics. It should be\nsaid that Catholic Social Teaching has not been very good at making this\nconnection explicit. Outside of Solicitudo Rei Socialis[31] and Laudato Si\u2019,\nthere is not a single reference to the Eucharist in any encyclical customarily\nconsidered a social encyclical.\n\n### A. Healing the Deification of Things\n\nOne possible response to the deification of things would be to separate God\nfrom things, the spiritual from the material, and opt for the former. If this\nis the goal, the Eucharist is counter-productive, because it makes a radical\nidentification of materiality with God, the claim that this particular bread\nand wine actually become Christ, \u201cbody, blood, soul, and divinity.\u201d[32] If\nfetishization is the investment of divinity into material form, the Eucharist\nwould seem to qualify, which would explain the insistence in some Christian\ntraditions that the Eucharist is only a symbol. Charles Taylor and others have\ntraced the advent of secularization to certain attacks of the Reformers on the\nmaterialization of God as a kind of idolatry.[33] Catholics have insisted, on\nthe other hand, that the Eucharist is not the degradation of God but the\nelevation of the material from mere matter to a sacramental portal to the\ndivine. At the same time, a sacramental view prohibits treating things as\ndivine, because a true sacrament is not an end in itself, but points beyond\nitself to God.\n\nThe Eucharist is a participation in the Incarnation and is therefore certainly\nan elevation of matter. As John Paul II writes, \u201cThe Word who became flesh\nimbues matter with a saving potential which is fully manifest in the\nsacraments.\u201d[34] The elevation of matter is not for its own sake, however, but\nrather for the restoration of right relationships of people to God, to other\npeople, and to the created order. John Paul II continues, \u201cTo those who seek a\ntruly meaningful relationship with themselves and with the cosmos, so often\ndisfigured by selfishness and greed, the liturgy reveals the way to the\nharmony of the new [person], and invites [them] to respect the Eucharistic\npotential of the created world. That world is destined to be assumed in the\nEucharist of the Lord, in his Passover, present in the sacrifice of the\naltar.\u201d[35] This phrase \u201cthe Eucharistic potential of the created world\u201d\nindicates that not all material things are rightly ordered, but they have the\npotential of being brought into relationships that so order them.\n\nCommodity fetishism, as we have seen, extracts commodities from their context\nin God\u2019s created order and in the social relationships of production. The\nEucharist, in contrast, is meant to offer both \u201cthe fruit of the vine and the\nwork of human hands\u201d as a sacrifice of praise to God. So, as Joseph Ratzinger\nhas written, \u201cThe elements of the earth are transubstantiated, pulled, so to\nspeak from their creaturely anchorage, grasped at the deepest ground of their\nbeing, and changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord. The New Heaven and the\nNew Earth are anticipated.\u201d[36] But it is not only the elements of the earth,\nwhat we call \u201cnature,\u201d but human work and human society that is elevated in\nthe Eucharist. As Benedict XVI also writes,\n\n> To develop a profound eucharistic spirituality that is also capable of\n> significantly affecting the fabric of society, the Christian people, in\n> giving thanks to God through the Eucharist, should be conscious that they do\n> so in the name of all creation, aspiring to the sanctification of the world\n> and working intensely to that end. The Eucharist itself powerfully\n> illuminates human history and the whole cosmos. In this sacramental\n> perspective we learn, day by day, that every ecclesial event is a kind of\n> sign by which God makes himself known and challenges us. The eucharistic\n> form of life can thus help foster a real change in the way we approach\n> history and the world.[37]\n\nThe popes have been critical of both the idolatry of material things\u2014their\ninvestment with divinity\u2014and the reduction of matter to \u201csomething\nindifferent, raw material to be utilized simply as we see fit.\u201d[38] Pope\nFrancis\u2019 Laudato Si\u2019 seeks the antidote to both in a kind of prayerful\ncontemplation in which, as the title of the encyclical indicates, God is\npraised in and through God\u2019s creation. Material creation is neither an end in\nitself, nor dead matter to be used to feed the self\u2019s desires; we are rather\nto see the beauty of the divine pulsing in the creation God has made.\n\nAs Francis writes in Laudato Si\u2019, \u201cThe universe unfolds in God, who fills it\ncompletely. Hence, there is a mystical meaning to be found in a leaf, in a\nmountain trail, in a dewdrop, in a poor person\u2019s face. The ideal is not only\nto pass from the exterior to the interior to discover the action of God in the\nsoul, but also to discover God in all things.\u201d[39] Note the refusal here to\nseparate nature from humanity, the leaf from the poor person. Francis further\nemphasizes that \u201cit is in the Eucharist that all that has been created finds\nits greatest exaltation.\u201d[40] The Eucharist is an anticipation of the\nsanctification of all matter, a time when all of creation, both animate and\ninanimate things, are brought into harmony with one another and with God.\nFrancis continues, \u201cIn the Eucharist, fullness is already achieved; it is the\nliving center of the universe, the overflowing core of love and of\ninexhaustible life.\u201d[41]\n\nThe danger of this sacramental view of the world is that it can remain a mere\naesthetics\u2014look at all the pretty flowers!\u2014a luxury that many people do not\nenjoy and a distraction from the ugliness of poverty, exploitation, and\nexclusion. This is why Francis refuses to separate human ecology from natural\necology.[42] In Laudato Si\u2019, Francis uses the term \u201cintegral ecology\u201d to show\nthat care for the earth cannot be separated from care for the human person.\nThe throwaway culture that is trashing the earth is the same culture that is\ndiscarding human persons, and the only way to restore the earth is also to\nheal the distorted human desires that lead to exploitation and exclusion. We\nmust not pit a human-centered approach against an earth-centered approach; the\nonly healing approach is a God-centered approach, one in which humans,\nanimals, plants, and all material things find their meaning in the loving God\nwho creates and sustains them in harmony.\n\nFrancis connects the Eucharist to this integral ecology explicitly in his\ndiscussion of the Sabbath, \u201ca day which heals our relationships with God, with\nourselves, with others and with the world.\u201d[43] Sunday, the day of the\nResurrection and the first fruits of a new creation, is a day of rest and\ncelebration, one that steps back from the 24/7 cycle of work and consumption.\nHere we learn receptivity and gratuity. Sabbath is not just a waste of time or\ncessation of work, but that which gives work purpose. The Sabbath \u201cprotects\nhuman action from becoming empty activism; it also prevents that unfettered\ngreed and sense of isolation which make us seek personal gain to the detriment\nof all else.\u201d[44] Rest from work and consumption reinserts work and things\ninto the context of relationships among people, God, and creation. Those who\nare hidden by commodity fetishism come to light. \u201cRest opens our eyes to the\nlarger picture and gives us renewed sensitivity to the rights of others. And\nso the day of rest, centered on the Eucharist, sheds its light on the whole\nweek, and motivates us to greater concern for nature and the poor.\u201d[45]\n\n### B. Healing the Reification of Persons\n\nIf the Eucharist gives us resources for finding God in things while resisting\nmaking a god of things, it can also be a practice of resisting the conversion\nof persons into things. For Jesus, table fellowship was radically inclusive of\noutcasts, leading the Pharisees to complain that Jesus ate and drank with tax\ncollectors and sinners (Luke 5:30). In John\u2019s version of the Last Supper,\nJesus washes the disciples\u2019 feet and commands them to do the same to others, a\nsign of profound love, respect, and humble service toward persons in their\nindividuality.\n\nFor Paul, the Eucharist offers resources for resisting the reification of\npersons by incorporating them into the body of Christ. In I Corinthians 8-10,\nthe antidote to table fellowship with idols is table fellowship with one\nanother in the body of Christ. In the Eucharist, the body of Christ is both\nwhat we eat and who we become. The act of consumption is curiously inverted.\nAugustine puts God\u2019s word to us in this way: \u201cI am the food of the fully\ngrown; grow and you will feed on me. And you will not change me into you like\nthe food your flesh eats, but you will be changed into me.\u201d[46] The object of\nconsumption here is a not a narcissistic mirror of our own desires; rather\nthan isolating us into a relationship with things, we are pulled into a larger\nbody, one in which, as Paul says, \u201cThe eye cannot say to the hand, \u2018I have no\nneed of you,\u2019 nor again the head to the feet, \u2018I have no need of you.\u2019\u201d There\ncan be no throwaway people, because we are members of the same body. Indeed we\nare to consider the weakest members as indispensable, Paul says, and we are to\ngive the greatest honor to the most inferior members (1 Cor 12:21-24).\n\nFor Paul, living Eucharistically means sharing food with the hungry. In 1\nCorinthians 11 he chastises the community for coming together to eat the\nLord\u2019s supper, but neglecting to share their food. At the accompanying meal,\nsome go hungry. The Eucharist is meant to generate an economy of gift, where\nwe gratefully receive what we have from God and continue the circulation of\ngifts. Bringing up \u201cthe gifts\u201d at the offertory is not simply our gift to God\nbut our participation in the circulation of gifts that God inaugurates.\nIgnoring the hungry according to Paul is not just a lack of charity toward\nothers but a failure to \u201cdiscern the body\u201d (11:29), a failure to see that we\nall participate in the same circulation of gifts in the body. Indeed, we share\nthe same nervous system. Says Paul, \u201cIf one member suffers, all suffer\ntogether with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it\u201d (1\nCor 12:26). Acts 2 describes this unity in economic terms: the early\nChristians not only broke bread together but shared all their possessions in\ncommon, distributing goods to all in need.\n\nThose hidden by our system of production and consumption are not only to be\nincluded in this sacramental economy; they are themselves sacraments of God\u2019s\npresence. The fetishism of commodities is countered by the sacramentalization\nof the exploited and hidden people who produce commodities for our\nconsumption. The marginalized as sacrament of Christ is revealed in Jesus\u2019s\ntelling of the last judgment in Matthew 25:31\u201346. There the Son of Man\nidentifies himself not with those who do good but with the \u201cleast of these\nbrothers and sisters of mine,\u201d those who were hungry, thirsty, strangers,\nnaked, sick, or imprisoned. God comes to us in material form in people,\nespecially the most vulnerable, who are living icons of Jesus Christ.\n\nBoth those who did not care for them and those who did were unaware that they\nwere in fact the Lord. Jesus\u2019s story of the last judgment is a challenge to\nsee the people who have been marginalized and hidden. There is no indication\nthat either the least or those who cared for them are limited to members of\nthe church; \u201call the nations\u201d are summoned to judgment before the Son of Man\n(Matt. 25:32). There is, nevertheless, a strong congruence between the\nsacrament of the Eucharist and the story Jesus tells here; those who would be\nassimilated to Christ\u2019s body in the Eucharist must see the weakest as the most\nhonored members of Christ\u2019s body, and therefore as part of their very own\nbody.\n\nTo recognize the presence of Christ in persons, especially the most\nvulnerable, is not to lose sight of the presence of Christ in the Eucharistic\nelements. Christ becomes vulnerable in both the bodies of the poor and in the\nhumble form of bread and wine. In our polarized Church, Eucharistic adoration\nis often divorced from concern for the throwaway people. It need not be so.\nJoseph Ratzinger wrote a short piece on the reservation of the Blessed\nSacrament in which he acknowledges that the rise of Eucharistic adoration in\nthe Middle Ages was accompanied by a loss in awareness of the communion the\nEucharist is meant to effect among people. He writes, \u201cThe Eucharist is not\naimed primarily at the individual. Eucharistic personalism is a drive toward\nunion, the overcoming of the barriers between God and humanity, between \u2018I\u2019\nand \u2018thou\u2019 in the new \u2018we\u2019 of the communion of saints.\u201d[47]\n\nBut we should not contrast a supposedly \u201cthing-like\u201d presence of the reserved\nEucharist with the action of eating and communion. The Eucharist is not a\nthing but the personal presence of Christ, a \u201cperson-to-person exchange.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Eating\u2019 it means worshipping it. Eating it means letting it come into me, so\nthat my \u2018I\u2019 is transformed and opens up into the great \u2018we,\u2019 so that we become\n\u2018one\u2019 in him (cf. Gal 3:16).\u201d[48] There should be no contrast between\nadoration and communion. Ratzinger points out, as well, that the reserved\nsacrament brings Christ\u2019s presence equally to the humblest church and the\ngreatest cathedral. Ratzinger thus implicitly recognizes the way the Eucharist\nbridges the spatial divide between the poor and the rich that our economy\npolices. Christ is present in the garbage dump parish of Payatas in Manila\njust as he is present in St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica in Budapest.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEnvironmental destruction is often blamed on anthropocentrism, but in some\nways our economy is commodity-centered, not human-centered. Commodities are\npersonalized, while humans are depersonalized. The Eucharist is meant to be a\npractice of healing these broken relationships. The Eucharist is meant to de-\ncenter and un-deify commodities, restoring both material creation and human\npersons to sacraments of God\u2019s presence.\n\nThe Eucharist does not do so automatically, of course. Without our\ncooperation, it does not bear fruit. Christians remain some of the worst\nidolaters. And yet the reality celebrated in the Eucharist that a renewed\ncreation does not depend entirely on us, that God is at work in creation, can\nliberate us from despair. When we think that we are powerless, that \u201cthe\neconomy\u201d is an impersonal reality beyond anyone\u2019s control, we can take hope in\nthe myriad experiments in personalized economies all over the world; Pope\nFrancis extols those \u201ccooperatives of small producers [that] adopt less\npolluting means of production, and opt for a non-consumerist model of life,\nrecreation, and community.\u201d[49] The point of this type of economy is not a\nbackward-looking nostalgia, but rather a forward-looking convergence of humans\nand all creation in the love of God, which is what the Eucharist anticipates.\nAs Pope Francis writes, \u201call creatures are moving forward with us and through\nus towards a common point of arrival, which is God, in that transcendent\nfullness where the risen Christ embraces and illumines all things.\u201d[50]\n\nEDITORIAL NOTE: This essay was first delivered as the final lecture of the\n\"The Only Solution is Love: The Eucharist and Catholic Social Teaching\" series\nhosted by Michael Baxter for the McGrath Institute for Church Life.\n\n[1] Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 1, trans.

Now, a small human clinical trial has demonstrated an mRNA vaccine\nthat quickly rallies the immune system to fight off the tumors, with promising\nresults.\n\nGlioblastoma is the most common form of brain cancer, and unfortunately it\u2019s\nalso the most aggressive. Treatment involves a combination of surgical\nremoval, radiation and chemotherapy, however the disease almost always comes\nback. Patients usually live about a year after diagnosis, with only about 5%\nof patients surviving longer than five years.\n\nMore Stories\n\nEnergy\n\nSea-bed 'air batteries' offer cheaper long-term energy storage\n\nSpace\n\nDeep-space lasers smash data speed records over interplanetary distances\n\nA new study from the University of Florida could soon add a better option for\npatients \u2013 an mRNA cancer vaccine. This technology, best known for COVID-19\nvaccines, has been shown to quickly alert the immune system to attack\nglioblastoma more effectively, in mice, dogs and now humans.\n\nAs you might remember from the heady days of 2020 and 2021, mRNA molecules are\nessentially natural blueprints that tell cells which proteins to produce. By\nengineering them to produce harmless versions of proteins associated with\npathogens, the immune system can be trained to fight off the real thing if it\nappears. After the real-world success of these treatments during the pandemic,\nthe possibility of adapting mRNA therapies for cancer took off, with\nintriguing early results.\n\nThis new version has two key advancements, the team says. First, the vaccine\nis personalized by using samples taken from the patient\u2019s own tumor cells. The\nsecond is that the delivery mechanism is more complex, which ultimately\nproduces a stronger immune reaction.\n\n\"Instead of us injecting single particles, we\u2019re injecting clusters of\nparticles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of\nonions,\" said Elias Sayour, senior author of the study. \"In less than 48\nhours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer to as 'cold' \u2013\nimmune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune response \u2013 to 'hot,'\nvery active immune response. That was very surprising given how quick this\nhappened, and what that told us is we were able to activate the early part of\nthe immune system very rapidly against these cancers, and that\u2019s critical to\nunlock the later effects of the immune response.\"\n\nThis small, FDA-approved clinical trial was designed to test safety and\nfeasibility, and only included four patients with glioblastoma. RNA was\nextracted from each patient\u2019s tumor after it was surgically removed, then the\nmRNA was amplified and wrapped in the particle clusters. This was then\ninjected into the patients, where it triggered the immune response. The team\nsays that it\u2019s currently too early to fully assess the clinical effects, but\nthe patients did spend more time disease-free and survived longer than\nexpected.\n\nAn expanded Phase I trial will be conducted next, involving up to 24 patients\nto determine an optimal and safe dose. Further down the line, phase 2 would\ninvolve 25 children.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Cell. The team discusses the trial\nin the video below.\n\nmRNA vaccine triggers fierce immune response to fight malignant brain tumor\n\nSource: University of Florida\n\n## Tags\n\nMedicalCancerBrain cancerVaccinesRNAUniversity of Florida\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nMichael Irving\n\nMichael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the\nweirder mysteries of the universe.
