By reading this post, you agree and acknowledge\nthat this post does not advise you on how to properly license your work and\nyou would not rely on this post to license your work; that this post does not\nadvise licensees of open source work on how to comply with the licenses; and\nthat this post only provides technical guidance on programming tasks that are\ncommon to licensing open source projects.\n\nMost popular open source licenses require redistributors to retain the\ncopyright and permission notices, among other things. For example, even the\nbrief MIT License explicitly requires so:\n\n> ...The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n> in all copies or substantial portions of the Software...\n\nHowever, without any automation, this simple task is not so simple for a\nbrowser JavaScript project: Tens and even hundreds of open source dependencies\nare often bundled and minified into a single .js file. Then, this .js file is\ncommonly distributed to browsers via the Internet.\n\nAs maintainers of open source JavaScript projects, what can we do to make\nretaining copyright and permission notices easier for dependent browser\nJavaScript projects?\n\n## Use the @license Tag#\n\nThe answer is incredibly simple: Add the copyright and permission notices as\ncomments to the top of each JavaScript source file, and then annotate the\ncomment block with the @license tag, like this (assuming the MIT license):\n\n    \n    \n    /** * @license MIT * Copyright (c) 20xx My Name * * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy * of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal * in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights * to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell * copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is * furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: * * The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all * copies or substantial portions of the Software. * * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR * IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, * FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE * AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER * LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE * SOFTWARE. */\n\nThe optional identifier after @license is usually an SPDX identifier. More\nsophisticated licenses usually come with instructions on what to put at the\ntop of each file, such as\n\n  * the GNU (Lesser) General Public License,\n  * the Mozilla Public License, and\n  * the Apache License.\n\n## How Does It Work?#\n\nWhen a browser JavaScript project bundles the JavaScript source files from a\ndependent, it typically uses a minifier (directly or indirectly) to strip all\ncomments from these source files. Under default settings, comment blocks\nannotated with @license are typically preserved by mainstream minifiers,\nincluding Terser, UglifyJS, babel-minify as in babel, and the Google Closure\nCompiler. Using these minifiers, if the packager of the browser project\nbundles and minifies all dependent JavaScript source files properly, the\neventual .js file would contain the copyright and permission notices of\nJavaScript dependents.\n\nBonus: @license is also recognized by common documentation tools, such as\nJSDoc.\n\n  * JavaScript\n  * Open Source\n\nWould like to comment?
