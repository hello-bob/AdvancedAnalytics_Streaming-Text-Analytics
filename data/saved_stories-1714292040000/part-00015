(Kyodo)\n\nTOKYO (Kyodo) -- Nearly 30 percent of municipalities in Japan have no physical\nbookstores due to the impact of population shrinkage and the prevalence of\nonline stores, according to a survey by a publishing industry association.\n\nOf the country's 1,741 municipalities, 482 cities, towns and villages, or 27.7\npercent of the total, had no bookstores as of March, with the rate increasing\nfrom 26.2 percent in the previous survey in September 2022, according to data\nreleased by the Japan Publishing Industry Foundation for Culture.\n\nIn the prefectures of Okinawa, Nagano and Nara, more than half of their\ncities, towns and villages had no bookstores at all, with the rate standing at\n56.1 percent, 53.2 percent and 51.3 percent, respectively.\n\nRural areas suffering depopulation have been particularly hit by vanishing\nbookstores, while all 23 wards in central Tokyo still had bookstores.\n\nThe central government has been searching for effective measures to prevent\nphysical bookstores from disappearing. They are considered important for\nexpanding knowledge by offering opportunities to discover books outside one's\nusual interests, in contrast to the online trend of narrowly tailored searches\nfor specific interests.\n\nCurrently, there are 7,973 real bookstores, excluding secondhand bookstores\nand university cooperatives, across Japan, down 609 from the previous survey,\nwhich was the first of its kind.\n\nCombining the 343 municipalities with just one physical bookstore and those\nwith none, the overall percentage of cities, towns, and villages with limited\nor no access to physical bookstores stands at 47.4 percent.\n\nEstimated sales of physical books and magazines also dwindled 6 percent in\n2023 from the previous year to about 1.06 trillion yen ($6.7 billion), a\ndownward trend that has continued since peaking at 2.66 trillion yen in 1996,\naccording to the Research Institute for Publications.\n\n\"The environment (surrounding bookstores) becomes harsher as personnel costs\nrise while sales are down,\" said Shuichi Matsuki, an executive of the Japan\nPublishing Industry Foundation for Culture.\n\nMatsuki added that bookstores, in cooperation with publishers and writers,\nneed to make their stores more attractive to customers.\n\nIndustry minister Ken Saito, following discussing with bookstore managers this\nmonth, expressed his vision of \"aiming for a world where libraries, online\nsites and bookstores coexist.\"\n\nHis ministry launched a project team to promote the bookstore business in\nMarch.\n\n  * Font Size\n\n    * S\n    * M\n    * L\n  * Print\n  *     * Timeline\n    * 0\n\n  * Go to The Mainichi Home Page\n\n## Also in The Mainichi\n\nThe Mainichi on social media\n\n    \n\n  * RSS\n\n## Latest Articles\n\n  * Retro Japan in Photos: Former Oita Pref. hospital's gentle, quasi-Western style\n\n  * Japan Trivia: Gifu Prefecture city has 4 different names\n\n  * Meet your match?
