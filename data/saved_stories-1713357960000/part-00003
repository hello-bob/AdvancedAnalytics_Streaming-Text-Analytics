One of key drivers of perception is\npositioning.\n\n##\n\nWhat is Positioning ?\n\nPositioning is an art of describing your service and product such that its\nvalue is clear to the targeted customer. A good product will be positioned in\nsuch a manner that it addresses the hair on fire problem the targeted customer\nhas.\n\n##\n\nHow to decide on positioning?\n\nPositioning can be done in two ways:\n\n###\n\nCompetitor focused Positioning\n\nPositioning based on competitor companies. This type of positioning requires\nyou to identify the features and aspects that set you apart from the\ncompetition. As a founder, you should be able to differentiate between\npositioning for VCs and for users. When building a pitch deck for fundraising,\nyou might want to draw the standard SWOT analysis on the competition and show\nwhy you have a differentiated product based on your point of view on the\nindustry. But if you go down this route for your customers, as an early stage\nstartup, you will appear like a feature factory to the users. And what really\nharms a startup is the fact people have to overload their brains with\ninformation. It\u2019s necessary to keep in mind that humans don\u2019t want to waste\ntheir \u201cbrain cycles\u201d on tasks that are not core to their ability to live.\nAnything that demands \u201cbrain cycles\u201d will be strongly resented or totally\nignored.\n\n###\n\nEveryday Alternatives Positioning\n\nAs a founder, when you are solving a specific problem that is faced by a\npotential customer. You need to worry about what alternatives they are using.\nThey could be using an intern to do it, an excel sheet or word document to\nsolve that problem sub-optimally. These are the everyday alternatives that\nyour product is really competing against according to the customer. If your\ncustomer isn\u2019t aware of your competitor company X, it makes no sense for you\nto position yourself with respect to them. Giving customers the insight as to\nwhy you think this problem is important and how it can be solved as compared\nto everyday alternatives, in the simplest of language, will make the customer\nnotice and think about your product.\n\nThanks for reading Build Startup In Public !

But no one seemed to tell us how it is different. Above I\nhave detailed my perspective on how it\u2019s different essentially when it comes\nto positioning.\n\nAnother mistake we and many founders make is that we speak about how the\nfuture of the product will evolve to customers. But only later did we realize\nthat customers are only interested in the here and now. Speaking about the\nfuture confuses them and makes them think - \u201cDo I need the X feature that they\nspeak about now? Why should I pay when it\u2019s not available now? \u201c. Consumers in\nour observation, sometimes even people closely following your journey, are\nreally bad at understanding features that will come in future. Again the\nprinciple of minimizing brain cycles for people kicks in and people just\nbecome uncertain of themselves. This led to action paralysis in the customers.\n\nLastly, can\u2019t iterate enough, how simplest language is necessary for success\nof the startup. Founders, and that includes us, see branding of big players\nlike Nike or Apple. We are compelled to believe that for a small company, who\nno one recognizes, must come up with a slogan that sticks in the mind of\ncustomers. In order to \u201cthink different\u201d we come up with complicated jargon\nand poetry-like language to impress upon the customers how big and serious a\nplayer; we are. Completely the wrong path to take.\n\nThank you for reading Build Startup In Public .
