I am\n> here for the art, vibes and mythology.\n\n2024 is the Year of the Dragon. We will be exploring some literature around\ndragons through this article with the blessings of the dragons \ud83d\udc32\n\n##### Inspiration for this post\n\nWhile I was watching this excellent video essay on dragons and Dragonology, I\nsaw the image below flash for a moment. I had to rewind and pause the video to\ntake a good look at the frame.\n\nEncountering the Divine Dragon in \"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\"\n\n##### The Divine Dragon from Sekiro: Shadows die Twice\n\nThis was the Divine Dragon, a boss in the game Sekiro: Shadows die Twice,\nsomething I did not know at the time.\n\n##### Finding the dragon\n\nThe first thing which came into my mind when I saw this dragon was, \u201chow the\nfunk is this dragon so beautiful and rad at the same time ?\u201d. I had to take a\nscreenshot, Image Search it in Google and figure out which game was this\ndragon from.\n\n##### Why do this analysis ?\n\nFor someone who loves Japanese art, I was mind blown to see this dragon\npopping out of a giant cherry blossom tree, complete with a missing arm and a\ncool sword in its claw. The design of this dragon was extremely intriguing to\nme.\n\n##### On y va\n\nWith that, I decided to do a short rabbit hole diving in to the design and\norigins of this dragon.\n\nof Constructions and Abstractions is a reader-supported publication. To\nreceive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid\nsubscriber.\n\n#\n\nDesign Analysis and Mythological Origins\n\n##### The four basic elements to the dragon\u2019s design\n\nWe can understand a lot of things from the way this dragon in composed in the\nscene. The four basic elements using which we can use to further our analysis\nare:\n\n  * The environment the dragon resides in\n\n  * The dragon itself\n\n  * The sword held by the dragon (seems to have a significance)\n\n  * The giant cherry blossom tree from which the dragon erupts\n\nThe above 4 elements make a major part of the composition of the scene. Let\u2019s\ndiscuss each of these elements one by one.\n\nIn this article we cover the environment and the dragon, in the next one we\nshall cover the sword and the tree.\n\n##\n\nThe Environment\n\nThe player is teleported to the Divine Realm where the player has to battle\nthe Divine Dragon. A fitting battlefield.\n\n###\n\nThe Divine Realm\n\nThe setting is the Divine Realm, a place that is ethereal and otherworldly,\nwith the dragon itself emerging from a large sakura, or cherry blossom tree.^1\n\nDivine Dragon before the Bloom ^9\n\n###\n\nWeather and Lightning\n\n##### Dragons and Rain\n\nIn Chinese mythology, dragons are believed to bring rain.\n\n##### Lightning and Thunder\n\nWhen lightning flashes, it is thought to be the gleam of a dragon's scales or\nits eyes, and thunder is the rumble of its movement or its mighty roar. ^7\n\n##### The Gloom\n\nIn the game itself the atmosphere is gloomy with clouds covering the sky and\nlightning surging throughout. These natural phenomena make this dragon\u2019s\npresence even more . This also checks out the mythology about the presence of\na dragon causing meteorological anomalies.\n\nMidjourney Prompt : \u201ceastern dragons, rain, lightning, thunder, and gloomy\nweather --aspect 2:1 --v 6.0\u201d\n\n##\n\nThe Dragon\n\n##### The Serpentine Beast\n\nThe dragon itself is a serpentine figure which looms over the character in the\ngame. The dragon swings its long neck and arms simultaneously balancing the 6\npronged sword to attack the character. The design on this is so beautiful that\nthe dragon looks almost real to me.\n\nBattling the Divine Dragon\n\n##### Dragons in Game of Thrones vs. the Divine Dragon\n\nEmerging from the cherry blossom trees, the Divine Dragon is a formidable\nfigure. There are dragons in other mythologies as well but this is like no\nother dragon we usually see in medieval fantasy series like Game of Thrones.\nWhat\u2019s up with the basic design of this dragon ? Why does it look more like a\nsnake than a dragon. We will explore this further in the following part.\n\n###\n\nDragons in Eastern Mythology\n\n##### Dragons and Waterfalls\n\n> ...As a VERY broad statement though, in Eastern Mythology, dragons are\n> commonly associated with rain and the weather, they are also associated with\n> moving bodies of water including springs, waterfalls, rivers, seas and\n> oceans...^1\n\nA Korean Dragon\n\n##### Dragon\u2019s home and transcendence\n\nIn the tapestry of Eastern mythology, dragons are often depicted as majestic\ncreatures closely connected to waterfalls and other bodies of moving water.\n\nThese dragons are believed to inhabit the swirling pools at the base of falls,\nwhere the water's perpetual motion and mist create an otherworldly realm fit\nfor such divine beings. The image of a dragon ascending a waterfall is\nparticularly iconic, symbolizing its journey toward the heavens and for\nspiritual transcendence.\n\n##### Climbing the waterfall\n\nThis motif is celebrated in various cultural festivals and artworks, where the\nwaterfall serves as a bridge between the earthly and the celestial, a path\nthat only the most virtuous and mighty dragons can navigate. The waterfall,\nwith its raw power and grace, becomes a natural throne for these guardians of\nwater.\n\n##### The waterfall dragon in Pok\u00e9mon\n\nIn the world of Pok\u00e9mon, Magikarp and Gyarados present a compelling narrative\nthat echoes the transformational myths of Eastern dragons.\n\nGyarados and Magikarp ^10\n\nMagikarp, a seemingly weak and ineffective Pok\u00e9mon, evolves into the\nformidable Gyarados, a creature that embodies the awe-inspiring power and\nmajesty often associated with dragons in Eastern mythology.\n\n##### Carps and the Dragon Gate\n\nThis metamorphosis from vulnerability to strength is reminiscent of the\nlegendary carp leaping over the Dragon Gate to become a dragon, a story\ncelebrated across various Eastern cultures. This narrative not only ties\nMagikarp and Gyarados to the lore of Eastern dragons but also serves as a\nmetaphor for growth, perseverance, and the potential within all beings to\ntranscend their limitations.\n\nTrying to represent Magikarp evolving into Gyarados or just a Carp passing the\nDragon Gate to become a dragon. Midjourmey Prompt: magikarp progressively\nturning into gyrados, stay true to the original art for pokemon as much as\npossible and not change artistic style --aspect 3:1\n\nWe shall look into other eastern dragons in popular culture towards in the\nnext part of this rabbit hole.\n\n##### Origins of Dragons as a Snake\n\nThe dragon\u2019s serpentine design is rooted in mythology. We shall discuss this\nfurther in one of the below sections on Korean Dragons.\n\n###\n\nA Dragon from the West\n\n##### A dragon\u2019s expedition\n\n> ...We also learn from the remnant of its memory that it is referred to as\n> the Divine Dragon of the Everblossom and that it came to Ashina from the\n> West long ago and took root there...^1\n\nSakura at the Fountainhead ^12\n\nDiving deeper into the lore of the Divine Dragon of the Everblossom, it's\nfascinating to uncover that this majestic creature wasn't originally from the\nlands of Ashina but ventured from the West, finding its sanctuary within the\nserene beauty of the Everblossom tree.\n\n##### Why was the dragon traveling to the West?\n\nThe dragon\u2019s origins from the West and its choice to root itself in Ashina's\nsoil, intertwining its fate with the land, is quite intriguing. It's like the\ndragon wasn't just passing through but was searching for something, a place\nwhere it could intertwine its essence with the land, becoming a guardian of\nsorts.\n\n###\n\nA Korean Dragon\n\n##### What makes us think that this dragon might be Korean?\n\n> ...You see, the Long, or Chinese dragon, is usually depicted with 5 claws on\n> each foot. Meanwhile, the Ryu, or Japanese Dragon is more commonly depicted\n> with 3 claws. So why does the Divine Dragon have 4? Well, the Yong (Forgive\n> me if this isn't considered the proper way to spell its name), the Korean\n> Dragon has four claws which may indicate a more Korean origin for the Divine\n> Dragon...^1\n\nThe above excerpt is from a reddit post which goes deep into the analysis of\nthe Divine Dragon and explains why this dragon might be Korean.\n\nKorean Dragons ^11\n\n##### Korean Dragons and their relationship to snakes\n\nKorean dragons, known as \"Yong\" or \"Yongwang\" embody a blend of serpentine\nelegance and majestic dragon-like features. They are often depicted as\nbenevolent beings, wielding control over water, weather, and agriculture,\nmirroring the protective and nurturing aspects attributed to snakes in various\ncultures. ^8\n\n##### Korean Dragons vs. Western Dragons\n\nDragons in western mythology are commonly associated with fire, it\u2019s\ninteresting to see that this is a contrast from the dragons in eastern\nmythology.\n\nUnlike their Western counterparts, Korean dragons are not fire-breathing\nmonsters but rather symbols of wisdom, power, and goodwill, often associated\nwith rainfall and rivers, which are crucial for farming. This intertwining of\ndragon and snake characteristics highlights a unique cultural perspective\nwhere the line between the mythical and the natural world is beautifully\nblurred. ^8\n\n> ...The divine dragon does come from the divine realm, does seem to summon\n> lightning and more importantly, rainclouds which fits the descriptions of a\n> Korean dragon, but the lack of a yeouiju is what makes me hesitant to label\n> it a Korean dragon...^1\n\nThis dragon comes pretty close to being one from the Korean folklore but the\nlack of \u201cYeouiju\u201d restricts that based on the excerpt above. The \u201cYeouiju\u201d is\na massive pearl which \u201cYong\u201d is supposed to be holding in his/her/their mouth.\n^8\n\nBut, the design of the Dragon itself comes closest to that of a Korean one, is\nsomething we can establish for now.\n\nIn the next part of this rabbit hole we shall explore the other two elements\nfrom the Divine Dragon\u2019s composition; the sword and the Everblossom.\n\nof Constructions and Abstractions is a reader-supported publication.
