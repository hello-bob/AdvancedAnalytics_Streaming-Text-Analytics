The latter\nremoved the option entirely at 300 locations most-impacted by shoplifting.\n\nRetailers are pulling back, but not abandoning self-checkout, according to\nNeil Saunders, managing director, retail, at GlobalData. \"They are trying to\nsee how does this play a role in the future, but it's not going to be the same\nthing they've done for decades, where it's a free-for-all, and anyone could\nuse it,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. There is a lot more caution.\"\n\nWalmart cited customer feedback as among the factors in its decision to remove\nthe self-checkout kiosks at its store in Shrewsbury.\n\n\"As part of our announced plans for additional investments and improvements to\nstores across the country, we're converting the self-checkout lanes at our\n7437 Watson Road store in Shrewsbury, MO., to traditional checkout lanes,\" a\nWalmart spokesperson emailed CBS MoneyWatch. \"We believe the change will\nimprove the in-store shopping experience and give our associates the chance to\nprovide more personalized and efficient service.\"\n\nSelf-checkout increased in popularity among retailers and customers during the\npandemic, allowing shoppers to limit their contact with others and helping to\nrelieve a labor shortage that made staffing registers more difficult.\n\nStill, as the pandemic wound down, many shoppers returned to their former\nhabits, and the appeal of self-checkout lost some of its allure.\n\n\"It's a very love-hate technology. A lot of customers see it as a\ndeterioration of the service, and they have to do more of the work. So it's\nnot good for driving customer loyalty, \" Saunders noted.\n\nWalmart revenue up, Home Depot sales down in 4th quarter reports 05:12\n\nStill, rising theft \u2014 part of what retailers call \"shrink\" \u2014 is the primary\nreason self-checkout is being ditched in some stores and restricted in others,\naccording to Saunders.\n\n\"Self-checkout is an area of the store people can steal things,\" said the\nanalyst, who noted that shoppers also make genuine mistakes, such as not\nscanning items properly. \"Retailers are very actively trying to reduce it, or\nin Target's case put more restrictions around self-checkout to try to reduce\nthe losses they incur from it.\"\n\nCostco in November added more staff in self-checkout areas after finding that\nnon-members were sneaking in to use membership cards that didn't belong to\nthem at self-checkout. Costco said shrink had increased in 2023 \"in part we\nbelieve due to the rollout of self-checkout.\"\n\nAnother approach is adding a receipt-scanning gate at self-checkout areas,\nwhich Safeway has done at multiple locations in California, in addition to\nshutting down self-checkout entirely in some stores.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nWayfair set to open its first physical store.
