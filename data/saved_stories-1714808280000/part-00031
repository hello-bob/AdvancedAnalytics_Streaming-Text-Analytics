The Czech\nRepublic also said its institutions were targeted.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4fS9I\n\nCopy link\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry said the government would use 'the entire spectrum\nof measures' to respond to 'Russia's aggressive behavior'Image: Sina\nSchuldt/dpa/picture alliance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGermany accused Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, on Friday of\nbeing behind a 2023 cyberattack that targeted the Social Democrats (SPD).\n\nNATO member Germany has been among the Western nations providing military\nsupport to Ukraine as it fights a Russian invasion and there have also been\nrecent accusations of increased espionage.\n\nIn June 2023, the SPD announced that cybercriminals had targeted email\naccounts belonging to its executives earlier that year.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Friday that a newly conducted\ngovernment investigation found that that cyberattack was carried out by a\ngroup called APT28.\n\nThe Czech Republic said its institutions too have been targeted by APT28, also\nknown as Fancy Bear and controlled by Russia's GRU military intelligence\nservice. The Czech Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it believed the group\nhad exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Outlook program.\n\n## Germany warns Russia over 'unacceptable' cyberattack\n\n03:43\n\n## What are the latest accusations?\n\n\"Russian state hackers attacked Germany in cyberspace,\" German Foreign\nMinister Baerbock said.\n\n\"Today we can say unambiguously ... we can attribute this cyberattack to a\ngroup called APT28, which is steered by the military intelligence service of\nRussia,\" she told a news conference during a visit to Australia.\n\nAPT28 has been accused of dozens of cyberattacks around the world.\n\n\"In other words, it was a state-sponsored Russian cyber attack on Germany,\"\nBaerbock said. \"This is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable and will have\nconsequences.\"\n\nShe did not specify what those consequences could be.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Germany would act alongside the\nEuropean Union and NATO in its response.\n\n\"The Russian cyberattacks are a threat to our democracy, which we are\nresolutely countering,\" Faeser said in a statement. \"Under no circumstances\nwill we allow ourselves to be intimidated by the Russian regime.\"\n\nThe Interior Ministry added that there was some evidence the Russian\ncyberattack also compromised the servers of some German companies.\n\n## How have others responded?\n\nThe European Union, of which both Berlin and Prague are members, condemned a\n\"malicious cybercampaign\" against the two countries. The bloc warned that it\nwould use a \"full spectrum\" of tools to respond.\n\nNATO said in a statement that it stands in solidarity with Germany and the\nCzech Republic following the attacks.\n\nThe US also released a statement, calling on Moscow \"to stop this malicious\nactivity and abide by its international commitments and obligations.\"\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Germany denied Moscow had a role in the 2023 attack,\nsaying its envoy \"categorically rejected the accusations that Russian state\nstructures were involved in the given incident ... as unsubstantiated and\ngroundless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Germany summons Russian envoy\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry later said it had summoned the Russian envoy about\nthe alleged cyberattacks.\n\n\"We have summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Russian Embassy,\" a\nministry spokesman told reporters. He added that the government would \"use the\nentire spectrum of measures to deter and respond to Russia's aggressive\nbehavior in cyberspace.\"\n\nBaerbock first addressed the cyberattacks while speaking after meeting\nAustralian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in Adelaide.\n\nWong said Australia was also \"deeply troubled\" by the cyber activity raised by\nBaerbock.\n\n\"Australia stands in solidarity with Germany in calling out states that act\ncontrary to the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace,\" Wong said.\n\nlo,rc/sms (AFP, Reuters)\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in\nGerman politics and society.
