Our interviews\nwith Jerry Seinfeld, Andr\u00e9 3000, Emily Bode, Lorde, Online Ceramics, Phoebe\nBridgers, Nathan Fielder, Hayley Williams, Rashida Jones, Seth Rogen, Romeo\nOkwara, Ezra Koenig, Tyler, The Creator and more are HERE.\n\nOur visionary profound essays are HERE.\n\nWe are 100% reader-supported \u2014 join our Cla$$ified Recon Tier today \u262e\ufe0f\u270c\ud83c\udffb\n\u2014Jonah & Erin\n\nSomething increasingly common in the life of the Mach 3+ jawnz appreciator is\nthat you\u2019ll check out a possibly cool small maker\u2019s webshop, trying to get a\nsense of what\u2019s up with their whole f**king gestalt, and the site design will\nlook... suspect.\n\nThe fonts, layout, and copy combine to feel, if not cursed, exactly, then off-\nputtingly hollow ... clean, but in a charmless, lifeless, cookie-cutter, sans-\nserif way that makes you think of \u201coptimized\u201d direct-to-consumer business\nmodels and timeline brands \u2014 the kinds of wack companies that exist to sling\n\u201cdisrupted\u201d Le Creuset knockoffs, fiberglass-Eames-chair rips in muted\npastels, \u201cminimalist\u201d chore coats in primary colors, etc., etc....\n\nEWWW, FOHHHH with that TORCHED s**t !!\n\nThis design style is usually a strong clue that the seemingly cool jawn in\nquestion is, IN SOOTH, the bogus offering of some wack V.C.-backed brand\ntrying to \u201cscale\u201d as fast as possible, appeal to as broad a swath of \u201ctasteful\nupwardly mobile urbanite\u201d customers as they can, and \u201cdo these 10x Ev*rlane\nnumbers ASAP.\u201d There is no spark of individuality, and no FRICTION (unless you\ncount the swarm of pop-up windows you\u2019ve got to close anytime you surf the\nd*mn web these days am I right?!)\n\nWhat\u2019s vexing is that SOMETIMES a brand with a cookie-cutter site is a\ngenuinely cool, actually small maker who\u2019s just using a prefab e-commerce\ntemplate from, like, Squ*respace or whoever... The maker has outsourced the\npresentation of their idiosyncratic wares to 2022-era Big Tech, so of course\nthat presentation is the opposite of idiosyncratic \u2014 like placing a bunch of\ncool handmade art in some subway-tile-and-exposed-brick-decorated WeW*rk.\n\nAs you can tell by taking one look at the \u201cbeautiful & blessed\u201d miracle that\nis Blackbird Spyplane, we have a soft spot for internet aesthetics that tend\ntoward the UNGAINLY and UNSLICK ... Sites that feel noisy, homemade, and\n\u201coff,\u201d on some Craigslist / Geocities s**t ...\n\n... rather than deadeningly prefab on some [D.T.C. BRAND-NAME REDACTED] s**t\n!!\n\nSo why are we talking about this??\n\nFor a while now, Erin and I have been thinking about what makes a space \u2014\nvirtual and physical alike \u2014 feel popping and warm vs. torched and soulless.\nAnd what kinds of places we miss and want to see make a RESURGENCE!\n\nLoosened lockdown restrictions and the seeming imminence of \u201cmetaverses\u201d (JFC)\nonly make these questions more vital. And recently, we had an EPIPHANY whose\nprofound implications will ripple outward from today\u2019s newsletter and, with\ntime, catalyze an architectural / design revolution across both the digital\nand physical realms ...\n\nHere\u2019s how it came to us. We were enjoying some excellent pizza at a spot\ncalled Hail Mary in Atwater, on the East Side of L.A., (shout out SpyFriend\nRashida Jones for the tip), and digging the overall vibe of the place \u2014\npositive \u201890s Native Tongues / Dungeon Family / backpack rap on the speakers,\nunevenly plastered walls, faintly sticky wooden booths, weird black quilted\nutility fabric on the ceiling \u2014 when we realized something about the place:\n\nIt was somehow cool yet UN-GRAMMABLE!!\n\nThe pizza was delicious & beautiful in a perfectly photogenic way, but the\nrestaurant itself was charmingly un-photogenic, at least when held up against\nthe dominant aesthetic fetishes of the current Instagram era.\n\nIt was a lovely and welcoming place to actually hang out, in other words, and\nthe kind of place where you were not remotely tempted to indulge in the modern\ncyborg tic of whipping out yr phone and documenting yr visit for the\ntimeline....\n\nFor instance, look at this suburban-Milwaukee lookin\u2019-a** bar & grill style\nstained-glass fixture hanging over Hail Mary\u2019s counter \u2014\n\n... this is a wonderfully unattractive YET vibe-enhancingly UN-GRAMMABLE piece\nof d\u00e9cor.\n\nIt dawned on us that whoever designed & decorated Hail Mary was fully steeped\n\u2014 whether they knew it or not \u2014 in what we call \u201cUN-GRAMMABLE HANG ZONE\u201d\n(U.G.H.Z.) Principles.\n\nAnd, as we sat there vibing, we realized how much we truly love spending time\nin an U.G.H.Z., now more than ever.\n\nSo, yr asking, what\u2019s an Un-Grammable Hang Zone??\n\nIt could be a few things, but what we have in mind specifically is the kind of\nwarm, welcoming, unpretentious place that proliferated in the \u201890s, back in\nthe quainter, earlier days of globalization \u2014 the type of teahouse,\ncoffeeshop, dive bar, pizza parlor, etc. that features any number of the\nfollowing U.G.H.Z. signifiers:\n\n  * Big saran-wrapped cookies studded with M&Ms for sale alongside enormous muffins with jumbo chocolate chips,\n\n  * Board games and a little library of FUNKY and/or classic books,\n\n  * Second-run movie nights, or even, like, \u201cLive Zydeco Thursdays\u201d??\n\n  * Slow internet / no internet,\n\n  * A hodgepodge of mismatched china / mismatched furniture possibly including a beanbag and an old couch,\n\n  * Maybe, like, a burlap coffee sack pinned to the wall next to a Japanese parasol as d\u00e9cor,\n\n  * That stained-glass fixture pictured above,\n\n  * A playlist full of, e.g., Talib Kweli and Jurassic 5 and nothing cooler than Tribe, OutKast, or Erykah Badu.\n\n  * A bulletin board with a bunch of \u201cDRUMMER WANTED\u201d and \u201cCATSITTER AVAILABLE\u201d fliers.\n\nAn ersatz version of this kind of place can be seen today on Netflix, in\nstreaming episodes of Friends, as \u201cCentral Perk,\u201d but the real thing can be\nfound I.R.L., too, albeit in dwindling numbers, from NYC to L.A. to Chicago to\nOakland to Athens, GA, to Eugene, OR, to Chapel Hill to Bennington to a\nconstellation of U.S. college towns, and outward to Berlin, Toronto,\nBarcelona, Melbourne, etc., etc.!!\n\nPart of our affection for places like this has to do with \u201890s nostalgia \u2014 a\nrelatively recent past that feels extraordinarily distant. And it has to do\nwith our interest at BBSP in identifying the moment when aesthetics that were\nprevalent, only to become pass\u00e9, round the corner of reappraisal and somehow\nbecome more popping than ever.\n\nDigging beneath that, our affection is also about the modest, chill and non-\ncorporate ethos that these places embody: \u201cCome pay a few bucks for a big\ncookie and a big coffee served in a weird Garfield mug, sit a while with\nfriends or a great book, maybe f**k around and do a puzzle, take a d*mn gander\nat the bulletin-board fliers and tear off a phone number so you can LINK &\nBUILD with a local ceramicist!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an ethos that sits in striking contrast to the new high-efficiency,\nlow-humanity kind of eatery where you point yr phone at a QR code and do\ncontactless payment before eating a room-temp grain bowl under a pink neon\nsign that says \u201cLiving My Best Life\u201d in cursive... the kind of dystopian\nplace, in other words, that exists substantially as its own watered-down\nimage, which people can enter into \u2014 dazed and automaton-like \u2014 and maybe take\na BLEAK selfie in front of the neon sign.\n\nAnd the pandemic has only accelerated this dismal impoverishment of gathering\nspaces!!\n\nCompare the two caf\u00e9s above, chosen at random except for their immense\nillustrative powers: On the left is a Berlin spot called The Greens, in Mitte,\noffering \u201ccoffee & plants,\u201d decorated with terracotta pots, matching sets of\nindustrial furniture and floors tiled just so ...\n\nTHEN on the right we\u2019ve got a longstanding Oakland caf\u00e9 called Jump\u2019n Java\n(temporarily closed, prayers up), decorated with funky metal sculptures by\nlocal artist Mark Bulwinkle, wonky hand-painted murals, old dented-aluminum-\ntopped diner-supply sugar dispensers and hella uncool (therefore cool) bamboo\nfolding chairs...\n\nNo shots at whoever may have put ample effort into the spot above left, but we\nare clearly not the only people feeling FATIGUED and PANDERED TO by spaces\nthat look like that, which I think is ALSO how you can account for the spike\nin love for classically charming and beautiful clich\u00e9-free pre-internet hang\nzones, most prominently Bemelmans Bar in NYC:\n\nShout out to Bemelmans, an inarguable treasure. And shout out to the immensely\n& similarly charming Tosca, in San Francisco, where Erin & I had dinner the\nother night and which never disappoints.\n\nBUT these places are not U.G.H.Z. because they are highly grammable and\ntherefore susceptible to invasion by annoying hordes, screaming out to be\ndocumented on the TL just like a much-less-charming N*stl\u00e9-owned Blue B*ttle\nthat\u2019s all blond-wood \u201cScandinavian\u201d furniture and clean white angles...\n\nRight now, in year ~15 of the fetish for \u201cclean lines\u201d and \u201cunderstated\nelegance,\u201d I wanna hang for hours in a FRUMPY, MISSHAPEN, INVITINGLY INELEGANT\nplace like Jump\u2019N Java instead, during which time I would never even think to\ntake out my phone and let the feed know I was there because, despite being\npacked with vibey curios, the place is way too much of a CHAOTIC VISUAL\nHODGEPODGE to \u201cwork\u201d in the form of an iPhone pic on social media ...\n\nThere is one major flaw with U.G.H.Z \u2014 the food and drinks on offer typically\nrange from passable to abysmal !\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, and that\u2019s why our visit to Hail Mary was\neye-opening: The d\u00e9cor was firmly on that good U.G.H.Z. s**t AND the food was\nvery good, too.\n\nIf I was opening a SPYPLANE CAF\u00c9 right now I\u2019d brew some fair-trade single-\norigin Maru-caliber coffee BUT I\u2019d serve it in chipped Far Side mugs alongside\nARTISANAL ENORMOUS COOKIES WITH ARTISANAL M&MS ON THEM \ud83d\ude09!!\n\nAnd not only would my discerning clientele respect the Mach 3+ U.G.H.Z.\naesthetic but they would actually savor the provisions while inhabiting a real\nplace, conceived of with love and care, ROOTED in the local soil with ZERO\nINTEREST in \u201csocial media shares.\u201d\n\nIf disgustingly high rents prevent such places from existing these days,\nmaking it so that the only ppl who can get into the caf\u00e9 game are V.C.-a** /\nN*stl\u00e9-type operations, well, that\u2019s just one more illustration of how we need\nto fight hard to reverse all manner of WACKLY ANTISOCIAL TRENDS in modern\nlife!!\n\nTerry Riley \u2014 Spyplane-beloved master of mind-blowing postminimalist drones,\nAND appreciator of U.G.H.Z. design\n\nHere\u2019s a beautiful thing about U.G.H.Z Principles \u2014 they apply to virtual\nspaces, too. (No, you would probably never \u201cgram\u201d a website, but we are\ntalking metaphorically here baby!)\n\nCompare the TORCHED \u201ccontemporary\u201d e-commerce templates below left, for\ninstance, with the heavily UGHZ\u2019D-OUT cool webstores and Geocities pages below\nright:\n\nI would never \u201cjoin a community\u201d or cop a jawn (at least not excitedly) at a\nplace that looked like it came from column A, whereas I would be stoked to\nchop it up and share FAR-OUT visions with all manner of eccentric weirdos AND\npsyched to cop some FLY FUNKY s**t from a place that looked like it came from\ncolumn B \u2014 that\u2019s U.G.H.Z. magic !\n\nTo pick just 2 contemporary sites that effortlessly embody U.G.H.Z. principles\n(while keeping things tidier than the chaotic Geocities look), check out the\nwebshop below of Mach 3+ Portland jawnshop Stand Up Comedy (who make their\ns**t look like a .jpeg-embedded Windows 95 era Word .doc with comic sans for\nthe designer names), or the website of Mach 3+ California artist (and\nBlackbird SpyFriend) Shana Moulton:\n\nThat good clean, contemporary U.G.H.Z. s**t from Stand Up Comedy and Shana\nMoulton\n\nOne glance and you aren\u2019t subsumed by \u201cvisual cacophony\u201d (no disrespect to\nvisual cacophony, which we of course love) but you can tell that these sites\nare clearly operated by cool people with unique & interesting taste\nnonetheless...\n\nListen \u2014 Blackbird Spyplane is \u201cunbeatably prophetic\u201d and influential, so it\u2019s\nonly a matter of time (could be months, could be more) until the holy wisdom\nwe are spitting today reaches corpo forces.\n\nRealizing that the neutered, rounded-edge aesthetic is TIRED, these forces may\nvery well pivot to some focus-grouped, heavily diluted version of U.G.H.Z.\nPrinciples.\n\nBut we know that \u201cunbeatable real ones\u201d will ALWAYS detect the fugazi\nfrequencies and go somewhere actually cool with BEAN BAGS AND BOARD GAMES\ninstead!!\n\nSPYPLANE: OUT \u262e\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\ude91\u2615\ud83c\udf6a\ud83e\udde9 Have fun with a Blackbird Spyplane \u201cCla$$ified Tier\u201d Subscription to\nimprove yr quality of life, access a bunch of elite exclusive s**t, and\nsupport this rare & miraculous newsletter:\n\nCop limited-edition SPYJAWNS\n\n139 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n139\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Too many places are STERILE and TORCHED \u2014 let\u2019s make them COOL and FUNKY\n\nwww.blackbirdspyplane.com\n\n26\n\nShare\n\n26 Comments\n\nLana HMar 9, 2023Nobody does U.G.H.Z. like New Orleans!Expand full commentLike\n(5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMax DiltheyDec 7, 2022Prophetic.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n24 more comments...\n\nWhy do new cars look like this??\n\n\"Wet Putty\" whips are everywhere.
