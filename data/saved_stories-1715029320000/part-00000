On the other side, scattered eucalyptus trees dot the\notherwise empty fields. All this nothing lies an hour north of San Francisco,\nfar from the nearest subdivisions and schools and strip malls. It's a\nspecifically Californian kind of empty.\n\nBut in Jan Sramek's eyes, it's full. Where others see only blue sky and dusty\nfarmland, Sramek, a former Goldman Sachs trader, sees row houses and\napartments. Art galleries and sushi bars. Bike paths and parks. A vibrant,\nbustling, energy-efficient community with all the charm of a 19th-century\nvillage \u2014 and all the fiber-optic internet and self-driving cars of a 21st-\ncentury megalopolis. Sramek sees the city of the future. He sees California\nForever.\n\n\"Downtown would be here, where the highways cross,\" he says, pointing to his\nright. Only 37, he's dark-haired and tall, standing next to his gray Tesla\nModel Y, arms outstretched, his vision materializing before him. \"And we're\nputting a second downtown closer to Rio Vista,\" he adds, gesturing toward that\ntown, invisible in the distance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSramek pauses. There's no futuristic city before him, no urban utopia. Only\n50,000 acres of scrubby real estate. It might, he realizes, seem a little\ncrazy.\n\n\"It's a lot less crazy than when I had the idea in 2017,\" he says. \"You always\nhave doubts.\"\n\nThose doubts, as it happens, are widespread. The revelation that a mysterious\ninvestor had quietly become the largest landowner here in Solano County, a\nsparsely populated swath of small towns and fertile fields wedged between Napa\nand Sacramento, caused an uproar among the locals. Things only got more heated\nwhen Sramek, backed by a who's who of Silicon Valley billionaire investors,\nwas outed as the driving force behind California Forever. Opponents of the\nproject accused Sramek and the tech tycoons \u2014 including the LinkedIn cofounder\nReid Hoffman, the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, and the venture\ncapitalist Marc Andreessen \u2014 of using \"strong-arm mobster tactics\" to bully\nlocals out of their land. They've assailed Sramek at public meetings and are\nfighting a ballot resolution that would rezone the property to accommodate his\nvision.\n\nSramek quietly acquired 50,000 acres of scrubby land an hour north of San\nFrancisco. \"It's in the middle of everywhere,\" he says. Christie Hemm Klok for\nBI\n\nDevelopment, be it residential or commercial or industrial, is always a battle\nbetween past, present, and future. Some interests favor the status quo; others\nlobby for change. The problem is America is in urgent need of change. There's\nnot enough housing to go around. Cities are trapped in a doom loop. Sramek\nbelieves that the only solution is to build a shiny new city on a hill \u2014 and\nthat he's the guy who has the juice, and the land, to get it done. \"We are\ntied to the mast,\" he says. \"You'll move here, right?\"\n\nSuch unwavering confidence helped forge Sramek's reputation as a financial\nwunderkind, someone who set out at an early age to be the European equivalent\nof Peter Thiel. But to those who know him from his days in London and Zurich,\nCalifornia Forever represents a strange and unlikely new chapter in Sramek's\nshort and not entirely successful career. The question is not just does\nSramek, working with an impressive team of urban planners, have the answer to\nwhat ails America's cities. The question is also: Does he really have a shot\nat building it, where all others have failed?\n\nIn England, back in the early 2000s, Jan Sramek was a name to conjure with.\n\nHe was born in the Czech Republic and grew up in a small town called\nD\u0159evohostice. His mother was a teacher, his father a mechanic. His\ngrandparents worked in the local steel mill. In 2004, at the age of 17, Sramek\nbailed on all that. He enrolled in boarding school in the city of York, in\nEngland, and two years later took 10 A-level exams, the British university\nentrance tests. Sramek got A's on all 10. Nobody takes that many A-levels, let\nalone scores A's on every one of them.\n\nA-level exams are a crucial part of Britain's socioeconomic infrastructure \u2014\nace them, and they're like the chain that pulls a roller coaster uphill, a\nmechanism for upward mobility. When a working-class kid from Eastern Europe\ndid it, the feat earned a mention in the national press. For years Sramek was\na role model for other English kids with aspirations. His name would pop up on\nforums where students discussed strategies for getting into their dream\nuniversities. Only have three weeks to ace an exam? \"Jan Sramek says it can be\ndone. You have to focus and be disciplined.\" If Jan could do it, maybe you\ncould, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe A-levels got Sramek into the University of Cambridge \u2014 which he left after\njust a year, for the London School of Economics and \"the City,\" the square\nmile of London that's Europe's answer to Wall Street. \"Party boy Jan is\nyoungest Rising Star in Square Mile,\" one tabloid reported. While in school,\nhe kept busy launching his own business ventures. There was AlphaParties,\nwhich he touted as the go-to organizer for parties at some of London's\nglitziest establishments, though Sramek claimed that he himself never drank or\nsmoked. There was a careers website called Nicube. But his main focus was the\ninternship he landed in London with Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a 2008 blog interview for a series titled \"Tycoons of Tomorrow,\" Sramek\nsaid he slept only five hours a night. His role model, he said, was Thiel, the\nPayPal cofounder and early investor in Facebook. Asked what motivated him,\nSramek responded, \"racing against myself.\" His advice for other budding\nentrepreneurs: \"See everything in terms of risk-reward, almost like a trade.\nDetermine your entry, exit and stop loss. Know when to get out.\" He was 21.\n\nAll the Goldman interns hoped to convert the entry-level position into a full-\ntime gig. Sramek actually pulled it off. In 2009, he became a trader on the\nfirm's emerging-markets desk. In his spare time, he cowrote \"Racing Towards\nExcellence,\" a bro-ish self-help book. The next year CheatSheet reported that\nSramek was being mentored by \"several of London's most powerful hedge fund\nmanagers who are clearly grooming him for the very top.\" New York magazine\nascribed to Sramek a \"cocksure arrogance.\" This very publication called him a\n\"prodigy.\"\n\nMaybe it was a little early for all that. \"It was a bit of cart before the\nhorse,\" says a friend of Sramek's from Cambridge who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity. \"There was a lot of attention around this guy, but he hadn't really\ndelivered much in the real world.\" Jonas Rave, a colleague at Goldman Sachs,\nsays Sramek was charismatic and confident. \"It's the curse of the gifted child\nwho's told from an early age that they're amazing,\" Rave says. \"There's a lot\nof early success that makes you believe you can do anything.\"\n\nSramek left Goldman after a bit less than two years \u2014 a tenure so short that\ninternet trolls and a few fellow bankers cocked their eyebrows at what might\nhave gone wrong for the wunderkind. His managers, though, back up Sramek's\naccount that the decision to leave was his. \"He was a very gifted, high-\npotential employee, but he had very ambitious goals,\" says Guy Saidenberg, a\nformer Goldman partner who oversaw Sramek's division. \"I think he was a bit\nfrustrated at the speed he was being promoted and given responsibilities.\"\n\nSramek moved to Zurich, where he followed in the footsteps of many former\ntraders: He tried to launch a hedge fund. At first he planned to use a\ntechnology-guided \"Moneyball\" mentality to improve traders' batting averages.\nBut after testing the software with actual users, Sramek and his cofounder\npivoted. Now it was an education startup. They changed the name from Erudify\n(as in, perhaps, \"to make more erudite\") to just Better.\n\nBetter did not live up to its name. Sramek's next venture, a kind of\nsupercharged version of Evernote called Memo, got him noticed by Silicon\nValley. The investor Marc Andreessen described Memo as \"when ideas have sex.\"\nBut it failed to procreate, and Sramek found himself out of ideas. So at 30,\nafter five years of working on failed startups, he did what Europeans often do\nwhen they can't find a way to succeed on the continent. He set out to reinvent\nhimself in California.\n\nHis startup failures in Europe haven't prevented Sramek from winning over\nbillionaire investors in Silicon Valley. Christie Hemm Klok for BI\n\nSramek had spent years reading about the Bay Area's success as a hub of jobs\nand innovation. But when he finally moved there in 2015, he found longtime\nresidents protesting Google buses. San Francisco was attracting the smartest\npeople in the world, paying them egregious amounts of money, and building\nprecisely no places for them to live. So they were fighting over the existing\nhousing stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As an outsider, it was easy to see how we messed up the housing market here\nin a really profound way,\" Sramek says. \"Instead of everyone getting excited\nabout good-paying jobs, it was: Yeah, good-paying jobs, but we're going to be\ndisplaced.\"\n\nThe most pleasant parts of Bay Area cities, the kinds of places young people\nand young families might want to go, were prohibitively expensive. \"My\ngirlfriend and I were making good money, and we struggled to live in Hayes\nValley,\" Sramek says, name-checking what's arguably the cutest neighborhood in\nAmerica's cutest city. \"It was a tournament with a fixed number of slots.\"\n\nSo Sramek started reading \u2014 in two years, he claims, he devoured 500 books\nabout urban development. (You can do the math and decide for yourself whether\nthat sounds plausible.) The standout, he says, was \"The Death and Life of\nGreat American Cities.\" Sramek, like generations of readers before him, was\ntaken by Jane Jacobs' emphasis on the value of vibrant, diverse streetfronts\nand the need to mix residences with retail. He traveled the world, studying\nthe most popular neighborhoods in the most vibrant cities, from Atlanta and\nPhoenix to Copenhagen and Barcelona. \"I'd just walk them for two days and see\nwhat worked,\" Sramek says.\n\nSramek exudes a specific kind of brainy charm. He's good-looking and speaks\nEnglish with a slight Eastern European accent; he wears brown suede desert\nboots and sports a suitably weathered black Goruck GR1 backpack, an emblem of\ntechy, tactical coolness. He's also a quick study. Embracing the ideals of the\nmodern city, he decided that what is needed is cheaper housing (to reduce\ninequality), solar power and wind farms (to reduce carbon emissions), and more\ndensely populated, walkable neighborhoods (to support shops and restaurants,\ncreate jobs, and reduce commute times). Yet it's hard to build places like\nthat nowadays, thanks to a host of zoning and land-use rules designed to\nprotect the environment and promote public input.\n\nSramek's new business idea was pretty far removed from his youthful grindcore\nmindset. Forget software startups; in the real world he'd do real estate.\nSramek thought he'd build in the interstitial and vacant spaces in cities.\nPlanners call that infill, and it's a fashionable idea in urbanism \u2014 supplying\nthe \"missing middle\" between single-family homes and bulky apartment\nbuildings. There was only one problem. Bay Area cities have created a process\nfor permitting new buildings so byzantine, slow, and expensive that if the\ngreat New York builder Robert Moses were alive and trying to work in San\nFrancisco, he'd be more Power Broken than Power Broker. Sramek's idea got\nnowhere. So to take his mind off his troubles, he went fishing \u2014 literally.\n\nAn avid angler, Sramek had been spending time on the waters of the Sacramento-\nSan Joaquin River Delta, the northwestern corner of San Francisco Bay. To get\nthere, he and his girlfriend would drive through Solano County, dotted with a\nmix of old farms, strip malls, half-empty downtowns, and industry in various\nstates of disarray. On one fishing trip, Sramek noticed an empty diamond-\nshaped space between Travis Air Force Base and the town of Rio Vista. To make\nhis point, he calls up a satellite view of the land on his Tesla's screen \u2014\nwhich is a bit disconcerting, given that he's driving.\n\n\"You can see that it's the only yellow patch on the map,\" he says. On the\nsatview, everything around the empty diamond is the beige-gray of city or the\nlush, irrigated green of maintained land. It seems like the middle of nowhere\n\u2014 until Sramek zooms out. \"It's in the middle of everywhere,\" he says\ntriumphantly.\n\nThe yellow diamond is between San Francisco and Sacramento. Between Silicon\nValley and the ski-and-sun resorts of Lake Tahoe. It's the geographic center\nof the Bay Area megaregion. And it's almost as big as Toledo, Ohio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the key that unlocked the problem Sramek had been struggling with.\nThe way to solve the housing crisis that's killing Silicon Valley, he decided,\nwasn't with small-bore infill. \"It was never going to be enough,\" he says.\n\"But what if you could build walkable neighborhoods on a greenfield site?\" Why\nfix an old city like San Francisco, in other words, when you could build a\nbrand-new one an hour north in Solano County?\n\nAs he leans against the Model Y, looking out at the wide, flat space his\ncompany owns, Sramek's eyes unfocus a little. \"This is not a good place for a\nsubdivision,\" he says. \"It's not connected to an existing town. It doesn't\nhave jobs. It doesn't have entertainment or retail.\" It becomes something only\nif you bring in thousands of people, homes, jobs, shops, schools, and houses\nof worship. \"You have to want to build it at that scale.\"\n\nSmarek with maps showing the area's predicted growth. \"Jan is a man on a\nmission,\" says one of the tech giants who are backing him. Christie Hemm Klok\nfor BI\n\nSramek named his new company after Flannery Road, a gravel road running across\nthe site, and convened a top-notch team of urban planners to assist him. \"Jan\nhas a pretty extraordinary vision for seeing this opportunity and putting it\ntogether,\" says BH Bronson Johnson, the project's sustainability engineer, who\nhas worked on big urban projects like Treasure Island in San Francisco and\nGoogle's since-canceled Sidewalk neighborhood in Toronto.\n\nSramek was certainly thinking big. The idea was to provide homes for Bay Area\ntechies and jobs for Solano County. But he couldn't convince anyone to invest\nin the project. So he took out a loan and bought the first bits of the yellow\npart of the map himself. He won't say how much the loan was for. \"It was a lot\nof money,\" he says. \"If this didn't work, I would've been in deep trouble.\"\n\nThat loan also paid for feasibility studies on the site. The engineering\nanalysis concluded that it was the ideal place to build a new city: too lousy\nto farm, no tectonic activity, high enough to withstand even the direst\nestimates of sea-level rise. Armed with the detailed studies, Sramek made\nanother run at wealthy investors. \"I think I wore people down,\" he says. \"They\nwould say, 'This is a good idea, and here are 150 reasons it won't work.' And\nI would take them one by one. At some point, people run out of questions. And\nthen they invested.\"\n\nSramek impressed the titans of Silicon Valley, just as he had charmed his way\ninto the upper echelons of high finance in his college days. \"It's really\nabout investing in the people behind those big ideas,\" says David George, the\npartner at Andreessen Horowitz handling the firm's investment in California\nForever. \"Jan is a man on a mission, and a student of history, geography, and\nwhat makes cities special.\"\n\nWith the help of some of the biggest names in Big Tech, Sramek was able to\nacquire the land he needed for California Forever. Now all he needed was\npermission to build something on it. But that, he soon discovered, might take\nCalifornia forever.\n\nIn 2022, Marilyn Farley started hearing rumors. Farmers in Solano County were\ngetting pressured to sell their land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA retired city councilwoman, Farley was no stranger to fighting out-of-town\ndevelopers. Way back in 1984, a local group named the Solano County Orderly\nGrowth Committee formed to block a San Francisco developer who wanted to build\na new city, from scratch, on mostly empty land near Travis Air Force Base. To\nkeep others from trying the same thing, the committee \u2014 which Farley would\njoin a few years later \u2014 passed a ballot measure to prevent virtually any\ndevelopment outside of Solano's seven existing cities. That rule, which\nremains on the books, is the biggest obstacle to Sramek's plans for California\nForever.\n\nAlarmed by the rumors of a new development, Farley set out to investigate. She\nfound the agenda for a closed meeting of the Sacramento Municipal Utility\nDistrict that suggested the agency was negotiating a land sale to a mysterious\nentity called Flannery LLC. But an attorney who had worked on the deal\nwouldn't tell Farley anything \u2014 they had signed a nondisclosure agreement. \"It\nwas all very perplexing,\" she says.\n\nThe land purchases roiled the county. Given the site's adjacency to an Air\nForce base, Solano County's congressman took his worries to the national\npress. Was this, perhaps, an effort by China to gain a foothold?\n\nThe frenzy forced Sramek's company, Flannery Associates, to finally reveal\nitself. Over the past half-decade it had quietly spent $900 million to become\nthe largest landowner in the county, stitching together 140 properties. When a\nhandful of landowners refused to sell, Flannery took them to court, accusing\nthem of colluding to force the price higher. In response, the landowners\nclaimed that Sramek had pitted family members against each other as a tactic\nto strong-arm farmers into selling their land.\n\nIf Sramek had been hoping to win over the locals, he was off to a bad start.\nHe had effectively staged a secret land grab with stealth funding provided by\nsome of the world's wealthiest tech barons. \"We understand why that looks, on\nthe surface, odd,\" he now concedes. But he points to another California\nvisionary who secretly bought up land before unveiling his dream of\nTomorrowland. \"When Disney was building Disney World, that's what he did,\"\nSramek says. \"And you all love Disney World.\"\n\nSolano County and Rio Vista residents Kathleen Threlfall, left, and Bill\nMortimore protest outside a press conference unveiling California Forever's\nplans after being shut out of the event held in Rio Vista, Calif., Jan. 17,\n2024. Jessica Christian/San Francisco Chronicle via AP\n\nForced into the open, Sramek shifted his strategy to one of transparency. He\nreleased a preliminary plan, began personally answering emails from concerned\ncitizens, and met with Farley. She describes him as cordial, though she was\nimmune to his charisma. \"I feel like he has his mind made up,\" Farley says.\n\"He knows what he wants to do. He has money, and he's used to getting his\nway.\"\n\nThings got even uglier last November, when Sramek attended a public meeting\nabout the project at the Vallejo Naval and Historical Museum. The audience\ntore him to shreds. Why did Sramek buy all that land in secret, they demanded.\nWhy should they trust him? One person who attended said Sramek sounded like\nLyle Lanley, the con artist who sells the town of Springfield a monorail in a\nclassic \"Simpsons\" episode.\n\nTo others, Sramek came across as unapologetic and arrogant, treating Solano as\nan engineering challenge instead of a real place. \"A lot of these founders and\ninvestors speak very logically,\" says Sam Houston, a Vallejo resident who was\nalso there. \"It all makes sense to them. But this is more than just logic.\nThis is where people live.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe more experienced members of Sramek's team weren't surprised by the\nbacklash. \"Having been to hundreds of community planning meetings in my\ncareer, what I have seen in Solano County is absolutely common,\" says Gabriel\nMetcalf, the head of urban planning for California Forever. \"You've got to go\nand take your lumps. You've got to be willing to make the argument.\"\n\nSramek realizes he screwed up. \"I didn't want this to be about me,\" he says.\n\"I didn't do a good job of telling the story.\" And if he can't undo the\ndamage, there may never be a California Forever. To get around the anti-\ndevelopment law Farley's committee helped pass in the 1980s, Sramek is pushing\na ballot measure that would rezone his property. He has tried to appease\nlocals by agreeing to invest in Solano's battered downtowns, and he has moved\nhis wife and two young children to the area. He's also begun playing up his\nworking-class roots. Whether Sramek has the Midas touch may, ironically, come\ndown to whether he can master the common touch.\n\nBut those moves have failed to allay the concerns of many local leaders. Rep.\nJohn Garamendi, the congressman who was worried about a Chinese government\ninvasion, still isn't on board. He says the newest version of Sramek's plan\ndoesn't account for the water and roads and schools that California Forever's\n50,000 residents will need. Like many locals, Garamendi continues to distrust\nthe larger motivations of Sramek and his Silicon Valley investors. \"What he's\ndoing is a scam,\" Garamendi says. \"He's not going to build a city. He's taking\n16,000 acres, maybe 20,000 acres, and getting it rezoned. Then he's going to\nsell that land to somebody that is a developer.\"\n\nIf California Forever has an existential problem, it's not that it's too\nambitious, or that its investors are rich hypocrites who would never trade\ntheir 10 acres in Atherton for a row house in Foreverville. It's that the\nproject, despite its lofty claims, isn't really a city. It's a glorified\nsubdivision that's designed to look and function like a city.\n\nDrawing from Jane Jacobs, Sramek and his team of urban planners have created\nan idealized version of modern urban living. There are townhouses and\naffordable condos in place of single-family homes, and cozy little coffee\nshops on the cobblestone streets, and bike paths to everywhere. There's even a\n\"warehouse district,\" a neighborhood full of the kind of buildings that, in an\norganic city, would have been repurposed from their industrial-era uses into\nartists lofts and caf\u00e9s and boutiques. Everything in California Forever is\nimagineered, a simulacrum of a city. And because it doesn't have a job base to\nspeak of, the people who live there will have to drive to and from work each\nday, just like all the other suburban commuters. Sure, they'll have bike paths\nat home. But outside of Foreverville, they'll still have to rely on highways\nto get to the real cities.\n\n> \"California Forever may be a subdivision, but it's precisely the kind of\n> subdivision America needs right now.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: California Forever may be a subdivision, but it's\nprecisely the kind of subdivision America needs right now. Rather than\nslapping up a bunch of energy-sucking McMansions or soulless lots dotted with\ncookie-cutter houses, Sramek is trying to create something that's both vibrant\nand sustainable. He may not be able to create jobs in the middle of nowhere \u2014\nbut he can create affordable housing and car-free streets and neighborhoods\nthat are friendly to commerce and community and kids. Dismiss him, if you\nwill, as another plundering, technocratic developer intent on making millions\nfor himself and his technocratic investors. But at least his blueprint for\nplundering would help solve the housing crisis and reduce inequality and\nprotect the planet.\n\nThe folks who live in nearby towns like Fairfield and Vallejo, Sramek points\nout, aren't against development in principle. After all, subdivisions are\nalready springing up on the edges of what is now Sramek's property. One of\nthose projects, One Lake, is a seemingly typical collection of houses a mile\nor so from Travis Air Force Base. The first hint that it's different is the\nblocky apartment building on the edge of town \u2014 affordable housing that was\npart of the deal to get One Lake built. The larger difference is obvious as\nsoon as Sramek drives his Tesla past the \"Welcome to One Lake\" sign. There's a\nlake \u2014 an artificial one. And on its shore is a gorgeous caf\u00e9, all glass and\nexposed wood beams, called Journey Coffee. It's a coffeehouse, maybe bigger\nand airier than one you'd find in Austin or Cambridge, but with a similar\nmenu; the seasonal special is a \"minty mocha latte.\"\n\nSramek points to One Lake, a nearby development of single-family homes,\ncondos, and affordable apartments, as proof that people want what he's\nselling. Christie Hemm Klok for BI\n\nIt's a Tuesday morning, and Journey Coffee is full. There's a half-hour wait\njust to get a bacon-and-egg sandwich. Young folks are clicking away on\nlaptops, moms are meeting on the terrace, their labradoodles greeting other\ncoffee drinkers as C-17s cruise the sky over Travis. The patrons are, visibly,\nfrom a bunch of different backgrounds. \"My wife is Indian,\" Sramek says. \"I've\nnever been to a place that has more genuine integration than Solano.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point, Sramek says, is that lots of locals in Solano would seek out what\nhe's trying to build: a dense, climate-friendly, aspirationally class-blind\ntown full of shops and schools and children. A charming place that lots of\ndifferent people can afford. But that's the tragedy of America today. Places\nlike California Forever aren't being opposed by the people who are desperate\nfor a place to live. They're being opposed by the people who already have a\nplace to live and don't want anyone else to live nearby.\n\n\"The people who have been opposed to it \u2014\" Sramek pauses, trying to choose his\nwords carefully. \"When you look at them,\" he says, \"they all look the same.\"\n\nSo who's that? Your basic white boomer NIMBY?\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, you said it,\" Sramek says. \"I'll just say it's not a\nparticularly diverse coalition in any measure. It's generally a 70-year-old\nSierra Club type. The only thing they care about is the open space behind\ntheir house.\"\n\nIt's a harsh critique \u2014 the idea that the same privilege that sent white\npeople scurrying to the suburbs a half century ago is now driving the\nopposition to affordable housing. And it's a strange argument to hear coming\nfrom a former Goldman trader and a darling of Silicon Valley. If Sramek is a\ntechnocrat trying to impose his will on the good progressive people of Solano,\nhe may well be more faithful to their ideals than they are. Yes, he's not from\naround here \u2014 just like he wasn't from London, or Zurich. But if Europe didn't\nwork out for him, well, maybe he can bring a bit of Europe to California. And\ngiven the doom loop facing American cities today, that might not be the worst\nthing.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
