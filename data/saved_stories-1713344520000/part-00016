But as fishermen approached,\nthey smelled death.\n\nInside were the decomposing bodies of more than a dozen Black men. No one knew\nwhere they were from, what brought them there, why they were aboard \u2014 and how\nor why they died. No one knew their names.\n\nWhat is clear now, but wasn\u2019t then, is this:\n\n135 days earlier, 43 people were believed to have left a port city across the\nocean in Africa.\n\nThey were trying to reach Spain\u2019s Canary Islands. But they never arrived.\n\nInstead, they ended up here, on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only ones.\n\nHalf a world away, their families were looking for them.\n\nFor nearly two years, The Associated Press assembled puzzle pieces from across\nthree continents to uncover the story of this boat \u2014 and the people it carried\nfrom hope to death.\n\nThe vessel that reached Tobago was registered in Mauritania, a large and\nmostly deserted country in northwest Africa nearly 3,000 miles (4,800 km)\naway. Evidence found on the boat \u2014 and its style and color as a typical\nMauritanian \u201cpirogue\u201d\u2014 suggested the dead were likely African migrants who\nwere trying to reach Europe but got lost in the Atlantic.\n\nIn 2021, at least seven boats appearing to be from northwest Africa washed up\nin the Caribbean and in Brazil. All carried dead bodies.\n\nThese \u201cghost boats\u201d \u2014 and likely many others that have vanished \u2014 are in part\nan unintended result of years of efforts and billions of dollars spent by\nEurope to stop crossings on the Mediterranean Sea. That crackdown, along with\nother factors such as economic disruption from the pandemic, pushed migrants\nto return to the far longer, more obscure and more dangerous Atlantic route to\nEurope from northwest Africa via the Canaries instead.\n\nArrivals on the Atlantic route jumped from 2,687 in 2019 to more than 22,000\ntwo years later, according to Spain\u2019s Interior Ministry. But for those to\narrive, many more must have departed, said Pedro V\u00e9lez, an oceanographer at\nthe Spanish Institute of Oceanography. V\u00e9lez wasn\u2019t surprised to learn of\nmigrant boats appearing in the Caribbean \u2013 that is where floating devices\ndropped by scientists on the West African coast naturally drift.\n\n\u201cThe sea conditions there are extremely harsh,\u201d he said. \u201cExtremely harsh.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, at least 1,109 people died or disappeared trying to reach the\nCanaries, according to the International Organization for Migration, the\ndeadliest on record. But that\u2019s likely a fraction of the real death toll. The\nmen in the Tobago boat, for example, are not included in this number.\n\nOther estimates are higher. Caminando Fronteras, a Spanish migrants\u2019 rights\norganization, recorded more than 4,000 dead or missing on the Atlantic route\nin 2021, with at least 20 boats vanishing after departing from Mauritania.\n\nThese migrants are as invisible in death as they were in life. But even ghosts\nhave families.\n\nThe AP investigation included interviews with dozens of relatives and friends,\nofficials and forensic experts, as well as police documents and DNA testing.\nIt found that 43 young men from Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and possibly other\nWest African nations boarded the boat. AP has identified 33 of them by name.\n\nThey departed the Mauritanian port city of Nouadhibou in the middle of the\nnight between Jan. 12 and 13, 2021. Clothing and DNA testing confirmed the\nidentity of one of the bodies, bringing closure to one family and opening the\nway for others to seek the same.\n\nThe lack of political will and global resources to identify dead and\ndisappeared migrants mean such resolutions, even partial ones, are rare. Each\nyear, thousands of families wonder about the fate of loved ones who left their\nhomes for Europe.\n\nFew ever find out.\n\nThis is the story of one boat and the people it carried from hope to death.\n\n## The Discovery\n\nOn the morning of May 28, 2021, Lance Biggart got a call from one of his\nfellow fishermen. A strange boat had appeared.\n\nThe 49-year-old Tobago native quickly reached his colleagues aboard his small\nbut speedy boat, the Big Thunder. Dozens of fishermen joined him at the scene,\nfilming the pirogue with their smartphones. Some continued fishing shiny mahi-\nmahi that had gathered around the corpses, life circling around death.\n\nBiggart remembers being puzzled by how the boat could have survived Atlantic\nswells.\n\n\u201cA wave came, and the boat rocked so, so badly,\u201d he recalls.\n\nOne of the dead men sat by the bow. The fishermen and police wondered if he\nwas the last to die, moving away from the rest of the dead in the bottom of\nthe boat. Biggart and his colleague were asked by the coast guard to tow the\npirogue back to shore. A tractor pulled the boat out of the water.\n\nMen in white overalls carefully removed 14 bodies, three skulls and other\nlarge bones one by one, placing the remains in 15 bags. Some victims were\nmissing limbs or heads. The sun had mummified some parts, while the salt and\nwater at the bottom of the boat had putrified others.\n\nRecovered from the boat were clothing, 1,000 West African CFA francs (under\n$2) and a few euros. Police also found half a dozen corroded cellphones with\nSIM cards from Mali and Mauritania. Tobago\u2019s Cyber Crime Unit extracted a\ncontact list from one of the SIMs.\n\nPolice in Trinidad and Tobago passed the numbers on to the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs, which reached out several times to the government of Mauritania. They\nnever got an answer, they said. Mauritania\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond\nto phone calls or repeated requests for comment by email from the AP.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, customers stopped buying Biggart\u2019s fish, fearing\nthe dead were victims of some sort of sorcery. Others made unfounded\nspeculations: Were they Ebola victims whose bodies had been thrown in the boat\nand set adrift?\n\nAs a man of the sea himself, Biggart felt responsible.\n\n\u201cI have a friend who went to sea and never came back,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nthe people and them. But I know the family will be hurting.\u201d\n\nYet months later, unable to identify the victims, police rebranded the\ncriminal investigation into a \u201chumanitarian\u201d case. The remains were kept at\nthe morgue of the Forensic Science Center in Trinidad.\n\nTo this day, there they sit.\n\n## A trail of clues\n\nIn 20 years as a forensic pathologist, Dr. Eslyn McDonald-Burris had never\nseen so many bodies arrive at the local mortuary in Tobago at once. Their\napparent African descent reminded her of her enslaved ancestors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of emotional for me, because I\u2019m thinking why? What is happening\nhere?\u201d asked the soft-spoken Burris, who has since retired. \u201cAnd then when I\nstarted looking at ocean currents. ... It\u2019s the same currents that they used\nwhen they brought us here.\u201d She concluded they most likely died of\n\u201cdehydration and hypothermia as a consequence of being lost at sea.\u201d\n\nOpening the body bags one by one, Burris was opening a small window into each\nperson\u2019s life. She looked for anything to help answer questions: Who were\nthey? Where were they trying to go? What happened on the boat?\n\nOne had prayer beads with a crescent and a star, Muslim symbols. Another\ncarried in his pocket a small label with Arabic writing of a water bottle from\nMauritania. Yet another wore a watch on his left wrist, still running even\nthough the time and date were wrong. \u201c5:32 Sun,\u201d it read.\n\nMost shared similar traits \u2014 \u201cthat sort of tall, slender look, long thin\nface,\u201d Burris says. Many wore several layers of clothing, common for seafaring\nmigrants. A few wore dark green weather-proof jackets and pants, typically\nused both by fishermen in West Africa and by migrants seeking to avoid\ndetection by port authorities.\n\nAs Burris pulled back the layers of clothing, she found soccer jerseys and\nshorts with the insignia of European teams as well as the Football Federation\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. One man was dressed more formally,\nwearing a black button-down shirt with thin white stripes.\n\nAnother stood out to Burris. \u201cA young man of African descent, slim build, dark\ncomplexion,\u201d her autopsy report read.\n\nHe had short, dark-brown hair. His ears were \u201cnotably very small.\" His teeth\nwere in good condition. His body was the most mummified of all, and his\nclothing was still relatively clean, suggesting he may have been one of the\nlast to die.\n\n\u201cDown here we say a \u2018sharp boy\u2019,\u201d Burris said, affectionately referring to his\nstyle.\n\nHe was found wearing distressed jeans, a Nike hoodie and a white patterned\nT-shirt underneath with some words on it \u2014 a lyric to a well-known Lionel\nRichie song.\n\nIt read: \u201cHELLO, IS IT ME YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR?\u201d\n\n## An Aunt in France\n\nThousands of miles away, in the French city of Orl\u00e9ans, May Sow had all but\ngiven up hope of finding her nephew alive.\n\nIt was mid-January 2021, and Alassane Sow, 30, wasn\u2019t answering his phone,\nleaving his family in both Mali and France desperate. May searched the\ninternet for any trace of him.\n\nA few days earlier, Alassane had told her over the phone that he was thinking\nof boarding a boat to Spain and, ultimately, to France to work, as some of his\nfriends had done. His estranged father had also left for Spain. Smugglers\ncharged 1,500 euros, and he had saved some money working as a security guard\nin Mauritania.\n\nShe thought it was a terrible idea. \u201cIt\u2019s suicide,\u201d she warned him. A family\nshe knew from the Ivory Coast was mourning a relative who died trying to reach\nEurope.\n\nAlassane said smugglers told him he would travel on a sturdy boat with a\nproper engine, not the flimsy overcrowded rubber boats often seen capsizing in\nthe Mediterranean. But even if he made it, she told him, he wouldn\u2019t be\nallowed to work legally in France.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to Paris, I see people, migrants sleeping outside, under tents,\u201d\nMay recalled.\n\nAlassane wouldn\u2019t hear of it. After all, his French family had a good life\nwith stable careers that allowed them to send money back to their Mali village\nof Melga, to support his mother.\n\nAlassane\u2019s grandparents had immigrated to France from the former colony\ndecades ago, leaving their eldest daughter, Alassane\u2019s mother, back in Mali.\nThey had six more children in France, including May.\n\nWhen May and her siblings tried to bring Alassane\u2019s mother over, she was an\nadult no longer eligible for family reunification. She applied for a visa for\nFrance eight times, only to be rejected each time.\n\nThe Sow family in France had tried to support Alassane in two projects back in\nMali, in livestock and in commerce. Both ultimately failed in part because of\nthe impact of climate change and a fragile economy in a country plagued by\nyears of conflict and political instability. The convenience store he opened\nwith their help hardly made enough money to feed his family.\n\nHe ultimately moved to Mauritania to make roughly 75 euros a month, May said.\nThat wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nMay said the \u201ckind, serious and respectful\u201d young man never asked his French\nrelatives for more money. Prosperity was in Europe, and the only way he could\nafford to get there was by boat.\n\n\u201cI think in his head, he thought he didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d May said.\n\nMay\u2019s nephew Alassane Sow\n\nOn the night between Jan. 12 and 13, 2021, he boarded a pirogue in Nouadhibou,\nMauritania, headed to Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, his family learned later.\n\nAfter the initial silence came rumors, including one that his boat had been\nstopped in Morocco and the migrants sent to prison. May contacted a Malian\ncommunity representative in Morocco to check prisons and morgues. No trace of\nAlassane.\n\nShe reached out to a page on Facebook called \u201cProtect Migrants not Borders,\u201d\nused by families of missing migrants to exchange information. That was when\nMay realized her nephew was one of thousands disappearing each year en route\nto Europe.\n\nEvery day people posted about a missing person. Few were ever found.\n\nAny tips she obtained were by word of mouth. There was no official\ninformation. She felt helpless.\n\nAlassane\u2019s mother, grandmother and wife held onto hope that he was alive,\nprobably in prison somewhere, and couldn\u2019t call. May was growing increasingly\nskeptical.\n\nOne night, she had a dream. She saw him dead with many people in the water,\nand she cried out for him.\n\nIn her nightmare, Alassane eventually opened his eyes but couldn\u2019t speak.\nAfter that, she was sure they had shipwrecked. But she had no proof.\n\nA few months later, her sister shared a news report about a Mauritanian boat\nfound in Tobago with dead bodies inside. Then an AP reporter contacted her\nasking about the same. Could her nephew be among those?\n\nHe left in January. The boat was found in May. But except for the time frame,\nthere was no evidence to suggest it was his boat. After all, the pirogues used\nby migrants departing Nouadhibou look the same.\n\n## Following the trail\n\nThe contact list extracted from one of the SIM cards on a phone in the boat by\nauthorities in Tobago contained 137 names.\n\nThe AP went down the list calling the numbers, asking those who replied if\nthey knew anyone missing. One name kept coming up: Soulayman Soumar\u00e9, a taxi\ndriver from S\u00e9libaby in southern Mauritania, near the borders with Mali and\nSenegal.\n\nThe AP traveled to S\u00e9libaby, a two-day drive from the fishing town of\nNouadhibou on a strip of tarmac that cuts through a bleak desert, and spoke to\ndozens of relatives and friends to reconstruct what happened.\n\nSoulayman had gone missing a year earlier, along with dozens of other young\nmen from nearby villages. They had taken off from Nouadhibou on a boat\ncarrying 43 people to the Canary Islands on the night of Jan. 12, 2021. It was\nthe same boat that Alassane Sow boarded.\n\nForty-seven people were meant to have boarded the boat originally. Four men\nnever got on. One, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, confirmed\nthat he and dozens of other relatives, friends and acquaintances from S\u00e9libaby\nand two nearby villages had traveled to Nouadhibou. There, they waited in\napartments arranged by smugglers. He heard more people from a town on the\nborder of Mali and Mauritania would also be getting on the boat.\n\nFinally, on Jan. 12, the smugglers called. They would be leaving for Spain\nthat night.\n\nTo avoid attracting authorities\u2019 attention, the migrants split into smaller\ngroups and left separately on different pirogues. They were to meet in the\nocean and all transfer to a larger pirogue bound for the Canaries.\n\nIn Nouadhibou, hundreds of fishermen zip in and out all day and night, and\nport authorities struggle to inspect every boat for migrants. But when they\nsaw four men allegedly going fishing without the typical dark green overalls,\npolice stopped them.\n\nLittle did they know that their lives had just been spared.\n\n## Families, still waiting\n\nJust as few people in Tobago had ever heard of Mauritania before, families in\nMauritania had never heard of Tobago. When shown the island on a map, with the\nAtlantic Ocean separating both nations, many gasped.\n\nA few miles away from S\u00e9libaby, on a dirt road dotted with goats, lies the\nvillage of Bouroudji, home to 11 of the missing young men. AP reporters shared\nthe available information with their mothers: A Mauritanian boat had drifted\nto Tobago with 14 bodies. One phone retrieved from the boat was linked to the\ngroup their sons had traveled with. There were no known survivors.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all dead,\u201d one mother exclaimed. She covered her face with her hands\nand left in despair.\n\nOthers hung onto hope. Until they saw their sons\u2019 bodies, the mothers said,\nthey could still be alive. They pulled out their cellphones and shared photos\nof their sons with AP. Among them were two young men named Bayla Niang and\nAbdoulaye Tall.\n\nNiang\u2019s father, 71-year-old Cir\u00e9 Samba Niang, said they were desperate for any\ninformation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people who say they\u2019ve died. There are people who say they are in\nprison,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are others who say, nonsense.\u201d\n\nNiang said he wasn\u2019t aware of his son\u2019s plans. He blamed local unemployment\nalong with better opportunities abroad. Many in his generation had also moved\nto Europe and made good money for Mauritanian standards.\n\n\u201cIf one goes to Europe, in one or two years they\u2019ll be able to build a house\n(in Mauritania), to buy a car,\u201d Niang said. \u201cThe other person sees that and\nsays, \u2018I can\u2019t stay here. I have to go, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nClockwise starting from the top left: Houdou Soumar\u00e9, Cheikh Dioum, Houdou and\nSoulayman with Djibi Koum\u00e9, Soulayman Soumar\u00e9. Images courtesy of the\nfamilies.\n\nIn the nearby village of Moudji, the parents of Soulayman Soumar\u00e9 and his\ncousins Houdou Soumar\u00e9 and Djibi Koum\u00e9, who had also disappeared, struggled to\nget on with their lives. One mother was severely depressed and suffering from\npanic attacks, the villagers said. \u201cYou cannot even talk because everyone is\nso upset,\u201d said Oumar Koum\u00e9, the father of Djibi Koum\u00e9.\n\nLike the mothers of Bouroudji, Koum\u00e9 asked to see the bodies found in the boat\nthat reached Tobago.\n\n\u201cIf you see someone is dead in front of you, you know it is done. But if you\ndon\u2019t see it, every day there are rumors,\u201d he said. \u201cYour heart aches.\u201d\n\nAdama Sarr\u00e9 is a 46-year-old nurse and single mother. Her 25-year-old son,\nCheikh Dioum, is among those who disappeared.\n\nAn introvert, Dioum would sometimes stay in his room for days, his mother\nsaid. He was upset, frustrated. He had repeatedly asked her for money to\ntravel to Europe. But on her meager nurse\u2019s salary, she had little to give\nhim. She advised patience. She recalled telling him: \u201cCheikh, go slowly, go\nslowly. If I work and find money, I will get you a plane ticket and you will\ngo.\u201d\n\nDioum thought she was lying, she said. He left without saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI call his phone, it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just sitting here.\u201d\n\n## A Survivor\u2019s Account\n\nWe may never know what happened to the men as they drifted from Nouadhibou to\nTobago. But accounts from survivors of other shipwrecks in the Atlantic offer\na clue.\n\nMoussa Sako was rescued by the Spanish Air Force on April 26, 2021. Their boat\nwas spotted by chance more than 310 miles (500km) from the Spanish island of\nEl Hierro \u2014 \u201cin the middle of nowhere,\u201d as one of the rescuers described it.\n\nThey had set off 22 days earlier from Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania.\nOnly three of 63 people who boarded survived.\n\nLike many on the boat, Sako, an asylum-seeker from Mali, had never seen the\nocean. Four men with maritime experience, including a Senegalese \u201ccaptain,\u201d\nwere in charge of reaching the Canaries. The voyage was to take four to five\ndays.\n\nThey were packed like sardines, with Sako squeezed in the middle. The leaking\ngasoline and salt water in the bottom of the boat burnt their skin, making it\npainful to sit.\n\nNot long after departing, they ran out of food and water. On the fourth day\nthey ran out of fuel. To slow down their drift and be more visible to\nrescuers, they made a makeshift anchor by tying the engine and other heavy\nmetal scraps to a rope.\n\nWith each day that passed, the boat drifted further. Tensions boiled into\narguments. The smugglers, some said, had betrayed them.\n\nMore days passed. No rescue came. A growing number of people wanted to cut the\nrope loose to drift faster. Sako thought they would be better off staying\nstill, where the sea was still calm and they could see some lights at night.\nBut Sako was defeated in a vote. The rope was snipped.\n\nJust as he feared, the wind took them to more agitated waters that poured over\ntheir boat. The next evening the first person died, a 20-year-old man. They\nwashed and wrapped his body in Islamic tradition and prayed before throwing it\noverboard.\n\nBy the second week, three to four people were dying every day.\n\nSome had hallucinations. One man jumped to his death thinking they had\narrived. Others jumped to end their suffering. Sako, the healthiest, tried to\nhelp the others.\n\n\u201cI had four full (layers of clothes) on me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI would take one\noff and put it on them ... until I had only one.\u201d\n\nOn day 18, he tried to get away from the rotting bodies. But they were\neverywhere. Only a handful of people were still alive. They hardly spoke.\n\nSako no longer feared death. He did worry about what would happen afterward.\n\n\u201cI wanted that even if I died, for people to recover (my body) and bury me,\u201d\nSako said. \u201cIf you disappear in the water, they can look for you for a hundred\nyears.\u201d\n\nSource: Spanish Air Force\n\nFinally, on day 22, a grey plane appeared in the sky above. Then came a\nhelicopter. A rescuer dropped down and pulled Sako and the other two survivors\nfrom the corpse-ridden pirogue.\n\nThe bodies of 24 people were recovered and buried in the Canaries with case\nnumbers instead of names. The remains of the other 36 were swallowed by the\nAtlantic.\n\n## (Partial) Answers\n\nThe number of people attempting the Atlantic crossing to the Canaries is\nfalling again as Spain and the EU, with help from their African partners, try\nto close that migration route in a constant cat-and-mouse game. But the\nreasons pushing these men, women and children to go \u2014 a lack of jobs, poverty,\nviolence, climate change \u2014 have only gotten worse.\n\nOne year after the 43 men departed Nouadhibou, the white-and-blue boat sat\nabandoned on the side of the road in Belle Garden, much like the case itself.\n\nThe clothing, objects and cellphones recovered from the boat and the bodies\nhad been kept in the back of the Scarborough police station in Tobago. Even\nthough it had been cleared for disposal, the officer in charge of storing\npolice evidence had decided to hold onto the items \u201cin case someone came\nlooking for this some day.\u201d\n\nWith latex gloves, the officer and an AP reporter cut open the sealed bags,\npulling out the decaying evidence on the concrete floor to be documented.\n\nThere were the dirty soccer jerseys and shorts of Juventus, Paris St-Germain,\nBarcelona, Real Madrid and The Football Federation of Mauritania that Burris\nhad noted in her autopsy reports. There were the dark green weatherproof coats\nand pants so many migrants wear during the crossing. There were the\ncellphones, so worn out that the devices fell apart at the slightest touch.\n\nAfter days analyzing photos of the evidence like a puzzle, one T-shirt seemed\nfamiliar. In a photo shared by one of the mothers from the Mauritanian village\nof Bourdouji, 20-year-old Abdoulaye Tall is seen wearing a colorful T-shirt\nwith words on it, but only parts of it were visible: \u201cIS IT ... E ... YOU\u2019RE.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, it came into focus. He was wearing the shirt that had struck Dr.\nBurris: \u201cHELLO, IS IT ME YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR?\u201d\n\nThe AP shared its finding, along with photos of the T-shirt, with Tall\u2019s\nfather. He said he was grateful for the information, even though it shattered\nhis hopes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious he\u2019s dead,\u201d Djibi Tall said. \u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nThe AP also shared photos of the evidence collected in Tobago with other\nfamilies of the missing in Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and France.\n\nMay Sow, the aunt in France, stared at the photos on her phone for days and\nstayed up late at night. One photo looked familiar: a black striped button-\ndown shirt.\n\nShe went back to photos of her nephew from shortly before he disappeared.\nThere it was \u2014 the same black striped shirt. He wore it on special occasions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they had the right to bring things with them, so he must have\nworn his best clothes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe reached out to one of Alassane\u2019s friends in Mauritania who had accompanied\nhim on the first part of the journey to the boat. He confirmed that Alassane\nhad worn the striped shirt underneath a jacket with red pockets. Both were\nfound on one of the bodies.\n\nMay Sow was already mourning the loss of her nephew, but her sister was still\nin denial. Sow reached out to the Red Cross in Senegal for help with a DNA\ntest to confirm. But because Alassane\u2019s mother was from Mali, they couldn\u2019t\nhelp.\n\nSo in late June, the AP got a saliva sample sent from Alassane\u2019s mother to the\nForensics Science Center in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThree months later, on Oct. 4, 2022, an email arrived in May Sow\u2019s inbox.\n\n\u201cI regret to inform that the DNA sample result is a positive match.\u201d\n\n## Epilogue\n\nAlassane was buried after an Islamic funeral on March 3, 2023, at the\nChaguanas Public Cemetery in Trinidad and Tobago. His family, unable to\ntravel, held prayers in both his hometown in Mali and in France.\n\nOf the 43 people believed to have boarded Alassane\u2019s boat, only 14 bodies and\nskeletal remains were found in Tobago. The Red Cross has collected 51 DNA\nsamples from family members of 26 missing migrants in hopes of identifying the\nother bodies at the Forensic Science Center in Trinidad. Those results aren\u2019t\nyet known.\n\nSome things are, in the end, unknowable.
