Image credit: Sengupta et al., doi:\n10.1186/s40168-024-01777-1.\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human\nachievement in space exploration.\n\nDespite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity,\nincreased carbon dioxide levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms\noccupy a unique niche.\n\nThese microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health\nand well-being of astronauts on board.\n\nOne microorganism of particular interest is Enterobacter bugandensis, a Gram-\nnegative bacterium notorious for being multi-drug resistant.\n\n\u201cMicroorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of\ninhabitants,\u201d said senior author Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran from NASA\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory and colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe ISS, a highly controlled built environment harboring extreme conditions\nsuch as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated carbon dioxide levels\nlevels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity\ncan acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations\nand horizontal gene transfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cProlonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts\u2019\nimmune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts\u2019\nmicrobiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, understanding microbial colonization, succession, and interactions is\npivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in\nisolated and confined human habitats.\u201d\n\nIn their new study, the authors analyzed thirteen strains of Enterobacter\nbugandensis isolated from the ISS.\n\nTheir results indicate that under stress, these strains were mutated and\nbecame genetically and functionally distinct compared to their Earth\ncounterparts.\n\nThe strains were able to viably persist on the ISS over time with a\nsignificant abundance.\n\nThey coexisted with multiple other microorganisms, and in some cases could\nhave helped those organisms survive.\n\n\u201cOur comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions\nsculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the\npotential dominance and succession of Enterobacter bugandensis within the ISS\nenvironment,\u201d the researchers said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of these findings are twofold,\u201d they added.\n\n\u201cFirstly, they shed light on microbial behavior, adaptation, and evolution in\nextreme, isolated environments.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring\nthe health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with\npotential pathogenic threats.\u201d\n\nThe findings appear in the journal Microbiome.\n\n_____\n\nP.
