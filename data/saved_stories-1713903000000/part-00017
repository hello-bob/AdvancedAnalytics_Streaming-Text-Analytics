There will also be\nheadsets that are designed to be as light as possible at the expense of\nperformance for productivity and exercise uses. And there will be gaming-\noriented ones.\n\nThe announcement named three partners to start. Asus will produce a gaming\nheadset under its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand, Lenovo will make general\npurpose headsets with an emphasize on \"productivity, learning, and\nentertainment,\" and Xbox and Meta will team up to deliver a special edition of\nthe Meta Quest that will come bundled with an Xbox controller and Xbox Cloud\nGaming and Game Pass.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nI worked exclusively in Vision Pro for a week\u2014here\u2019s how it went\n\nUsers running Horizon OS devices from different manufacturers will be able to\nstay connected in the operating system's social layer of \"identities, avatars,\nsocial graphs, and friend groups\" and will be able to enjoy shared virtual\nspaces together across devices.\n\nThe announcement comes after Meta became an early leader in the relatively\nsmall but interesting consumer mixed reality space but with diminishing\nreturns on new devices as the market saturates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, Apple recently entered the fray with its Vision Pro headset. The\nVision Pro is not really a direct competitor to Meta's Quest devices\ntoday\u2014it's far more expensive and loaded with higher-end tech\u2014but it may only\nbe the opening volley in a long competition between the companies.\n\nMeta's decision to make Horizon OS a more open platform for partner OEMs in\nthe face of Apple's usual focus on owning and integrating as much of the\nsoftware, hardware, and services in its devices as it can mirrors the\nsmartphone market. There, Google's Android (on which Horizon OS is based) runs\non a variety of devices from a wide range of companies, while Apple's iOS runs\nonly on Apple's own iPhones.\n\nMeta also says it is working on a new spatial app framework to make it easier\nfor developers with experience on mobile to start making mixed reality apps\nfor Horizon OS and that it will start \"removing the barriers between the Meta\nHorizon Store and App Lab, which lets any developer who meets basic technical\nand content requirements release software on the platform.\"\n\nPricing, specs, and release dates have not been announced for any of the new\ndevices. Zuckerberg admitted it's \"probably going to take a couple of years\"\nfor this ecosystem of hardware devices to roll out.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n88\n\nSamuel Axon Samuel is a senior editor at Ars Technica.
