The human use of petroleum is ancient, and may (for all we know)\ndate well into pre-history. In the form found most often in nature, as thick\npools of bituminous tar, this sticky, potentially flammable substance found\nuse as a caulk, an embalming fluid, a lubricant, a weapon of war, and a\nmedicine. Another source of petroleum, less widely exploited but also known\nfor centuries, were oil seeps, where liquid petroleum emerged from the ground.\nOil Creek, Pennsylvania, was named after the substance that tended to pool\nalong its edge, and its skimmings were sold as a cure-all at least as far back\nas the eighteenth century. But until the middle of the nineteenth century,\npetroleum was never used extensively as a fuel source for heat or light.[1]\n\n## Petroleum: A Product in Search of Solutions\n\nWhy did it take so long for this substance, the load-bearing keystone of the\nindustrial society of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, to be tapped\nfor its energy? There were several obstacles. The first was chemical: it was\nnot obvious how to extract a useful fuel from raw petroleum, and the chemical\nknowledge and techniques needed to guide this distillation did not emerge\nuntil the nineteenth century. The second obstacle was industrial: to refine\npetroleum in a laboratory was one thing, to do it at the scale needed to\ncreate a national or global market was another. The final obstacle was\nlogistical: tar (or bitumen, or asphalt) was heavy (it had to be mined, not\npumped), and difficult to process. Oil appeared at the surface in fairly small\nquantities, and there was no obvious reason to believe, given geological\nknowledge at the time, that it represented leakage from a large, liquid\nreservoir below, nor were there obvious means to access such a reservoir if it\nexisted.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century the tools were at hand in North America and\nEurope to overcome all of these obstacles, given enough effort. Europeans had\nbegun constructing large-scale chemical manufacturing plants, primarily for\nthe making of soda, earlier in the century. Around 1860, the chemical industry\nbegan a massive expansion into synthetic organic compounds, primarily dyes\nextracted from the tarry residue left over after cooking coal to make\nilluminating gas. Chemical knowledge advanced rapidly over this same period,\nin part because of its increasing commercial value. Meanwhile, salt miners had\ncreated the boring machinery needed for drilling deep into the earth, which\nthey used to extract subsurface brine.[2]\n\nBut a reason was still needed to put in the effort to apply these tools. The\nreason, as it turned out was a simple enough one: the ancient incantation of\n\u201clet there be light.\u201d As we have already seen, the nineteenth-century had\nbrought forth an ever-growing demand for illumination. Modernity, with its\ncontempt for the rhythms of nature, had taken a firm hold in the culture of\nEurope and North America. Town gas had brought on-demand light to urban public\nspaces and townhouses, but even the poor and those living far from the bustle\nof cities no longer accepted that the setting of the sun must mean the end of\nthe day\u2019s work and leisure, nor was the feeble light of a candle deemed good\nenough any longer.\n\nWhale oil was the premium-grade illuminating fluid of the time. It gave off a\nclean, bright light, but it cost as much as $2.50 a gallon in the United\nStates. With the remaining whales disappearing from every corner of the oceans\nunder the harpoon thrusts of a hundred Ahabs, prices could only be expected to\nrise. Lamps burning animal fat or vegetable oil could serve if nothing else\nwas available, but the most popular cheap substitute, at only 50 cents per\ngallon, was camphene, made from tree resin and alcohol. Volatile camphene,\nhowever, burned all to readily, bringing with it the risk of deadly fires or\neven explosions. It also had a rather unpleasant odor.[3]\n\nFigure 56: Typical nineteenth-century oil lamps. The glass reservoir above the\nbase held the oil while the chimney kept the flame tall and protected from\ndrafts. [National Parks Service, Gateway Arch]\n\nAbraham Gesner, a Canadian doctor and amateur geologist and chemist, was the\nfirst to figure out how to turn petroleum into a useful source of light. In\n1849, he distilled a coal oil from bitumen that came from a huge lake of tar\nin Trinidad. He dubbed the oil kerosene: \u201ckeros\u201d from wax (because of its wax-\nlike solid form) and \u201c-ene\u201d to invoke the familiar camphene. Within a decade,\nhe had set up a plant in New York making five thousand gallons of his\nilluminating oil a day, in competition with dozens of other companies making\nsimilar products.[4]\n\nBut tar-based illuminants were always limited by the difficulty of extracting\nand transporting the heavy raw material from its limited, often remote, origin\nsites. A group of northeastern businessmen led by George Bissell, a New York\nlawyer and man of all parts, became convinced that liquid rock oil would solve\nthis problem and provide an alternative to whale oil of equal quality at a\nmuch lower price. So it was that Oil Creek became the epicenter for an eastern\nGold Rush. Bissell and his colleagues convinced Yale chemist Benjamin Silliman\nto have a crack at distilling the oozings of Oil Creek into an effective\nlighting source, a feat he accomplished in 1855. It took a further four years\nfor the group to hit paydirt at Oil Creek, drilling down seventy feet through\nbedrock with the same techniques used to bore for salt water. Then, finally,\nthe oil boom was on.[5]\n\nThe Drake well near Oil Creek in 1859. From Ida Tarbell, History of the\nStandard Oil Company.\n\nThe illuminant that Silliman had extracted from raw oil also acquired the name\nkerosene, due to its similarity to Gesner\u2019s tar extract. It provided a\ncheaper, cleaner, and brighter alternative to whale oil. During the 1860s, an\nentire industry emerged to extract, transport, and burn this kerosene, and in\nthe 1870s it came under the increasing domination of John Rockefeller\u2019s\nStandard Oil. Then came electric light: a potential threat to the illuminating\noil business, just as it was to the illuminating gas business. As long as it\nremained confined to dense town centers, electricity was more of a problem for\ngas than kerosene, given the latter\u2019s advantage in portability. But the advent\nof long-distance electrical transmission around the turn of the century\nchanged matters. It would take huge capital investments over many years to\nbring electricity to every town in the richer parts of the world, but it was\nonly a matter of time. The oil magnates were on the lookout for a new kind of\nbuyer for their product, before electric light relegated it to a niche fuel,\nuseful only to the most rural and remote customers.[6]\n\n## Petroleum and Internal Combustion: Symbiosis\n\nConveniently, while the extractors and refiners of petroleum were looking for\nnew buyers for their product, makers of combustion engines were looking to\npetroleum for a new source of fuel. Illuminating gas made for a convenient\nfuel supply in towns with the infrastructure for piping gas already in place,\nbut as long as their engines depended on it, they could not make sales to more\nrural workshops.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a combustion engine, requiring neither firebox, nor boiler, nor\nwater tank, had great potential as a lightweight motor for a moving vehicle:\nit could finally make practical the dream of the self-propelled carriage, a\ndream dreamed since the time of Nicolas Cugnot and even earlier, but which no\none had been able to realize using bulky steam engines.\n\nAttempts to use more portable liquid fuels began in the 1870s: reliable,\nfamiliar kerosene was one possibility. But even more attractive was a volatile\nnewcomer, gasoline: a light distillate of petroleum which as of yet had little\ncommercial value. A liquid hydrocarbon fuel had to be mixed with air before\nputting into the cylinder, a process called carburetion, and lighter gasoline\nvaporized and carbureted more readily than heavier fuels. Several effective\ngasoline carburetors were invented in the mid-1880s at Deutz (home of the Otto\nengines), Karl Benz\u2019s Benz & Cie, and the new workshop of Daimler and Maybach,\nwho left Deutz together in 1882 to pursue the design of small, portable\nengines.[7]\n\nDaimler and Maybach wanted to create a general-purpose light engine that could\nbe used equally well in a workshop or a mobile vehicle. To do this, they\nneeded to generate more horsepower with less weight than a typical stationary\nengine, and the easiest way to do that was to turn the engine faster,\ngenerating far more rotations-per-minute (rpm) (a typical Otto engine would\nrun at 100 rpm or less). This, in turn, required a new ignition mechanism: the\ntypical engine of the time used an ignition flame, re-lit on each cycle of the\nengine from a permanent pilot light, then snuffed out again. This mechanical\nprocess was too slow for the speeds Daimler and Maybach wanted, so their\nStanduhr engine (so-called because it resembled an upright pendulum clock)\ninstead used a hot tube of metal that protruded into cylinder for ignition. A\nflame outside the cylinder kept the tube at the right temperature to ignite\nthe fuel-air mixture at the desired point in the compression stroke (the more\ncompressedthe mixture, the more easily it ignited). With a hot tube, surface\ncarburetor and water cooling, the Standuhr reached 650 rpms. One could be\nfound putting about Daimler\u2019s property in September 1886 mounted to a\ncarriage, providing, aptly, about one horsepower.[8]\n\nThe Daimler Standuhr engine at the Mercedes-Benz Museum [morio / CC BY-SA 3.0\nDEED].\n\nBenz, on the other hand, set out to make a vehicle designed from start to\nfinish a motor car, with a bicycle frame as the basis for the chassis, and a\nnew engine custom-designed for the vehicle. He used electric rather than hot-\ntube ignition: a safer approach than the hot tube and with the potential for\nmore precise control, but finnicky with the battery technology available at\nthe time. He did not achieve the same engine speeds as Daimler, but also made\na working vehicle.[9]\n\nOver the following years, Daimler, Benz, and other inventors (primarily in\nGermany, France, Britain, and the U.S.) steadily refined combustion automobile\ndesign, borrowing features from both the Daimler and Benz traditions and\nmaking many other design refinements (including improvements that made\nelectrical ignition much more reliable) to produce something recognizable as\nthe template for the modern automobile by about 1900. This new market for\npetroleum as a vehicle fuelrather than a light source was small, but\npromising, and poised to grow (dare I say it) explosively in the following\ndecades.\n\nThe 1901 Daimler \u201cMercedes\u201d, typically taken as the common ancestor of the\nmodern automobile.\n\n## Diesel\n\nGasoline engines created a new market for light, self-powered\nvehicles\u2014automobiles and later aircraft\u2014but did not supplant steam engines in\nthe role of pulling heavy loads on steamships and locomotives. It was another\ngenus of combustion engines that would snuff out the nimbus of steam that had\nshrouded ports and train stations throughout the nineteenth century.\n\nThe fire piston, a simple but ingenious fire-starting device, was used in\nSoutheast Asia and the surrounding islands for centuries\u2014no one knows exactly\nhow long. It consists of a hollow wooden cylinder into which a matching piston\ncan be snugly fitted. The piston contains a small niche at the end to hold\nflammable tinder. When forced rapidly into the cylinder, the compression of\nthe air will heat it up rapidly, igniting the tinder. Fire pistons were found\nacross Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, and were often used, like Volta\u2019s\nelectric pistol, in scientific demonstrations. The principle of their\noperation provided the foundation for this new genus of combustion engine, the\nkind we now know after the name of its inventor, Rudolf Diesel.[10]\n\nA collection of fire pistons from various parts of Asia. From Henry Balfour,\n\u201cThe Fire-Piston\u201d in Anthropological Essays Presented to Edward Burnett Tylor\nin Honour of his 75^th Birthday (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907), plate II.\n\nDiesel had a peripatetic childhood: born in 1858 in Paris to parents from\nAugsburg in Bavaria, briefly exiled to London due to the anti-German feelings\nsparked by the Franco-Prussian War, he returned with his family to Paris, then\nmoved in with cousins in Augsburg in 1873, where he enrolled in an industrial\nhigh school. It was likely at Augsburg that Diesel witnessed a demonstration\nof a fire piston with glass walls, exposing the magic moment of ignition. Did\nthe sight of this spark kindle the concept for a new kind of engine deep in\nthe recesses of young Diesels\u2019 mind? It\u2019s unlikely: he did not create his\nfamous engine for another twenty years. But he remembered the event well\nenough, and considered it important enough, to relate it to his children years\nlater.[11]\n\nAfter completing his schooling at Augsburg, Diesel moved on to study\nengineering at Munich\u2019sPolytechnic School (founded by the \u201cMad\u201d king Ludwig\nII, and now known as the Technical University of Munich). There he was\ndisgusted to learn how thermodynamically inefficient were the steam engines\nthat powered industrial society; he became fascinated by Carnot and wondered\nhow to replicate a perfect Carnot heat engine, to convert the heat from coal\ndirectly into work \u201cwithout intermediaries.\u201d He also met an important mentor,\nCarl von Linde, a mechanical engineering professor with a sideline in\nrefrigeration machines.[12]\n\nAfter college, with the aid of his mentor, Diesel entered the refrigeration\nbusiness; he worked in France throughout the 1880s, selling refrigeration\nequipment and patenting his own ice-making machines, while toiling away at his\nsolution to the heat engine puzzle. Another victim of the seductive reasoning\nthat the problem with the steam engine was steam, Diesel was building an\nengine that would use ammonia for its working fluid instead. He presented his\ncreation at the Exposition Universelle of 1889, in the shadow of Eiffel\u2019s\ngrand new tower. No great acclaim followed; this was not the Diesel engine\nthat we know today. The exposition also marked the end to his life in France;\nwith anti-German sentiment on the rise again, Diesel moved to Berlin in\n1890.[13]\n\nAt the same exhibition Diesel could have seen Benz\u2019 three-wheeled Patent-\nMotorwagen and Daimler and Maybach\u2019s Standuhr engine. Perhaps it is no\ncoincidence then, that around this time he abandoned his ammonia engine and\ndeveloped the idea for a new kind of internal combustion engine, one that\nwould achieve new heights of efficiency through \u201cthe extreme compression of\nordinary air.\u201d How would it work? His goal was to achieve an ideal Carnot\ncycle by maintaining constant temperature in the chamber throughout\ncombustion. His conceptual four-stroke engine would compress air to an\nastonishing 250 atmospheres, driving the temperature up to 900 degrees\nCelsius. The fuel could not be premixed with the air in the chamber, as in the\ngasoline engine, because it would then ignite too early. Instead, he would\nthen inject the fuel just as the piston reached dead center in its compressing\ncycle. The fuel would then ignite immediately like the kindling in a fire\npiston, driving the piston backward, and giving up all of its heat to\nexpanding the air back to its original volume, without any waste lost to the\nwalls. Diesel filed for a patent on this idea in 1892.[14]\n\nThe problem was the 250 atmospheres. This was, to his contemporaries, an\nabsurd figure; as one Diesel biographer points out, \u201c[a]s far as was known in\n1892, pressures of that magnitude had only occurred in volcanoes and bombs.\u201d\nDiesel expected to rely on help constructing his engine from his good friend\nHeinrich Buz, head of the Bavarian manufacturing plant Maschinenfabrik\nAugsburg, but Buz would have nothing to do with it until Diesel agreed to\nreduce his pressure requirement to about forty atmospheres, at which point Buz\nagreed to build an experimental engine.[15]\n\nIt took Diesel and his colleagues at Maschinenfabrik Augsburg two years to get\nthis experimental engine to run for a full minute straight, and a further\nthree years (until early 1897), to get a really useable engine. The greatest\nengineering challenge was the fuel injector, which had to add just the right\namount of fuel at just the right time within a window of less than one\nhundredth of a second, into a cylinder pushing back on the injector at far\nhigher than atmospheric pressure. Gasoline would not do as a fuel for diesel\nengines because it would begin combustion too early: its volatility, an asset\nfor easy mixing with air in an Otto engine, became a liability. Kerosene and\nother heavier oils worked well, vegetable oils and even coal dust were\nconsidered as alternatives.[16]\n\nDiesel\u2019s 1894 engine, which ran for one minute straight [Tila Monto / CC BY-SA\n3.0 DEED].\n\nThe 1897 engine was not the ideal heat engine that Diesel had first dreamed\nof, but at 26% efficiency (including both heat and mechanical losses), it\nsurpassed any of its competitors: a typical Otto gasoline engine sat at around\n15%. Because of the need to withstand high pressures in the chamber and for a\nseparate pump to supply the fuel injector, it was heavy and bulky compared to\nOtto-style engines, but its enormous compression ratios allowed it produce\nhigh power output at low rpms, a valuable feature for overcoming momentum when\nstarting heavy machinery or pulling a large load from a standstill. Over the\nlong run Diesel engines would also prove more durable and reliable than their\ngasoline counterparts.[17]\n\nDiesel and Buz now had something much closer to a marketable engine, and they\nsoon had licensing agreements for construction of engines in Scotland, France,\nand Germany \u2013 including an agreement with Deutz, the leaders of the German\ninternal combustion market. Adolphus Busch, the St. Louis beer magnate,\nacquired the exclusive rights to make Diesels in the United States for one\nmillion German marks, while Emmanuel Nobel (nephew of Alfred), acquired\nsimilar rights in \u201call the Russias\u201d for 800,000 marks.[18]\n\nThe German cruiser Deutschland (sometimes called a pocket battleship),\ncommissioned in 1933, was the first large warship powered by diesels.\n\nBecause their high compression ratios created high torque at low rpms, diesel\nengines became the engine of choice for heavy-duty applications: ships,\ntractors, electrical power (Kiev used diesel for its streetcar system) and\neventually trains. Each application brought its own challenges which required\nnew inventive creativity to overcome: the size and weight of the early diesel\nengines, for example, as well as the inability to put them in reverse, made\nthem unsuitable for shipboard use; while diesel-electric locomotives (which\nused electric motors powered by diesel-supplied electricity), overcame the\ncomplex mechanical transmission problems of bringing direct diesel power to\nall the wheels of the locomotive. It would fall to other men than Diesel to\novercome these obstacles, allowing the diesel to continue to scale up in power\nand find new uses over the decades. In 1911, the Swiss manufacturing firm\nWinterthur built a diesel with a cylinder one-meter across that generated\nabout 2,000 horsepower. The following year, the ten-thousand-ton diesel-\npowered Danish freighter Selandia debuted to great success, \u201c...carrying cargo\nfaster, farther, and cleaner than steam-powered freighters, on less fuel and\nwithout any stops for bunkering.\u201d In 1934, the Pioneer Zephyr achieved a new\nrecord time on the Denver-to-Chicago run under diesel-electric power, at an\naverage speed of seventy-seven miles per hour.[19]\n\nDiesel at Thomas Edison\u2019s West Orange, New Jersey lab in 1912, looking rather\nstiff. [U.S. National Park Service]\n\nThe later life of Diesel the man was less happy than that of his engine. A\nproud inventor, he was stung by the withering critiques of engineers who\nemphasized how little he had contributed to the creation of the diesel engine\nin its many useful forms. Profligate with money, he seemed compelled to live\nas if his means were inexhaustible rather than merely substantial. A pacifist,\nhe was disturbed by the growing bellicosity of the European powers in the\nopening years of the twentieth century. Among his friends, Diesel could count\nCharles Parsons of steam turbine fame. While they dined together at Diesel\u2019s\nhome in June 1913, \u201c...56,000 kilowatt Parsons turbines were being built into\nthe five British battleships of the Queen Elizabeth class...and pairs of\nultralight 1250-kilowatt Diesel engines were being installed in the\nUnterseebooten U-19 to U-23, the first Diesel-powered submarines of the German\nNavy.\u201d Several months later, at age 55, a broke and broken Diesel hurled\nhimself mid-sea from the deck of the steamer Dresden.[20]\n\n## Gas Turbines\n\nBy the end of the first third of the twentieth century, things looked\nincreasingly grim for the age of steam. Having been upstaged by gasoline\nengines in the new markets for cars, trucks, and aircraft, been supplanted in\nthe low-end of the power spectrum by easy-to-use combustion engines, and with\nits remaining share of train and sea-power steadily eroding, steam had one\nlast, unconquered bastion. The sources of electric power remained dominated by\na mix of coal-fueled steam and hydroelectric. Up through the 1930s, they more-\nor-less split global electrical production between them, with coal tending to\ntake the larger share.[21]\n\nBut combustion held one last insult to inflict upon steam, albeit a long-\ndelayed one. A side effect of petroleum extraction operations was the emission\nof large quantities of hydrocarbon gas, called natural gas in contrast to the\nlongstanding synthetic coal gas industry. In a sense it was the lightest\npetroleum distillate of all, pre-separated in the bowels of the earth and\nreleased from the borehole like an enormous, long-held flatulation.\n\nLike other forms of flatulence, natural gas was mostly treated by the\npetroleum industry as an undesirable embarrassment. But by the 1880s, pipeline\ntechnology became good enough to bring gas from wells to nearby cities, where\nit could provide light and heat with a cleaner burn and more energy density\nthan coal gas. During the early U.S. petroleum boom in Appalachia and the\nMidwest, natural gas supply came to Pittsburgh, from the Haymaker well about\ntwenty miles east of the city. Originally drilled in search of oil, the\nHaymaker had been left abandoned and burning for four years before being tamed\nand tapped. Natural gas came to Chicago from the wells to the southeast that\ngave Gas City, Indiana its name. Then, after coming, the gas went again, as\nthese northern gas fields ran dry.[22]\n\nThe situation changed radically when the second American oil and gas boom took\noff in the Southwest in the early twentieth century. Prospectors found\ntrillions of cubic feet of natural gas beneath their feet in Louisiana and\nTexas. This created a huge imbalance in supply and demand between southern\nproducers, \u201cflaring or simply venting into the atmosphere hundreds of millions\nof cubic feet per day of natural gas\u201d and northern cities eager for a clean,\ncheap source of heat.[23]\n\nHuge investments of capital in the 1920s and 30s would finally rectify that\nimbalance. A group of investors, including Samuel Insull, best known as the\nczar of Chicago\u2019s electrical system, pooled their resources to build a massive\npipeline from Texas to Chicago. Nearly a thousand miles long and two feet in\ndiameter, it could carry gas at a rate of 210 million cubic feet per day, ten\ntimes the capacity of the defunct lines that had once supplied Chicago from\nthe Indiana gas fields. The newly developed technique of electrical resistance\nwelding made the line feasible by fusing the sections of pipe together without\nany seam, allowing it to carry the gas under high pressure without\nleakage.[24]\n\nThe \u201cBig Inch\u201d pipeline, originally built to bring oil from Texas to the\nnortheastern U.S. during World War II, was later converted to natural gas.\n\nThat was all very well for chilly Midwesterners, but it was nothing to concern\nsteam. Some areas of the Southwest burned gas instead of oil or coal in their\nelectric plants\u2014why not, when it was so abundant\u2014but that was just another way\nto make steam.[25] But, as we know, gas could be burned inside an engine, too,\nand a new, very efficient and powerful kind of internal combustion engine was\njust about to come onto the scene.\n\nGiven that waterwheels had to make room for water turbines, and steam pistons\nfor steam turbines, the appearance of internal combustion turbines (typically\nknown as gas turbines, though they may burn liquid fuels) has the air of\ninevitability. The idea had a long, difficult gestation, however, in large\npart of because of the continuous high temperatures to which the moving parts\nwere exposed, which could be withstood only be new heat-tolerant alloys. The\nbasic idea is to burn fuel continuously within the turbine, and use the hot\ngas that resulted, rather than steam, to spin the turbine blades and provide\npower. Some heat is also drawn off to drive a compressor that continuously\npushes fresh air into the chamber for combustion.\n\nA few stationary power turbines were built in the early part of the twentieth\ncentury, primarily in Switzerland, but gas turbine technology got a massive\nboost from the intensified development of aeroengines before and during World\nWar II. In the 1930s, both Frank Whittle in Britain and Hans-Joachim von Ohain\nin Germany designed experimental jet engines (which exhausted the hot gas\ndirectly for thrust instead of driving an axle) for combat aircraft, and a\nGerman jet engine saw combat on the Messerschmitt Me262 fighter. American\nengineers, meanwhile, gained experience in high-performance gas compressors by\ndesigning superchargers to enable piston-driven aircraft such as the P-47 and\nP-51 fighters to operate efficiently at high altitude.[26]\n\nNeuchatel of Switzerland\u2019s experimental gas turbine on exhibit in 1939.\n\nIt took still more decades for stationary turbine technology to develop to the\npoint where electricity generated by gas turbines became commonplace. Demand\nfor gas power plants has grown over the decades since, fueled by environmental\nconcerns (gas burns much more cleanly than coal and produces less carbon\ndioxide) and the need for excess capacity to respond to demand spikes (gas\nplants can be turned on quickly since they don\u2019t need to build up a head of\nsteam). The share of global electricity production claimed by gas rose from\n13% to 24% between 1971 and 2019.[27]\n\n## The Twilight of Steam\n\nSteam is still with us: roughly half of the electricity generated world-wide\nis still mediated by steam, whether generated by coal, nuclear power, or\noil.[28] Most modern natural gas plants also use steam in a secondary role:\nthey run the still-hot gas turbine exhaust through a steam-powered turbine in\norder to maximize the overall efficiency of the plant. A few warships still\nprowl the world\u2019s oceans under a head of steam generated by nuclear fission,\nwhich allows them to stay on station for months without any local fuel source.\n\nBut the meaning and influence of steam in our economy, society, and culture\nhave altogether diminished. No twenty-first century Edward Ellis will write of\na \u201cSteam Man of the Prairies\u201d (1868) marching across the American West, nor a\ntwenty-first century Verne of a Steam House (1880) puffing around India, nor\natwenty-first century Wells of steam-powered \u201cLand Ironclads\u201d (1903) crawling\nover the battlefields of Europe. Visions of a steam-powered tomorrow now exist\nonly at a second level of remove, not as something imagined in our future, but\nas something imagined in a future of the past, within the kitschy sub-genre of\nsteampunk.\n\nSteam did not decline all at once; a gradual process saw it shunted from\nforeground to background. Around the turn of the twentieth century, many\nwriters wrote of the time in which they lived as an age of steam, though some\nbelieved it was in the process of being supplanted by an age of\nelectricity.[29] As late as 1938, Henry Dickinson\u2019s A Short History of the\nSteam Engine gives off no overtones of valediction or mourning. One leaves the\nbook, after a discussion of contemporary improvements in turbines and boilers,\nwith the sense that steam power is still on an upward trajectory.\n\nNot long after that, an American G.I. headed to Operation Torch in North\nAfrica in the fall of 1942 would have experienced a hybrid world. He might\nhave ridden a train pulled by steam locomotive to his port of departure and\nboarded a Liberty ship powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. But he\nwould have crossed an ocean prowled by diesel-powered U-boats, and would have\nmounted a two-and-a-half-ton truck to move forward with his unit, or taken up\na crew station on an M4 Sherman tank, both vehicles equipped with gasoline\nengines. This is to be expected. The diffusion of new technologies is always\ngradual and, to some degree, incomplete. At this same time, the German army of\nthe blitzkrieg could boast a spearhead of gleaming motorized divisions, but\nrelied on old-fashioned horse-drawn wagons and carts for the rest.[30]\n\nCertainly, by the 1960s, however, the age of steam had taken up decisive\nresidence in the past, a historical era on which one looked back fondly,\nrather than a description of a present reality.[31] Google\u2019s Ngram viewer\ntraces its decline from vital concept to historical reminiscence quite\nvividly:\n\nWhat can we say, in closing, about the age of steam? What was it, exactly, and\nwhat did it mean? Each of the aspects of the age of steam that we have\nvisited\u2014the pumping engine, the factory prime mover, the steamboat and\nsteamship, the locomotive, the electric power\u2014share a common theme, and that\ntheme is modernity, and specifically the unhitching of mankind from the wagon\nof Earth\u2019s natural, cyclical processes: day and night, summer and winter, wind\nand calm, sun and rain.\n\nWe cannot, of course, lay all of modernity at the feet of steam. The\nindustrial revolution began under water power, and would probably have\ncontinued to develop in a quite similar direction for some time without steam.\nAll of the political, social, and cultural features that we associate with the\nmodern world (nationalism, individualism, secularization, and so on) have no\nobvious connection to steam power, and can be traced to antecedents dating\ncenturies before steam power took off.\n\nBut steam power changed humanity\u2019s relationship to the world in a profound\nsense. Almost all of the useful energy humans encounter comes, one way or\nanother, from the light of the sun: the plants it feeds, the rain that it\nlifts into the sky, the wind that it drives across the plains. We must wait\npatiently for this bounty to grow, to fall, to blow. The age of steam refused\nto wait, borrowing instead from the banked solar energy of the past, stored\nbeneath the earth in the form of coal, to get power on demand, at will. The\npetroleum age of internal combustion that succeeded steam was simply an\nextension and intensification of this process; we should perhaps speak of a\nsingle age, an age of fossil fuels.\n\nJevons\u2019 paradox, formulated by the economist William Jevons in 1865, captures\nthe impatient, spendthrift spirit of the age. Concerned about the future\nexhaustion of Britain\u2019s reserves of coal, he noted that the obvious solution\nof making more efficient machinery would have the opposite of the intended\neffect: the less coal steam engines consumed for a given amount of work, the\nmore useful coal became, and so the more of it the British nation pulled out\nof the earth to burn: \u201cIt is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the\neconomical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very\ncontrary is the truth.\u201d[32]\n\nNow, awakening to the full implications of borrowing from the past with no\nintent to repay, and thus releasing all of Earth\u2019s long-buried carbon into the\nopen, humanity is embarked on a new quest, to supply our needs by more\ncompletely and effectively capturing the solar energy of today: renewable\nenergy, that will come again tomorrow and the next day as long as the sun\ncontinues to shine. We want, we hope, to somehow give up our dependence on\nborrowing from the past, without giving up all the hard-won conveniences of\nthe steam age.
