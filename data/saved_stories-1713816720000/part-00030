While this study and other observational studies have also found\nthis association, it doesn't prove that these drugs cause dementia. But we do\nknow that anticholinergic drugs can cause confusion and increase fall risk in\nolder people.\n\nAnticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine. This substance\ntransmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is\ninvolved in learning and memory. In the rest of the body, it stimulates muscle\ncontractions. Anticholinergic drugs include some antihistamines, tricyclic\nantidepressants, medications to control overactive bladder, and drugs to\nrelieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\n## What the study found regarding Benadryl and dementia\n\nA team led by Shelley Gray, a pharmacist at the University of Washington's\nSchool of Pharmacy, tracked nearly 3,500 men and women ages 65 and older who\ntook part in Adult Changes in Thought (ACT), a long-term study conducted by\nthe University of Washington and Group Health, a Seattle healthcare system.\nThey used Group Health's pharmacy records to determine all the drugs, both\nprescription and over-the-counter, that each participant took the 10 years\nbefore starting the study. Participants' health was tracked for an average of\nseven years. During that time, 800 of the volunteers developed dementia. When\nthe researchers examined the use of anticholinergic drugs, they found that\npeople who used these drugs were more likely to have developed dementia as\nthose who didn't use them. Moreover, dementia risk increased along with the\ncumulative dose. Taking an anticholinergic for the equivalent of three years\nor more was associated with a 54% higher dementia risk than taking the same\ndose for three months or less.\n\nThe ACT results add to mounting evidence that anticholinergics aren't drugs to\ntake long-term if you want to keep a clear head and keep your head clear into\nold age. The body's production of acetylcholine diminishes with age, so\nblocking its effects can deliver a double whammy to older people. It's not\nsurprising that problems with short-term memory, reasoning, and confusion lead\nthe list of side effects of anticholinergic drugs, which also include\ndrowsiness, dry mouth, urine retention, and constipation.\n\nThe University of Washington study is the first to include nonprescription\ndrugs. It is also the first to eliminate the possibility that people were\ntaking a tricyclic antidepressant to alleviate early symptoms of undiagnosed\ndementia; the risk associated with bladder medications was just as high.\n\nThis study is another reminder to periodically evaluate all of the drugs\nyou're taking. Look at each one to determine if it's really helping.\n\nMany drugs have a stronger effect on older people than younger people. With\nage, the kidneys and liver clear drugs more slowly, so drug levels in the\nblood remain higher for a longer time. People also gain fat and lose muscle\nmass with age, both of which change the way that drugs are distributed to and\nbroken down in body tissues. In addition, older people tend to take more\nprescription and over-the-counter medications, each of which has the potential\nto suppress or enhance the effectiveness of the others.\n\n## What should you do about Benadryl and the risks of dementia?\n\nIn 2008, Indiana University School of Medicine geriatrician Malaz Boustani\ndeveloped the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale, which ranks these drugs\naccording to the severity of their effects on the mind. It's a good idea to\nsteer clear of the drugs with high ACB scores, meaning those with scores of 3.\nThere are so many alternatives to these drugs. For example, selective\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram (Celexa) or fluoxetine\n(Prozac) are good alternatives to tricyclic antidepressants. Newer\nantihistamines such as loratadine (Claritin) can replace diphenhydramine.\nExercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles (Kegel exercises) and cognitive\nbehavioral training can help reduce urinary incontinence.\n\nOne of the best ways to make sure you're taking the most effective drugs is to\ndump all your medications \u2014 prescription and nonprescription \u2014 into a bag and\nbring them to your next appointment with your primary care doctor.\n\nAdapted from a Harvard Health Blog post by Beverly Merz\n\n## About the Author\n\nHarvard Health Publishing Staff\n\nHarvard Health Publishing (HHP) is the consumer health education division of\nHarvard Medical School (HMS).

However,\nminor memory lapses that occur with age are not usually signs of a serious\nproblem, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but rather the result of normal changes\nin the structure and function of the brain. This report, Improving Memory:\nUnderstanding age-related memory loss, describes these normal age-related\nchanges and other more serious causes of memory loss \u2014 and how to distinguish\nbetween them.\n\nRead More\n\n## Related Content\n\nStaying Healthy\n\n### 10 habits for good health\n\nStaying Healthy\n\n### Caregiving crisis\n\nStaying Healthy\n\n### Combining electronic cigarettes and counseling helps more smokers quit\n\nMental Health\n\n## Free Healthbeat Signup\n\nGet the latest in health news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign Up\n\n## Footer\n\nHarvard Health Publishing\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube\n\n### My Account\n\n  * Customer Service\n  * Log in\n\n### Order Now\n\n  * Online Learning Courses\n  * Digital Subscriptions\n  * Special Health Reports\n  * Print Subscriptions\n\n### More\n\n  * About Us\n  * Permissions\n  * Content Licensing\n  * Topics\n  * Trademark Notice\n\n\u00a9 2024 Harvard Health Publishing\u00ae of The President and Fellows of Harvard\nCollege\n\nDo not sell my personal information | Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nScroll To Top\n\nThanks for visiting.
