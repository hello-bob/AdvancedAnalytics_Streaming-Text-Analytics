Mihalek\n\nMarch 12, 2024, 12:46 PM\n\n0:14\n\nIn this photo illustration, US 100 dollar bills are seen on an American flag.\n\nIgor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe U.S. dollar is perhaps the most recognized in the world, accepted nearly\neverywhere and viewed as one of the most reliable, stable currencies of any\nnation. Which is why, at a time when consumers swipe or tap a card to pay for\nmost anything, the U.S. Secret Service reported that they seized nearly 22\nmillion dollars in counterfeit cash last year.\n\nCounterfeiting is a crime that has existed for millennia, but it really came\nto the fore in the U.S. during the Civil War, when both the Union and\nConfederate governments, in an attempt to subvert the other, counterfeited\neach other's currency. By the war's end, nearly one-third of all currency\ncirculating the U.S. was counterfeit, undermining a recovering economy where\nphysical currency was what most used to do business.\n\nIn this illustration, Secret Service officers descend upon a den of coin\ncounterfeiters.\n\nBettmann Archive\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service was born out of the need to thwart that rampant\ncounterfeiting and restore the population's trust in the nation's financial\nsystem. That task has become more challenging with the advent of\ncybercurrencies like Bitcoin, digital currencies, peer-to-peer payment methods\nlike PayPal and Venmo, and more. Criminals and crimes adapt to the times, and,\nas much as payment methods have increased, so too have the ways to defraud\nconsumers. Cryptocurrency-related crimes grew over 53% in 2023, according the\nFBI's Internet Crime Report, from $2.57 billion in losses in 2022 to $3.94\nbillion last year.\n\n### MORE: Video -- Nearly $1M in counterfeit bills found in Minnesota: Feds\n\nFurther, a February 2023 Deloitte poll found that, during the previous 12\nmonths, \"34.5% of polled executives report that their organizations'\naccounting and financial data was targeted by cyber adversaries,\" with nearly\na third of those organizations attacked more than once during the survey\nperiod.\n\nJust one such attack can cripple a business and shut down economic activity,\nwhich is why governments around the world have prioritized stopping them. Yet\nas financial cybercrimes have taken the spotlight, counterfeiting of U.S.\ncurrency has quietly experienced a resurgence. As the Secret Service says,\n\"The threat of counterfeit U.S. currency to the financial system of the United\nStates continues to evolve. Advances in technology, the availability of\nscanning and printing devices and the adoption of the U.S. dollar by nations\nas their legal tender have exacerbated the global threat.\"\n\nBefore computers, currency counterfeiters created physical printing plates to\nsimulate U.S. currency, and printed their counterfeit currency on different\ntypes of paper. Digital scanners and printers have further enabled\ncounterfeiters, but the biggest challenges for most counterfeiters are the\nsecurity features in U.S. currency, which are difficult to replicate.\n\nYet it still happens. In May 2012, the Canadian police seized $1 million worth\nof fake U.S. $20 bills and arrested four suspects. When asked why they did it,\nthe main counterfeiting suspect stated that it was because U.S currency was\nthe most widely accepted worldwide.\n\nRedesigned $100 notes lay in stacks at the Bureau of Engraving and\nPrintin...Show more ---\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images, FILE\n\n### MORE: Video Bitcoin hits new record\n\nIndeed, over half of genuine U.S. currency is in circulation overseas. Cash,\nespecially genuine U.S. currency, is the preferred payment method in many\ncorners of the world for law-abiding individuals who either can't or don't\nwant to use electronic payment systems. When counterfeit currency is\nintroduced in these places, it can significantly undermine the local economy\nand damage trust.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Secret Service confiscated more than half a billion dollars\nin counterfeit money. Since then, seizures have steadily declined due in part\nto the consistent redesigns of U.S. currency to make it more counterfeit\nresistant.\n\nAs attempts to thwart counterfeiting have continued, \"funny money\" has taken\non new forms, including the use of \"prop money\" \u2013 that is, fake money made for\nuse as on-camera props in films or television. As a result, and despite non-\ncriminal intentions, Hollywood is apparently home to one of the largest\nstashes of counterfeit currency.\n\n### MORE: Georgia Counterfeit Ring Passes $1 Million In Fake Bills\n\nAll of which is why an estimated $70 million to $200 million in counterfeit\nbills are in circulation at any given time, according to the United States\nDepartment of Treasury. As recently as June of 2023, Philadelphia Customs and\nBorder Protection officers, working with the U.S. Secret Service, seized\nnearly $15 million in counterfeit currency from several multi-million-dollar\ncounterfeit smuggling attempts.\n\nEven while the world's monetary transactions are going more electronic, the\ncontinued popularity of counterfeiting demonstrates that in many corners of\nthe world, cash is still king.\n\nDonald J.
