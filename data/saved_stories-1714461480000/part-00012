Customers who signed up for the Apple Card in August 2019,\nwhen the Apple Card launched, will be receiving the notice.\n\nIt appears that the physical Apple Card is designed to last for five years\nbefore a replacement is sent out. Most of the Apple Card's functionality is\ndigital, with options for rotating security codes and credit card numbers for\nonline purchases, but there is a number associated with the physical card\nthat's used for in-person transactions. Credit card companies add expiration\ndates to physical cards for fraud prevention purposes, to introduce new\ntechnology, and more.\n\nFrom Apple's email:\n\n> We're sending a replacement titanium card to your billing address so you can\n> continue to use it at physical locations. Remember, even without a physical\n> card you can always use your Apple Card at any location that accepts Apple\n> Pay. Your new titanium card will be shipped within 2 weeks from the date of\n> this communication.\n>\n> You can continue to use your titanium card until it expires or you activate\n> the new one. You can still use Apple Card with Apple Pay and your virtual\n> card number to shop at merchants that don't yet accept Apple Pay by typing\n> in your number from Wallet or using Safari AutoFill.\n\nReplacement cards will include a prepaid shipping label so that customers can\nsend in their old Apple Card to be recycled. Apple recommends that Apple Card\nusers who receive a new card activate it when it arrives, as the current card\nis scheduled to stop working at its expiration date.\n\nCustomers who signed up for Apple Card at some point after it first launched\nwill likely receive emails at the five year mark. Note that some customers\nhave been receiving emails for the last month or so, but these may be\ncustomers who were able to sign up for the Apple Card early as part of a beta\ntest.\n\nTag: Apple Card Guide\n\n[ 53 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\njb310\n\n3 hours ago at 12:55 pm\n\nInteresting, the card gets new models faster than the Magic Mouse does. ?\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nFuzzball84\n\n3 hours ago at 12:55 pm\n\nThey should refresh them every year, if it doesn't come with M4 chip this\nyear, I'm walking.\n\nScore: 4 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nFuzzball84\n\n3 hours ago at 12:50 pm\n\n> Considering its made of Titanium and weighs 15 grams, it has value.
