miles\n\nPower lines will be built across four states in a $5.2 billion effort that,\nrelying on coal plants that were meant to be shuttered, is designed to keep\nthe electric grid from failing amid spiking energy demands.\n\nCutting through farms and neighborhoods, the plan converges on Northern\nVirginia, where a growing data center industry will need enough extra energy\nto power 6 million homes by 2030.\n\nWith not enough of those green energy facilities connected to the grid yet,\nenough coal and natural gas energy to power 32 million homes is expected to be\nlost by 2030 at a time when the demand from the growing data center industry,\nelectric vehicles and other new technology is on the rise, PJM says.\n\n\u201cThe system is in a major transition right now, and it\u2019s going to continue to\nevolve,\u201d Ken Seiler, PJM\u2019s senior vice president in charge of planning, said\nin a December stakeholders\u2019 meeting about the effort to buy time for green\nenergy to catch up. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll look for opportunities to do everything we can\nto keep the lights on as it goes through this transition.\u201d\n\n### A need for power\n\nData centers that house thousands of computer servers and the cooling\nequipment needed for them to run have been multiplying in Northern Virginia\nsince the late 1990s, spreading from the industry\u2019s historic base in Loudoun\nCounty to neighboring Prince William County and, recently, across the Potomac\nRiver into Maryland. There are nearly 300 data centers now in Virginia.\n\nWith Amazon Web Services pursuing a $35 billion data center expansion in\nVirginia, rural portions of the state are the industry\u2019s newest target for\ndevelopment.\n\nThe growth means big revenue for the localities that host the football-field-\nsize buildings. Loudoun collects $600 million in annual taxes on the computer\nequipment inside the buildings, making it easier to fund schools and other\nservices. Prince William, the second-largest market, collects $100 million per\nyear.\n\nAn Amazon Web Services data center is located within about 50 feet of some\nresidential homes in the Loudoun Meadows neighborhood in Ashburn, Va. A\nMicrosoft data center is under construction at top right. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The\nWashington Post)\n\nAn Amazon Web Services data center, top center, has been built near\nresidential neighborhoods in Manassas, Va. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington\nPost)\n\nBut data centers also consume massive amounts of energy.\n\nOne data center can require 50 times the electricity of a typical office\nbuilding, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Multiple-building data\ncenter complexes, which have become the norm, require as much as 14 to 20\ntimes that amount.\n\nThe demand has strained utility companies, to the point where Dominion Energy\nin Virginia briefly warned in 2022 that it may not be able to keep up with the\npace of the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe utility \u2014 which has since accelerated plans for new power lines and\nsubstations to boost its electrical output \u2014 predicts that by 2035 the\nindustry in Virginia will require 11,000 megawatts, nearly quadruple what it\nneeded in 2022, or enough to power 8.8 million homes.\n\nThe smaller Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative recently told PJM that the\nmore than 50 data centers it serves account for 59 percent of its energy\ndemand. It expects to need to serve about 110 more data centers by July 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of energy available is not growing quickly enough to\nmeet that future demand. Coal plants have scaled down production or shut down\naltogether as the market transitions to green energy, hastened by laws in\nMaryland and Virginia mandating net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and,\nfor several other states in the region, by 2050.\n\nDominion is developing a 2,600-megawatt wind farm off Virginia Beach \u2014 the\nlargest such project in U.S. waters \u2014 and the company recently gained state\napproval to build four solar projects.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those projects won\u2019t be ready in time to absorb the projected gap in\navailable energy. Opponents of PJM\u2019s plan say it wouldn\u2019t be necessary if more\ngreen energy had been connected to the grid faster, pointing to projects that\nwere caught up in bureaucratic delays for five years or longer before they\nwere connected.\n\nA PJM spokesperson said the organization has recently sped up its approval\nprocess and is encouraging utility companies and federal and state officials\nto better incorporate renewable energy.\n\nAbout 40,000 megawatts of green energy projects have been cleared for\nconstruction but are not being built because of issues related to financing or\nsiting, the PJM spokesperson said.\n\nOnce more renewable energy is available, some of the power lines being built\nto address the energy gap may no longer be needed as the coal plants\nultimately shut down, clean energy advocates say \u2014 though utility companies\ncontend the extra capacity brought by the lines will always be useful.\n\n\u201cTheir planning is just about maintaining the status quo,\u201d Tom Rutigliano, a\nsenior advocate for clean energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council,\nsaid about PJM. \u201cThey do nothing proactive about really trying to get a handle\non the future and get ready for it.\u201d\n\n### \u2018Holding on tight\u2019 to coal\n\nThe smoke from two coal plants near West Virginia\u2019s border with Pennsylvania\nbillows over the city of Morgantown, adding a brownish tint to the air.\n\nNearby sits the 502 Junction substation, connected to those plants and a third\none about 43 miles away via existing power lines, which will serve as a\nterminus for a western prong of the PJM plan for new lines that will extend to\nanother substation in Frederick, Md., then south into Northern Virginia.\n\nThe 502 Junction substation, to which transmission lines are connected, in\nMount Morris, Pa.
