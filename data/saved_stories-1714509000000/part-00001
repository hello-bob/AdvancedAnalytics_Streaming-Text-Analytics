A neighbor told the FT\nthey were not even aware of the office\u2019s existence. Apple did not respond to\nrequests to comment.\n\nApple has been typically tight-lipped about its AI plans even as big tech\nrivals Microsoft, Google and Amazon tout multibillion-dollar investments in\ncutting-edge technology.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n33\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
