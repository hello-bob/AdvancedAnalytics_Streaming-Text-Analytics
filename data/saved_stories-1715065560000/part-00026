Pretty much everyone in oil and gas booked a decline in the\nbottom line as prices deflated amid falling concerns about supply security.\nCash, however, remained high. And it appears this cash has allowed the\nindustry to lower their demand for borrowing.\n\nDemand for loans from the oil and gas industry fell by 6% last year, Bloomberg\nreported this week. This followed a 1% decline during the previous year\u2014but in\nthat previous year oil and gas producers raked the cash in as the world\npanicked there were going to be shortages. The 6% decline in demand for loans\nwhen profits were lower, too, was certainly more notable.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The oil and gas industry has experienced a number of booms and busts over the\npast few decades, but for now, it appears to be flush with cash,\" Bloomberg\nIntelligence senior analyst Andrew John Stevenson said, as quoted by the\npublication.\n\nThanks to these developments, oil and gas producers' ratio of net debt to\nearnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization has dropped from\n2.4 in 2020 to 0.8 last year, Stevenson also said, adding that by 2030, this\nratio could dip below zero, which would make the industry quite unique\u2014and\nquite appealing to investors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, however, this strong performance from oil and gas\nproducers is cause for worry because of the transition. Indeed, large banks\nhave been reducing the amount of business they do with oil and gas companies\nin line with the transition drive but, it appears, the industry can\nsurvive\u2014and grow\u2014without the help of those particular big banks. Especially\nwhen other lenders and asset managers are still very much exposed to oil and\ngas.\n\nIt was Bloomberg again that in April reported that smaller, regional U.S.\nbanks were stepping up their lending to oil and gas producers as big-ticket\nnames shrunk their dealings with the industry. The report calculated that five\nregional U.S. lenders had raised the amount of money they'd lent to oil and\ngas by as much as 70% between 2022 and 2023, while big lenders curbed their\nown lending to hydrocarbon producers in the same period.\n\n\"Someone betting heavily that the demand for fossil fuels will keep on rising\nsignificantly is clearly taking a view that is at odds with existing\nforecasts,\" one climate activist from an organization called the Network for\nGreening the Financial System told Bloomberg at the time.\n\nYet the existing forecasts must have some inaccuracies if oil and gas\nproducers are becoming increasingly financially independent, needing less in\nborrowed capital than before. There can be only one rational explanation for\nthis trend, and it has to do with demand for these companies' products. This\ndemand has remained amazingly resilient in the face of energy transition\nchallengers, and it has grown at a pace that has allowed oil and gas drillers\nto reduce their demand for loans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is perhaps unpleasant news for the banks that hastened their exit from\noil and gas in an effort to support the shift away from hydrocarbons because,\nit turns out, the effort has been wasted. It would be even more unpleasant\nnews for all the organizations that convinced the banks to do that with the\nargument that curbing lending to oil and gas will keep more of these in the\nground. Perhaps this is a good time to recall the words of former Shell chief\nexecutive Ben van Beurden, who gave an excellent example of oil demand\nresilience and the futility of trying to kill this demand by reducing the\nsupply of the commodity.\n\n\"Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today,\" van Beurden\nsaid in a LinkedIn post commenting on a court ruling that obliged Shell to\nreduce its emissions by a whopping 45% by 2030. \"This would certainly cut\nShell's carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit. Demand for\nfuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at\nother service stations.\"\n\nBy the same token, if BNP Paribas, Barclays, HSBC, and ING stop funding oil\nand gas projects, the companies leading those projects would go to another\nbank or\u2014and this is rightly more concerning for banks and climate activists\nalike\u2014they would use their own cash because they have it.\n\nEven more worryingly for those working to reduce the world's reliance on oil\nand gas, this cash will help producers increase their output in the coming\nyears, responding to demand trends. There would be no banks to stop them.\nBasically, the oil and gas industry has become more difficult to influence\nfrom the outside, so its chief motivation for production plans is now demand.\nA free market if ever there was one.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Canada Issues Final Authorization for Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion\n  * The Permian Shrugs Off Below-Zero Natural Gas Prices in Texas\n  * Shell Quits China\u2019s Power Markets\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\nFACEBOOK Twitter LINKEDIN REDDIT PRINT\n\nPrevious Post\n\nFossil Fuel Companies Face Mounting Legal Challenges\n\nNext Post\n\nCarbon-Eating Bacteria May Hold The Key To Decarbonization\n\n### Irina Slav\n\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on\nthe oil and gas industry.\n\nMore Info\n\n### Related posts\n\n### Belgium's Ports Are Brimming With Unsold Chinese EVs\n\n### Will OPEC+ Extend Oil Production Cuts?\n\n### New EPA Regulations on Fossil Fuel Emissions Could Lead to Power Shortages\n\nLeave a comment\n\n### Most Popular\n\nLarge Crude Inventory Build Rocks Oil Prices\n\nIs Copper Heading to $15,000?\n\nOil Demand Likely To Surprise To The Upside\n\nU.S. Oil and Gas Production Continues to Shatter Records\n\nOPEC Chief Challenges Reports Predicting Demise of Oil Demand\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Trending Discussions\n\n  * #### GREEN NEW DEAL = BLIZZARD OF LIES\n\nPosted by JoMack\n\nAs Biden, the President of Climate Change, and Kerry, our fabulous Climate\nCzar, who just gave...\n\n  * #### They pay YOU to TAKE Natural Gas\n\nPosted by footeab@yahoo.com\n\nThe Permian Shrugs Off Below-Zero Natural Gas Prices in Texas...\n\n  * #### Could Someone Give Me Insights on the Future of Renewable Energy?\n\nPosted by rich20509\n\nHello there, As I am very much interested for a thoughtful discussion about\nthe futu...\n\nEXXON Mobil -0.35\n\nOpen57.81 Trading Vol.6.96M Previous Vol.241.7B\n\nBUY 57.15\n\nSell 57.00\n\n  * More About Us\n  * About Us\n  * Site News\n  * Sitemap\n  * Advertise with us\n\n  * Site info\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 OilPrice.com\n\nThe materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational\npurposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment\nadvice.\n\nNothing contained on the Web site shall be considered a recommendation,\nsolicitation, or offer to buy or sell a security to any person in any\njurisdiction.\n\nMerchant of Record: A Media Solutions trading as Oilprice.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
