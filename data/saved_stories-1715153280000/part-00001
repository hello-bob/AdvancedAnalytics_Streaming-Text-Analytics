This\nincredibly personal model of tracking is the latest level of surveillance\ninfrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014where communities are not only\nexposed to a tremendous amount of constant monitoring, but also serves as a\nlaboratory where law enforcement agencies at all levels of government test new\ntechnologies.\n\nThe product now being deployed in Texas, called TraffiCatch, can detect wifi\nand Bluetooth signals in moving cars to track them. Webb County, which\nincludes Laredo, has had TraffiCatch technology since at least 2019, according\nto GovSpend procurement data. Val Verde County, which includes Del Rio,\napproved the technology in 2022.\n\nThis data collection is possible because all Bluetooth devices regularly\nbroadcast a Bluetooth Device Address. This address can be either a public\naddress or a random address. Public addresses don\u2019t change for the lifetime of\nthe device, making them the easiest to track. Random addresses are more common\nand have multiple levels of privacy, but for the most part change regularly\n(this is the case with most modern smartphones and products like AirTags.)\nBluetooth products with random addresses would be hard to track for a device\nthat hasn\u2019t paired with them. But if the tracked person is also carrying a\nBluetooth device that has a public address, or if tracking devices are placed\nclose to each other so a device is seen multiple times before it changes its\naddress, random addresses could be correlated with that person over long\nperiods of time.\n\nIt is unclear whether TraffiCatch is doing this sort of advanced analysis and\ncorrelation, and how effective it would be at tracking most modern Bluetooth\ndevices.\n\nAccording to TraffiCatch\u2019s manufacturer, Jenoptik, this data derived from\nBluetooth is also combined with data collected from automated license plate\nreaders, another form of vehicle tracking technology placed along roads and\nhighways by federal, state, and local law enforcement throughout the Texas\nborder. ALPRs are well understood technology for vehicle tracking, but the\naddition of Bluetooth tracking may allow law enforcement to track individuals\neven if they are using different vehicles.\n\nThis mirrors what we already know about how Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) has been using cell-site simulators (CSSs). Also known as\nStingrays or IMSI catchers, CSS are devices that masquerade as legitimate\ncell-phone towers, tricking phones within a certain radius into connecting to\nthe device rather than a tower. In 2023, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s\nInspector General released a troubling report detailing how federal agencies\nlike ICE, its subcomponent Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the\nSecret Service have conducted surveillance using CSSs without proper\nauthorization and in violation of the law. Specifically, the Inspector General\nfound that these agencies did not adhere to federal privacy policy governing\nthe use of CSS and failed to obtain special orders required before using these\ntypes of surveillance devices.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies along the border can pour money into overlapping\nsystems of surveillance that monitor entire communities living along the\nborder thanks in part to Operation Stonegarden (OPSG), a Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS) grant program, which rewards state and local police\nfor collaborating in border security initiatives. DHS doled out $90 million in\nOPSG funding in 2023, $37 million of which went to Texas agencies. These\nprograms are especially alarming to human rights advocates due to recent\nlegislation passed in Texas to allow local and state law enforcement to take\nimmigration enforcement into their own hands.\n\nAs a ubiquitous wireless interface to many of our personal devices and even\nour vehicles, Bluetooth is a large and notoriously insecure attack surface for\nhacks and exploits. And as TraffiCatch demonstrates, even when your device\u2019s\nBluetooth tech isn\u2019t being actively hacked, it can broadcast uniquely\nidentifiable information that make you a target for tracking. This is one in\nthe many ways surveillance, and the distrust it breeds in the public over\ntechnology and tech companies, hinders progress. Hands-free communication in\ncars is a fantastic modern innovation. But the fact that it comes at the cost\nof opening a whole society up to surveillance is a detriment to all.\n\n## Related Issues\n\nBorder Surveillance Technology\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\n## Join EFF Lists\n\n## Related Updates\n\nPress Release | May 6, 2024\n\n### EFF Zine on Surveillance Tech at the Southern Border Shines Light on Ever-\nGrowing Spy Network\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\u2014Sensor towers controlled by AI, drones launched from truck-bed\ncatapults, vehicle-tracking devices disguised as traffic cones\u2014all are part of\nan arsenal of technologies that comprise the expanding U.S surveillance\nstrategy along the U.S.-Mexico border, revealed in a new EFF zine for\nadvocates, journalists, academics, researchers, humanitarian aid workers,\nand...\n\nDeeplinks Blog by Dave Maass | April 10, 2024\n\n### Virtual Reality and the 'Virtual Wall'\n\nWhen EFF set out to map surveillance technology along the U.S.-Mexico border,\nwe weren't exactly sure how to do it.
