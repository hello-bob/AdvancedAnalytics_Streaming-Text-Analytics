After\nsetting up the bucket for a client project, he checked his billing page and\nfound nearly 100 million unauthorized attempts to create new files on his\nbucket (PUT requests) within one day. The bill was over $1,300 and counting.\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing ... nearly 100 million\nunauthorized requests.\n\nMaciej Pocwierz\n\n\"All this actually happened just a few days after I ensured my client that the\nprice for AWS services will be negligible, like $20 at most for the entire\nmonth,\" Pocwierz wrote over chat. \"I explained the situation is very unusual\nbut it definitely looked as if I didn't know what I'm doing.\"\n\nPocwierz declined to name the open source tool that inadvertently bum-rushed\nhis S3 account. In a Medium post about the matter, he noted a different\nproblem with an unlucky default backup. After turning on public writes, he\nwatched as he collected more than 10GB of data in less than 30 seconds. Other\npeople's data, that is, and they had no idea that Pocwierz was collecting it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of that data came from companies with customers, which is part of why\nPocwierz is keeping the specifics under wraps. He wrote to Ars that he\ncontacted some of the companies that either tried or successfully backed up\ntheir data to his bucket, and \"they completely ignored me.\" \"So now instead of\nhaving this fixed, their data is still at risk,\" Pocwierz writes. \"My lesson\nis if I ever run a company, I will definitely have a bug bounty program, and I\nwill treat such warnings seriously.\"\n\nAs for Pocwierz's accounts, both S3 and bank, it mostly ended well. An AWS\nrepresentative reached out on LinkedIn and canceled his bill, he said, and was\ntold that anybody can request refunds for excessive unauthorized requests.\n\"But they didn't explicitly say that they will necessarily approve it,\" he\nwrote. He noted in his Medium post that AWS \"emphasized that this was done as\nan exception.\"\n\nIn response to Pocwierz's story, Jeff Barr, chief evangelist for AWS at\nAmazon, tweeted that \"We agree that customers should not have to pay for\nunauthorized requests that they did not initiate.\" Barr added that Amazon\nwould have more to share on how the company could prevent them \"shortly.\" AWS\nhas a brief explainer and contact page on unexpected AWS charges.\n\nThe open source tool did change its default configuration after Pocwierz\ncontacted them. Pocwierz suggested to AWS that it should restrict anyone else\nfrom creating a bucket name like his, but he had yet to hear back about it. He\nsuggests in his blog post that, beyond random bad luck, adding a random suffix\nto your bucket name and explicitly specifying your AWS region can help avoid\nmassive charges like the one he narrowly dodged.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n79\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
