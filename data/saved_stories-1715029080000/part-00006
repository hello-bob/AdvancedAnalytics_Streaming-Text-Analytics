Applying to a desired role online, you're\ngreeted with a login prompt. The employer is asking you to create a profile to\napply? Annoying, but you go ahead.\n\nYou're given a long form to fill out with the information that's already on\nyour r\u00e9sum\u00e9. In a world where we can all attach PDFs, this seems unnecessary,\nbut \u2014 ah, phew \u2014 the form promises to autofill the entries if you simply drag\nyour r\u00e9sum\u00e9 over, and \u2014 oh, crap. It loads all wrong. Your work experience is\nscattered across the lines that want your name and address. Your address,\ntruncated, is where your college degree should be. It's a mess. You find it's\neasier to delete it all and manually type in each entry. How obnoxious.\n\nSoon after, applying to a different job at a different company, you click\nthrough and see the same form. You recognize the logo at the top of the page:\na blue W with a yellow arch cresting above it. Is the arch a ... frown? Geez.\nBut you'd set up a user ID to apply to the previous job, so this should be \u2014\nhuh? It wants an entirely new ID. New company, new profile, new form. Oof.\nSurely it saved your application entries from the other job, right? Nope. Does\nthe autofill work this time? Of course it doesn't. Another half-hour of\nformatting and you're done with the application \u2014 and so done with whichever\nconfounding organization decided to execute these tasks this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen you find another job opening and \u2014 no. No! So the logo is a frown.\n\nThe company devising this torture that is the modern job application is called\nWorkday. Since 2006, Workday, which provides software for payroll, talent\nmanagement, and expense processing, has been making a mint creating misery\nwhere painless processes could be. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies\nuse Workday to pay, hire, onboard, and administer benefits to their employees.\nClients range from Netflix to Goodwill, Spotify to The Washington Post, Chick-\nfil-A to Ohio State University. Trillions of dollars in revenue and tens of\nmillions of employees are at the mercy of Workday's back-end people-management\nsoftware. The company is worth some $70 billion, a market cap greater than\nthat of FedEx, Nintendo, or Honda.\n\n> \"LinkedIn, Reddit, and Blind abound with enraged job applicants and\n> employees sharing tales of how difficult it is to book leave, how Kafkaesque\n> it is to file an expense.\"\n\nFew seem happy about this. LinkedIn, Reddit, and Blind abound with enraged job\napplicants and employees sharing tales of how difficult it is to book paid\nleave, how Kafkaesque it is to file an expense, how nerve-racking it is to\nclose out a project. \"I simply hate Workday. Fuck them and those who insist on\nusing it for recruitment,\" one Reddit user wrote. \"Everything is non-\nintuitive, so even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head,\" wrote\nanother. \"Keeping notes on index cards would be more effective.\" Every HR\nprofessional and hiring manager I spoke with \u2014 whose lives are supposedly made\neasier by Workday \u2014 described Workday with a sense of cosmic exasperation.\n\"It's like constantly being botsmacked by bureaucracy incarnate,\" said a copy\ndirector at an AI startup in San Francisco who had the misfortune of having to\nhire contractors through Workday. He went on: \"Getting someone onboarded using\nWorkday is like trying to get water from your sink to your stove using a\ncolander.\" The X account Work Day Failing tracks memes and news articles\ndescribing workers and companies suffering within various circles of Workday\nhell, from Amazon's failed migration to Workday in 2021 (after which Workday's\nstock dropped by 7%) to an ongoing class-action lawsuit that alleges Workday\nuses AI to discriminate against candidates based on race, age, and disability.\n(\"We believe this lawsuit is without merit and deny the allegations,\" said a\nWorkday spokesperson. \"Workday does not have oversight or control of our\ncustomers' job application processes.\")\n\nIf candidates hate Workday, if employees hate Workday, if HR people and\nmanagers processing and assessing those candidates and employees through\nWorkday hate Workday \u2014 if Workday is the most annoying part of so many\nworkers' workdays \u2014 how is Workday everywhere? How did a software provider so\nwidely loathed become a mainstay of the modern workplace?\n\nThe answer, to use a term that any client of Workday could surely use, is\nPOSIWID. This is a saying in systems thinking: The purpose of a system is what\nit does (POSIWID), not what it fails to do. And the reality is that what\nWorkday \u2014 and its many despised competitors \u2014 does for organizations is far\nmore important than the anguish it causes everyone else.\n\nOf the 160 million Americans with jobs, about 130 million of us aren't self-\nemployed or don't own a business and so receive wages and health-insurance\nplans through our employers. Serving these 130 million people are roughly 1\nmillion human-resources professionals. That's an impossible shit ton of\nhirings, firings, withheld taxes, expenses, paid leaves, orientation\ntrainings, and professional-growth reviews to keep track of. It's a world of\npaperwork that software is eager to eat.\n\nIn the late 20th century, companies moved more and more of that recordkeeping\nfrom filing cabinets to mainframe computers and then to servers. In 1988,\nPeopleSoft, backed by IBM, built the first fully fledged Human Resources\nInformation System. In 2004, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion. One\nof its founders, David Duffield, then started a new company that upgraded\nPeopleSoft's model to near limitless cloud-based storage \u2014 giving birth to\nWorkday, the intractable nepo baby of HR software.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Workday stores our applications and profiles as\nobjects that relate to each other, linked with metadata. How this works is\nless important than the fact that it means Workday could conceivably build its\nown encrypted database of our information, across our different jobs and\napplications. When you leave Spotify to go work at Netflix, your profile could\nfollow you, allowing you to more easily apply to the job. The multiplying\npowers of tech could scale to free us of our busy work, as promised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Workday's servers belong with its clients, and so it can't (or won't) do\nthis. Does Workday want to carry the liability of a data breach that could\ndamage half of the Fortune 500? Probably not. A Workday spokesperson said that\nWorkday's clients \"configure the application process for each job to fit their\nunique hiring processes and needs.\" She added, \"Our customers retain control\nover their own data.\"\n\nThis raises another point: Workday is indifferent to our suffering in a job\nhunt, because we aren't Workday's clients, companies are. And these companies\n\u2014 from AT&T to Bank of America to Teladoc \u2014 have little incentive to care\nabout your application experience, because if you didn't get the job, you're\nnot their responsibility. For a company hiring and onboarding on a global\nscale, it is simply easier to screen fewer candidates if the result is still a\nsingle hire.\n\nAlso, because Workday is a jack of all trades program (recruiting and finance\nand company-wide planning etc. etc.), the supposed convenience of an all-in-\none platform often come at the cost of creating frustrating new problems for\nclients. At one major university last year, migrating its IT \u2014 including\n11,000 outstanding invoices \u2014 to Workday became a full-blown fiasco. A search\non a job board can return hundreds of listings for in-house Workday\nconsultants: IT and engineering professionals hired to fix the software\npromising to fix processes.\n\n> \"Bureaucratic hell is always about one person's ease coming at the cost of\n> someone else's frustration, time wasted, and busy work.\"\n\nFor recruiters, Workday also lacks basic user-interface flexibility. When you\npromise ease-of-use and simplicity, you must deliver on the most basic user\ninteractions. And yet: Sometimes searching for a candidate, or locating a\ncandidate's status feels impossible. This happens outside of recruiting, too,\nwhere locating or attaching a boss's email to approve an expense sheet is\ncomplicated by the process, not streamlined. Bureaucratic hell is always about\none person's ease coming at the cost of someone else's frustration, time\nwasted, and busy work. Workday makes no exceptions.\n\nWorkday touts its ability to track employee performance by collecting data and\nmarking results, but it is employees who must spend time inputting this data.\nA creative director at a Fortune 500 company told me how in less than two\nyears his company went \"from annual reviews to twice-annual reviews to\nquarterly reviews to quarterly reviews plus separate twice-annual reviews.\" At\neach interval higher-ups pressed HR for more data, because they wanted what\nthey'd paid for with Workday: more work product. With a press of a button, HR\ncould provide that, but the entire company suffered thousands more hours of\nbusy work. Automation made it too easy to do too much. (Workday's \"customers\nchoose the frequency at which they conduct reviews, not Workday,\" said the\nspokesperson.)\n\nOf course, Workday has innumerable competitors, their names as ridiculous as\ntheir sheer volume. We have Dayforce, Zenefits, and Sage. We must not confuse\nPaycom with Paycor, or Kudos with Kudoboard. How dare you mistake Namely or\nCornerstone for Rippling. Beyond standard HR Information Systems, legions of\nniche operators offer add-ons to boost employee engagement, from Bonusly\n(really) to BucketList (sad but true), to Motivosity (yes).\n\nAre any of these better, or are they all maligned? As easily as you can find a\nfounder who hates UKG Pro but loves Rippling you can find a similar rant from\nanother founder ripping Rippling a new one. HR and payroll and recruiting are\nunenviable tasks, and not easy even before scale. At the scale of a large\ncompany, this is simply too much work to expect a few people to do and far too\nuser-specific to expect automation to handle well. It's why Workday can be the\nworst while still allowing that Paychex is the worst, Paycom is the worst,\nPaycor is the worst, and Dayforce is the worst. \"HR software sucking\" is a big\ntent.\n\nThe writer and tech critic Cory Doctorow coined the term \"enshittification\" to\ndescribe how internet platforms inevitably decay. First, platforms are good to\ntheir users, creating value (Facebook, where people can connect and share\ntheir lives with one another). Then they abuse their users to make money for\ntheir actual customers, advertisers or businesses (Facebook, where we sell\nyour data to inundate you with ads). Then they abuse those business customers\nto try to recoup revenue for themselves (Facebook, pivoting to video). Then\nplatforms die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorkday finds itself between enshittification steps two and three. The\nplatform once made things faster, simpler for workers. But today it abuses\nworkers by cutting corners on job-application and reimbursement procedures. In\nthe process, it provides the value of a one-stop HR shop to its paying\ncustomers. It seems it's only a matter of time before Workday and its\ncompetitors try to split the difference and cut those same corners with the\naccounts that pay their bills.\n\nWorkday reveals what's important to the people who run Fortune 500 companies:\neasily and conveniently distributing busy work across large workforces. This\nis done with the arbitrary and perfunctory performance of work tasks (like\nexcessive reviews) and with the throttling of momentum by making finance and\nHR tasks difficult. If your expenses and reimbursements are difficult to file,\nthat's OK, because the people above you don't actually care if you get\nreimbursed. If it takes applicants 128% longer to apply, the people who\nimplemented Workday don't really care. Throttling applicants is perhaps not\nintentional, but it's good for the company.\n\nCustomer service is Workday's goal. It's just that the customer isn't you.\n\nI once worked at a cocktail lounge with a creaky board behind the bar, and the\nowner refused to fix it. We all complained nonstop about the board, but never\nabout him. He'd seemed to realize the same net benefit that Workday and all of\nits love-to-hate-them competitors provide us in the modern workplace: Nothing\nbrings people together like a common enemy.\n\nMatt Alston's writing has appeared in Wired, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and\nBeliever.
