I\u2019d written about\nthe Genesee County drain commissioner\u2019s flawed plan to create a new regional\nwater authority, a plan developed mostly because, for reasons that still bear\ninterrogation, the commissioner intended to cut out the Detroit Water and\nSewerage Department. And I wrote about some of the problems that followed the\nswitch, after some bacterial outbreaks suggested things weren't going\nsmoothly.\n\nIn Detroit, our attention in the summer of 2015 was largely consumed with the\nongoing aftermath of the city\u2019s 2013 municipal bankruptcy, the early days of\nthe 2016 presidential campaign, and, shamefully, the latest Lansing scandal,\nan extramarital affair between two state lawmakers whose names few even\nremember.\n\nWhile most of Michigan wasn't paying attention, Flint\u2019s state-appointed\nemergency manager had signed on to the new water authority, and OK\u2019ed a switch\nto Flint River water while the new system was under construction \u2014 that\nhappened 10 years ago this week. General Motors had stopped using Flint River\nwater in its plant there, saying it was too corrosive, residents had to begun\nto report that the city's tap water was yellow, smelled and tasted bad, and\nthe state was insisting that water tests showed everything was fine.\n\nIn late summer of that year, I got a call from a longtime source, who wanted\nto introduce me to Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a local pediatrician and researcher\nwho had some explosive news: Since the water switch, the blood-lead levels of\nchildren in Flint had elevated, proof positive that thousands of young\nchildren had been exposed to a neurotoxin.\n\nI remember the surrealism of that phone call; when you get the first line on a\nbig story, you wonder if you\u2019re about to feel the fool, because what you\nthought you just heard is too terrible to be true.\n\nWell, it was true, and the next year was powerful and frustrating in near-\nequal measure.\n\nPowerful, because of the efforts of brave Flint residents to tell the truth\nabout the end point of absolute systemic failure, and because of the reporting\nundertaken by a handful of dedicated journalists at a slew of statewide\norganizations. I'll never forget meeting Flint moms struggling to care for\ntheir children without tap water, or their anger and frustration at the\ndisregard they'd been subject to. Or kids whose futures might be shaped by\ncircumstances they were too young to understand. Some of those children\nreminded me of my son, then 5. I had to not think about that part too much.\n\nFrustrating, because the the failures that led to the Flint water crisis were\nall too clear, and none of it needed to happen.\n\nFrustrating because of the lying.\n\nPeople sometimes suggest that politicians and their representatives lie often.\nBut with a notable exception or two, they don't. Sure, politicians stretch the\ntruth, shade things to flatter themselves and their interests. But to lie\noutright is rare, in no small part because it's just too easy to get caught.\nMoral objections aside, it\u2019s just not worth it.\n\nFlint was different.\n\nFrom 2015: Year before water change, state knew of risks in Flint\n\n## The things they tried to tell us about the Flint water crisis\n\nAs the water crisis unfolded, state officials repeatedly tried to discredit\nthe Flint residents who wouldn\u2019t stop sounding the alarm, suggesting they were\nangling for new fixtures or plumbing repairs on the city or state's dime.\n\nThey attacked Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician/researcher whose medical center\nwas a regional catchment for blood-lead level testing in small children, and\nwho'd gone public with what she'd learned. A state spokesman described a U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency water expert as a \"rogue employee,\" and a\nVirginia Tech scientist as some sort of flim-flam artist.\n\nHanna-Attisha's data, then-Gov. Rick Snyder's press secretary wrote in an\nemail to me on Sept. 24. 2015, was \u201cspliced and diced.\u201d\n\nState officials took great pains to suggest that the decision to switch to\nFlint River water was made by the local elected officials who had been\ndisplaced by the appointment of an emergency manager, adopting the bizarre\npretense that state-appointed emergency managers, granted sweeping, unilateral\nauthority by state law, were ineffectual rubber-stampers of local decision-\nmaking. The state, the spokeswoman wrote, had \u201csevere reservations\u201d about the\nwater switch, signing off only at the behest of the Flint City Council.\n\nFlint\u2019s council did endorse the switch, but state law grants emergency\nmanagers absolute authority \u2014 and emergency managers are appointed because\nstate officials don\u2019t think the local electeds have made very good decisions.\nThat part about \u201csevere reservations\u201d was simply untrue \u2014 emails revealed\nafter the crisis broke made it plain that state officials were fine with the\nswitch, even in the face of evidence suggesting it would cost more to use\nriver water.\n\nFrom 2015: Snyder must act on Flint lead crisis\n\n## Hoist by their own data\n\nA few days after that Sept. 24 email from Snyder's press secretary, the Free\nPress obtained data intended to refute Hanna-Attisha's claims, showing that\nkids\u2019 blood-lead levels were fine. There was, if you're not a math person, a\nvery convincing chart. Presumably, they hoped we'd republish it, so the world\nwould see what the state wanted them to.\n\nAnd it might have worked, but for Free Press data reporter Kristi Tanner.\nTanner, also a statistics professor, requested additional numbers, performing\nher own analysis that determined the state\u2019s own data supported Hanna-\nAttisha's research. (You might say that the state's data had been \"spliced and\ndiced.\") A state health department official, we later learned from emails\nobtained under the Freedom of Information Act, wrote to other state employees\nthat her \"secret hope\" was to convince Tanner that lead poisoning rates in\nFlint hadn't changed.\n\nBut that\u2019s what covering the Flint water crisis was like \u2014 scrambling around\nto establish the facts of things that were plainly true the whole time: The\nwater was contaminated with lead, Flint residents were harmed, the state and\nits emergency managers were at fault.\n\nThe state's efforts to discredit the truth-tellers and to dodge blame\ndisplayed a diligence that hadn\u2019t been present in their duty of care for\nFlint. I cry when I\u2019m angry, so I cried a lot that fall.\n\nThe state eventually got straight on the need to acknowledge that there was a\nserious problem. A fatal outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease led to the criminal\ncharges against some state officials, but didn't result in convictions of the\nhighest-ranking members of state government, including Snyder. Flint received\nfunding to replace its lead service lines, and the city\u2019s water has met state\nand federal safety for years now.\n\nIt's not so easy to repair the toll on Flint residents.\n\n## There's no grant money to fix broken trust\n\nSome may never trust tap water again, or the government. And who can blame\nthem? The city and state opted not to treat the drinking water with an\naffordable mixture of chemicals called corrosion control that would have kept\nlead out of the water. For 16 months, state government lied to Flint,\ninsisting the yellow, foul-tasting water coming out of residents\u2019 taps was\nfine. A state-appointed manager waved off residents\u2019 concerns, with the\nunderlying assumption they were compelled by some sinister motivation.\n\nTen years later, I still can\u2019t say I really understand what happened in Flint,\nor why it happened at all.\n\nBut what I come back to again and again is the lying. The water crisis didn\u2019t\nhave to happen. But after it did, they didn\u2019t have to lie about it.\n\nNancy Kaffer is the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press.
