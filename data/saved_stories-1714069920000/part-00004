However, not much has been done on the front of\n> investigating the effect of scaling properties of different inductive biases\n> and model architectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so,\n> how does inductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence\n> upstream (pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a\n> systematic study of scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures\n> such as Transformers, Switch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic\n> convolutions, Performers, and recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive\n> experiments, we show that (1) architecture is an indeed an important\n> consideration when performing scaling and (2) the best performing model can\n> fluctuate at different scales. We believe that the findings outlined in this\n> work has significant implications to how model architectures are currently\n> evaluated in the community.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2207.10551 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2207.10551v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.10551arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yi Tay [view email] [v1] Thu, 21 Jul 2022 15:50:22 UTC (1,699 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Scaling Laws vs Model Architectures: How does\nInductive Bias Influence Scaling?, by Yi Tay and 9 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2207\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
