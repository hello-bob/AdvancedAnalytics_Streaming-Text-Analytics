Marie Kondo was on every TV, The\nMinimalists were in everyone's podcast feed, and I found myself confused,\nregretting not having started a blog or something years ago. I've always been\na bit of a minimalist myself, and it had never occurred to me that other\npeople might not be aware of that philosophy. I figured that others simply\nchose to live a more materialistic lifestyle, and that at any point anyone\ncould wake up and go \u201cwait, I don\u2019t actually want this crap\u201d and downsize.\nIt\u2019s not like I took a class. I don\u2019t even remember learning about\n\u201cminimalism\u201d until I was in my mid-twenties. I just took all those childhood\nafter-school specials to heart when they said \u201cthings don\u2019t matter.\u201d It was\nalso probably influenced by my time in the military, moving from duty station\nto duty station (or even just room to room) constantly and having to be able\nto pack my entire life into two bags I could carry by myself, sometimes with\nno warning.\n\nWhile the cultural bandwagon has moved on to the next fad we\u2019ll all forget\nabout in fifteen minutes, it\u2019s clear that minimalism left a mark. Before Marie\nKondo, if I told people I was a minimalist they assumed that I lived in a tiny\nstudio apartment with a sheetless twin-sized mattress in the corner, and\nperhaps a single plate and cup or something. These days people tend to\nunderstand that it instead means that I probably just have a smaller and more\nsparse home than average. Of course I still own things. That purple\nplanetscape poster in my video backdrop? I owned that for years before\nbecoming a content creator. And a small bookshelf\u2019s worth of print books (I\nexperimented with ebooks but didn\u2019t like it). Next to my desk, I have my\ncollege diploma and a poster for an award-winning play I did the sound for\nframed on the wall. I own multiple coffee mugs, some clothes I haven\u2019t worn in\na while, and some band posters and wall flags. But until I met my wife, I\ndidn\u2019t own a TV, or a lot of those \u201cknick-knacks\u201d that you see taking up space\non tables and shelves, or other wall decor, or most of our specialized kitchen\nappliances like an air fryer or food processor, or spare blankets, or any of\nthose extra things that some would argue make a house feel like a \u201chome.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinimalism,\u201d according to modern stereotypes\n\nMost people these days realize that my minimalist lifestyle isn\u2019t about having\nthe fewest toys, it\u2019s about only owning things that I really want \u2013 like\n\u201clong-term want,\u201d not \u201cwant while I'm looking at it but if I don\u2019t buy it I\u2019ll\nforget about it by the time I\u2019ve left the store.\u201d It also explains why my home\nis now so crowded. Before I met my wife, I was quite content with my $150\nworth of discount furniture in my 600-square-foot apartment. My wife, on the\nother hand, is not a minimalist. We met at the height of the Marie Kondo hype,\nand she was in the middle of being swept along by the bandwagon until it\nnearly drove her to a breakdown. It took her months to realize what had been\ninstinctual to me and what Kondo herself preached but somehow some people had\ntaken too far: minimalism isn't about \u201cowning the fewest things,\u201d it\u2019s about\nbeing intentional. By that definition, I consider my wife a minimalist. She\nhas since dialed back the downsizing \u2013 which she regrets in some cases, like\ngetting rid of all her manga and she\u2019s now trying to rebuild her collection \u2013\nand has instead replaced it with asking \u201cdo I really want this? Will my life\nbe less off without this long-term? Am I willing to spend my hard-earned money\non it?\u201d Our house has since filled up with stuff, which doesn't bother me so\nlong as we bought it with intention. To me, this is what minimalism has always\nbeen about: \u201cdo I really want this? Or do I feel pressured to have it?\u201d\nResisting the lure of mindless consumerism, \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses,\u201d and\nmaterialism.\n\nDigital minimalism is something we think about less, but I think it\u2019s equally\nas important. But I think the reason people don't think about it so much is\nthat it's relatively invisible. Physical materialism is easy to see. You don\u2019t\nhave to guess if someone is a hoarder or not, and you know you have way too\nmuch stuff once you start packing to move and get frustrated at the literal\nboxes of crap you haven\u2019t even touched or thought about in years (this is why\nThe Minimalists suggest a \u201cpacking party\u201d as a way to downsize: pack up as if\nyou\u2019re about to move and use that opportunity to throw away those things you\nhaven\u2019t used in years and no longer want). It\u2019s harder to see digital\nmaterialism and hoarding. Most of us don\u2019t hoard lots of physical tech: we\nmight have a box of old phones \u201cjust in case\u201d but we typically don\u2019t have an\nentire room full of laptops and hard drives or find ourselves struggling to\nmake another app fit into a moving box or getting annoyed cleaning yet another\naccount sitting on the counter. We also probably don't realize how much time\nwe spend online. So much of life has become digital today \u2013 from Teams and SMS\nmessages to social media and streaming services. While the inclusion of\nscreen-time analysis apps into modern smartphones by default has probably\nhelped a little, most of us probably don't think to check them. As such, it's\neasy to not think about our digital materialism. But our digital lives are\noften just as cluttered as our physical spaces. How many of us have accounts\nwe made once for a single purchase and never touched again? Or have old social\nmedia accounts from Myspace, Livejournal, Digg, and other digital graveyards?\nAs a privacy advocate I try to practice what preach but once I couldn\u2019t help\nbut notice a woman on a plane who was scrolling through her phone\u2019s home\nscreen as if looking for a specific app and she had over five pages of apps!\nThat\u2019s at least eighty apps! How can anyone need eighty apps on a single\ndevice? (And I think there were more screens I didn't see.)\n\nDigital minimalism is essential to privacy and security. The fewer accounts\nyou have, the fewer risks for a data breach. Ideally this would mean not\nsigning up for an account in the first place if you don\u2019t have to, but of\ncourse many of us have baggage from our past lives before we understood the\nvalue of privacy and security, which presents in the form of old accounts. We\nmay also, as I've discussed before, change with the times. Perhaps you once\nneeded an account for a job and now you don't. My recommendation here is to\ndelete those accounts. For accounts where the service refuses to delete them,\nremove as much data as you can then lock them tightly with a strong password\nand 2FA and hold onto them \u2013 I\u2019ve seen many stories where ownership or laws\nchange and suddenly you can delete those accounts at a later date. Digital\nminimalism extends beyond the internet and onto our own devices: just because\nyou have an account doesn\u2019t mean you need to have the app. Every app or\nprogram you install presents an opportunity for privacy violations \u2013 in the\nform of location tracking, as a common example \u2013 or presents a possible attack\nsurface that can be exploited if that app has any vulnerabilities. Personally\nI don\u2019t have any email apps on my phone. The whole point of email is that it\u2019s\nnot important and it can wait til I check my email that night. I also don\u2019t\nkeep a banking app on my phone because I don\u2019t need to: I never need to\ndeposit any paper checks these days, and I\u2019m financially secure enough that I\ndon\u2019t need to keep checking my account before every purchase to see if I have\nenough funds or not. This is just one example. I still have email, of course,\nbut I check it on my desktop. Last but not least, digital minimalism can\nextend into our actual usage. As I said earlier, many of us check out devices\nfar more often than we think we do. While I think for some of us that check is\nunderstandable \u2013 replying to a text or seeing what time it is \u2013 for most\npeople it\u2019s less productive than they realize: perusing social media, playing\na game, or something else. In the past several years, numerous studies have\ncome forward finding a strong correlation (though to be fair, not causation)\nbetween screentime and mental health issues like depression and anxiety. The\nterm \u201cdoomscrolling\u201d didn't catch on for no reason. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s also\nphysical harms I simply haven\u2019t been made aware of, though the dangers of\nsitting at a desk all day (computer or not) have been documented for some\ntime. Digital minimalism can improve multiple areas of your life at once. For\nthose who wish to really dive into this subject beyond a simple paragraph, Cal\nNewport literally wrote the book on digital minimalism, entitled Digital\nMinimalism, and I encourage you to check it out for more information. Aside\nfrom the advice given here, he discusses various ways to reduce how much time\nyou spend on-screen and goes over the research I mentioned earlier in more\ndepth.\n\nThe reason I kept in my lengthy preamble about the rise of physical minimalism\nin the public consciousness is because the same rules apply here. I have one\ngame on my phone \u2013 just one \u2013 and I\u2019m known to play it sometimes as I relax in\nbed before going to sleep. (It\u2019s Bloons Tower Defense 6, for those who are\nburning to know. Yes, of course it is, for those who are rolling their eyes.)\nOf course, I've checked all the permissions and I tend to use Blokada or a VPN\n(with DNS-blocking) activated at all times. I also used to keep my bank\u2019s app\non my phone back when I got paid in check a lot more and my bank didn\u2019t have\nan ATM nearby, allowing me to deposit checks via the app. I\u2019m currently an\navid Mastodon user, with plans to expand into Lemmy in the near future.\n\nAs with physical minimalism, the goal of digital minimalism isn\u2019t to have the\nfewest toys just because. The goal is to ask \u201cdo I get value out of this?\u201d The\nanswer for me, in some cases, is \u201cyes.\u201d I get value out of Bloons TD6. I get\nvalue out of Mastodon. I don\u2019t get value from Facebook, Twitter, Subway\nSurfers, or having email on my phone. I find them distracting and stressful to\nkeep up with. These are questions I encourage everyone to ask themselves\nregularly. As always, the answers vary from person to person. Some people\nreally may love the idea of having a tiny studio apartment with a single set\nof silverware and no TV. If you want to go full-Diogenes, I'm rooting for you.\nBut most of us don't, myself included. On the other hand, a film buff may get\na lot of value and joy out of a Smart TV with many streaming services. You may\nwant a dumb phone that offers only basic functionality, while others may get a\nlot of value out of a smartphone that offers a lot of different apps to help\nthem manage their schedule or business (my ADHD wife, as I\u2019ve said many times,\nwould be lost without cute-looking habit trackers, calendars, to-do apps, and\nmore). Most of us probably land somewhere in the middle. Much like threat\nmodeling, minimalism is an individual thing. My only \u201chard and fast\u201d rule is\nto be intentional. If you want games on your phone or a certain streaming\nservice, that\u2019s up to you, but ask yourself if you really want them or if\nyou\u2019re just doing it cause everyone else does and you\u2019re suffering from fear\nof boredom or missing out. Don\u2019t be afraid to pick up new hobbies, be alone\nwith your thoughts, and try new things. Digital minimalism can reap massive\nbenefits in your life if you\u2019re willing to let it.\n\nYou can find more recommended services and programs at TheNewOil.org, and you\ncan find our other content across the web here or support our work in a\nvariety of ways here.
