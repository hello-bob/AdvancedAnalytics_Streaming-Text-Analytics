Cloud Gateways is a fully managed, multi-region API\nmanagement solution. It\u2019s the easiest and fastest way to deploy performant,\nscalable, and highly available global API management infrastructure in the\ncloud using Kong Gateway with Kong Konnect, Kong\u2019s unified API platform.\n\nWith the new Cloud Gateways release, you can run distributed API management\ninfrastructure at the edge or internally with one click and in multiple\nregions. With Cloud Gateways, you can upgrade without downtime and elastically\nscale based on demand to handle all API traffic workloads. We offer support\nfor private networking to securely connect your cloud with Kong Konnect \u2014 all\nthis is part and parcel of Cloud Gateways.\n\nBefore we take the covers off this new capability, let\u2019s discuss the benefits\nyou\u2019ll enjoy as a customer.\n\n  * Fastest time to value: Go from nothing to managing, securing, and governing APIs in a matter of hours \u2014 not days or weeks. Now you can focus on driving business value, while Kong manages the underlying platform.\n  * Cost-effectiveness: Scale resources based on current demand, and pay only for what you use.\n  * Extended value: When running Kong Gateway and Kong Konnect in the cloud you can take advantage of automatic elastic scaling and maximum deployment flexibility. This enables customers to do things they\u2019re unable to do when running their API infrastructure on-prem, such as automated upgrades.\n  * Access to experts: Kong has vast experience running a modern global API infrastructure and employs a dedicated team of site reliability and security engineers. You can now leverage our expertise and deploy this resource to add value to your business.\n\nUnder the hood, Cloud Gateways is powered by Kong Gateway, the world\u2019s most\nadopted OSS API gateway technology. Kong Gateway is used to manage APIs both\nat the edge and internally with the same performance and speed, so you not\nonly get its performance but all the functionality and plugins (community &\nenterprise) that come with it. Kong Konnect operates on top of Kong Gateway as\nthe API management platform. Kong Konnect enables businesses to have\ncomprehensive governance and visibility across API gateways, Kubernetes\nfootprint, and service mesh through a single control plane and you have a\nwinning combination. Cloud Gateways is a core feature of Kong Konnect Gateway\nManager while also integrating with other Kong Konnect modules, like Service\nHub, Developer Portal, and API Observability.\n\nWith Cloud Gateways, Kong meets you where you are in your cloud journey. We\nbelieve customers will experience the most value from running Kong in the\ncloud as a managed service. Now with hybrid and fully managed versions of Kong\nKonnect, we\u2019re able to support customers wherever they wish to manage their\nAPIs.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into this new capability!\n\n## Multi-cloud and multi-region API infrastructure in one click\n\nRunning global API infrastructure is a tedious task. It\u2019s expensive, risky,\nand complex, but our businesses depend on it \u2014 because when our API\ninfrastructure experiences downtime, our applications go down. To complicate\nmatters, data has gravity and customers want to build, run, and govern their\nAPIs where their data and workloads reside.\n\nWith Cloud Gateways, you can leverage Kong\u2019s expertise in running a modern\nglobal API infrastructure for all your applications. By letting Kong shoulder\nthe burden of operating your API infrastructure, you can dramatically improve\nsite reliability engineering (SRE) productivity, reduce costs, and improve\nyour business\u2019 time to market. Cloud Gateways offers the best of both worlds\nto our customers, enabling them to run on dedicated infrastructure that isn\u2019t\nshared with any other customer but is extremely easy to use with a serverless-\nlike developer experience.\n\nChoose the regions where you want to run your API gateway infrastructure, and\nKong Konnect will provision, upgrade, scale, and run the infrastructure for\nyou. This allows you to define where your data will reside \u2014 putting data\nclose to users to reduce latency and satisfy compliance requirements for data\nresidency.\n\nChoose the clouds and regions where you want to deploy your API\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe Cloud Gateways GA currently ships with support for AWS in nine regions.\nAdding support for new regions is easy and entirely customer-driven, so don\u2019t\nhesitate to let us know about any other location you would like to use.\nSupport for Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is coming soon.\n\nAWS regional support at GA. We plan to add new regions on a regular basis and\nbased on customer demand.\n\nYou can provision as many Cloud Gateways clusters on as many Kong Konnect\nControl Planes as you need, or you can decide to re-use the same cluster\nacross multiple Kong Konnect Control Plane Groups.\n\nOnce provisioned, you can manage your Cloud Gateways clusters in Kong\nKonnect\u2019s Gateway Manager. Gateway Manager is the cloud management plane for\nall API gateway control planes provisioned on the platform and gives you both\nconfiguration functionality and data plane segregation to scale across\nmultiple teams and applications in the organization. You can also run Cloud\nGateways alongside hybrid self-managed gateways, enabling maximum flexibility\nand architectural freedom when choosing how to run your API infrastructure.\n\n## Autopilot and Custom modes\n\nThe ability to elastically adjust resources in response to changing demand and\nensure optimal performance during peak periods is one of the primary reasons\nfor businesses to move to the cloud.\n\nCloud Gateways supports two modes of scaling infrastructure to satisfy the\nneeds of every SRE team.\n\nIn Autopilot mode, we can pre-warm the cluster for immediate maximum\nperformance.\n\nWith Autopilot mode, Kong Konnect automatically and elastically scales to your\ncluster based on the number of incoming requests in real time to ensure your\nAPI traffic is always being served with appropriately sized infrastructure\nacross every cloud and region. This is the hands-off and easy-to-use\n\u201cserverless\u201d developer experience, but with all the benefits of running on\ndedicated infrastructure, which makes Autopilot truly a unique offering in the\nAPI landscape.\n\nWhen you need more control over the underlying resources that Cloud Gateways\nprovisions, you can switch to Custom mode and choose the type of instances you\nwant to provision, and for each region how many instances you want to run.\nEssentially, with Custom mode, you trade in the automated scalability that\nAutopilot offers for higher predictability and control of the underlying\nresources being provisioned.\n\nWith Custom mode, you have full control of the underlying infrastructure\nsizing.\n\nBy offering both modes, Cloud Gateways provides maximum freedom for our\nmanaged API deployment. Combined with self-managed Hybrid mode, Kong Konnect\nnow offers the most comprehensive and flexible API infrastructure deployment.\n\n## Private networking\n\nIt\u2019s critical that communication between Cloud Gateways \u2014 which runs on Kong\u2019s\nKonnect global cloud infrastructure \u2014 and your APIs takes place via secure\ncommunication. We offer two types of security strategies that can be\nimplemented to achieve an appropriate level of compliance with your security\ncontrols.\n\nFirst, Cloud Gateways offers native support for AWS Transit Gateway, which\nallows you to run our API infrastructure as securely as if it were running in\nyour own account. With AWS Transit Gateway, you can connect your Amazon\nVirtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-prem networks through a central hub. In\nKong Konnect, you can configure as many Transit Gateways attachments as\nneeded, and even reuse existing Transit Gateway attachments across a region\nbeing used by different Cloud Gateways clusters.\n\nWith private networking, you can securely link Dedicated Cloud Gateways with\nyour clouds.\n\nYou can further improve security by implementing mTLS across the API traffic,\nand L7 credential injection that can be validated by the receiving\napplications. And of course, firewall rules as well.\n\n## Smart Global DNS\n\nWhen starting a Cloud Gateways cluster, you can choose to make the APIs\navailable for public consumption on the internet \u2014 for edge and mobile\napplications \u2014 or to make them available only internally without any public\ninternet interface \u2014 exclusively for internal API traffic. As a matter of\nfact, you could have many clusters, each one of them with different API access\nsettings.\n\nYou can choose different API access settings for a Cloud Gateway cluster.\n\nWhen provisioning a cluster, each region will be load balanced automatically.\nYou can choose to either consume each region individually with a dedicated DNS\naddress for each, or you can choose to consume all regions by leveraging our\nsmart global DNS capability.\n\nWith Smart Global DNS, we\u2019ll automatically provision a DNS address that can\ncommunicate with all the clouds and regions where you\u2019ve deployed Cloud\nGateways and choose the best region to use for each API request based on real-\ntime performance and latency affinity. This means that implementing multi-\ncloud and multi-region connectivity with Kong Konnect is as easy as sending\nrequests to the Smart Global DNS, while at the same time being able to\nautomatically accelerate your API experiences by letting Kong Konnect choose\nthe fastest region to use at any given time.\n\n## Native support for Kong Gateway and automatic upgrades\n\nWith Cloud Gateways, we can leverage the entire Kong Gateway ecosystem,\nincluding all plugins, custom plugins, and all existing automation.\n\nThis means that migrating to Cloud Gateways from a self-managed version of\nKong Gateway is seamless and easy: the same configuration that you\u2019re running\ntoday can be easily imported into Cloud Gateways.\n\nYou can upgrade across different Kong Gateways versions with one click: Kong\nKonnect automatically provisions new infrastructure and slowly moves traffic\nover while automatically monitoring the API traffic for any errors. Upgrades\ncan be manually configured by selecting a new Kong version to upgrade to, and\ndifferent clusters can run on different supported versions of Kong Gateway.\nRollbacks are also automated.\n\n## Get started today\n\nWith Cloud Gateways, we\u2019ve built the easiest and the fastest way to run a\nmodern API infrastructure, and we plan to continuously add support for other\ncloud vendors and more regions.
