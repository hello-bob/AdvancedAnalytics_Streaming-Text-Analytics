The study involved 57 pairs of identical\nand 48 pairs of fraternal twins from the Beijing Twin Study, focusing on\nmetacognition and mentalizing\u2014abilities tied to understanding and controlling\none\u2019s cognitive processes and recognizing emotions in others, respectively.\n\nResearchers revealed that twins, regardless of genetic similarity, showed\nsimilar cognitive traits when raised in similar educational and socio-economic\nenvironments. This challenges previous beliefs about the heritability of these\ncognitive skills, suggesting that the family environment plays a crucial role.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The study differentiated between general intelligence, which is significantly heritable, and other cognitive abilities like metacognition and mentalizing, which appear to be more influenced by environmental factors.\n  2. Participants performed tasks that measured their ability to assess motion direction and their confidence in decisions, along with their capacity to evaluate others\u2019 mental states.\n  3. Findings indicated that twins with parents who had higher education and income levels displayed similar metacognitive abilities, pointing to the influence of shared family environments over genetics.\n\nSource: Cell Press\n\nTwin studies have proven invaluable for teasing out the effects of both\ngenetics and the environment on human biology.\n\nIn a study published April 2 in Cell Reports, researchers studied pairs of\ntwins to look at how the interplay of genetics and environment affect\ncognitive processing\u2014the way that people think.\n\nThey found that some cognitive abilities appear to be regulated more by\nenvironmental factors than by genetics.\n\nCognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, and\nplanning are considered to be the basis for general intelligence. Credit:\nNeuroscience News\n\n\u201cPast research has suggested that general intelligence\u2014often referred to as\nintelligence quotient or IQ\u2014has a heritability ranging from 50% to 80%,\u201d says\nsenior and corresponding author Xiaohong Wan of Beijing Normal University in\nChina.\n\n\u201cOur study may be the first to demonstrate that a different kind of cognitive\nability, known as metacognition and mentalizing, might be much more influenced\nby environment.\u201d\n\nCognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, and\nplanning are considered to be the basis for general intelligence. These\nfunctions regulate the way that people organize and process new information.\nBy contrast, metacognition looks at how well people understand and control\ntheir cognitive processes.\n\nMetacognition is important for developing learning strategies and is believed\nto be a predictor of an individual\u2019s successes in school and social\nachievements. Mentalizing describes the process of recognizing and\nunderstanding mental states like emotions and attitudes, both in ourselves and\nin other people.\n\nFor this research, the investigators recruited 57 pairs of adult monozygotic\n(identical) twins and 48 pairs of dizygotic (fraternal) twins from the Beijing\nTwin Study (BeTwiSt).\n\nThis is an ongoing, long-term study established in 2006 that includes\nextensive data like brain images and psychological surveys, as well as genetic\ninformation, on pairs of twins.\n\nThe twins were asked to perform tasks related to metacognition. These tasks\nconsisted of watching a cluster of moving dots on a screen and making a\nperceptual judgement on the net direction of the dots.\n\nThey were also asked to rate their confidence about their decisions. To\nmeasure mentalizing, the participants were asked to evaluate a partner\u2019s\nconfidence in their decision-making abilities.\n\nThe investigators found that pairs of twins who had parents with higher levels\nof education and higher family incomes have similar results to each other,\nregardless of whether they were identical or fraternal. These observations\nsuggested that familial environment was more likely to influence metacognitive\nabilities than genetics.\n\n\u201cOur findings were outside our expectations,\u201d Wan says.\n\n\u201cDecades of extensive research utilizing the classical twin paradigm have\nconsistently demonstrated the heritability of nearly all cognitive abilities\nso far investigated.\n\n\u201cOur findings emphasize that these shared family environmental factors, such\nas parental nurturing and the transmission of cultural values, likely play a\nsignificant role in shaping the mental state representations in metacognition\nand mentalizing.\u201d\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that there are limitations to this research and\nthat many more studies are needed. They plan to continue their research in\nthis area, including using population studies to further investigate what kind\nof specific parental nurturing factors and sociocultural values affect\nindividuals\u2019 metacognitive and mentalizing abilities.\n\nFunding: This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology\nof the People\u2019s Republic of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina, the Interdisciplinary Innovation Team of the Chinese Academy of\nSciences, and the BeTwiSt of Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of\nSciences.\n\n## About this neuroscience and metacognition research news\n\nAuthor: Kristopher Benke Source: Cell Press Contact: Kristopher Benke \u2013 Cell\nPress Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access. \u201cDistinct Genetic and Environmental Origins of\nHierarchical Cognitive Abilities in Adult Humans\u201d by Xiaohong Wan et al. Cell\nReports\n\nAbstract\n\nDistinct Genetic and Environmental Origins of Hierarchical Cognitive Abilities\nin Adult Humans\n\n## Highlights\n\n  * Human cognitive abilities can be categorized into a two-order hierarchy\n  * First-order cognitive abilities are primarily influenced by genetic factors\n  * Second-order cognitive abilities are more influenced by environmental factors\n  * Multiple family factors contribute to second-order cognitive abilities\n\n## Summary\n\nHuman cognitive abilities ranging from basic perceptions to complex social\nbehaviors exhibit substantial variation in individual differences.\n\nThese cognitive functions can be categorized into a two-order hierarchy based\non the levels of cognitive processes. Second-order cognition including\nmetacognition and mentalizing monitors and regulates first-order cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nThese two-order hierarchical cognitive functions exhibit distinct abilities.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether individual differences in these cognitive\nabilities have distinct origins.\n\nWe employ the classical twin paradigm to compare the genetic and environmental\ncontributions to the two-order cognitive abilities in the same tasks from the\nsame population.\n\nThe results reveal that individual differences in first-order cognitive\nabilities were primarily influenced by genetic factors. Conversely, the\nsecond-order cognitive abilities have a stronger influence from shared\nenvironmental factors.\n\nThese findings suggest that the abilities of metacognition and mentalizing in\nadults are profoundly shaped by their environmental experiences and less\ndetermined by their biological nature.\n\nTags\n\nbrain researchCell\nPresscognitionenvironmentGeneticsmetacognitionneurobiologyNeuroscience\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
