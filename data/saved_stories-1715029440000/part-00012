SVR.JS\nis a web server that runs on top of Node.JS, thus enabling server-side\nJavaScript on webpages. SVR.JS also has an integrated log viewer, log\nhighlighter, and user management tool. SVR.JS can run not only on Node.JS but\nalso in Bun (experimental support).\n\nGNU/LinuxManually\n\nInstall SVR.JS\n\nCopycurl -fsSL\nhttps://downloads.svrjs.org/installer/svr.js.installer.linux.20240506.sh >\n/tmp/installer.sh && sudo bash /tmp/installer.sh\n\nDownload SVR.JS installer for GNU/Linux How do I install SVR.JS? How can I\nupdate it?

SVR.JS is licensed under the MIT (or X11) license, and it's open-source,\nso there are no secretly planted backdoors. SVR.JS is running on Node.JS,\nwhich is also free software (also MIT/X11 license). We have a Git repository,\nso you can contribute to SVR.JS!\n\n### It's scalable!\n\nSVR.JS is running on Node.JS, which is a JavaScript runtime using event-driven\ninfrastructure, so SVR.JS is handling I/O-intensive operations pretty well.\nAdditionally, SVR.JS is by default running in clusters, so it withstands more\nrequests, server process hang-ups, and worker crashes.\n\n### It's secure!\n\nWe are putting the cybersecurity of your websites first. SVR.JS has a built-in\nURL sanitizer to prevent path traversal, protects sensitive data from brute\nforce attacks on HTTP authentication by default, and forbids website visitors'\naccess to sensitive configuration files. You can also configure SVR.JS to hide\nserver-side JavaScript files and hide the server version. This way, bad actors\nwill have a pretty hard time hacking your site (unless you're using vulnerable\nmods or vulnerable server-side JavaScript)! SVR.JS also has a built-in block\nlist, so you can simply block those bad actors that might take control over\nyour server. You can check which versions of SVR.JS are vulnerable.\n\n### It's configurable!\n\nYou can configure SVR.JS through config.json file. You can also install mods\nand use server-side JavaScript! Focus on developing JavaScript web\napplications with SVR.JS!\n\n## SVR.JS IN ACTION\n\nThis video shows the process of developing a basic web application showing\nuser's IP address using Node.JS and the SVR.JS API. HTML, CSS, and server-side\nJavaScript files are all in the public domain.\n\n## COMPARISON WITH COMPETITORS\n\nSVR.JS| lws| http-server| serve| Apache httpd^*  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nHTTP authentication  \nHTTP authentication| Yes (basic)| Yes (basic)| Yes (basic)| No| Yes (basic,\ndigest)  \nHTTP authentication brute force prevention  \nHTTP authentication brute force prevention| Yes, enabled by default| No| No|\nNo| Yes, via mod_security  \nHTTPS  \nHTTPS| Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes  \nOCSP stapling  \nOCSP stapling| Yes| No| No| No| Yes  \nCGI (Common Gateway Interface)  \nCGI (Common Gateway Interface)| Yes, via RedBrick| No| No| No| Yes, via\nmod_cgi  \nSSI (Server-Side Includes)  \nSSI (Server-Side Includes)| Obsolete, via Berno| No| No| No| Yes, via mod_ssi  \nServer-side JavaScript  \nServer-side JavaScript| Yes, via Node.JS and SVR.JS API| Yes, via Node.JS and\nKoa framework| No| No| Experimental, via mod_js  \nHTTP compression  \nHTTP compression| Yes (br, gzip, deflate)| Yes (br, gzip)| Yes (br, gzip)| Yes\n(gzip, deflate)| Yes (br, gzip)  \nURL rewriting  \nURL rewriting| Yes, built-in| Yes, via lws-rewrite| No| No| Yes, via\nmod_rewrite  \nHTTP/2  \nHTTP/2| Yes| Yes| Yes| No| Yes  \nLicense  \nLicense| MIT/X11| MIT/X11| MIT/X11| MIT/X11| Apache 2.0  \nArchitecture  \nArchitecture| Event-driven + Clustered| Event-driven| Event-driven| Event-\ndriven| Thread-based  \n  \n^*Apache httpd was included as a non-Node.JS-based reference Comparison done\non August 2023. Node.JS-based servers are compared based on source code\nanalysis from corresponding GitHub repositories (with exception of SVR.JS,\nwhich has self-hosted git repository).\n\nAs you can see, SVR.JS is more similar in terms of functionality to\ntraditional HTTP servers, like Apache httpd, and it's more advanced than some\nother Node.JS-based web servers. You can deploy your JavaScript web\napplications and use many features offered by traditional web servers without\nusing any reverse proxy (using a reverse proxy, like NGINX or Apache httpd is\ncommon when deploying Node.JS-based web apps).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is a web server?\n\nA web server is computer software that accepts HTTP requests and serves\nwebsites. Web servers can also be underlying hardware running web server\nsoftware.\n\n### What is SVR.JS?\n\nSVR.JS is web server software running on Node.JS that can host both static and\ndynamic content. With additional mods, SVR.JS can be used for different types\nof dynamic content and can even be used as a forward or reverse proxy. SVR.JS\nis licensed under a permissive MIT/X11 license.\n\n### How was SVR.JS created?\n\nSomeone in 2018 wanted to create a website, but he didn't know about setting\nup popular web server software like Apache httpd, NGINX, or IIS... So he\ncreated his own web server in Node.JS to serve his website! And he saved it in\na file called svr.js. Since then, this web server has been gradually turned\nfrom a web server intended for one website into a general-purpose web server,\nwhich is what SVR.JS is today!\n\n### How did SVR.JS get its name?\n\nSVR.JS got its name from the original name of the server script: svr.js, one\nof many generic file names for a server written in JavaScript.\n\n### What is Node.JS?\n\nNode.JS is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chromium's\nV8 engine. Node.JS is designed to build scalable network applications.\n\n### How can I use SVR.JS?\n\nYou can read its documentation to learn how to use the SVR.JS web server.\n\nResources and development\n\n  * Blog (Feed)\n  * Git server\n  * Contribute\n  * Change log\n  * Downloads\n  * Official SVR.JS mods\n  * Branding\n  * Thanks\n\nSupport\n\n  * Documentation\n  * Forum (Feed)\n  * Contact us\n  * Server uptime\n\nSocial\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * X (Twitter)\n  * Bluesky\n  * Odysee\n\nPolicies and Security\n\n  * Security\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023-2024 SVR.JS.
