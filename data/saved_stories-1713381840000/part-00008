By the project's own measures, NetBSD\n10 is the 18th major release. In other words, this is a significant release of\na mature OS.\n\nAmong the highlights are improved SMP performance, faster virtual memory, an\nimproved scheduler, which is aware of performance and efficiency cores, much\nimproved cryptography and security including WireGuard VPN support and support\nfor ARMv8-A security features, and wide-ranging improvements to the system's\ncode sanitizers, testing, and QA.\n\nNetBSD 10's default graphical environment is the very retro Ctwm, but it's\nquick and it works \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nIn a modest way, the team has been celebrating, including a talk at this\nyear's FOSDEM conference in Brussels, which The Reg FOSS Desk attended \u2013\nNetBSD 10: Thirty years, still going strong! \u2013 complete with a Google Slides\ndeck. In the talk, NetBSD developer Benny Siegert made several points,\nincluding that although NetBSD 0.8 came out in April 1993, work on BSD itself\nstarted in 1974, making the project as a whole 50 years old.\n\nNetBSD is the oldest of the BSD projects, and in some ways sticks closest to\nthe original. It supports a remarkable number of active \"ports.\" This is\nNetBSD's term for the different types of computer it can run on: eight \"tier\n1\" first-class supported platforms, plus another 47, which are also at version\n10. One of the project's mottos is \"Of course it runs NetBSD!\" and that's fair\n\u2013 there's no other OS in the world that runs on so many different\narchitectures and platforms.\n\nSiegert's talk addressed many of NetBSD's strengths and weaknesses compared to\nLinux, and for an overview, we recommend at least reading the slides. We were\nstruck, though, by how one question caught him without a ready answer: \"Why\nchoose NetBSD instead of FreeBSD?\" He hesitated before suggesting that the\ncommunity of NetBSD users and developers was smaller and friendlier, and thus\nmore welcoming than the larger FreeBSD community. He clarified to The Reg that\nwhat counts is:\n\nthe amount of contribution opportunity. In a smaller project and community, it\nis easier to find stuff to contribute to, and to find a place in the community\nas a contributor. By contrast, if the community is like a well-oiled machine,\nit may be hard to even find an angle where your contribution could be helpful.\n\nWe also spoke with kernel developer and release engineer Martin Husemann, who\nnoted a fringe benefit of the extended release process for version 10:\n\nAs a bonus we (mostly by accident and because it was simple) got support for\nthe Nintendo Wii added to the evbppc port.\n\nHis take on the inter-BSD comparison surprised us. When we suggested that one\ncomparison was wider hardware support than FreeBSD but comparable to OpenBSD,\nhe said:\n\nThe waters get blurry there \u2013 it used to be a much simpler thing, but\nnowadays, FreeBSD is a lot more portable than it used to be (probably mostly\nthanks to the OS X and related work by Apple), and OpenBSD has changed a lot\ntoo (and is diverging from NetBSD further). We at NetBSD of course do not\nbelieve the OpenBSD tale about their security focus and consider NetBSD at\nleast as secure (with less voodoo) \u2013 but that is hard to demonstrate or verify\non a technical level.\n\n### Taking it for a spin\n\nThe last time we looked at NetBSD, we checked out version 9.3 by installing it\nin VirtualBox. Emboldened by the familiarity gained in this experience, we\ndecided to try the new version on bare metal. We thought it would be a fair\ncomparison to use the same testbed as we did for OpenBSD 7.5 last week, a\nvenerable Thinkpad W500, a fairly fast Core 2 Duo machine with an ATI Mobility\nFireGL V5700 GPU, maxed out with 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. This isn't a\npowerhouse anymore, but we hoped that its older hardware would be well\nsupported, and previously it's proved surprisingly responsive with Haiku beta\n4 and Alpine Linux 3.18.\n\nIt's more than four years since NetBSD 9.0 appeared, and indeed we were\npleased to find that some of our niggles we experienced in the preceding\nrelease have gone away. The cursor keys worked as we expected, including on\nthe text console. NetBSD fails to boot from a Ventoy USB key, but written to a\nkey of its own it worked fine. The installer brought up Wi-Fi perfectly first\ntime \u2013 more than OpenBSD could until it could fetch the firmware over\nEthernet.\n\nThe installer continues to be cumbersome. It's aimed at lowest-common-\ndenominator hardware so it's mostly controlled by pressing letters and numbers\n(we guess because not all terminals have cursor keys). We couldn't work out\nhow to reformat the empty 32 GB FAT32 primary partition that we'd left ready,\nalthough OpenBSD did that no problem. We couldn't even find a way to just\ndelete it. In the end, we rebooted into Linux and deleted it from there.\n\nNetBSD happily created a partition for itself in the resultant gap, although\nit insisted on asking us about cylinders, heads, and tracks, none of which our\nSSD possesses. The installer created its own sub-partitions in its new primary\npartition, and installed itself into those.\n\nWe only tripped over one thing. We didn't want to put the NetBSD bootloader in\nthe MBR. As well as OpenBSD, this machine already has Windows XP64, Q4OS, and\nBodhi Linux on it. Trying to avoid overwriting GRUB meant that we got no\nNetBSD bootloader at all. There was no obvious option to put it into the root\npartition, as in OpenBSD. We rebooted, did an in-place upgrade (meaning from\n10.0 to 10.0, with all package sets turned off), and this time accepted the\ndefault bootloader option. It worked fine, and installed NetBSD's own\nbootloader to the root partition as we wanted. If you are dual-booting with\nLinux, then just as with OpenBSD on the same machine, you need to chainload\nthe NetBSD bootloader from GRUB \u2013 for example, here's how to do it from\nUbuntu.\n\nThis time around, we knew that after the install, we had to remain in the\nsysinst program a little longer and complete some more steps, which meant that\nby our first reboot, we had a working package manager, configured with online\nrepositories, a hostname, and so on. The experience was much smoother, and on\nour first boot, we got a graphical login screen and a \"lightweight and fairly\nminimal window manager.\" We experimentally installed a couple of small tools\nsuch as htop and neofetch. Everything just worked so we went for something\nbigger:\n\n    \n    \n    pkgin -y install firefox\n\n  * After delay due to xz, Ubuntu 24.04 'Noble Numbat' belatedly hits beta\n  * OpenBSD 7.5 locks down with improved disk encryption support and syscall limitations\n  * GCC 14 dropping IA64 support is final nail in the coffin for Itanium architecture\n  * PumpkinOS carves out a FOSS PalmOS-compatible runtime environment\n\nThat worked too, albeit not quite as we expected. We got a nightly build,\nrather than the latest release 124, and it pulled in some unexpected\ndependencies such as Python 3 and Wayland \u2013 although NetBSD doesn't support\nWayland. These things seem unrelated to Firefox, and we're strongly reminded\nof Poul-Henning Kamp's classic essay, A Generation Lost in the Bazaar.\n\nAdding other relatively substantial packages, such as Abiword, Gnumeric, VLC,\nor even the MATE system monitor, worked much the same. We also installed Xfce,\nusing the same outdated guide we used for NetBSD 9.3. Everything we tried\nworked fine, and Xfce gave us a more familiar, flexible environment, with\nluxuries such as adjustable font sizes.\n\nNetBSD 10 is a fascinating contrast with modern Linux. It works well. For\ninstance, our Thinkpad's sound chip and ATI GPU were detected, and the radeon\ndriver was installed automatically. Some of the rough edges we saw in 2022,\nsuch as cursor keys and packaging tools, seem to have been smoothed out.\n\nIt's somewhat smaller than a lightweight Linux, but not massively so. While\nthe default install only took a few gigabytes, with Xfce, Firefox, and a few\napps, it took 7.1 GB. In a Ctwm window, only 189 MB of RAM were in use, which\nis pretty good \u2013 but in an Xfce terminal window, that went up to 433 MB. We\ndidn't attempt to benchmark it, but under Xfce, it feels comparably responsive\nto the lightweight Linux distros on the machine.\n\nNetBSD is more of a traditional Unix-style experience than modern Linux. By\ndefault, even with a modern Linux desktop like Xfce installed, there are no\ngraphical tools for things like network connections, sound settings, or\npackage management. Although NetBSD does have its own hypervisor, NVMM, you\nwon't find modern features like containers in the standard repositories.\n\nNetBSD is bigger and arguably more complete than OpenBSD. Although both OSes\noffer a CD-sized installation ISO, NetBSD also has a USB installation image,\nwhich is 2.62 GB in size \u2013 but includes things like Wi-Fi firmware. This also\nmeans a quicker installation as packages are local so it pulls less from the\ninternet.\n\nThe package selection in OpenBSD is noticeably more rigorous, but there's a\nprice to pay for being so selective. For instance, NetBSD supports Bluetooth,\nwhile OpenBSD doesn't. We suspect that many people would consider that an\nacceptable price for seeing some possibly extraneous stuff in package\ndependencies. NetBSD also offers optional support for ZFS, although an older\nversion than in FreeBSD, but including somewhat preliminary support for root\non ZFS.\n\nThere are various reasons to try NetBSD. It's a shoo-in for old but still\ncapable hardware that's no longer supported by its vendor or by modern Linux,\nsuch as older RISC computers (PowerMacs or SPARC machines, say). And,\nremember, soon this will include 32-bit x86 hardware as well.\n\nIt's also a good choice if you want to improve or broaden your Unix skills.\nLinux is mainstream now, but a lot of older Unix machines still lurk inside\nbig businesses; others hold the internet together. If you want to learn how\nlow-level operating systems internals work \u2013 or how to work in a community-\ndriven development project \u2013 then nothing beats getting a command-line-driven\nOS running on bare metal. VMs are no substitute.\n\nIn the BSD world, there's a spectrum. FreeBSD is relatively mainstream,\nfeature-rich, and mainly supports modern or recent hardware, with containers,\nvirtual machines, and close integration with ZFS. Dragonfly BSD is\nexperimental and x86-64 only. OpenBSD is almost extremist, with a ruthless\napproach to clean code and secure design, even if that means dropping entire\nareas of functionality such as Bluetooth.\n\nNetBSD sits in the middle. It is a relatively small, clean, and simple OS.\nSmaller than FreeBSD, but more feature-complete and less rigorous than\nOpenBSD. Even so, all of them are modern OSes, with modern browsers and so on.\nAll of them are smaller, cleaner, and simpler than modern Linux. Even so, and\ndespite a bias towards server stuff, all are able to be used as full desktop\nOSes. They're not as experimental and restrictive as Redox OS or 9Front. As\nLinux continues to drown in code, it's good to know there is still a safe\nrefuge. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Unix\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AIX\n  * Android\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### More about\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Unix\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AIX\n  * Android\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### OpenBSD 7.5 locks down with improved disk encryption support and syscall\nlimitations\n\nThe most secure Unix-like OS to date?\n\nOSes5 days | 49\n\n#### Linux Foundation is leading fight against fauxpen source\n\nOpinion Shifts its transmission from vendor neutral into open source gear\n\nApplications5 days | 37\n\n#### VMS Software prunes OpenVMS hobbyist program\n\nVintage OS editions go the way of the dodo as VSI cranks up exclusivity\n\nApplications8 days | 54\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Notepad++ dev slams Google-clogging notepad.plus 'parasite'\n\nUpdated Imitator seemingly swiftly sunk from search after plea to users for\nhelp\n\nApplications8 days | 104\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity22 hrs | 19\n\n#### Open source versus Microsoft: The new rebellion begins\n\nOpinion Neither side can afford to lose, but one surely must\n\nSaaS2 days | 156\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware13 days | 184\n\n#### Microsoft to use Windows 11 Start menu as a billboard with app ads for\nInsiders\n\nThis wasn't what most had in mind when Redmond promised to make the feature\n'great again'\n\nOSes2 days | 105\n\n#### AMD to open source Micro Engine Scheduler firmware for Radeon GPUs\n\nAnd it was all thanks to peer pressure\n\nSystems12 days | 12\n\n#### PumpkinOS carves out a FOSS PalmOS-compatible runtime environment\n\nAnd rePalm may yet bring real PalmOS to new hardware ... even the Raspberry Pi\n\nOSes6 days | 12\n\n#### Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux\nKconfig\n\nParamount penguin forces more robust whitespace handling\n\nOSes19 hrs | 58\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
