Chances are, Mood Media has told you how\nto feel.\n\nThe first thing Jaime Bettencourt did last Friday morning was put on the new\nTaylor Swift album.\n\nThat might not seem unusual \u2014 hers was one of 300m streams that day on Spotify\nalone \u2014 but for Bettencourt, an album release is never just about the music.\n\nAs she swept through each Tortured Poets Department track, she found herself\nthinking about her clients. Who would be a fit for these songs? Where could\nshe imagine them playing? What kind of brand would be a match for the\nethereal, melancholic sound?\n\nBettencourt is senior vice president of global account management and\nmarketing for Mood Media, the biggest company you\u2019ve never heard of. If Chanel\nor Foot Locker or Krispy Kreme were Taylor Swift, Mood would be the Jack\nAntonoff behind their retail locations.\n\nMood works with companies like Starbucks to determine the alchemy that keeps\ncustomers coming back. (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images)\n\nMood Media works on all things vibe \u2014 a store\u2019s soundtrack, scents, and\nsignage \u2014 to capture a brand\u2019s personality through the senses. They\u2019re the\nglobal leader in a field known as retail atmospherics. And they\u2019re behind most\nof the stores you visit every day.\n\nMood Media reaches 165m people every day through 500k store locations around\nthe world, a huge share of the world\u2019s 3.5B total consumers. They\u2019ve puffed\nthe scent of campfire smoke through Yeti, and helped Ferrari customers design\ntheir own vehicles via tablet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about how we are helping to shape perceptions and activate\nbehaviors, and then drive business results for our clients,\u201d Bettencourt says.\n\n\u201cWhat we ultimately want to do is help brands create that emotional connection\nand drive loyalty. It\u2019s about feeling good.\u201d\n\nIn short, emotion matters. And Mood has become a master at the upswing,\nthrough a little art, a little science, and a lot of acquisition.\n\n#### Elevator music\n\nTo understand Mood, you first need to understand Muzak. And to do that, you\nneed to know about elevator music.\n\nBack in the 1920s, George O. Squier, the U.S. Army\u2019s chief signal officer\nduring World War I, made a discovery. He realized he could transmit signals\nacross electrical wires, no radio necessary.\n\nOriginally, the idea was to play music to the average citizen that way but the\nradio soon eclipsed Squier\u2019s tech. In 1934, he created a company to focus on\nservicing commercial clients like hotels, restaurants and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\nelevators, where nervous riders were eager for some soothing ambience. Muzak \u2014\na portmanteau of music and Kodak \u2014 was born.\n\nAn early ad for Muzak. (Mood Media)\n\nIn the 1950s, Muzak announced its music could improve workplace productivity,\nand released its Stimulus Progression, music programmed to rev up the\nheartbeats of the office workers who\u2019d be listening to it. The melodies\nstarted at a slower lilt than the average 72 heartbeats per minute before\nrising to a crescendo with some bigger brass sounds and then after 15 minutes\noffering a break.\n\n\u201cWe consider Music by Muzak a definite part of the modern office. It goes\nnaturally with good lighting, soft colors and intelligent layout,\u201d read one\n1965 testimonial from the National Gypsum Co. \u201cAfter the installation of\nMuzak, our best estimates show that efficiency increased 5%.\u201d\n\nEven the astronauts on Apollo 11 piped Muzak through the spaceship to calm\ntheir nerves.\n\nA Muzak ad advocates for the purchasing power of music. (Mood Media)\n\nBy the \u201970s, one of Muzak\u2019s rivals would change the audio landscape forever.\nYesco, in a bid to appeal to young boomers, decided to license and distribute\nhits shoppers already knew and loved. The pop songs encroached on and\neventually replaced Muzak\u2019s watered-down orchestral takes.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nThe two companies merged, and Billboard magazine would later write that\nYesco\u2019s foregrounding of \u201cforeground\u201d music led to Muzak transforming from\n\u201cpass\u00e9 elevator music specialist to dynamic, multi-faceted communications\ncompany.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, renowned \u201cking of marketing\u201d professor Philip Kotler\ncoined the term \u201cretail atmospherics.\u201d Academic research was beginning to back\nup what marketers had known anecdotally for years: Our environment can change\nhow humans (i.e., consumers) behave in it.\n\nStudies over the last 40 years have shown that music makes people stay longer,\neat more, and drink more wine at bars and restaurants. It enhances people\u2019s\ndesire to participate and customers\u2019 desire to build connections with staff. A\ncohesive theme in a store will sell more merchandise than a store that doesn\u2019t\ntell a story.\n\nAnd forget background music: The dulcet, forgettable Muzak that defined the\nsecond half of the 20th century has been widely replaced by foreground music\nby popular artists. (When Bettencourt heard Beyonc\u00e9 sing about Levi\u2019s jeans on\nthe new Cowboy Carter record, she thought, can Levi\u2019s use that?)\n\nMood\u2019s SVP Jaime Bettencourt can\u2019t go into a store anymore without scanning\nits environment for pros and cons. (Mood Media)\n\nIn an attempt to gain any edge they possibly can, stores, restaurants, and\ngyms are getting louder. Abercrombie & Fitch plays music just under the legal\nlimit for a commercial enterprise in which patrons don\u2019t wear ear protection.\nChoices like those are in service of shaping a customer\u2019s perception of the\nkind of wares they can expect to find inside (clothes for even the loudest of\nfrat houses, perhaps).\n\n#### Mood swings\n\nUp in Canada in the early aughts, a company called Fluid Music Canada was\nemerging as the purveyor of low- or no-royalty music to 15k locations across\nNorth America. Riding the coattails of American Idol\u2019s success, Fluid seized\nan opportunity.\n\nAs aspiring musicians uploaded their songs to American Idol Underground, a\nwebsite that promised possible exposure in exchange for the $25 upload fee,\nthey were also uploading away their rights. Fluid distributed those songs,\nplus the 3m others they bought from mp3.com. Five years in, the company was\nbringing in millions in revenue from businesses across the globe.\n\nIn 2010, Fluid acquired Mood Media, a company focused on signage and scent,\nfor a reported $206m. Fluid decamped to the States and rebranded as Mood\nMedia.\n\nFluid Music founder and former CEO of Mood Media Lorne Abony called the low-\nor no-royalty model \u201cthe secret sauce\u201d that fueled his company\u2019s growth. (Rick\nKern/WireImage)\n\nSince then, Mood has continued its path to acquisition domination, buying its\nway to becoming the global leader of everything your eyes, ears, and nose\nconsume when they walk into a store.\n\nIn 2011, Mood acquired Muzak in a deal reportedly worth $345m, boosting their\ntotal music library to 1.7m tracks.\n\nThe next year, Mood bought the agencies that handled visuals for Abercrombie &\nFitch, Burberry, and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nIn 2018, they bought Focus Four, a company that specialized in digital signage\nlike drive-thru menus. And last year, Mood bought Vibenomics, a startup audio\nin-store ad network, to help optimize (read: monetize) the hundreds of\nthousands of screens already in place in stores across the globe.\n\n#### The audio architects\n\nFor every client, Mood starts by creating a profile through a robust discovery\nprocess. Think a personality quiz, but way, way more nuanced.\n\nFrom there, Mood\u2019s staff of world-class DJs, music PhDs, and music designers\ndevelops curated (and ad-free) playlists. They analyze lyrics and tempo, and\nconsider innuendo and image, to develop a brand\u2019s audio persona.\n\nIt\u2019s different from a Spotify playlist for two reasons. One, it\u2019s legal to\nplay in a store. And two, it\u2019s crafted with human expertise taking everything\nfrom the mindset of your customer to the color palette of your walls and\nfloors into account.\n\nIf a brand wants a unique smell, they can create one from the 2.4k scents in\nMood\u2019s library. (Even that can be monetized: Some hotels sell candles with\ntheir proprietary fragrance, for customers who don\u2019t want to have to leave the\nmemories behind.)\n\nSculpted animals loom large in the windows of Burberry, one of the luxury\nbrands Mood partners with. (Christopher Jue/Getty Images)\n\nMood will also create content, from narratives to QR codes to drive-thru\nmenus, with a department of expert animators to propel customers deeper into a\nstore and a brand. Even the language they use to describe customers\u2019 behavior\n\u2014 \u201cdwell time\u201d and \u201cfootfall\u201d \u2014 sounds focus-tested.\n\nThey work to understand who their customers are and what they\u2019re trying to\naccomplish, and drill down into details as specific as where to mount an\ninformational screen and where to position a store\u2019s speakers.\n\nMood\u2019s own research monitors customers\u2019 skin response and eye movements to\ndetermine what\u2019s working:\n\n  * Consumers experienced a 40% uptick in mood when a store used scent to create an atmosphere\n  * Scent has led shoppers to underestimate actual shopping time by 26% when exposed to fragrances\n  * Shoppers paid 5% more attention to content when it was animated vs. static\n  * And customers were 17% more emotionally sensitive \u2014 in a negative way \u2014 when the store they shopped in was dead silent\n\nMost of all, customers want an experience they can\u2019t get from a website when\nthey walk into a store IRL.\n\nThe Hustle\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really just about community. Why am I drawn back?\u201d Bettencourt\nsays. \u201cI think it\u2019s really fun right now that brands are offering something in\nthe store that you can do, it\u2019s hands-on. Teach me something, create\nsomething. Personalization moments. Those are the ones I think are the most\nfun.\u201d\n\nBut for every brand, the nuance and recommendations and engineering all come\ndown to one question: \u201cHow do they want people to feel?\u201d\n\n#### \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\n\nLast night, I went to the mall for the first time in months. I needed to\nreturn a sweater, and grimaced when I walked into Aritzia, house music\nthumping through my chest.\n\nWalking back to the parking lot, I passed a bustling Sephora. The digital\nscreens shone with new arrivals and how-to guides, the ring lights at the\nvanity counters emitted the perfect cheekbone-lifting glow.\n\nThe store felt deliciously tactile in a way I\u2019d never really appreciated\nbefore. I smeared liquid blush on my cheeks, dabbed on a dramatic shade of lip\ngloss. The experience gave me the sensation of being a child, casting about\nfor a new toy she might like. The music was bouncy, and so was the vibe.\n\nI walked out feeling a little bit lighter \u2014 and not just because I\u2019d left $70\nbehind.\n\nTopics: Music\n\n## Follow us on social media\n\n## Get Smarter on Business and Tech Thanks for subscribing!\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\nWant even more business resources?
