on the\nother, the government has fiercely defended its ability to access wiretaps of\nAmericans' emails and phone conversations, often years after the fact and in\ncases unrelated to the reasons the wiretaps were ordered in the first place.\n\nThe 702 program works by compelling the cooperation of US businesses defined\nby the government as \u201celectronic communications service\nproviders\u201d\u2014traditionally phone and email providers such as AT&T and Google.\nMembers of the House Intelligence Committee, whose leaders today largely serve\nas lobbyists for the US intelligence community in Congress, have been working\nto expand the definition of that term, enabling the government to force new\ncategories of businesses to eavesdrop on the government\u2019s behalf.\n\nMarc Zwillinger, a private attorney who has twice appeared before the FISA\nCourt of Review, wrote last week that the RISAA legislation expands the\ndefinition of \u201celectronic communications service provider\u201d (ECSR) to include\ndata centers and commercial landlords\u2014businesses, he says, that \u201cmerely have\naccess to communications equipment in their physical space.\u201d According to\nZwillinger, RISAA may also ensnare anyone \u201cwith access to such facilities and\nequipment, including delivery personnel, cleaning contractors, and utilities\nproviders.\u201d\n\nZwillinger had earlier criticized the ECSR language this year, leading House\nlawmakers to amend the text to explicitly exclude certain types of businesses,\nincluding hotels.\n\nZwillinger noted in response that the need for those exclusions is proof\nenough that the text is overly broad; an exception that merely serves to prove\nthat the rule exists: \u201cThe breadth of the new definition is obvious from the\nfact that the drafters felt compelled to exclude such ordinary places such as\nsenior centers, hotels, and coffee shops,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut for these specific\nexceptions, the scope of the new definition would cover them\u2014and scores of\nbusinesses that did not receive a specific exemption remain within its\npurview.\u201d\n\nThis analysis quickly flooded inboxes on Capitol Hill last week, with some\nHill staffers and privacy experts quietly dubbing the ECSR language the \u201cStasi\namendment,\u201d a reference to the East German secret police force notorious for\ninfiltrating industry and forcing German citizens to spy on one another.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Science\n\nIt Takes Guts, Not College, to Fix Wind Turbines for a Living\n\nCaitlin Kelly\n\n  * Gear\n\nUse Apple Shortcuts to Build the Ultimate Daily Digital Journal\n\nJustin Pot\n\nDigital rights groups have pointed to Zwillinger\u2019s assessment while lobbying\nUS senators this week to vote against the RISAA. \u201cWhile the Department of\nJustice wants us to believe that this is simply about addressing data centers,\nthat is no justification for exposing cleaning crews, security guards, and\nuntold scores of other Americans to secret Section 702 directives,\u201d says Sean\nVitka, policy director at Demand Progress, which has taken to calling the ECSR\ntext the \u201cMake Everyone A Spy provision.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, Jim Himes, a Democrat from\nConnecticut, decried comparisons between the ECSR text and the East German\nsecret police, saying critics of the provision were \u201cmassively exaggerating\u201d\nthe 702 program's domestic reach.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on RISAA on Wednesday, though a few procedural\nhurdles remain. A two-thirds majority vote will be needed to get the bill to\nthe floor, and another two-thirds majority is required to prevent privacy\ndefenders from filibustering the bill. Once those hurdles are cleared,\nhowever, a simple majority is needed to send the FISA reauthorization bill to\nthe White House.\n\nThere is almost zero chance of US president Joe Biden rejecting the bill. The\nadministration has spent months sending top lieutenants to the Hill to\nchampion its cause. Biden\u2019s support for the 702 program stands in stark\ncontrast to the views of his campaign rival, former president Donald Trump,\nwho last week commanded his supporters in Congress to \u201cKILL FISA.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, the senior US senator from Oregon, argues that RISAA represents\n\u201cone of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance\nauthority in history.\u201d A leading privacy hawk in Congress, Wyden joined the\nSenate Intelligence Committee just prior to the 9/11 attacks and has served\nfor more than two decades.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed RISAA last week in a 273\u2013147 vote. An\namendment aimed at requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain\nsearch warrants before accessing wiretaps on US citizens was rejected after a\nvote on the amendment ended in a tie.\n\nMembers of the House Intelligence Community allied with the Biden White House\nand its spy agencies to defeat the amendment in what multiple House sources\nreferred to as a \u201ccampaign of fear.\u201d An hour before the vote on Friday, Himes\nopenly threatened US lawmakers supporting the warrant requirement, claiming\nthat if it passed, he\u2019d ensure those lawmakers face the brunt of the blame in\nthe wake of any future terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cIf we turn off the ability of the government to query US person data, the\nconsequences will be known soon,\u201d Himes said. \u201cAnd we will audit why what\nhappened happened. And accountability will be visited.\u201d\n\nFor years, the US government has claimed that it would be impossible to\nestimate the number of Americans who are being eavesdropped on under Section\n702. While statistics on the program are difficult to come by, it is known to\nhave captured hundreds of millions of individual calls, texts, and emails\nwhile in the process of targeting only a few million individuals. (The FBI\nclaims that, following a series of recent internal reforms, the 702 program\nnow targets fewer than 300,000 individuals per year.)\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Science\n\nIt Takes Guts, Not College, to Fix Wind Turbines for a Living\n\nCaitlin Kelly\n\n  * Gear\n\nUse Apple Shortcuts to Build the Ultimate Daily Digital Journal\n\nJustin Pot\n\nWhile Section 702 is hailed as a powerful tool against terrorism, cybercrime,\nand drug trafficking, US spy agencies are likewise authorized to target\nforeigners on the basis that they\u2019re believed to receive or possess \u201cforeign\nintelligence information,\u201d an ambiguous term legal experts argue could extend\nto a virtually unlimited number of activities with any number of tenuous ties\nto \u201cforeign affairs.\u201d\n\nWhile attempting to paint the program as merely a threat to Americans who\ncommunicate with Hamas, ISIS, or other designated terrorist groups, House\nIntelligence Committee chairman Mike Turner did little to reject claims last\nweek that the 702 program can also be aimed at foreign dignitaries and\npoliticians of allied European nations. Notably, the US does not recognize any\nforeign citizen abroad as having privacy rights, and US spy agencies may\nfreely target them without congressional approval. The 702 program exists\nbecause the government relies on US businesses to implement its wiretaps and\nensnares Americans\u2019 communications in the process.\n\nMuch of the criticism aimed at the 702 program stems from revelations in a\ndeclassified court filing last year that describes rampant abuse by agents of\nthe FBI, which is known to have scoured the wiretap database for information\non tens of thousands of American protesters, journalists, political donors,\nand at least one sitting member of Congress.\n\nThe FBI has implemented a number of internal policies in recent years designed\nto limit lower-ranking FBI employees from unilaterally authorizing searches\nthat target Americans\u2014reforms that Turner and other spy agency surrogates\nclaim are sufficient to stave off future abuse.\n\nThe program\u2019s critics, meanwhile, say relying on the FBI to internally police\nitself is a mistake, pointing to decades of surveillance abuses and political\nintelligence gathering carried out in clear violation of US law.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
