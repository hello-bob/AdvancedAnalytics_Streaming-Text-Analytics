A robust understanding of angiosperm evolution is required to\nexplain their rise to ecological dominance. So far, the angiosperm tree of\nlife has been determined primarily by means of analyses of the plastid\ngenome^3,4. Many studies have drawn on this foundational work, such as\nclassification and first insights into angiosperm diversification since their\nMesozoic origins^5,6,7. However, the limited and biased sampling of both taxa\nand genomes undermines confidence in the tree and its implications. Here, we\nbuild the tree of life for almost 8,000 (about 60%) angiosperm genera using a\nstandardized set of 353 nuclear genes^8. This 15-fold increase in genus-level\nsampling relative to comparable nuclear studies^9 provides a critical test of\nearlier results and brings notable change to key groups, especially in rosids,\nwhile substantiating many previously predicted relationships. Scaling this\ntree to time using 200 fossils, we discovered that early angiosperm evolution\nwas characterized by high gene tree conflict and explosive diversification,\ngiving rise to more than 80% of extant angiosperm orders. Steady\ndiversification ensued through the remaining Mesozoic Era until rates resurged\nin the Cenozoic Era, concurrent with decreasing global temperatures and\ntightly linked with gene tree conflict. Taken together, our extensive sampling\ncombined with advanced phylogenomic methods shows the deep history and full\ncomplexity in the evolution of a megadiverse clade.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Origin of angiosperms and the puzzle of the Jurassic gap\n\nArticle 06 May 2019\n\n### Fossil data support a pre-Cretaceous origin of flowering plants\n\nArticle 28 January 2021\n\n### Prickly waterlily and rigid hornwort genomes shed light on early\nangiosperm evolution\n\nArticle Open access 24 February 2020\n\n## Main\n\nFlowering plants (angiosperms) represent about 90% of all terrestrial plant\nspecies^2 but, despite their remarkable diversity and ecological importance\nunderpinning almost all main terrestrial ecosystems, their evolutionary\nhistory remains incompletely known. Since their Mesozoic origins^5,10,11,\nangiosperms have had a pervasive influence on the biosphere of Earth, shaping\nclimatic changes at global and local scales^12, supporting the structure and\nassembly of biomes^13 and influencing the diversification of other organisms,\nsuch as insects, fungi and birds^14. The evolution of terrestrial biodiversity\nis thus inextricably linked with the macroevolution of angiosperms, which can\nonly be shown using a robust and comprehensive tree of life. Reconstructing\nsuch a tree, however, is challenging because of the sheer diversity of\nangiosperms and the complex phylogenetic signal in their genomes.\n\nHigh-throughput DNA sequencing methods now enable us to reconstruct\nphylogenetic trees that broadly represent the evolutionary signal across\nentire genomes. Target sequence capture^15 has revolutionized plant\nphylogenetics by unlocking herbarium specimens as a source of sequenceable\nDNA^16, thus removing the chief sampling bottleneck that has obstructed the\ncompletion of the tree of life. Although previous work on plants has relied\nprimarily on the widely sequenced plastid genome^3,4,7, these technologies now\nallow us to tap into the evolutionary signal of the much larger and more\ncomplex nuclear genome. Universal nuclear probe sets, such as Angiosperms353\n(ref. ^8), have made target sequence capture consistently applicable across\nbroad taxonomic scales, opening doors to collaboration and data\nintegration^17. As a result, opportunities now present themselves to address\nfundamental questions in plant evolutionary biology, such as the origin of\nangiosperms, the tempo and mode of their diversification and the\nclassification of main lineages.\n\nHere, we present a nuclear phylogenomic tree that includes all 64 orders and\n416 families of angiosperms recognized by the prevailing classification^18,\nusing the Angiosperms353 (ref. ^8) gene panel. Our sampling of 7,923\nangiosperm genera (represented by 9,506 species) amounts to a 15-fold increase\ncompared to previous work^9. Leveraging a dataset of 200 fossil calibrations,\nwe scale the tree to time, effectively capturing evolutionary divergences for\nall but the most recent 15% of angiosperm history. Although our tree broadly\nsupports relationships predicted by previous studies primarily based on\nplastid data, it also shows previously unknown relationships and highlights\nsome that remain intractable despite a vast increase in data. Gene tree\nconflict is tightly linked to diversification across the tree. We find\nevidence for high levels of conflict associated with an early burst of\ndiversification, which is followed by an extended period of constant\ndiversification rates underpinned by a tapestry of varied lineage-specific\npatterns. Diversification then increases in the Cenozoic Era, potentially\ndriven by global climatic cooling. Our results highlight the fundamental role\nof botanical collections in reconstructing the tree of life to illuminate\nlong-standing questions in angiosperm macroevolution.\n\n## The angiosperm tree of life\n\nOur phylogenetic tree includes 58% of the approximately 13,600 currently\naccepted genera of angiosperms (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1; ref. ^2).\nTogether, the 7,923 genera encompass 85.7% of total known angiosperm species\ndiversity. We produced data for 6,777 of these genera; before this study,\n3,154 of these lacked publicly available genomic data, of which 393 lacked any\nform of DNA sequence data. For the remaining genera, data were obtained from\npublic repositories. Sampling for this project was possible thanks to the\ncollaborative effort of many biodiversity institutions from around the world,\nincluding 163 herbaria in 48 countries. More than one-third of species were\nsourced directly from herbarium specimens, some dating back nearly 200 years.\nMany phylogenetically problematic lineages with unconventional genome\nevolution were sampled, such as holoparasites, mycoheterotrophs and aquatics.\nMany of the species included are threatened and four are extinct (or extinct\nin the wild). The resulting tree of life presented here is one of the largest\ngenomic trees generated yet for angiosperms as a whole.\n\nFig. 1: Time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for angiosperms based on 353 nuclear\ngenes.\n\nAll 64 orders, all 416 families and 58% (7,923) of genera are represented. The\nyoung tree is illustrated here (maximum constraint at the root node of 154\nMa), with branch colours representing net diversification rates. Black dots at\nnodes indicate the phylogenetic placement of fossil calibrations based on the\nupdated AngioCal fossil calibration dataset. Note that calibrated nodes can be\nolder than the age of the corresponding fossils owing to the use of minimum\nage constraints. Arcs around the tree indicate the main clades of angiosperms\nas circumscribed in this paper. ANA grade refers to the three consecutively\ndiverging orders Amborellales, Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales. Plant\nportraits illustrating key orders were sourced from Curtis\u2019s Botanical\nMagazine (Biodiversity Heritage Library). These portraits, by S. Edwards, W.\nH. Fitch, W. J. Hooker, J. McNab and M. Smith, were first published between\n1804 and 1916 (for a key to illustrations see Supplementary Table 2). A high-\nresolution version of this figure can be downloaded from\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10778206 (ref. ^55).\n\nFull size image\n\n### The phylogenomic challenge\n\nLarge genomic datasets present challenges to phylogenetic inference. One issue\nis accurate homology assessment, which proved intractable across the full span\nof our dataset, even with the most advanced multiple sequence alignment\nmethods. Another challenge is the efficient search of tree space based on gene\nmatrices that have many more taxa than characters. We overcame both challenges\nwith a divide-and-conquer approach (Supplementary Fig. 1). First, we computed\na backbone species tree with sampling limited to five species per family\n(1,336 (15%) samples in total) and targeted to represent their deepest nodes\n(Supplementary Fig. 2). We used the backbone species tree to delimit taxon\nsubsets for the construction of order-level gene alignments, which were then\nmerged into global alignments. We then computed global gene trees from the\nglobal alignments, using backbone gene trees (inferred during the estimation\nof the backbone species tree) as topological constraints to reduce tree space\nwhile still letting gene trees differ from each other. The smaller number of\nsamples in the backbone dataset permits a more thorough search of tree space,\nresulting in greater confidence at deeper nodes than could be achieved in an\nunconstrained global analysis. This approach allows a trade-off between\ncomprehensive sampling and tree search robustness while accommodating putative\ndiscordance among gene trees. Finally, we used the global gene trees to\ngenerate a global species tree in a multispecies coalescent framework\n(Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nA widespread concern in phylogenomic analysis is the presence of undetected\ngene copies. Our findings are unlikely to be affected by this because we used\ngenes that have been selected to be mostly single-copy across green\nplants^8,9. Although gene duplication cannot be ruled out^19, the methods we\nused have been shown to be robust to the presence of paralogues^20. In\naddition, a full assessment of orthologues was not computationally tractable\nbut should be undertaken when methods become available to fully unravel the\ncomplexity of genome evolution at this scale^21.\n\n### Phylogenetic insights from nuclear data\n\nOur results broadly corroborate the prevailing understanding of angiosperm\nphylogenetic relationships, which rests on three decades of molecular\nsystematic research largely built on data from the plastid genome^3,4,18,22.\nWe recover all main lineages of angiosperms, namely Amborellales, Nymphaeales,\nAustrobaileyales, Ceratophyllales and the three larger clades, monocots,\nmagnoliids (including Chloranthales) and eudicots (Figs. 1 and 2). Although\nsome of the relationships among those groups, such as the placement of\nAmborellales as sister group to all other angiosperms, are well-established\nand confirmed here, others, such as the placement of Ceratophyllales, which\nhave been unstable in previous work^4,9, remain inconclusive in our results.\nDespite the contrasting biological properties of the nuclear and plastid\ngenomes (for example, size, copy number, mode of inheritance, recombination\nand evolutionary rate), which can lead to conflicting phylogenetic results,\nour findings largely support the mostly plastid-based phylogenetic\nclassification of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group^18 (Extended Data Fig. 1).\nFor example, 58 of the 64 now accepted orders and 406 of the 416 families are\nrecovered as monophyletic (excluding artefacts; Supplementary Table 1). The\nmost striking exception is the non-monophyly of Asteraceae, the largest\nangiosperm family comprising the sunflowers and their relatives. Our tree also\nconfirms 85% of the relationships among families recovered by ref. ^4 using\nplastid genomes (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nThe overall stability of established relationships is unevenly distributed\nacross the tree, as observed in contrasting patterns in the main eudicot\nclades, the asterids and rosids, which account for 35% and 29% of angiosperm\ndiversity, respectively^2. The relationships among main orders of asterids are\nstable^9, with a clade comprising Ericales and Cornales sister to all other\nasterids and the remaining 15 orders divided in two main clades (campanulids\nand lamiids), both long characterized by their contrasting floral ontogeny^23.\nRelationships contrasting with the status quo are mostly restricted to small\norders, such as the paraphyly of Aquifoliales, Bruniales and Icacinales. These\nDNA-defined orders were consistently recovered as highly supported clades in\nplastome analyses^4,24 but they lack morphological cohesion. Given their\nplacement in our phylogenetic tree and unique morphologies, these changes,\nalthough small, will alter our understanding of the evolution of asterids.\n\nBy contrast to asterids, our findings in rosids conflict markedly with\nplastid-based evidence. First, we resolve Saxifragales, rather than Vitales^4,\nas sister to the remainder of rosids. In rosids, the fabid and malvid\nsubclades, recovered as reciprocally monophyletic by plastid data^4,22, are\nsubstantially rearranged into a grade of four orders subtending two well-\nsupported sister clades, which we designate here as the recircumscribed fabids\nand malvids. The new fabid clade (Cucurbitales, Fabales, Fagales and Rosales)\nhas long been characterized by symbiotic nitrogen fixation^25. In the new\nmalvids (Brassicales, Celastrales, Huerteales, Malpighiales, Malvales,\nOxalidales, Picramniales and Sapindales), Oxalidales is resolved as two\nindependent lineages, the core emerging closer to Brassicales, Malvales and\nSapindales, whereas Huaceae emerges in the position conventionally occupied by\nOxalidales, that is, closer to Malpighiales and Celastrales (the former\nCelastrales\u2013Oxalidales\u2013Malpighiales (COM) clade^18).\n\nNotwithstanding the many well-supported confirmatory and new findings, some\nkey relationships remain contentious and cannot be resolved by our data. These\nareas of high gene tree conflict often coincide with biological processes that\nconfound phylogenetic inference. For example, the uncertain placements of\neudicot orders Caryophyllales, Dilleniales and Gunnerales are probably\nimpacted by key whole genome duplications^9,26. The poor support for\nrelationships among magnoliids, monocots, eudicots and Ceratophyllales might\nbe explained by ancient hybridization events, such as that recently proposed\nfor the origin of the monocots^27. These examples highlight the importance of\nareas of poor resolution as waymarkers to biological events meriting further\nstudy.\n\n## Time frame for angiosperm macroevolution\n\nOur tree was analysed in combination with a dataset of 200 fossil calibrations\n(originally described in ref. ^5, with modifications) to estimate divergence\ntimes and rates of diversification. Because the age of angiosperms is\nuncertain^28, we dated the tree with two different maximum constraints at the\nangiosperm crown node (154 and 247 million years ago (Ma), termed the young\ntree and old tree, respectively), which reflect realistic upper and lower\nbounds for the maximum age of this node^5,28. These different constraints\naffected age estimates across angiosperms (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary\nFig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3). For example, in the young tree, stem node\nage estimates for Nymphaeales, Austrobaileyales and Ceratophyllales were 153,\n152 and 152 Ma, respectively, whereas in the old tree the equivalent age\nestimates were 245, 244 and 243 Ma. Likewise, for larger clades such as\nmagnoliids, monocots and eudicots, crown node age estimates were 151, 149 and\n151 Ma in the young tree and 238, 237 and 241 Ma in the old tree. This range\nin age estimates is consistent with the most comprehensive comparable study^5\n(Extended Data Fig. 3) but our trees provide age estimates for a further 7,000\nnodes. In subsequent analyses, we indicate if differing age estimates between\nthe young tree and old tree cause substantially different interpretations of\nangiosperm diversification.\n\nWith our sampling across angiosperms, we ensured that deeper branching events\nleading to extant lineages are comprehensively represented, while recognizing\nthat extinct lineages are inaccessible to genomic methods. However, our dated\ntrees are sparsely sampled at the species-level, meaning that branching events\nare incompletely represented towards the present, limiting diversification\ninferences in that time window. To address this, we developed a simulation-\nbased approach to quantify the sampling fraction through time. For both dated\ntrees, the lineage representation begins to drop substantially (below 75%)\naround 50 Ma (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, the most dramatic fall in\nlineage representation occurs in the most recent 20 Myr, in which it falls\nfrom around 50% to slightly more than 1% at present. Our investigation of\nangiosperm diversification should be interpreted with this broader context in\nmind. In particular, inferences in the most recent 20 Myr may be updated in\nthe future with denser species sampling.\n\n## The diversification of angiosperms\n\n### Diversification linked to gene conflict\n\nWe used our dated trees to reconstruct both diversification and gene tree\nconflict across a broad range of temporal and phylogenetic scales and\ninvestigate the relationship between them. We show that throughout angiosperm\nmacroevolution, elevated gene tree conflict was tightly associated with\nelevated diversification. At a general level, this relationship is visible by\nsimply comparing estimated diversification rates with gene tree conflict\nacross all angiosperms through time (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, in a branch-specific\nanalysis using the temporal duration of branches as a proxy for the rate at\nwhich branches are diversifying, we also show that conflict and\ndiversification rate are positively correlated (Extended Data Fig. 4) (P <\n0.001, r^2 = 0.51).\n\nTo characterize the theoretical basis of this relationship, we simulated\nspecies trees with corresponding gene trees under different diversification\nscenarios in a multispecies coalescent framework. These simulations showed\nthat gene tree conflict is positively correlated with diversification when\ncaused by incomplete lineage sorting, assuming that effective population size\nis constant (Supplementary Fig. 7). Our empirical results are largely\nconsistent with such a scenario. Other potential causes of gene tree conflict\nsuch as whole genome duplication and hybridization may also be associated with\nrapid diversification and have been recorded extensively throughout\nangiosperms^29,30. Overall, however, gene tree conflict seems to be reliable\ncorroborating evidence for investigating temporal patterns of angiosperm\ndiversification.\n\n### Early burst of angiosperm diversification\n\nOur lineage-through-time (LTT) heatmap and diversification rate estimates\nthrough time both indicate an explosive early phase of diversification of\nextant lineages during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Periods (Fig. 2b\nand Fig. 3a). An early burst of angiosperm diversification, popularized as\n\u2018Darwin\u2019s abominable mystery\u2019^31,32, is expected given the sudden emergence of\ndiverse angiosperm fossils during the Early Cretaceous^11,33,34,35.\nPhylogenetic studies based on single or few genes have also implied that\nangiosperms diversified rapidly in the Early Cretaceous^7,36,37,38. Our dated\ntree corroborates the existence of a distinct early burst of diversification,\nassociated with high levels of gene tree conflict (Fig. 3a and Supplementary\nFig. 8), further increasing our confidence in this finding.\n\nFig. 2: Diversification dynamics across angiosperms.\n\nThe results illustrated are based on the young tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 154 Ma). a, Time-calibrated summary phylogenetic tree with LTT\nplots rendered as heatmaps for all orders with four or more sampled genera.\nThe log-transformed increase in the number of lineages is depicted in 5 Myr\nintervals, omitting crown nodes, which disproportionately altered the\nvisualization; crown node locations are indicated by vertical lines. The\nyellow to blue colour scale represents steep to shallow slopes. For each\norder, the numbers of sampled and total genera are provided. b, A global LTT\nheatmap for all angiosperms is shown at the bottom of the figure as a whole.\n\nFull size image\n\nFig. 3: Angiosperm-wide diversification and gene tree conflict through time.\n\nThe results illustrated are based on the young tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 154 Ma). See Extended Data Fig. 5 for results based on the old\ntree. a, Estimated net diversification rate through time (yellow, left y axis)\nand the level of gene tree conflict through time (blue, right y axis). Net\ndiversification rates are estimated with a model that enables speciation rates\nto vary between time intervals; the line is the posterior mean and the yellow\nshaded area is the 95% highest posterior density. Gene tree conflict is\ncalculated from the percentage of gene trees that do not share a congruent\nbipartition with each species tree branch, with the plotted value being the\nmean across all species tree branches that cross each 2.5 Myr time slice. b,\nCumulative percentage of extant orders and families that have originated\nthrough time. In both a and b, the background grey-scale gradient is the\nestimated percentage of extant lineages represented in the species tree\nthrough time (sampling fraction).\n\nFull size image\n\nMore than 80% of extant angiosperm orders originated during the early burst of\ndiversification (Fig. 3b). Although not strictly comparable because of their\nsubjective delimitation, orders represent the main components of angiosperm\nfeature diversity, which have arisen rapidly after the crown node of\nangiosperms. In the young tree (Fig. 3), the early burst occurs during the\nCretaceous, consistent with the hypothesis that a Cretaceous terrestrial\nrevolution was triggered by the establishment of main angiosperm\nlineages^14,39,40. More controversially, the old tree places the early burst\nin the Triassic Period (Extended Data Fig. 5), which is dramatically at\nvariance with the palaeobotanical record^33,34, highlighting that current\nmolecular dating methods are unable to resolve the age of angiosperms^28.\n\n### A tapestry of lineage-specific histories\n\nFollowing the early burst, overall rates of diversification across angiosperms\ncontinued at a lower, constant pace for at least 80 Myr (Fig. 3a), during\nwhich time around three-quarters of all families originated (Fig. 3b). As\nexpected, this phase of slower diversification was associated with lower\nlevels of gene tree conflict. Despite the constancy of overall rates,\ndiversification during this period was underpinned by a complex tapestry of\nlineage-specific patterns. This is illustrated by the LTT heatmap, which shows\nprofound differences in diversification trajectories among orders (Fig. 2) and\nby the estimation of around 160 lineage-specific diversification rate shifts\nin angiosperms, most of which occur during this period. These rate shifts have\na widespread phylogenetic distribution, with most orders containing at least\none rate shift and many containing several nested shifts (Supplementary Table\n4). The importance of nested rate shifts is highlighted extensively in\ndiscussions of evolutionary radiation^41,42 and underpins the continual\nresponse of diversification to dynamic extrinsic and intrinsic conditions.\nHowever, because these rate shifts are temporally scattered, as also shown by\nref. ^43, they do not lead to observable global rate shifts across\nangiosperms.\n\n### A Cenozoic diversification surge\n\nA second surge in angiosperm diversification occurred during the Cenozoic Era\n(Fig. 3a). The occurrence of this surge, despite the already high standing\ndiversity of angiosperms at the time, suggests that diversification was\nunaffected by diversity-dependent processes, that is, the filling of available\nniche space as clades diversify^44. Instead, this finding is consistent with\npreviously proposed positive feedbacks between increased diversity and\nincreased rates of diversification in angiosperms^14, alongside more positive\nfeedbacks, for example, between angiosperm and insect diversification^45,46.\nAlternatively, global climatic cooling during the Cenozoic acting as a driver\nof angiosperm diversification could explain this finding^7,47,48,49.\nImportantly, an even larger Cenozoic surge would probably be inferred with\nincreased sampling that addresses the under-representation of branching events\nin the recent time window. The temporal distribution of lineage-specific\ndiversification rate shifts may offer some insight into the cause of the\nCenozoic surge. Many of the largest diversification rate increases occur\nduring the Cenozoic, whereas the number of diversification rate decreases\ndeclines markedly during this period (Fig. 4). These large rate increases may\nunderpin the Cenozoic surge. The expansion of taxon sampling should be given\npriority to confirm these patterns.\n\nFig. 4: Summary of lineage-specific diversification rate shifts estimated by\nBAMM.\n\nThe results illustrated are based on the young tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 154 Ma). See Extended Data Fig. 6 for results based on the old\ntree. a, Diversification rate increases per LTT. The colour corresponds to the\naverage magnitude of the rate increases during the time period. b, Equivalent\nto a but for rate decreases. c, Equivalent to a but focusing on the largest\n25% of diversification rate increases. In a, b and c, the number of shifts is\nfrom the maximum a posteriori shift configuration with the prior for the\nnumber of shifts set to 10 and the background grey-scale gradient is the\nestimated percentage of extant lineages represented in the species tree\nthrough time (sampling fraction).\n\nFull size image\n\n## Synthesis\n\nThe nuclear phylogenomic framework presented here is the result of an ongoing\ninitiative to complete the tree of life for all angiosperm genera^50, a\nmilestone in our understanding of angiosperm evolutionary relationships. This\nstudy not only sheds light on much of the deep diversification history of the\nangiosperms but also lays foundations for future work towards a species-level\ntree^50. The standardized panel of nuclear genes in our dataset paves the way\nfor more collaborations and data integration^17,51, while the open\navailability of universal tools to sequence them (that is, Angiosperms353\nprobes^8) has made nuclear genomic data more accessible at relatively low\ncost. The accelerating uptake of this approach^52,53,54, which is readily\napplicable to herbarium collections^16, indicates that large volumes of data\nwill soon become available for a wide range of applications in plant\ndiversity, systematic and macroevolutionary research.\n\nOur fossil-calibrated, phylogenomic tree enables a range of unique insights\ninto broad-scale diversification dynamics of angiosperms, substantiating the\nearly burst of diversification anticipated by Darwin while illuminating the\ncomplexity and conflict in the lineage histories underlying it. This sets the\nscene for future research, extending these investigations to shallower\nphylogenetic scales or digging more deeply into the data to discover the\nprocesses driving angiosperm diversification, such as genomic conflict,\npolyploidy, selection, trait evolution and adaptation. The challenges brought\nby the scale of this dataset and its ongoing expansion may also catalyse the\ndevelopment of methods which take full advantage of the global proliferation\nof genomic data.\n\n## Methods\n\nAs part of the Plant and Fungal Trees of Life (PAFTOL) Project at the Royal\nBotanic Gardens, Kew^50, we assembled a nuclear genomic dataset consisting of\nnewly generated data and data mined from public repositories. Our objective\nwas to sample at least 50% of all angiosperm genera, with genera selected in a\nphylogenetically representative manner on the basis of published research. To\navoid excessive imbalance in the tree, we included only one sample per species\nand a maximum of three species per genus. When several samples were available\nfor the same species, we selected those with the largest amount of data, that\nis, more genes and a higher sum of gene length. For genera with several\nspecies available, the criterion for selection was primarily phylogenetic\nrepresentation followed by amount of data. One species of each gymnosperm\nfamily was selected to form the outgroup, totalling 12 samples.\n\nWe produced target sequence capture data for 7,561 samples using the universal\nAngiosperms353 probe set^8 following established laboratory protocols^50,56.\nWe complemented our dataset with publicly available data for 2,054 species,\nsourced from the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative^9 (OneKP; 564\nsamples), annotated and unannotated genomes (151 samples) and the sequence\nread archive (SRA; 1,339 samples), the last including transcriptomes (for\nexample, see refs. ^57,58) and target capture data (for example, see refs.\n^59,60). To standardize taxonomy and nomenclature, all species names and\nfamilies were harmonized with the World Checklist of Vascular Plants^2 and\norders with APG IV if possible^18.\n\n### Sequence recovery\n\nSequence recovery was carried out in two ways, depending on the type of input\ndata. For recovery on the basis of raw reads, that is, Angiosperms353 data or\ndata mined from the SRA, we used HybPiper v.1.31 (ref. ^61), embedded in a\nbespoke pipeline (https://github.com/baileyp1/PhylogenomicsPipelines). Raw\nreads were trimmed using Trimmomatic^62 to remove low-quality bases and short\nsequences. In HybPiper, reads were initially binned into genes using BLASTN\nand an amino acid target file as reference (Supplementary File 1). Individual\ngenes were assembled de novo using SPADES^63 and refined by joining and\ntrimming gene contigs to match coding regions using Exonerate^64. For genes\nwith paralogue warnings, only the putative orthologue as identified by\nHybPiper was used. Exclusion of genes with several copies per species has been\nshown to have negligible impact on species tree inference when it is performed\nunder a multispecies coalescent framework, as described below^20. Conversely,\nthe inclusion of several copies per species would have rendered our study\ncomputationally intractable. Gene sequences from assembled genomes and OneKP\ntranscriptomes were recovered using custom scripts described in ref. ^50.\nBriefly, the assembled sequences were searched against the target file\nmentioned above using BLASTN, selecting the best match for each gene and\ntrimming it to the BLAST hit. For a few Angiosperms353 samples that\nrepresented the sole accession of their respective families (Ixonanthes\nreticulata, Mitrastemon matudae and Tetracarpaea tasmannica) and had poor\nrecovery from HybPiper (that is, below 5 kilobase pairs (kb) in total sum of\ncontig length), recovery was undertaken following ref. ^50, using less\nstringent recovery thresholds. The average recovery per order is presented in\nSupplementary Fig. 9.\n\n### Phylogenetic inference\n\nTo analyse the dataset, we devised a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we\ncomputed a backbone tree, sampling up to five species per family, to test the\nmonophyly of orders and to rigorously explore deep relationships. We used the\nbackbone tree to identify groups (orders or groups of orders) for multiple\nsequence alignment, with the aim of producing refined subalignments among\nclosely related taxa. Subsequently, the subalignments were merged into global\ngene alignments and global gene trees were inferred from these using the\nrespective gene trees from the backbone analysis as constraints. Finally, we\ninferred a multispecies coalescent tree using the estimated gene trees. The\ninference pipeline is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\n#### Backbone tree inference\n\nThe samples for the backbone were selected so as to represent the crown node\nand deepest divergences in each family. For families with five or fewer\nsamples (279 families), all samples were included. For those with more than\nfive samples (156), we selected the best sample (most genes and longest\nsequence) of each consecutively diverging clade (based on published\nphylogenetic evidence and preliminary analyses of our own data), until five\nsamples were included. To evaluate the extent to which sample selection might\naffect the backbone tree topology, we inferred 20 backbone replicates,\nrandomly selecting five samples for each family with more than five samples\n(among the 50% best samples in terms of gene number and gene length\nrecovered). We then summarized the trees to family level and computed\nRobinson\u2013Foulds distances between the backbone and the 20 replicates\n(Supplementary Fig. 10).\n\nThe phylogenetic reconstruction of the backbone involved up to two iterations\nof gene alignment and gene tree estimation, with an intermediate step of\noutlier removal. This was followed by species tree inference in a multispecies\ncoalescent framework. In the first iteration, all sequences for a given gene\nwere aligned using MAFFT v.7.480 (ref. ^65) (with ffnsi method, that is,\n--retree 2 --maxiterate 1000) and with the direction of the sequence adjusted\n(--adjustdirection). After removing sites with more than 90% missing data with\nPhyutility^66, gene trees were estimated using IQ-TREE v.2.2.0-beta^67,\nkeeping identical sequences in the analysis (--keep-ident), setting the\nsubstitution model to GTR + G and estimating branch support with 1,000\nultrafast bootstrap replicates^68. Before the second iteration, we identified\nlong branch outliers using TreeShrink^69 in \u2018all-genes\u2019 mode and rerooting at\nthe centroids of the trees. A second iteration of gene alignment, removal of\ngappy sites and gene tree estimation was performed for genes with outliers\nafter the removal of outlier sequences. Subsequently, the resulting gene trees\nwere summarized into a species tree using ASTRAL III v.5.7.3, a quartet-based\nspecies tree estimation method statistically consistent with the multispecies\ncoalescent model^70, enabling the full annotation option (-t 2), having first\ncollapsed poorly supported nodes (ultrafast bootstrap \u2264 30%) in the input gene\ntrees using Newick utilities^71.\n\n#### Order-level subalignments\n\nFor the order-level subalignments, most orders were analysed individually,\nfollowing the same method described for the backbone. In some cases, smaller\norders (fewer than 50 samples) were analysed together with larger ones if they\nformed monophyletic groups in the backbone. These groups are: (1) Commelinales\nwith Zingiberales, (2) Dioscoreales with Pandanales, (3) Fagales with Fabales,\n(4) Columelliales, Dipsacales, Escalloniales and Paracryphiales with Apiales,\n(5) all magnoliids (Canellales, Laurales, Magnoliales and Piperales) and (6)\nall gymnosperms together (Cycadales, Ephedrales, Gnetales, Ginkgoales and\nPinales). Conversely, orders emerging as non-monophyletic in the backbone were\nsplit into monophyletic subgroups as follows: (1) Cardiopteridaceae and\nStemonuraceae separate from the rest of Aquifoliales, (2) Dasypogonaceae\nseparate from the rest of Arecales, (3) Collumelliaceae separate from the rest\nof Bruniales, (4) Oncothecaceae separate from the rest of Icacinales and (5)\nHuaceae separate from the rest of Oxalidales. The groupings of samples used in\nthe order-level subalignments are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Very\nsmall groups, comprising one or two samples (termed orphan sequences), were\nnot included in subalignments and were incorporated directly in global\nanalyses.\n\n#### Global gene alignments and trees\n\nWe produced global gene alignments by merging the order-level subalignments\n(before removal of gappy sites) and adding the orphan non-aligned sequences\nusing MAFFT^65, with up to 100 refinement iterations. This approach yields\nalignment across the order-level subalignments without disrupting the\nstructure in the subalignments. The final gene alignments were cleaned by\nremoving gappy sites. A summary of the alignments was produced with AMAS^72\n(Supplementary Table 5) and the average occupancy per gene per order is\npresented in Supplementary Fig. 11.\n\nWe then estimated gene trees in Fasttree v.2.1.10 (ref. ^73), setting the\nmodel to GTR + G, using pseudocounts to avoid biases from fragmentary\nsequences and increasing search thoroughness (-spr 4, -mlacc 2 and -slownni).\nWe used the gene trees from the backbone analysis to constrain the topology of\neach respective global gene tree. To avoid propagating error from the backbone\nanalysis to the global analysis, we removed potentially misleading signal from\nthe backbone gene trees before applying them as constraints. First, branches\nwith bootstrap values below 80% were collapsed to avoid enforcing poorly\nsupported relationships. Second, tips placed far from the rest of their order\nwere algorithmically removed (but retained in global gene alignments). Once\nglobal gene trees were estimated, outlier long branches were removed using\nTreeShrink and the set of pruned gene trees was used to compute the global\nspecies tree using ASTRAL-MP v.5.15.5 (ref. ^74), after collapsing branches\nwith poor support (that is, those with support lower than 10% in the\nShimodaira\u2013Hasegawa test).\n\n### Divergence time estimation\n\nDivergence times were estimated by penalized likelihood in treePL^75,76. This\nmethod is computationally efficient for datasets of this scale and typically\nestimates similar divergence times to more computationally intensive Bayesian\nanalyses. The coalescent species tree topology was used as the input tree with\nmolecular branch lengths estimated in IQ-TREE, on the basis of a concatenated\nalignment of the top 25 genes selected by SortaDate^77. Genes were selected by\nranking their corresponding gene trees according to the number of congruent\nbipartitions with the species tree. We selected genes on this basis because\nhigh gene tree conflict leads to error in divergence time estimates^78,79.\n\nFossil calibrations were based on the AngioCal fossil calibration dataset\ndescribed in ref. ^5. We used an updated version of this dataset, referred to\nas AngioCal v.1.1 (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary File 2). Assigning\nfossil calibrations in this dataset to our tree topology led to 200 unique\nminimum age calibrations at internal nodes (Supplementary Table 7 and\nSupplementary Fig. 12). A maximum constraint of 154 or 247 Ma was used at the\nangiosperm crown node. These two values, respectively, represent a young and\nold constraint for the maximum age of the angiosperm crown node^5,28. Both\nvalues are nonetheless considerably older than the oldest known crown group\nangiosperm fossils of around 127.2 Ma (ref. ^80). Both maximum constraints, in\ncombination with all the minimum age constraints, were used to time-calibrate\nthe species tree. Depending on the maximum constraint at the root node, these\ndated phylogenetic trees are referred to as young tree and old tree,\nrespectively. For both the young tree and old tree, four analyses were\nperformed in treePL, using smoothing values of 0.1, 1, 10 or 100. These\ndifferent smoothing values assume high to low levels of among-branch\nsubstitution rate variation.\n\n### Sampling extant lineages through time\n\nAt 1 Myr intervals from the root age of the dated phylogenetic trees to the\npresent, we calculated how many angiosperm lineages would have been present in\na hypothetical tree that sampled 100% of extant angiosperm species diversity.\nWe used this to quantify the proportion of extant lineages incorporated by our\nphylogenetic trees through time (Supplementary Methods). To do this we\nsimulated unsampled diversity on the dated trees: the species diversity of\nunsampled genera was simulated as a constant-rate birth\u2013death branching\nprocess originating in the crown group of its respective family, whilst\nunsampled species diversity in sampled genera was simulated as a constant-rate\nbirth\u2013death branching process originating at the stem node of the relevant\ngenus. The extant diversity of each simulated branching process was determined\nusing the World Checklist of Vascular Plants^2. At each time interval, we then\ncalculated the proportional difference between the number of lineages in our\ndated phylogenetic tree and the hypothetical fully sampled tree.\n\n### Diversification rate estimation\n\nDated trees estimated with alternative smoothing values were very similar\n(Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5), so diversification rate\nestimates were only performed with the dated trees estimated with a smoothing\nvalue of 10. By contrast, age estimates in the young and old trees differed\nmarkedly. Diversification rate estimates were therefore performed for both\nthese dated trees. In each case, the dated trees were pruned such that there\nwas a maximum of one tip for each genus.\n\nAn initial analysis of diversification rates was performed by generating LTT\nplots as heatmaps for angiosperms as a whole, as well as for each order, with\ncolours representing the steepness of each LTT curve at 5 Myr intervals. To\ncalculate the steepness of the curve, we calculated the running difference\nbetween logarithmic corrected cumulative sums of lineages and applied Tukey\u2019s\nrunning median smoothing to avoid excessive noise. For order plots, the\ncumulative sum starts at the first branching point, that is, order crown\nnodes.\n\nTime-dependent diversification parameters (speciation and extinction rates)\nwere also explicitly estimated across all angiosperms. These analyses were\nperformed in RevBayes with the dnEpisodicBirthDeath function^81. The smallest\ntime windows in which rates were estimated were 5 Ma. However, larger windows\nwere used toward the root of the tree such that there were at least 50\nbranching events in each time window. Three different models were used: equal\nrates of speciation and extinction across all windows; variable rates of\nspeciation across windows but equal rates of extinction; and equal rates of\nspeciation across windows but variable rates of extinction. Bayes factor\ncomparison was used to compare models and offered strong support for the\nvariable rate models but could not distinguish between the two variable rate\nmodels (Supplementary Information), indicating that they are probably from the\nsame congruent set of models for the species tree^82. In subsequent discussion\nwe primarily refer to results from the variable speciation rate model (for\njustification see Supplementary Information), although both variable rate\nmodels estimate similar patterns of net diversification rates through time\n(Supplementary Information).\n\nLineage-specific diversification rate estimation was performed in BAMM^83 and\nRevBayes. For analyses in BAMM, the setBammPriors function from the R package\nBAMMtools^84 was used to define appropriate priors. Different sets of analyses\nwere performed with the prior for the expected number of shifts set to either\n10 or 100. These different prior settings had minimal effect on parameter\nestimates. Clade-specific sampling fractions were specified for each sampled\nfamily and a backbone sampling fraction of 1 was used. We therefore accounted\nfor incomplete sampling within families alongside comprehensive sampling of\nthe backbone of the tree. For analyses in RevBayes, the dnCDBDP function was\nused and the prior for the total number of rate shifts was set to either 10 or\n100. Clade-specific sampling fractions cannot be specified with this function.\nTherefore, the sampling fraction was set to 1 meaning that estimates will\nbecome inaccurate toward the present because of unsampled within-family\ndiversity.\n\n### Simulations on gene tree conflict\n\nSimulations were based on a multispecies coalescent process. Each species tree\ncontained 100 tips and was simulated as a birth\u2013death branching process with\ntime-dependent rates of speciation and extinction. In experiment 1, the\nextinction rate was always 0. The speciation rate was 0.75 species Myr^\u22121 at\ntimes over 6 Ma, between 6 and 2 Ma the speciation rate was 0.075 species\nMyr^\u22121 and less than 2 Ma the speciation rate was 0.75 species Myr^\u22121. In\nexperiment 2, the net diversification rates were the same as in experiment 1;\nhowever, in this case changes to the extinction rate led to the net\ndiversification rate shifts. Therefore, for all time intervals, the speciation\nrate was 0.75 species Myr^\u22121. At times over 6 Ma the extinction rate was 0\nspecies Myr^\u22121, between 6 and 2 Ma the extinction rate was 0.675 species\nMyr^\u22121 and at times less than 2 Ma the extinction rate was 0 species Myr^\u22121.\n\nSpecies trees with extinct lineages have extra complexities: first, changes in\nthe extinction rate have a less direct impact on the duration of extant\nlineages in the species tree compared to changes in the speciation rate\n(Supplementary Information); and second, the effect of extinction is reduced\nat times close to the present. This causes shorter branches in the species\ntree, leading to the so-called \u2018pull of the present\u2019. We therefore performed a\nfurther analysis that was similar to experiment 2 but with no decrease in the\nextinction rate at the present. This offered insight into the effect of the\n\u2018pull of the present\u2019 on inferences of gene tree conflict and diversification\nrates and the relationship between these variables and the timing of rate\nshifts.\n\nOne-hundred gene trees were simulated along the branches of the birth\u2013death\nbranching processes according to a multispecies coalescent process. For most\nexperiments, the effective population size was 5,000. In one further\nexperiment, which was otherwise the same as experiment 1, the effective\npopulation size was 50,000. For each simulated dataset, the degree to which\nthe simulated gene trees exhibited conflicting topologies with the species\ntree was plotted through time (Supplementary Information). This enabled\ncharacterization of the relationship between gene tree conflict caused by\nincomplete lineage sorting and shifts in speciation and extinction rates in\nthe species tree.\n\nMore methods, results and discussion are available (Supplementary Information;\nSupplementary Figs. 13\u201324 and Supplementary Table 8).\n\n### Inclusion and ethics statement\n\nThe research described here results from a highly inclusive, large-scale,\ninternational collaboration, which has actively encouraged the participation\nof many individuals from around the world.

Baker.\n\n## Ethics declarations\n\n### Competing interests\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\n## Peer review\n\n### Peer review information\n\nNature thanks Craig Barrett, Elena Kramer, Patrick Wincker and the other,\nanonymous, reviewer(s) for their contribution to the peer review of this work.\nPeer reviewer reports are available.\n\n## Additional information\n\nPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional\nclaims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\n## Extended data figures and tables\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 1 Tanglegram at ordinal level between this work (left)\nand the APG IV schematic tree (right).\n\nBranches colours represent the clades according to the composition proposed in\neach work. Posterior probability is presented only for nodes without maximum\nsupport. Coloured circles in the left tree represent the posterior probability\nof each node as: maximum (absent), between 1 and 0.95 (green), between 0.95\nand 0.75 (yellow), between 0.75 and 0.5 (red), below 0.5 (black).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Comparison of node age estimates in the eight time-\ncalibrated phylogenetic trees.\n\nEach point represents a node and corresponds to the percentage difference in\nage estimates for that node between the two trees that are compared in each\nplot.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Comparison of stem ages of families and orders\ninferred in this study and Ram\u00edrez-Barahona et al.^5.\n\na and b, Stem age comparison between our young tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 154 Ma) and the dataset CC_complete of Ram\u00edrez-Barahona et al.^5.\na, Ages in each study, coloured according to taxonomic rank and b, Age\ndifferences, calculated as age in this study minus age in Ram\u00edrez-Barahona et\nal.^5 c and d, Stem ages comparison between our old tree (maximum constraint\nat the root node of 247 Ma) and the dataset UC_complete from Ram\u00edrez-Barahona\net al.^5 c, Ages in each study, coloured according to taxonomic rank and d,\nAge differences, calculated as age in this study minus age in Ram\u00edrez-Barahona\net al.^5.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Correlation between branch time duration and\npercentage of gene trees that do not share a congruent bipartition for the\nbranch.\n\nThe results are based on the young tree (maximum constraint at the root node\nof 154 Ma). For each branch in the young tree, the percentage of gene trees\nthat do not share a congruent bipartition with the species tree branch is\nplotted against the logarithm of the time duration for the branch.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Angiosperm-wide diversification and gene tree\nconflict through time.\n\nThis is equivalent to Fig. 3 but for the old tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 247 Ma). a, Estimated net diversification rate through time\n(yellow, left y-axis) and the level of gene tree conflict through time (blue,\nright y-axis). Net diversification rates are estimated with a model that\nenables speciation rates to vary between time intervals; the line is the\nposterior mean and the yellow shaded area is the 95% highest posterior\ndensity. Gene tree conflict is calculated from the percentage of gene trees\nthat do not share a congruent bipartition with each species tree branch, with\nthe plotted value being the mean across all species tree branches that cross\neach 2.5 Myr time slice. b, Cumulative percentage of extant orders and\nfamilies that have originated through time. In both a and b, the background\ngrey-scale gradient is the estimated percentage of extant lineages represented\nin the species tree through time (\u201csampling fraction\u201d).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Summary of lineage-specific diversification rate\nshifts estimated by BAMM.\n\nThis is equivalent to Fig. 4, but for the old tree (maximum constraint at the\nroot node of 247 Ma). a, Diversification rate increases per lineage through\ntime. The colour corresponds to the average magnitude of the rate increases\nduring the time period. b, Equivalent to a, but for rate decreases. c,\nEquivalent to a, but focusing on the largest 25% of diversification rate\nincreases. In a, b and c, the number of shifts is extracted from the maximum a\nposteriori shift configuration, the prior for the number of shifts is set to\n10 and the background grey-scale gradient is the estimated percentage of\nextant lineages represented in the species tree through time (\u201csampling\nfraction\u201d).\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Methods, Results, Discussion, references, Figs. 1\u201324, captions\nfor Tables 1\u20138, Files 1 and 2 and extended acknowledgements.\n\n### Reporting Summary\n\n### Peer Review File\n\n### Supplementary material\n\n### Supplementary Tables\n\nSupplementary Tables 1\u20138.\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
