To create a high-quality scene, designers\n> usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might\n> need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes,\n> hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require\n> completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper,\n> we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like\n> GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an\n> answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-\n> based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the\n> correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of\n> visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual\n> reasoning capabilities of VLMs with \"imagined\" reference images from image-\n> generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language\n> descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our\n> system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks\n> such as editing procedural materials from text and/or reference images, as\n> well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex\n> scenes.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Graphics (cs.GR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.17672 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.17672v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Ian Huang [view email] [v1] Fri, 26 Apr 2024 19:37:13 UTC (40,287 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled BlenderAlchemy: Editing 3D Graphics with\nVision-Language Models, by Ian Huang and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.GR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
