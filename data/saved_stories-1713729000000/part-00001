With BSDs it\u2019s not the same.\nOne should try to understand the downsides, as not to waste the next 20 years\nexploring an OS that simply is not a good fit.\n\nAll BSD are much less popular than BSD/Linux^1, and with this comes the most\npressing downsides. The support from hardware vendors is, at the very least,\nproblematic. You will have problems with recently released components; most\nlikely your WiFi card will not work. Your graphic card may have drivers, but\nthey may work much slower. One needs to deeply examine hardware at hand and\nmake sure it is supported by the chosen OS. As an example, my laptop has an\nNVIDIA card hardwired to HDMI-out, so if I want to use an external monitor, I\nneed to use this card. While this works on FreeBSD, there is no support on\nOpenBSD. Another example would be the Intel wireless NIC which I had to\nphysically replace^2 to not get constant Kernel Panics. It goes without saying\nthat power management is also a problem, but it\u2019s a problem on GNU/Linux as\nwell.\n\nThe lackluster support from vendors is handled by volunteers who try to\nreverse-engineer the hardware. And here comes another problem - it\u2019s very hard\nto back port anything from GNU/Linux kernel. There is a huge difference\nbetween what GPL and BSD license allows. And even if that wasn\u2019t the problem,\nthe GNU/Linux driver land is full of closed blobs. You could have thought that\nif something is supported there, it has a beautiful open-sourced drivers.\nNothing further from the truth. Ever wondered why GNU\u2019s GUIX doesn\u2019t support\nNvidia? That\u2019s because the drivers are provided as blobs, and therefore\nclosed-source. As a result, the work needed for BSD support is difficult and\nslow^3, ^4.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume this is not a problem in your case. You have been blessed by\nthe Gods of Hardware Support. You\u2019ve installed the system: your GPU is\ncalculating pixels, your air is full of bits and waves. Next step? Software!\nAnd hello to another problem: software support. Most popular software is not\ncompiled against BSD operating systems. VS Code? Steam? Microsoft Office?\nFirefox? Those programs may be essential for your work or evening. BSDs on\ndesktop crowd is not significantly large enough for companies to want to deal\nwith us. We are not completely lost here, as BSD is POSIX-compliant, so it\u2019s\npossible to compile everything that\u2019s running on GNU/Linux. It requires\nchanges and a bit of luck^5 but any open-source application can be run.\nUnfortunately, since we are not using GNU/Linux, all hacks that make software\nrun fast there may now work here, or even create huge problems. Firefox on\nFreeBSD is a hack layered over a hack running slowly. I have no idea how much\nwork is required to support it, but it\u2019s somewhere between \u201cbig\u201d and \u201chave\nmercy\u201d. About that closed-source ones? No Office for you.\n\nLet\u2019s once again allow our imagination run wild and assume all software you\nuse is there, but you have a problem. You try to Kagi^6 it and nothing. Nada.\nGNU/Linux has plethora of sites, blogs, and vlogs. Any problem you may\nencounter, someone else already solved and documented. In BSD you are expected\nto read the manual. But wait, you may ask, RTFM? That\u2019s rude! It is, however,\ntrue. Since all BSDs have best in class documentation, it is assumed that you\nwill look for help there first. This also means that trivial problems may not\never find themselves a subject of any blog post. Unfortunately, non-trivial\nones are also often not documented. The community is friendly and will help\nyou, but you need to do the homework. Since the community is small, it may\ntake some time/luck, but someone will help you help yourself. When GUN/Linux\nmay be used by someone who has zero knowledge about the inner workings of the\nOS, BSD will not be so kind.\n\nNotice how I, like a gentleman, always mention GNU when mentioning Linux?\nWell, BSD teaches you why you should. Since BSD and Linux use different\nuserland software, they are not compatible. And while yes, basic usages of\nsuch programs like ls, cat, awk is the same, GNU likes to add a lot of custom\nextensions. You can assume that only POSIX requirements are met. As a result\nyou will find answers for your question on the interwebs which will not work\nfor you, as they are written for GNU-flavored tooling. Unfortunately, POSIX is\na weapon for a more civilized age. Folks these days assume a lot and BSDs\ndon\u2019t even come with ZSH out of the box. Ever used the basic Shell? Too bad,\nas Shell is what you should assume in all your scripts.\n\nNext: do you like to call yourself an early adopter? Being in the bleeding\nedge is what gets you going? BSD are evolving slowly by design. If something\nworks, let\u2019s leave it alone. That\u2019s the mantra. GNU/Linux is changing rapidly\n- Pipewire, Wayland, SystemD. Even good old ifconfig is being deprecated. At\nthe same time BSDs still use technology from decades ago^7. There was never a\nneed to replace them, so no one did it.\n\nAnd lastly, prepare for a lot of raised brows. Younger folks may have never\neven heard of BSD. Rocking their MacBooks they don\u2019t know (nor care) about its\nFreeBSD roots. Very few people I have contact in the meatsphere have ever seen\na BSD system, and it\u2019s not that easy to explain that it\u2019s not Linux.\n\nYou can think of the problems as something one may have had trying to run\nRedHat on a computer with a winmodem back in 1999. It\u2019s not an OS that gets\nout of the way allowing you to get stuff done. You need to enjoy making it\nwork for you. Otherwise, all you will find is annoyance and a swift OS change.\n\n  1. I won\u2019t even mention proprietary OS, as they are irrelevant here. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. I tried to record my fight with having my Thinkpad working under FreeBSD here. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. I won\u2019t pretend to understand it, but as to the best of my knowledge: those closed blobs are part of Linux kernel. They are not strictly drivers, as drivers are how the OS communicated with the device. Instead, they are firmware which run on the device itself. Both of those parts need to work together as to not fry the device. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. As a sidenote: having closed standards is my definition of a dick move. Not only the way the device is hidden, but also how something like WiFI is. It\u2019s very hard to read the exact spec of modern WiFi standard, and it\u2019s most definitely illegal to use that knowledge without a paying a crazy amount of money. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. BSDs have collection of such converted software called ports. They are supported by volunteers, so your mileage may vary. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  6. Are people still using Google? \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  7. Not going on breakneck speed is one of huge driving factors towards BSD. It\u2019s a good thing, I promise! \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nPublished: 2024-04-20\n\n", "frontpage": false}
