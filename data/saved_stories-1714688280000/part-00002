How is Yandex tailoring its AI strategies to meet the unique demands\nof web users?\n\nAround a year and a half ago, when the first language models like ChatGPT were\nreleased, there was a misconception that they might challenge major search\nengines. However, this was a myth. Regardless of the type of language model or\nneural network, they lack specific knowledge about the world. While they can\narticulate impressively on general topics, they falter when asked about\nspecific details or recent events.\n\nSeeing this, we recognised we were positioned uniquely. After all, we have a\nsearch engine that knows almost every detail about the world since it\ncontinuously takes in new information from the Internet. Thanks to our\nadvanced search engine, we have real-time access to the most recently uploaded\nonline information.\n\nAt first, we were unsure about comparing ourselves with OpenAI. However, we\nare now confident that we can develop similarly sophisticated language models\nand Generative AI.\n\nOur recent release, Neuro, is a unique hybrid product that combines the power\nof our proprietary language model, YandexGPT, and our own search engine, which\nis free for our approximately 100 million monthly users. Currently operating\nin Russian, users can ask questions in natural language and receive detailed,\nup-to-date responses. If information is available online, Neuro will provide a\nsingle, summarised answer, citing all the sources.\n\nExample of Neuro in action\n\nThis is the biggest search-related update that Yandex has rolled out in the\nlast 20 years. The launch of Neuro is a significant milestone for us and for\nthe rest of the world.\n\nWhat challenges does Yandex face when ensuring the accuracy and reliability of\nAI-generated information?\n\nThe fundamental challenge here is clear. In response to a user query, a\ntraditional search engine provides 10 relevant sources on the first page. In\nthis case, the search engine is not really responsible for the content of the\nsources it provides. However, it\u2019s a whole other story when you\u2019re giving a\ndirect answer to a user\u2019s question. This is why we\u2019re seeing many emerging AI\nproducts avoid answering sensitive questions.\n\nOur aim is to maintain the universality of search products while ensuring\naccuracy, reliability and ethics in our responses. From the outset, our\nproduct development has focused on these principles. Technically, this\ninvolves two components.\n\nFirstly, our search engine with 27 years\u2019 experience filters out low-quality\nresources. When using our hybrid search, the search engine provides material\nsources, which are summarised by the LLM into a single answer.\n\nSecondly, we train our model to provide balanced, ethical and accurate\nresponses through a team of specialised editors. During the training process,\nmultiple individuals review material to ensure alignment and balance. Plus,\nNeuro\u2019s answers are based on the information found online and the answer\nalways includes links to the sources used.\n\nIn summary, the first component involves providing relevant and high-quality\nsources, a common practice in any search engine. The second component utilises\na team of cross-checking editors to train the model to provide accurate and\nbalanced answers.\n\nHow does Yandex differentiate itself in a competitive market?\n\nWe are a bit of a technological miracle as we are managing to strongly compete\nagainst Google.\n\nApproximately 65% of Internet users in Russia opt for Yandex as their search\nengine of choice, a well-known fact that is openly available. This showcases\nour ability to compete with global companies.\n\nOur size is somewhat paradoxically advantageous. While we\u2019re significantly\nsmaller than other giants on the global market, it allows us to be more\ndynamic and agile. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve nearly doubled our staff,\ngrowing to 27,000 employees. However, we\u2019ve managed to maintain a startup\nmentality, making quick decisions and staying nimble in a rapidly changing\nmarket.\n\nSo, how are we differentiating ourselves from other global players? First of\nall, especially when entering new markets, we place a huge focus on product\nlocalisation. The first thing we did when we started actively developing in\nthe CEE region was a massive push towards raising the quality of Yandex Search\nin the Kazakh language. I\u2019m not saying that other global companies don\u2019t care\nabout localisation, but for us this is a number one priority.\n\nWe make sure that our AI and search solutions work better in the local\nlanguage, including, but not limited to, Russian. And we regularly compare\nthousands of cases to make sure of that.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is our talent pool. Russian engineers consistently\nexcel in programming competitions like ICPC where Russia has won 14 of the\nlast 20 years, showcasing our country\u2019s remarkable engineering talent.\nObviously, we couldn\u2019t build any of our cutting-edge technologies without\nhundreds of talented professionals and we\u2019re constantly hiring new ones. We\nnow have 1.5x more ML engineers than we did before 2023.\n\nWhat future developments can we expect from Yandex in the AI and search engine\nfields?\n\nWe are at the beginning of a new era; a technological revolution that could\nlast five to 10 years. Just as smartphones and the Internet transformed our\nlives, AI has the potential to do the same, if not more. We\u2019re only one and a\nhalf years into this AI renaissance, but already, the potential is staggering\nfor GenAI.\n\nRegarding Yandex\u2019s plans, I\u2019m personally inspired by OpenAI\u2019s advancements and\nit is important for us to adhere to the new standard of AI it has set. Our\nstrategy is generally to ensure the fundamental AI technologies are on par\nwith global companies in specific domains, or even better.\n\nBut there is a challenge that\u2019s being widely discussed within the professional\ncommunity \u2014 monetisation. The question is, how do you make a great product,\nwhich is always the first thing on your mind, and also turn it into a\nprofitable business? Sure, there are traditional monetisation approaches like\nadvertising and many companies rely on subscriptions. But we aim to distribute\nour general-purpose products, like Neuro, for free. We might adopt a\nmonetisation approach at some point, but it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nSpeaking of advertising, we\u2019ve been quite successful in ad tech, which we have\nyears of experience and strong expertise in. To put things into perspective,\nYandex Direct \u2014 our platform for placing contextual and banner ads \u2014 has more\nthan 400,000 advertisers who place an average of 4.5 billion ads a day. Around\n25 different neural networks are involved in delivering ad impressions to\nusers and our entire Yandex Advertising Network has more than 55,000 partner\nplatforms.\n\nAside from that, Yandex has quite a few plans on the international market. I\nbelieve this year we will be marked by a significant expansion in the non-\nRussian-speaking world.\n\nIn essence, our focus is on improving fundamental technologies, developing\nsustainable business models, evolving our products and expanding\ninternationally. We are excited about the journey ahead.\n\nWhat is the potential of AI and what global trends are you seeing that could\nbe key to its advancement?\n\nThe concept of AI is fascinating considering its potential to revolutionise\ntechnological advancements. AI essentially makes intelligence cheaper and\nfaster, much like how the Internet made information more accessible.\n\nThe efficiency gains from AI are substantial. Over the next five to seven\nyears, we can expect a 3% to 5% increase in daily productivity for the average\nInternet user. This will be particularly pronounced in fields such as software\nengineering, customer support and legal professions where AI can streamline\ntasks by up to around 10%.\n\nContrary to concerns about job loss, AI is expected to enhance productivity\nand create new jobs and businesses. Software engineers, for instance, will\nreceive substantial support from AI systems, enabling them to work more\nefficiently. Additionally, AI solutions will be extended beyond B2C\napplications. We already offer access to our models via API, allowing\ncompanies to seamlessly integrate our AI into their systems.\n\nUltimately, AI will democratise access to information and services making them\nmore efficient and accessible globally. Whether it\u2019s offering medical advice\nto remote communities or streamlining business processes, AI will transform\nindustries and improve lives.\n\nWhat are the latest developments in voice tech in regard to search and AI?\n\nVoice technology is a fascinating area often overlooked in discussions. It\nholds immense promise, particularly in the field of real-time translation\nwhich is not yet fully developed; however, the market is making significant\nprogress. I\u2019m confident that in a few years there will be technologies capable\nof providing real-time translation for conversational purposes.\n\nWe are already working in this field and have successfully implemented real-\ntime, AI-powered video translation in Yandex Browser.\n\nWe have made significant progress in voice recognition and speech synthesis.\nThe quality of real-time voice-to-text conversion on mobile devices is\nimpressive, thanks to advanced AI and Machine Learning systems.\n\nWhile voice recognition and speech synthesis have come a long way, there is\nstill much to achieve, particularly in understanding emotions. Smart\nassistants lack the ability to convey empathy effectively or read emotional\ncontent with appropriate intonation.\n\nOne of our goals in the Machine Learning department is to improve the\nemotional recognition capabilities of our voice assistant, Alice. (Its\ntechnology was also brought in for the creation of Yasmina, a bilingual AI\nassistant that speaks both Arabic and English). By the end of the year, we aim\nto enhance its ability to efficiently interpret emotional overtones and make\nthem more relatable. It is already remarkably human-like, capable of making\njokes and offering an engaging conversational experience. It is simply\nenjoyable to interact with it, however, we still need to improve its emotional\nunderstanding capabilities.\n\nOverall, the trend is towards humanising technology. We\u2019ve already introduced\nfeatures like whispering, allowing the virtual assistant to respond softly\nwhen spoken to in a whisper, as well as speaking louder or quieter depending\non the distance from the person speaking.\n\nOverall, the field of voice tech is definitely shifting towards a more human-\ncentred approach. It is not only about intonations, but also other aspects of\nhuman interactions, some of which may be very subtle. However, when you deal\nwith technology, there remains a gap that needs to be bridged. Despite this, I\nbelieve that the voice tech domain will be fully explored within the next\nthree to five years.\n\nClick below to share this article\n\nSignup to the Intelligent CIO Middle East newsletter and never miss out on the\nlatest news\n\nA Lynchpin Media Brand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n##### Intelligent Technologies\n\n  * Cabling\n  * Cloud\n  * Data Centres\n  * Enterprise Security\n  * Green\n  * Mobile\n  * Software\n\n##### Intelligent Verticals\n\n  * Aviation\n  * Banking & Finance\n  * Education\n  * Energy\n  * Government\n  * Healthcare\n  * Hospitality\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Retail\n  * Telecom\n  * Trade & Logistics\n\n##### Countries\n\n  * Kuwait\n  * Oman\n  * Qatar\n  * Saudi Arabia\n  * United Arab Emirates\n\n##### Analysis\n\n  * Blogs\n  * Case Studies\n  * Insights\n  * Research\n\n##### Other Regions\n\n  * CIO APAC\n  * CIO Africa\n  * CIO Europe\n  * CIO North America\n  * CIO LATAM\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 Intelligent CIO | 63/66 Hatton Garden, London, EC1N 8LE | +44 (0) 20 3026 6825\n\nBrowse our latest issue\n\nView Magazine Archive\n\n\u00d7\n\n", "frontpage": false}
