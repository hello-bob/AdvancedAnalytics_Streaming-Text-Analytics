Antonie Robertson / The National\n\nFemale surgeons have reduced patient mortality rates compared to their male\ncounterparts, a new study has found. Antonie Robertson / The National\n\nNicky Harley\n\nLondon\n\nApr 23, 2024\n\nPowered by automated translation\n\nPatients treated by female doctors have a reduced risk of dying, with female\npatients benefiting more than their male counterparts, new research has found.\n\nThe mortality rate for female patients was 8.15 per cent when treated by\nfemale physicians compared to 8.38 per cent when a male counterpart was\ninvolved.\n\nWhile the difference for male patients was smaller, female doctors had a 10.15\nper cent mortality rate compared with male medics\u2019 10.23 per cent rate.\n\nThe study, published on Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Annals of\nInternal Medicine, found the same pattern for hospital readmission rates.\n\nRead more\n\n'Great resignation' of women increases pressure on global healthcare sector\n\nDr Yusuke Tsugawa, associate professor-in-residence of medicine at the David\nGeffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and\nthe study\u2019s senior author said the findings are important and could help\nimprove care for future patients.\n\n\u201cPatient outcomes should not differ between male and female physicians if they\npractice medicine the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat our findings indicate is that female and male physicians practice\nmedicine differently, and these differences have a meaningful impact on\npatients' health outcomes.\n\n\u201cFurther research on the underlying mechanisms linking physician gender with\npatient outcomes, and why the benefit of receiving the treatment from female\nphysicians is larger for female patients, has the potential to improve patient\noutcomes across the board.\u201d\n\nMedics look after a patient in the intensive care unit at Sana Klinikum\nOffenbach, Germany. AP\n\nThe researchers examined insurance body Medicare's claims data from 2016 to\n2019 for 458,100 female and about 319,800 male patients.\n\nOf those, 142,500 and 97,500, or about 31 per cent for both, were treated by\nfemale doctors.\n\nThe primary outcomes were 30-day mortality from the date of hospital admission\nand 30-day readmission from the date of discharge.\n\n## Male doctors 'may underestimate severity of female patients' illnesses'\n\nThe researchers said there could be several factors driving the differences.\n\nPrevious research has found that male doctors might underestimate the severity\nof their female patients\u2019 illnesses from pain levels to gastrointestinal and\ncardiovascular symptoms, and stroke risk, which could lead to delayed or\nincomplete care.\n\nIt says female doctors may communicate better with their female patients,\nmaking it likelier that these patients provide important information leading\nto better diagnoses and treatment.\n\nFemale patients may be more comfortable with receiving sensitive examinations\nand engaging in detailed conversations with female physicians.\n\nAnother study found that female doctors are more empathetic, which could help\nreduce their patients' pain and anxiety. It found that patients of empathetic\ndoctors are more likely to take their medication as prescribed.\n\nA Flourish map\n\nDr Tsugawa says more research is needed into how and why male and female\nphysicians practice medicine differently and its effect on patient care.\n\n\u201cA better understanding of this topic could lead to the development of\ninterventions that effectively improve patient care,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, gender gaps in physician pay should be eliminated, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that female physicians provide high-quality care, and\ntherefore, having more female physicians benefits patients from a societal\npoint-of-view,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nBritish-Yemeni nurse raises profile of \u2018invisible\u2019 Arab

experience\ncomplications than those whose surgery is performed by a male doctor.\n\nThe research, a collaboration between surgeons from Canada and the US which\nwas published by the Jama Surgery journal, found female surgeons have lower\nrates of adverse postoperative outcomes, including death at 90 days and one\nyear after surgery, compared with those treated by male surgeons.\n\nIts authors concluded that the findings further support differences in patient\noutcomes based on the sex of the physician that warrant deeper study regarding\nunderlying causes and potential solutions.\n\nThe paper, entitled Surgeon Sex and Long-Term Post-Operative Outcomes Among\nPatients Undergoing Common Surgeries, examined whether there was an\nassociation between the gender of surgeons and patients\u2019 long-term outcomes.\n\nAnother study from Sweden into 150,000 patients undergoing gallbladder surgery\nfound that patients treated by female surgeons suffered fewer complications\nand experienced shorter hospital stays than those operated on by men.\n\nThe research, which was also published in Jama Surgery, found female surgeons\noperated more slowly than men and were less likely to switch from a keyhole\ntechnique to an open procedure.\n\nProf Martin Almquist at Sk\u00e5ne University hospital in Sweden wrote in an\naccompanying editorial: \u201cThe fact that female surgeons had operations with\nfewer complications but longer operation times suggests that the Navy Seal\nmantra \u2018slow is smooth, and smooth is fast\u2019 also applies to surgery.\u201d\n\n## Day of admission\n\nAccording to a previous study of patients admitted to hospitals in England in\n2013 and 2014, the day a patient is admitted is also significant to mortality\nrisk.\n\nIt showed those admitted at the weekend face a higher risk of death within 30\ndays, even when the severity of their illness is taken into account.\n\nPatients admitted on a Saturday and Sunday have a 10 per cent and 15 per cent\nhigher risk of death than those admitted on a Wednesday.\n\nUpdated: April 23, 2024, 7:32 PM\n\nHealth newsUKHospitals\n\nBeshara\n\nYour weekly dose of good news delivered to your
