The entire\nbuilding is the computer.\n\nOur mission is to incubate a humane dynamic medium whose full power is\naccessible to all people.\n\n1\n\nA communal computer.\n\nThis is computing together.\n\nThis is computing together in Dynamicland.\n\nNo screens, no devices. Just ordinary physical materials \u2014 paper and clay,\ntokens and toy cars \u2014 brought to life by technology in the ceiling.\n\nEvery scrap of paper has the capabilities of a full computer, while remaining\na fully-functional scrap of paper.\n\nIn Dynamicland, computational media isn't hidden away in isolated virtual\nworlds. It's real stuff that everyone can see and get their hands on.\n\nAnd everyone gets their hands on everything! You walk by, you see what someone\nis making, you play with it and trade ideas, you sit down and work on it\ntogether. This happens constantly.\n\nEveryone learns from everyone, all the time.\n\nDynamicland is a computer where people literally work together, face-to-face,\nwith eye contact and many hands. It's as multiplayer as the real world.\n\n2\n\nAgency, not apps.\n\nNo normal person sees an app and thinks \u201cI can make that myself.\u201d\n\nOr even \u201cI can modify that to do what I actually need.\u201d\n\nComputational media in Dynamicland feels like stuff anyone can make.\n\nPens, scissors, and staplers are genuinely powerful tools here.\n\nMake interactive books with tape and a hole punch.\n\nA humane dynamic medium gently leads people down a path from playing, to\ncrafting, to remixing, to programming.\n\nPrograms are small, because the real world does most of the work. Programs are\nflexible, and compose readily.\n\nBut most importantly \u2014 programs are real things. You touch them. You see them\neverywhere \u2014 they can only run when visible. You can change anything and see\nwhat happens. No black boxes.\n\nEveryone is constantly grabbing and remixing each other's work, because it's\nall just there. Mash-ups happen in seconds. The social dynamics of programming\nhere are completely bonkers.\n\nDynamicland is an authoring environment, and everyone is an author. People\nmake what they need for themselves. They learn through immersion. The true\npower of the dynamic medium \u2014 programmability \u2014 is for everyone.\n\n3\n\nThinking like a whole human.\n\nPeople think with their hands.\n\nPeople think with their bodies.\n\nPeople spread out\n\nwalk around\n\ncompare possibilities.\n\nPeople improvise\n\nexperiment\n\nwith everything.\n\nA humane dynamic medium embraces the countless ways in which human beings use\ntheir minds and bodies, instead of cramming people into a tiny box of pixels.\n\nOne guest, after spending time at Dynamicland, held up his smartphone and\nshouted, \u201cThis thing is a prison!\u201d\n\nDynamicland is a communal computer, designed for agency, not apps, where\npeople can think like whole humans.\n\nIt's the next step in our mission to incubate a humane dynamic medium whose\nfull power is accessible to all people.\n\nThe computer of the future is not a product, but a place.\n\n## A community space and possible future.\n\nIf the dynamic medium is to serve as the foundation for new modes of thought\nand communication, it must lift all people, not just those traditionally\nadvantaged by technology. There is no product we can ship to achieve this\ngoal.\n\nInstead, we are building Dynamicland as a community space, where the people of\nOakland will come to \u201clive in the future\u201d and shape the medium with us. We are\nactively drawing our community from a diverse set of people, with a focus on\nthose who are underserved or alienated by current forms of computing.\n\nThis community space is a model for a new kind of civic institution \u2014 a public\nlibrary for 21st-century literacy.\n\nWorkspaces and galleries, where residents and visitors alike create dynamic\nmedia and exhibits, learn from those of others, and freely remix everything. A\nnew kind of makerspace meets a new kind of Exploratorium.\n\nTown hall of the future, hosting talks and discussions about issues of\nimportance to the community. A place to invent a new form of conversation,\nbeyond the \u201coral culture\u201d of talking points and PowerPoints.\n\nStudents of all ages. We'll be actively working with K-12 students via after-\nschool and summer programs, as well as hosting university work. The next\ngeneration should take the dynamic medium for granted.\n\n## One step in a 50-year project.\n\nBret's 2013 CDG research agenda, the roots of Dynamicland\n\nBret's 2014 talk \u201cThe Humane Representation of Thought\u201d\n\n2014: CDG research lab was co-founded by Alan Kay and Bret Victor to reinvent\ncomputing for the 21st century. The Dynamicland vision and technology emerged\nfrom years of exploration, hundreds of working prototypes, and multiple whole-\nsystem iterations.\n\n2018: Founding Dynamicland. In Oakland, we built the first full-scale\nrealization of the vision, inviting thousands of people into our space to\ncollaborate. Together, these artists, scientists, teachers, students,\nprogrammers, and non-programmers created hundreds of projects that would have\nbeen impossible anywhere else.\n\n2020: Realtalk-2020. We're bringing together everything we've learned to\ncreate the next iteration of our Realtalk computing system. Realtalk-2020 will\nform the foundation for the next decade of research and applications.\n\n2022: Dynamicland meets the world, in the form of new kinds of libraries,\nmuseums, classrooms, science labs, arts venues, and businesses. We will\nempower these communities to build what they need for themselves, to design\ntheir own futures.\n\n2040: A dynamicland in every neighborhood, following the model of the Carnegie\nlibraries a century ago. Like libraries and museums, these dynamiclands will\nbe run by the local community and reflect the local culture, in contrast to\nfranchised clones or mass-produced products. Perhaps existing libraries will\nbe dynamiclands.\n\n2060: The dynamic medium, everywhere, built into all infrastructure as\nelectric lighting is today. As a non-profit, we are free and obligated to do\nwhatever it takes to ensure that this pervasive medium is safe and empowers\nall people, rather than prioritizing corporate or nefarious interests.\n\n## A 5000-year project.\n\nWriting and print transformed humanity. Computing will have as great an\neffect. What will be the shape of this transformation?\n\nWill it lift all people, or widen the gap? Give people agency, or give them\nproducts to consume? Bring people together, or isolate them? Deepen people's\nconnection to their bodies, their hands, and the real world we all depend on?\nOr abstract human beings into pixels and database entries?\n\nThe time to decide is now.\n\nThe dynamic medium belongs to everyone.\n\n## Dynamicland is non-profit.\n\nSome projects are bigger than companies. The Internet, for example, could\nnever have happened as a consumer product. The Internet was incubated in a\nnon-commercial research culture for decades. By the time a trillion-dollar\nindustry grew around it, a set of core values (decentralization, equal access\nfor all) were embedded in the core protocols, and are still recognized today\nas ideals worth fighting for.\n\nThis is our model.\n\n## A humane future must be funded.\n\nThe fundamental research that gave rise to personal computing and the Internet\nwas made possible by adequate funding, via federal agencies and industrial\nlaboratories. The global wealth subsequently generated by these inventions has\nbeen astronomical.\n\nFundamental research is now in a time of extreme scarcity. Industry continues\nto exploit the inventions of the past, not plant the seeds for a humane\nfuture. Government and foundation grants prefer low-risk incremental work.\n\nDynamicland exists solely due to the foresight of a small handful of visionary\ndonors and corporations. If you'd like to become a visionary funder and\nmeaningfully enable our progress toward the humane future, please get in\ntouch.\n\nAbout Us more peeks \u27f6 @dynamicland1 hi@dynamicland.org\n\n", "frontpage": false}
