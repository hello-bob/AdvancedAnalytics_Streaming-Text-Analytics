In 2000, it\nmerged with competitor Confinity and in 2001, the merged company changed its\nname to PayPal.\n\n## Business model[edit]\n\nX.com developed and operated a financial services website with banking\nservices provided by First Western National Bank, an FDIC-insured bank in La\nJara, Colorado.^[1] The company was initially funded by Elon Musk and Greg\nKouri, who went on to fund Musk's later ventures: Tesla and SpaceX.^[2]\n\nCustomers were not assessed fees or overdraft penalties. New member referrals\nwere rewarded with a $20 cash card and a $10 card for each new sign-up. These\nfeatures were unique for their time. For instance, customers could send money\nto another person by entering their email address into X.com.^[3]\nAdditionally, customers could open an account strictly with online\nregistration with no need to mail a check.^[4]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Elon Musk envisioned creating a full-service online bank\nthat provided checking and savings accounts, brokerage, and insurance.^[5]\nMusk commented in a 1999 interview with CBS MarketWatch: \"I think we're at the\nthird stage now where people are ready to use the Internet as their main\nfinancial repository.\"^[4]\n\nIn January 1999, Musk formally began planning an online bank while in the\nprocess of selling his company Zip2. A month after Zip2 was purchased by\nCompaq, Musk invested about $12 million into co-founding X.com in March 1999\nwith Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho.^[6]^[7] Fricker worked with\nMusk when Musk was an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Payne was a friend of\nFricker, and Ho was an engineer at Silicon Graphics and executive at Zip2.^[8]\nThe company was initially run from a house before moving to an office in Palo\nAlto.^[9]\n\nDue to conflict on how to run the company, Musk fired Fricker five months\nafter X.com had started, and the other two co-founders, Payne and Ho left\nconsequently. ^[10]^[11]\n\nX.com officially launched on December 7, 1999, with former Intuit CEO Bill\nHarris serving as the inaugural CEO.^[12]^[4] Within two months, X.com\nattracted over 200,000 signups.^[13]\n\nIn March 2000, X.com merged with its fiercest competitor Confinity, a software\ncompany also based in Palo Alto which had also developed an easy payment\nsystem. The new company was named X.com.^[14] Musk was its biggest shareholder\nand was appointed as its CEO. Started in 1998, Confinity's product PayPal\nenabled users with PalmPilots to send money to each other through the devices'\ninfrared ports.^[15]^[16] Subsequently, PayPal developed to allow users to\nsend money using email and the web.^[16]\n\nIn September 2000, when Musk was in Australia for a honeymoon trip, the X.com\nboard voted for a change of CEO from Musk to Peter Thiel, the co-founder of\nConfinity. In June 2001, X.com changed its name to PayPal.^[17]\n\n## Domain name[edit]\n\nIn July 2017, PayPal sold the domain x.com back to Elon Musk.^[18] Starting in\n2023, x.com began to be used for certain features of Twitter, acquired by\nMusk, as it rebranded to X.^[19]^[20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Markoff, John (January 28, 2000). \"Security Flaw Discovered at Online Bank\".
