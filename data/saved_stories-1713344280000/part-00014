Now imagine that you can access this information AND\nCAPTURE NOTES AND IDEAS anytime, anywhere -- even while walking, driving,\nrunning, lying down, or even waiting in line at the airport.\n\n  * NO MORE tiny, klutzy keyboards that are inaccessible even when seated at a desk!\n  * Instantly accessible - wears like a 2-way pager, but works like a pocket organizer - all in the palm of your hand!\n  * Capture information faster than any other pocket organizer -- faster than Palm Pilot, Blackberry, or Pocket Windows!\n  * Extremely easy to use - most people learn the alphabet in only a few hours (same learning curve as Graffiti).\n\nIn a nutshell, the Data Egg is the answer to the current trend of continuously\nshrinking portable devices -- 2-way pager, pocket organizers, for example --\nall of them too small to type on, and none of them accessible unless you're\nsitting down and anchored to a desk. Originally developed by Gary Friedman of\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a keyboard for astronauts, the Data Egg is\nnow poised to forge the next wave in Personal Information Appliances. Having\nsolved the keyboard barrier problem, the Data Egg for the first time will\nenable the merger of 2-way pager, phone book, notepad, calendar, e-mail, alarm\nclock, language translator, and a host of other specialized functions to all\nco-exist in one self-contained, handheld device that can easily capture as\nwell as retrieve information on the fly, regardless of position or activity.\n\nThe Data Egg's \"keyboard\" consists of seven buttons (at least 3 for the thumb,\n1 for each of the remaining fingers) wrapped around a shape that's easy for\nthe hand to hold. The seven buttons are pressed in different combinations,\nmuch like playing chords on a piano (hence the name 'chording'), and can be\nused to type all letters, all numbers, all punctuation -- pretty much anything\none can type on a typewriter. The Alphabet is also easy to learn since the\nshapes of the letters resemble the button patterns that are pressed. The first\nphysical prototype had the buttons mounted onto an Easter egg, hence the name\n'Data Egg' was born.\n\nThe applicability of the Data Egg to everyday tasks is unending; and properly\nmarketed, the Egg can have the same impact on society as have the microwave\noven, the pager, credit card, and the spreadsheet.\n\nUPDATE: After pursuing this idea for more than 15 years, as of January 1,\n2005, development on the Data Egg concept has ceased. There are no prototypes\nor schematics that can be shared. This site remains up in the hopes that\nsomeone else will grab hold of the idea and run with it.\n\nE-mail to Gary@Friedman.org\n\nOriginally designed for astronaut use, the Data Egg has many down-to-earth\napplications for position-independent activities.\n\nwww.xaphoon.com www.friedmanarchives.com www.notyourordinary.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
