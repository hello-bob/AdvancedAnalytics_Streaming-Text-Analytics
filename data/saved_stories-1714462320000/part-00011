The very visible gap between intent and execution leads\nmany to believe that government does not consistently deliver well-designed,\nwell-implemented programs or demonstrate clear strategic thinking. The roots\nfor this are many and varied:\n\n  * Zero-sum Contest: The majority endeavors to force through their agenda at all costs while in power, while the minority makes every effort to block their efforts.\n\n  * Horse Trading and Partisanship: Compromises and trade-offs dilute the original intent of laws, leading to legislation that serves political expediency rather than the public interest.\n\n  * Noise over Nuance: Buzz-worthy hammers are favored over the complex process of defining, testing, and revising hypotheses.\n\n  * Confirmation Bias: Policymakers may overlook critical data in favor of information that confirms their preconceptions.\n\n  * Lobbying and Influence: Special interest groups can unduly influence legislation, pushing for laws that benefit a few at the expense of the general welfare.\n\n  * Opacity and Accountability: Processes by which laws are negotiated and enacted often lack transparency hindering public accountability.\n\n  * Short Election Cycles: Politicians focus on short-term wins rather than long-term solutions due to upcoming elections.\n\n  * Lack of Interdisciplinary Approaches: Lawmaking often lacks input from diverse fields, leading to solutions that don't fully address multifaceted problems.\n\n  * Complexity of Modern Societies: The interdependence of global systems can overwhelm the legislative process, leading to blunt solutions.\n\n  * Inadequate Data and Research: Policies might be based on incomplete or outdated information, lacking a robust empirical foundation.\n\n  * Principal / Agent misalignment: The incentives of those responsible for enacting policy may not align with those who are responsible for creating legislation.\n\nOne of the core reasons for the disconnect between the intent and execution of\ngovernment programs, I believe, lies in what I call \u201cleaky hypotheses\u201d that\nare endemic in law and policy crafting. At its core, every piece of\nlegislation embodies a hypothesis: we don't define background checks, set\nwelfare entitlements, or forgive student loans arbitrarily. In each case,\nthere's a hypothesis being tested, such as \"Background checks for assault\nweapons will reduce violent crime,\" or \"Welfare entitlements will protect our\nmost vulnerable citizens while not disincentivizing work.\"\n\nHowever, the journey from legislative drafting to implementation often\nintroduces \"leaks\" in these hypotheses due to several key reasons:\n\n  * Lack of Clear Definition: The hypothesis behind a law is frequently not explicitly stated, leaving room for ambiguity, evasion, goalpost shifting, and varied interpretations and enforcements.\n\n  * Compromised Execution and Atomicity: The legislative process is marked by negotiations and compromises which dilute the law's focus and effectiveness. As a result, the original hypothesis can become fragmented, muddied, or even inverted. This often occurs when laws are combined and mutated along with other legislative aims to aid passage, sometimes resulting in the dreaded omnibus bills.\n\n  * Inadequate Data Collection and Experimentation: Robust frameworks for data collection and analysis are seldom attached to laws, making it difficult to measure their impact accurately or adapt based on empirical findings.\n\n  * Absence of Parsimony: Legislation often becomes encumbered with extraneous elements that do not serve the core hypothesis, complicating the assessment of the law's effectiveness in achieving its intended goal.\n\n  * Inconsistent Implementation: Once passed legislation moves to enactment and enforcement, which may lead to differing implementation and adherence between different jurisdictional or organizational entities tasked with implementing legislation.\n\nThe legislative process introduces intricacies and complications that lead to\na significant divergence from the original aims. Watered-down provisions,\nstate-level implementation variations, and the absence of a consistent,\nreliable feedback mechanism exacerbate this divergence. Lacking an\nexperimental framework to test and validate underlying assumptions, policies\nbecome subject to a cycle of debate, uneven enactment, and contention that\nfails to advance understanding or effectiveness.\n\nIn this cycle, advocates claim that the altered law didn't fulfill its\noriginal intent, while opponents declare its failure. Both sides then return\nto square one, each aiming to force through winner-take-all legislation to\nenact their agenda and repeal that of their opponents. As a result, the\nbalance of power may shift, but the argument remains static.\n\nThis approach all but guarantees that the original \u201cleaky\u201d hypothesis will be\nre-litigated unchanged in the future. The vicious and inescapable cycle\ncontinues: the same arguments are repeated, but without the benefit of\nevidence and experimentation to evolve the dialogue or policy. Even when new\nevidence emerges it is often treated with the credulity of a TIME magazine\ncover rather than the continuous agglomeration, synthesis, and interpretation\nof a scientific approach.\n\nTIME: Eat Butter\n\nThe underlying \u201creal\u201d hypotheses of legislation remain in stasis, untested and\nunrefined. This environment makes it nearly impossible to consistently and\nsystematically craft laws that clearly and effectively address the challenges\nthey intend to solve and can adapt based on new data and changing conditions.\nConsequently, we perpetuate a system of governance that struggles to evolve\nand adapt to the needs and complexities of modern society.\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted elsewhere, government stands in stark contrast to scientific and\ntechnological endeavors which, despite their flaws, are able to evolve their\nconversation and shared understanding due to a firm empirical bent. In these\nother fields, the iterative, cyclical process of hypothesis generation,\ntesting, and refinement drives progress. The challenge and opportunity for us\nlie in applying this empirical rigor to the craft of governance, transforming\nhow laws are made, applied, and evolved.\n\n##\n\nCorrectness Conditions: Scientific Policy\n\nHaving delineated our problem, we can define the contours of our solution. As\nalways with the caveat that pragmatism should temper the aspirational nature\nof these rules.\n\n  * Clear and Testable Hypotheses: Policies should articulate a clear and testable hypothesis, setting measurable objectives that facilitate the evaluation of the policy's impact. This clarity allows policymakers and the public to understand the intended outcomes and assess whether those outcomes are being achieved. Pedant\u2019s note, I say accept the hypothesis because that\u2019s the accepted language but more formally the goal should always be to reject the null hypothesis. In addition, hypotheses should always be evolving as new data and learnings emerge.\n\n  * Parsimony and Atomicity in Policy Design: Policies should aim to be parsimoniously atomic, addressing target issues without needlessly muddying analysis. This approach prevents the convolutions typical of omnibus bills, ensuring that each piece of legislation has a focused, direct, and measurable impact.\n\n  * Incorporation of Experimental Design: Each law and policy must include an experimental framework for systematic data collection and analysis. This empirical approach not only enables testing and validating the policy's underlying hypotheses but also creates a powerful flywheel effect. Data gathered from previous legislation can generate new hypotheses, provide unexpected insights, and help other jurisdictions accelerate their policy development based on prior art and data. This encourages the spread of good experimental design and testing methodologies across jurisdictions as well.\n\n  * Path for Experimental Improvement: Beyond initial design, laws and policies should provide a clear path for iterative improvement based on empirical findings. This adaptability allows policies to evolve in response to new data, ensuring that legislation remains relevant and effective in a changing world.\n\n  * Parsimony in Law and Policy: In addition to being parsimoniously atomic in design, policies should also minimize regulatory, compliance, and paperwork that obstruct testing and evaluation while making the policies less accessible and adding administrative overhead. Keeping the overhead of any policy parsimoniously light improves accessibility and prevents administration of the policy from becoming a confounding factor. Following Occam's razor, strive for simplicity and directness in policy implementation to avoid unnecessary barriers that hinder the empirical evaluation and iterative improvement of legislation. This balance requires a careful evaluation of each policy component, ensuring that every element serves a necessary function without adding undue complexity.\n\n##\n\nSolution: Law as Hypothesis Testing\n\nThe way I propose to do this is through a framework I call law as hypothesis\ntesting. At its core is a simple conceit: Every law can be reformulated as a\ntestable hypothesis. For instance, \"If it is illegal to purchase semi-\nautomatic weapons in the state of California, fewer people will acquire them,\nand this will reduce the casualties of mass shootings.\" Similarly, the\nopposition to this could be couched as a counter-hypothesis: \u201cIf it is illegal\nto purchase semi-automatic weapons, criminals will be emboldened, and rates of\nassaults and home invasions will increase.\u201d\n\nMaking the hypothesis clear and testable offers numerous benefits. It forces\nadvocates and opponents to think about the outcomes critically, potentially\nmaking it easier to craft effective policy. It aligns legislators and\nadministrators around designing the correct study rather than fixating on a\npolicy they agree with. Instead of bickering about who is right, the\nconversation shifts to what's the best way to prove it. Enemies are turned\ninto co-conspirators in the pursuit of truth.\n\nIf your objective is to reduce gun violence, you may discover that focusing on\nassault weapons is a misdirection, as the newsworthiness of mass shootings is\noutweighed by the more pedestrian march of shootings, accidents, and suicides.\n\nA clear hypothesis also weeds out bad actors and special interests. These\ngroups have no place to hang their hat since they must propose a hypothesis\nthey believe to be supportable forcing them to either declare their interests\noutright or desperately retreat against a tide of overwhelming evidence.\n\nNotice how this aligns the incentives of legislators. Whether I agree or\ndisagree with the core policy proposal, I have a stake in proposing an\nalternate hypothesis and ensuring good experimental design (which I believe\nwill validate my hypothesis). My objection to the policy is tempered by the\nfact that if the data comes back in my favor, I will be able to iterate on it\nor even reverse course, regardless of the power dynamics at the time.\nSimilarly, as a supporter of the legislation, the urge to tamper with my\nproposal is limited since doing so weakens the evidence for my experiment.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of this approach is making data collection an integral\npart of any law or policy. It's crucial to accurately measure the benefits and\ncosts of the changes being proposed. While I am generally wary of imposing\nstrict rules on data collection, allocating a proportion of the cost or\nbenefit towards this endeavor seems reasonable. For instance, if the proposed\ncost of implementing a piece of legislation is $1M, and the projected benefit\nis $10M per year, dedicating 1% of the proposed net benefit to data collection\nand analysis would be sensible. Even at these low stakes, this represents a\nsignificant increase in funding for data collection and analysis.\n\nThe potential for unlocking all these data sets is immense. Providing a wealth\nof high-quality data for analysis not only fosters an industry to generate and\nanalyze this data but also has incredible knock-on effects. The current\nstruggle to find regularly updated and timely research from government sources\ncould be alleviated by setting up a comprehensive system that utilizes\nstandard data collection, formatting, and tagging techniques. This approach\nwould not only facilitate further research but also lead to the organic\nemergence of new law hypotheses from prior legislation. The creation of a\nmassive, standardized, and accessible database of research data is not just an\nadministrative improvement; it's a paradigm shift that can transform the\nlandscape of policy-making and governance, shifting it towards a more\nempirical, data-driven model and providing grist to the mills of academic\nresearch and private enterprise built on top of open data.\n\nSo far I\u2019ve used toy issues but take something like whether we should create\nmanufacturing jobs or reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Both\nsides probably have something valid to say, concerns to address, and outcomes\nthey care about. Both sides also probably really believe in their cause and\nhave some shared goal even if they couch it in different terms. But even\ndiametrically opposed parties have an interest now in setting up a common\nframework for collecting data on the problem. Which inevitably leads to\nfiguring out how to measure the thing in question.\n\nWith this approach we\u2019ve moved the battle from what the solution and nature of\nthe problem is to a battle over efficacy. There\u2019s no longer any incentive to\nhalf-bake and compromise a solution since that weakens your hypothesis,\ninstead the battle shifts to what and how to measure the outcome.\n\nInstead of opposing parties trying to reconcile opposing aims in the solution\nthey now have a shared goal of being able to accept or reject a hypothesis\nthrough effective experimentation.\n\nYou also lose the winner-takes-all nature of politics where each party tries\nto jam through all that they can while they have control since now there is a\ndirect feedback mechanism where if you jam through something ineffective it\nwill come back and reflect poorly on you and if you are in opposition even if\nyou don\u2019t get what you want you can be comforted by the fact that the evidence\nwill turn in your favor and invalidate the opposition.\n\nIt also encourages experimentation. While some purists may frown at the rules\nnot applying equally to everyone it is much easier to propose an approach that\nis limited either to the population it affects or the time it is in effect. It\nis better to propose legislation that clearly defines a testable hypothesis\nthan have it apply universally out of the gate. For instance, a hypothesis\nabout replacing existing welfare programs with unconditional cash transfers\ncould be tested on a subset of welfare recipients rather than a universal\nsolution that only replaces a subset or fraction of benefits.\n\nThis approach might not work with as cynical a party as the NRA but take even\nsomething like abstinence-only education. Pro-abstinence parties are going to\nmake little progress explaining how many unbaptized babies you can fit upon a\npinhead. Anti-abstinence parties are going to make little headway talking of\npersonal empowerment. But maybe, just maybe, they can come to a shared\nframework of something like high school graduation rates and children born out\nof wedlock by age cohort that allows both sides to test a hypothesis that they\nbelieve supports further legislation.\n\nEven if it all fails. We\u2019ve collected data and we can iterate on it again\nwithin a framework. We won\u2019t move 100% of the folks on an issue but if we can\nmove 20% the conversation shifts and the side that\u2019s on the losing side of the\nevidence has to either find a way to justify the discrepancy in the data, find\na new justification for their belief, or abandon their position. This approach\nwins not because people see a data point that contradicts their priors and\nchanges their minds but rather evidence accumulates in a collaborative process\nin which they are an active participant.\n\nAnother benefit is we\u2019ve taken away the stigma of failure. If my hypothesis is\nrejected, I\u2019ve learned something and gained knowledge not lost my reputation.\n\n###\n\nAdaptive Policy Trials\n\nAnother way to envision the end goal of this approach is by drawing a parallel\nwith the evolution in medicine towards adaptive clinical trials.\n\n> An adaptive design is defined as a design that allows modifications to the\n> trial and/or statistical procedures of the trial after its initiation\n> without undermining its validity and integrity.[8] The purpose is to make\n> clinical trials more flexible, efficient and fast. Due to the level of\n> flexibility involved, these trial designs are also termed as \u201cflexible\n> designs.\u201d1\n\nAdaptive clinical trials have significantly advanced medicine by embracing\nflexibility, permitting real-time adjustments based on interim results without\nundermining the study's integrity. This adaptability allows promising\ninterventions to be refined, more widely implemented, and approved more\nswiftly, ultimately benefiting patients and enhancing outcomes. In a parallel\nmanner, adopting an adaptive framework in policy-making can lead to more\nresponsive, effective, and beneficial policy changes. It ensures that\nlegislation can swiftly adapt to new findings and evolving societal needs,\nthereby broadening the reach and impact of well-informed policy decisions.\n\nCentral to the success of an adaptive policy-making framework is the robust\ncollection and analysis of data. Just as the precision and reliability of data\nare paramount in adaptive clinical trials, ensuring accurate and timely\nadjustments, a similar commitment to rigorous data practices is essential in\nthe realm of policy-making. Comprehensive data collection and sophisticated\nanalysis not only provide the empirical basis for initial policy formulation\nbut also enable continuous monitoring and iterative refinement. This process\nensures that policies are not static but are living entities that evolve in\nresponse to new insights and changing circumstances. By establishing a robust\ndata infrastructure, we empower policymakers to make informed decisions,\nvalidate the effectiveness of interventions, and adapt strategies proactively,\nthereby enhancing the overall impact and responsiveness of governance.\n\nWe now have a consensus-driven hypothesis to test. We have a policy in place\nthat we believe will influence the outcome of this hypothesis. A robust data\ncollection system is set up to systematically measure and analyze the results.\nAnd, as we acquire and analyze data, we are ready to flexibly adapt our\ndesign.\n\n  * Expanding Policy Reach: If we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that our policy has a positive impact, we can consider widening the scope, reach, or extent of the policy to magnify the benefit.\n\n  * Revising and Iterating: Conversely, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that our policy may not be achieving its goals, we are not bound to an endless cycle of policy ping pong. Instead, we can revise our original hypothesis, propose a new, more focused trial, or perhaps decide to put an inconclusive or ineffective policy to rest.\n\nImagining the culmination of this approach, I foresee a system where prior\nevidence directly influences the passage and repeal of laws. If a hypothesis\ndemonstrates promise, the affected population or the scale of response could\nbe automatically adjusted, fostering a more responsive and dynamic legislative\nenvironment. Alternatively, the criteria for passing or renewing legislation\ncould evolve to be more evidence-based; for instance, legislation supported by\nrobust experimental evidence might require a lower threshold, say 41%, rather\nthan the conventional 51%, to pass.\n\n###\n\nTwo-Way Door Legislation\n\nWhen considering the practical application of our adaptive policy-making\napproach, it's essential to assess the reversibility of decisions. Borrowing a\nconcept from Amazon, we can categorize decisions as \"two-way door\" or \"one-way\ndoor.\" Two-way door decisions are those that are modular and easily\nreversible. For example, changing the organ donation process to an opt-out\nsystem involves minimal costs and processes, making it a reversible, two-way\ndoor decision. On the other hand, decisions like altering the US power mix to\ninclude more nuclear energy represent one-way door decisions due to the\nsignificant fixed costs and long timescales involved, making them difficult to\nreverse.\n\nIn situations where we face a one-way door decision, the best strategy is to\nrefine our approach to make the hypothesis more testable and iterative. Can we\nexamine a more limited hypothesis? Is it possible to test our hypothesis\nthrough random sampling without applying it universally? While we can never\nentirely eliminate one-way door decisions, we can certainly make them less\nfrequent and ensure that when they arise, they are backed by substantial\nevidence. By making our hypotheses more testable and iterative, we enhance the\nadaptability of our policies, even in scenarios where decisions are less\nreversible. This approach ensures that every policy, regardless of its\ninherent reversibility, is subject to scrutiny, experimentation, and evidence-\nbased refinement.\n\n##\n\nConclusion: From Hypothesis to Testing\n\nHow do we bring the Law as Hypothesis Testing from a theory into practice?\n\nThe litmus test for a framework's value lies in real-world application,\nechoing as always, E.M. Box\u2019s \u201call models are wrong, some models are useful\u201d.\nWe need the amateur scientists and innovators in policy-making to adopt this\napproach, experiment rigorously, and observe outcomes critically.\n\nBenefits of this approach:\n\n  * Scale Invariance: This approach is adaptable, fitting policies of any scale, from local to national. It aligns data collection and analysis with the policy's scope, budget and anticipated impact, ensuring that even modest initiatives are grounded in empirical evidence.\n\n  * Compatibility with Existing Legislative Processes: This framework doesn't necessitate an overhaul of the legislative process. It encourages policymakers to frame hypotheses, design experiments, and embed scientific rigor in their work and thinking but it does not preclude drafting traditional legislation that incorporates these elements. This compatibility ensures that even amidst political compromises, the core of a testable hypothesis can endure.\n\nBut the elephant in the room remains: What\u2019s the incentive for existing\nactors, politicians and bureaucrats to depart from the status quo and embrace\nthis novel approach?\n\n  * Societal Improvement: Perhaps some naive optimism is in order. In an era where trust in the ability and confidence of government is eroding, some politicians may genuinely seek a framework to improve legislative outcomes while improving flexibility and responsiveness.\n\n  * Double Down on Success or Pivot on Failure: This model allows policymakers to responsively amplify successful initiatives or pivot from failing initiatives in a rapid, data-driven, adaptive manner.\n\n  * Political Cover and Escape from Gridlock: By centering politics on empirical measurement, it offers politicians an escape from political gridlock and rigid party lines. They receive cover for unpopular decisions by letting the evidence tie their hands. And can shelter from criticism under the aegis of eventual vindication by the evidence.\n\n  * Indulge Pet Causes: Politicians passionate about specific issues can incorporate measuring these into the experimental framework, ensuring their concerns are measured and addressed without the excesses of traditional pork-barrel politics. It is cheaper to measure a pet cause than implement and administer it as law.\n\nLet\u2019s advance open societies by bringing the scientific method and empirical\ntesting to bear on the law. Let\u2019s refine this framework together and engage\ndecision-makers and legislators to urge them towards a future where governance\nevolves through data, evidence, and continuous innovation.\n\nScales of justice balancing law and data\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2941608/#sec1-2title\n\n### Subscribe to Engineering Open Societies\n\nBy Asa Downs \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nUsing the tools and processes of software engineering to build a better world.\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Law as Hypothesis Testing\n\nasadowns.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nEngineering Open Societies\n\nOr tilting at windmills, you decide\n\nMar 5, 2023 \u2022\n\nAsa Downs\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Engineering Open Societies\n\nasadowns.substack.com\n\n2\n\nDesign Documents\n\nOr, write what you know\n\nMar 12, 2023 \u2022\n\nAsa Downs\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Design Documents\n\nasadowns.substack.com\n\nGovernment as a Service\n\nPart 1: Objective, Problem Statements\n\nMar 19, 2023 \u2022\n\nAsa Downs\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Government as a Service\n\nasadowns.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Asa Downs\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
