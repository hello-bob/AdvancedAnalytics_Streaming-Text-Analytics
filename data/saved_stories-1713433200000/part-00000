Popa\n\nArt by Carson McNamara.\n\nForget the Emily Dickinson you think you know, that hermetic author of\nbedeviling sense, \u201cSo Anthracite, to live - // For some - an Ampler Zero -.\u201d\nSay goodbye to the Belle and Recluse of Amherst, Mythic Emily, and every other\nepithet that scholars, biographers, and critics have coined to stoke the\npublic\u2019s fascination with a human sphinx. Behold, instead, a woman who baked\u2014a\nlot\u2014for friends, family, and neighbors; who lamented that she didn\u2019t receive\nany valentines at school (\u201cI have not quite done hoping for one\u201d); who was\nvery often funny and used a prodigious number of exclamation points in letters\nto her family (\u201cYour welcome letter found me all engaged in the history of\nSulphuric Acid!!!!!\u201d); and who, until age 35, traveled and visited friends,\nbefore poor health made traveling impossible. Toward the end of her life, in\n1884, she sent 86 letters to 34 recipients: the majority express thanks,\nothers include a gift of flowers or food, and a handful convey condolences or\ncongratulations. Her supposed withdrawal from the world\u2014and readers\u2019 continued\ninterest with such a narrative\u2014has an apocryphal dimension we must be willing\nto forego in order to see and hear the poet clearly, perhaps for the first\ntime.\n\nEdited by the scholars Cristanne Miller and Domhnall Mitchell, The Letters of\nEmily Dickinson (Harvard University Press, 2024) promises to be the definitive\nedition of the poet\u2019s 1,304 letters, expanded, revised, and annotated for the\nfirst time in more than 60 years. At least 80 letters have been discovered or\nre-edited since Thomas H. Johnson and Theodora Ward published their edition of\nThe Letters of Emily Dickinson in 1958. As Miller and Mitchell make plain,\n\u201cEditorial standards have changed dramatically. And Dickinson scholarship has\nexploded. Scholars were still debating the significance of Dickinson\u2019s oeuvre\nin the 1950s, but her position in the pantheon of great writers is now\nsecure.\u201d In other words, there has never been a better time to revisit and\nrestore the author\u2019s charismatic, sensitive, and characteristically brilliant\nprose.\n\nThe new book\u2019s extensive and considered introductory essay establishes Miller\nand Mitchell\u2019s modus operandi, and carefully outlines the ways this version\ndistinguishes itself from its predecessors. Among the editors\u2019 contributions\nto Dickinson scholarship is a painstaking effort to correct the chronology of\nthe letters that Johnson and Ward previously published. Even poems dated by\nR.W. Franklin, the leading scholar of Dickinson\u2019s manuscripts, are identified\nonly by year, or season and year. As Miller and Mitchell explain, \u201cA\ncollection of letters that proceeds chronologically, however, requires greater\nprecision than a year to establish a likely sequence of correspondence. Our\nredating, together with our annotation, indicates that Dickinson was writing\nin response to local and world events and to the visits of her friends, and we\nattempt to recreate that sequence of response.\u201d\n\nTo undertake this delicate work, Miller and Mitchell set out on an\ninvestigation of poetic observation, relying on Dickinson\u2019s own attention to\nthe natural world:\n\n> Because Dickinson wrote so often about plants, birds, bees, and other\n> insects, we attend to the typical New England season of bloom for arbutus,\n> apple blossoms, or roses, and to migratory patterns. ... Much of her\n> correspondence was occasional. Even if a poem was composed months or years\n> earlier, her sending it to a particular person is likely to respond to\n> something immediate\u2014whether a weather event or event in a correspondent\u2019s\n> life or in the world. In assigning a placement or date to the letters, we\n> consider their sequential relationship to known occasions. We also consider\n> them holistically, in relation to the narrative of relationships illuminated\n> by other letters.\n\nRelying on a local record of weather patterns in Amherst (not available to\nJohnson and Ward) and the Williston Seminary catalogue, the editors were able\nto assign, for instance, the precise date of October 14, 1844 to a letter\npreviously dated \u201cAutumn 1844.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, Miller and Mitchell provide invaluable contextual annotations\nand restore material that previous transcribers omitted\u2014\u201ceven where the\nomissions themselves seem innocuous,\u201d as they write. We learn that hundreds of\nDickinson\u2019s letters were destroyed, which was customary in the 19th century\nafter a person died. But Mabel Loomis Todd, co-editor of two volumes of\nDickinson\u2019s poems, had the foresight to begin collecting letters in the early\n1890s, preventing the further loss of these precious artifacts. Among the\nnewly included letters are two to Elizabeth Seelye, whose husband Julius was\ninaugurated as president of Amherst College in 1877 (the family noted having\nburned 75 Dickinson poems they received, an act of shocking sacrilege to\nmodern readers) and another to Ellen Dickinson, the wife of Emily\u2019s cousin,\nwho reports having destroyed \u201ca considerable number\u201d of Dickinson\u2019s poems.\nThis edition expeditiously illustrates the race against the ravages of\nnegligence and time that such scholarship requires.\n\nThe larger consequence of these efforts is to show, once and for all, that\nDickinson was never isolated from the world, but rather sensitively engaged\nwith local and national events. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a\ndistinguished family with a wide social circle, she was an active member of\nher community, comfortable initiating correspondence with even famous\nindividuals of her time\u2014among them the Civil War colonel, abolitionist,\nauthor, and advocate of women\u2019s rights Thomas Wentworth Higginson, with whom\nshe shared a lifelong friendship. Her reluctance to see visitors as she grew\nolder\u2014but not to bake them gingerbread or correspond with them\u2014can be\nexplained at least in part by the time she spent caring for ill family members\nor navigating her own poor health. She was socially adept and flexible,\nnaturally modulating in her correspondences, easily and willingly engaging\nwith people from all social classes. Her letters to family members buzz with\nlocal and personal news. An 1850 letter to Abiah Root, a close friend\nDickinson met at Mount Holyoke, captures the poet's playfulness:\n\n> The circumstances under which I write you this morning are at once glorious,\n> afflicting, and beneficial, glorious in ends, afflicting in means, and\n> beneficial I trust in both. Twin loaves of bread have just been born into\n> the world under my auspices, fine children, the image of their mother, and\n> here my dear friend is the glory.\n\nDickinson's older brother, Austin, especially relied on her to be kept abreast\nof happenings at home whenever he was away. \u201cWhile she may not have seen some\nof these correspondents, or seen them only rarely, Dickinson understood\nfriendship and repeatedly showed herself to be a loving friend,\u201d Miller and\nMitchell write.\n\nShe is also frequently funny, capable of making quick, wry assessments\nalongside her casual profundity. When Dickinson was 10 years old, her father\nEdward was forced to sell part of the Dickinson homestead out of financial\nnecessity, moving the family to a smaller house on West Street where they\nwould stay for 15 years. Edward repurchased the house in 1855, whereupon\n25-year-old Emily commented in a letter to her friend Elizabeth Holland: \u201cThey\nsay that \u2018home is where the heart is.\u2019 I think it is where the house is, and\nthe adjacent buildings.\u201d A later letter to Holland concludes with her typical\nwarmth and tenderness, \u201cPardon my sanity Mrs. Holland, in a world insane, and\nlove me if you will, for I had rather be loved than to be called a King in\nEarth, or a Lord in Heaven.\u201d Dickinson\u2019s life as a poet was shaped by these\nmundanities and everyday upheavals, as well as by larger historical\nundercurrents, which she sensed with stunning perspicacity. In spring 1861,\nshe sent a letter-poem to her sister-in-law Susan Gilbert Dickinson that,\nportentously, alluded to the forthcoming Civil War:\n\n> A slash of Blue - A sweep of Gray - Some scarlet patches on the way, Compose\n> an evening sky - A little Purple - slipped between - Some Ruby Trowsers\n> hurried on - A Wave of Gold - A Bank of Day - This just makes out the\n> morning sky!\n\nBut it\u2019s this edition\u2019s underlying scope that will truly win over the poet\u2019s\nadmirers. \u201cEmily Dickinson was a letter writer before she was a poet,\u201d the\nintroduction begins. Any fan of Dickinson would rightfully line up for a\nglimpse of her poems in the letters, and indeed, the cadence of her poems is\nevident in thrilling flashes throughout. But what proves even more enjoyable\nthan the fragmentary phrases idiosyncratically housed between em dashes is the\ninverse, moments of dilated thought that might later be essentialized in a\npoem. \u201cHow swiftly summer has fled & what report has it borne to heaven of\nmisspent time & wasted hours? Eternity only will answer,\u201d she writes to Abiah\nRoot in an early letter dated September 8, 1846. Miller and Mitchell remark on\nthe similarities between Dickinson\u2019s poetry and prose, noting that \u201cher\nprocess of composition in both genres may have been similar at its earliest\nstages: a retained metaphor or sequence of language might serve as the germ of\na letter, or it might linger in her workshop until a letter seemed just right\nto house it, just as a poem might begin with a resonant phrase.\u201d\n\nThis illustrates the porous boundary between the poet\u2019s two modes of thinking\non the page. Those closest to her knew she kept notes on language that stirred\nher and that could be later adapted as the phrases of a letter or the lines of\na poem. In fact, she even insisted on receiving intriguing details in a letter\nto Austin dated June 15, 1851: \u201cWont you please to state the name of the boy\nthat turned the faintest, as I like to get such facts to set down in my\njournal, also anything else that\u2019s startling which you may chance to know \u2013 I\ndont think deaths or murders can ever come amiss in a young \u2013 woman\u2019s\njournal.\u201d In another later letter to Austin from June 11, 1854, she admits to\nwriting without her usual reserve of material: \u201cJohn Emerson just went away\nfrom here \u2013 he has been spending the evening, and I\u2019m so tired now, that I\nwrite just as it happens, so you must\u2019nt expect any style. This is truly\nextempore, Austin \u2013 I have no notes in my pocket.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most evident slippage between her poetry and prose is delivered in\nher \u201cletter-poems.\u201d Dickinson was locally recognized as a poet and sent more\nthan 500 poems, or stanzas and lines, to those she corresponded with across\nher lifetime. The letters sent without accompanying prose are known as\n\u201cletter-poems,\u201d and Miller and Mitchell have added an additional 214 such\nexamples to the 24 already cataloged, providing readers with a far deeper\nunderstanding of how poems\u2014like the missives themselves\u2014served as a form of\ncommunication for Dickinson. As the editors explain, \u201cDickinson quoted poems\nby other writers; sometimes sent a poem to one correspondent as verse and to\nanother lineated as prose; and at times wrote passages in intermittent or\ncontinuous metered prose\u2014that is, prose with the metrical rhythms of verse,\nand sometimes even rhyme, but lineated as prose. In one form or another, the\nrhythms of poetry recur throughout her letter writing.\u201d In a letter to her\ncousin Louisa Norcross dated May 29, 1863, the two modes blend, as a prose\nsummary of Dickinson\u2019s visit ends in a distilled couplet:\n\n> Jennie Hitchcock\u2019s mother was buried yesterday, so there is one orphan more,\n> and her father is very sick besides. My father and mother went to the\n> service, and mother said while the minister prayed a hen with her chickens\n> came up, and tried to fly into the window. I suppose the dead lady used to\n> feed them, and they wanted to bid her Good-bye.\n>\n> Life is death we\u2019re lengthy at, Death the hinge to life.\n\nElsewhere and throughout, lines of poetry and prose blur in a dynamic, vital\nmeasure, drawing out the inherent creativity of address inspired by the\naddressee. Indeed, Dickinson\u2019s best correspondents offered teeming soil for a\nteeming mind, a space to think, for Dickinson to be Dickinson. An 1850\nvalentine, likely sent to George H. Gould, a student at Amherst Academy,\nreveals Dickinson's natural modulation from quick wit to offhand profundity.\n\u201cOur friendship sir, shall endure till sun and moon shall wane no more. ...\nThat\u2019s what they call a metaphor in our country. Don\u2019t be afraid of it, sir,\nit won\u2019t bite!\u201d In the next paragraph, she offers a perennial assessment: \u201cBut\nthe world is sleeping in ignorance and error, sir, and we must be crowing-\ncocks, and singing-larks, and a rising sun to awake her; or else we\u2019ll pull\nsociety up to the roots, and plant it in a different place.\u201d\n\nCertainly, scholarship has made leaps and bounds since its earliest attempts\nto categorize an uncategorizable talent\u2014still, I cannot help wondering what\nhas taken so long, and if there\u2019s isn\u2019t more at play than a portrait\nunintentionally skewed by historic shadows. When faced with genius that is sui\ngeneris, that invites no immediate comparisons, there is an understandable\nurge to lean on the biography for answers. Surely something must explain such\ninsistent originality, the poet\u2019s enigmatic, compulsively absorbing cadence,\ntextured diction, and time-bending syntax in poems that anticipate T.S.\nEliot\u2019s charge that \u201cgenuine poetry can communicate before it is understood.\u201d\nJohnson and Ward\u2019s 1958 edition proclaimed that Dickinson \u201cdid not live in\nhistory and held no view of it, past or current.\u201d Her letters, richly detailed\nand relishing their present, prove decidedly otherwise. Somewhere along the\nway, scholars accounted for Dickinson\u2019s psychic complexity and epigrammatic\nvision by turning her into a steely, nightgown-wearing spinster, a mind\nalternately cooled by the language of the stars or agitated by death. We\u2019ve\nlooked away as she baked gingerbread and pressed flowers. We have framed her\ngenius in the way that is comfortable to imagine: the result of an intensity\nexclusively achievable in a vacuum, acquired in seclusion hinged on\ntemperamental proclivities. What selfishness, what loneliness\u2014we might achieve\nsome genius ourselves, but at what cost? All along, it is our vision that has\nbeen too small, not Dickinson\u2019s.\n\nWhat is made plain in these letters is that the reality is far more wondrous\nthan the prefab myth of Dickinson that has so long existed, in part, to\nrationalize how so extraordinary a mind could come by its power. What if\nDickinson\u2019s vision wasn\u2019t arrived at through hermetic seclusion but in\ncompany? Is it not, perhaps, the ancient refusal to acknowledge women in their\nfullness that has denied Dickinson her social life, diminishing her inherent\nplayfulness, renouncing the warmth of her intimacies in favor of otherworldly\nfevers? Might it have seemed incongruous to past scholars to wrestle with a\npicture of a person as at ease on earth as on Parnassus\u2014a poet who could\ntoggle her vision from wide to atomic, traveling the reverberations of a\nsingle word and following that mental thread to its essential, unknowable\nnature? When we deny Dickinson a chance at triviality, we deny her the\nfullness of existence, the very material from which she drew her strength. Can\nwe accept that being a loving friend was at least as important to her as her\npoetry? Can we imagine a person whose social life unfolded on her own terms,\nand who, in fact, turned to it for inspiration? In doing so, we honor\nDickinson not as a myth but as a flesh-and-blood woman who once walked\u2014and\nwrote\u2014among us. We let in the richness of life for which Dickinson stood.\n\nMaya C.
