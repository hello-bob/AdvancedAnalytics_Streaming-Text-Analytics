Consider grabbing one of our 3D metal\nemblem pint glasses to go with it: https://store.gamersnexus.net/product... EK\nWater Blocks is accused of non-payment of contractors, employees, and\nsuppliers. We dug into the story and came into contact with now over a dozen\npeople, at time of publishing, who verified various versions of this report.\nWe have collected spreadsheets, cost sheets, chat logs, screenshots of emails\nand messages, contracts, and tax status information painting a picture of a\ncompany driven into the ground by a CEO put in place by the founder. The story\nis bleak, and we think EK's only chance at recovery is IMMEDIATE rectification\nfollowed by swift internal action to correct company culture, behavior, and\nhandling of money. EK's founder must now bear the difficult burden of righting\nhis ship, but at this time, it is unclear how much the founder might be\nimplicated in all of this. EK has taken legal action against some who have\nspoken out. GamersNexus has prepared all necessary evidence in the event a\nfollow-up is required or if EK becomes further legally active.
