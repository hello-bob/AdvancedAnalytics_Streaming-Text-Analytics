It is produced by\nthe French company R\u00e9my Martin to promote Louis XIII, their cognac which takes\n100 years to create. Advertised in 2015 with the tagline \"The Movie You Will\nNever See\", it is due to be released on November 18, 2115. The film stars an\ninternational ensemble cast, with American actor John Malkovich, Chinese\nactress Shuya Chang, and Chilean actor Marko Zaror.\n\n100 Years is apparently a short film. Rodriguez stated in a 2019 interview:\n\n> I was making several short films for them, and I finished that one first, we\n> shot that one first, I thought that was gonna be a commercial or something.\n> And then I showed them the movie and they said \"Yeah, that's great, that's\n> great. That's the one we lock away.\" And I said, \"What? That's the one you\n> lock away? What about the other one with the future...\" \"No, that's the\n> commercial.\"\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\nWhile the details of the film have been kept highly secret, the names of three\nactors have been released:^[1]^[2]\n\n  * John Malkovich\n  * Shuya Chang\n  * Marko Zaror\n\n## Production[edit]\n\nMalkovich and Rodriguez announced in November 2015 that they had teamed with\nLouis XIII Cognac, owned by R\u00e9my Martin, to create a film inspired by the\nhundred years it takes to make a bottle of Louis XIII.^[3] Although the film's\nplot remains a complete secret, on November 18, 2015, Malkovich and Rodriguez\nreleased three teaser trailers: Retro,^[2] Nature,^[4] and Future.^[5]^[6]\n\n## Release[edit]\n\nPending release, the film is being kept in a high-tech safe behind bulletproof\nglass that will open automatically on November 18, 2115, the day of the film's\npremiere. One thousand guests from around the world, including Malkovich and\nRodriguez, have received a pair of invitation tickets made of metal for the\npremiere, which they can hand down to their descendants.^[3]^[7] The safe in\nwhich 100 Years is kept was showcased at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and\nvarious other cities before being returned to Cognac, France and the Louis\nXIII cellars.^[8]\n\n## Related[edit]\n\nA song, \"100 Years\", is said by Louis XIII Cognac to have been composed for\nthem by Pharrell Williams and performed live, once, at a private party. Louis\nXIII Cognac has promised that a recording of the song will be issued in\n2117.^[9]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Future Library project\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Lussier, Germain (November 18, 2015). \"John Malkovich and Robert Rodriguez Have Made A Movie No One Will See For 100 Years\". io9.
