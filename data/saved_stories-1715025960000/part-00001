And that\u2019s \u201creader mode\u201d, a web browser feature.\n\n### 1\\. How to turn on Reader or \u201cSpeedreader\u201d Mode in Brave\n\nThe Brave browser has two built-in reader options. The normal reader mode can\nbe activated from a compatible web page by hitting the \u2018Turn on reader mode\u2019\non the right side of the URL bar, like so:\n\nBut you can also turn on \u201cSpeedreader\u201d mode by navigating to Settings >\nAppearance and hitting the toggle next to Speedreader. This will cause\ncompatible pages to load in reader mode automatically, making them faster and\nless bandwidth intensive. That makes Brave arguably the best browser for\nbandwidth and loading times.\n\nNote: Reader mode works the same in the Brave mobile app, but they don\u2019t seem\nto have implemented Speedreader for mobile yet.\n\n### 2\\. How to turn on Reader Mode in Firefox\n\nFirefox also has a built-in reader view, which can be activated by clicking\nToggle reader view with the button on the right side of the URL bar \u2013 or by\npressing F9. It works the same way in the Firefox app for Android and iOS.\n\n### 3\\. How to turn on Reader Mode in Chrome\n\nChrome has its own reader mode, but it\u2019s a little trickier to activate since\nits not turned on by default.\n\n  * Type chrome://flags in your URL bar\n  * Scroll down to Enable Reader Mode and set the drop down menu to Enabled\n\n  * When you see the pop up on the bottom of the screen, hit Relaunch\n  * Now you can enable reader mode from the button on the right side of the URL bar.\n\n### 4\\. How to turn on Reader Mode in Safari\n\nUnlike the other browsers on the list, Safari\u2019s reader mode is found on the\nleft side of the URL bar. On Mac, you simply hit the button, but on iOS you\u2019re\nhave to select Show reader view from the dropdown menu.\n\n## Text-Only News: Wrap-Up\n\nNow, you\u2019ve not only got a huge list of text-only news sites to choose from,\nbut you also know how to use reader mode to make other sites lighter on your\ndata too.\n\nAre there any sites that we missed?
