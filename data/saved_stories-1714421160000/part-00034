Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA\n\nX\n\n# The demise of Twitter: how a \u2018utopian vision\u2019 for social media became a\n\u2018toxic mess\u2019\n\nIn the early days it was seen as a place for \u2018genuine public discourse\u2019, but\nusers have fled since Elon Musk took over. What went wrong?\n\nKate Lyons\n\nShare\n\nIf anything is emblematic of the demise of Twitter, it is the rise and stall\nof the account of Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOprah joined the platform in 2009, tweeting for the first time live from her\nwildly popular TV show: \u201cHI TWITTERS. THANK YOU FOR A WARM WELCOME. FEELING\nREALLY 21st CENTURY.\u201d\n\nIt was \u201ca breakthrough moment\u201d for the platform, says Axel Bruns, professor in\nthe digital media research centre at Queensland University of Technology.\n\n\u201cThat really was the moment where numbers absolutely took off.\u201d\n\nThese days, Oprah still has an account on the now-renamed X, with 41.7m\nfollowers. But since November 2022, a month after Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of\nthe site was finalised, she has posted just once \u2013 in January 2023, when she\ntold Chelsea Clinton she was \u201cstill laughing out LoUD for real \ud83d\ude02\u201d over Clinton\naccidentally wearing two different black shoes to an event.\n\n  * Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nDebates about X have reignited in the last week, as the Australian government\nhas taken the platform to court in an effort to get it to remove a video of a\nSydney bishop being allegedly stabbed as he officiated a church service last\nweek.\n\nX says it has complied with orders to remove footage of the stabbing (though\nironically, the post announcing its compliance had a comment directly\nunderneath in which someone had shared the full and graphic video) and Musk\nhas been scathing about Australia\u2019s requests for the footage to be taken down.\nX has been contacted for comment.\n\nThe disinformation hurricane surrounding the Bondi stabbing marks the end of Twitter as a breaking news destination | Van Badham\n\nRead more\n\nBut as the debate has raged about what responsibility social media platforms\nhave for stopping the spread of violent or extremist content, another question\nhas emerged: what even is Twitter/X any more?\n\nWhat has become of a site that was once utterly indispensable to the news\ncycle and political debate and now is increasingly abandoned by those who once\nchecked it religiously?\n\n## The beginning: \u2018a utopian vision\u2019\n\nIn Twitter\u2019s early years, it had lofty goals, says a former employee at\nTwitter Australia, who does not wish to be named.\n\n\u201cI think back then it was definitely a utopian vision. Like so many of these\nfounders, they really saw themselves as disruptors, as creating a space for\ngenuine public discourse,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people really enjoyed it back\nthen \u2013 it was a really fast-moving, innovative platform, you could get\nbreaking news, you could follow and connect with people you really admired. It\nalways had pockets of being a toxic swamp, even early on, but it wasn\u2019t\nentirely like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had social cachet,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember when everyone was obsessed with\nhaving a blue tick ... and people who didn\u2019t have one pretended not to care?\u201d\n\nExact numbers of active monthly users are not available, but while Twitter/X\nhas never had the broad mainstream appeal of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or\nTikTok, for years it had an outsize impact on the world of news and politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very specific and limited audience,\u201d Bruns says. \u201cBut the kind of\naudience you could reach on Twitter were journalists, politicians, activists,\nexperts of various forms ... often the people who are influential in other\ncommunities both online and offline.\u201d\n\nBelinda Barnet, senior lecturer in media and communications at Swinburne\nUniversity of Technology in Melbourne, says: \u201cIt became a company that really\nmade itself absolutely central to the news cycle. In essence, it became a tool\nthat journalists in particular just couldn\u2019t afford to do without.\u201d\n\nThis was partly because the functionality of Twitter \u2013 specifically @ mentions\nand hashtags \u2013 made it so good for breaking news.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s battle over the Sydney church stabbing video is not about freedom of speech. It\u2019s to titillate his followers | Belinda Barnet\n\nRead more\n\nIn Japan, for instance, Twitter became big partly because in 2011, when the\ncountry was hit by the devastating tsunami, people were using it as a way of\ncommunicating and organising, the former Twitter employee says.\n\n\u201cIt became a real lifeline for people, it\u2019s the way people were getting\nrescued,\u201d she said.\n\nPew research from 2021 found that 69% of US Twitter users said they got news\nfrom the site, 46% said the site had increased their understanding of current\nevents and 30% said it had made them feel more politically engaged.\n\nThe breaking news functionality was not without its issues. While the\nimmediacy of the platform gave voices to dissidents and citizen journalists,\nmaking it crucial for uprisings like those seen in the Arab spring, it also\nallowed politicians to circumvent the traditional mediation of journalists,\nsays Bruns.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few politicians who essentially stopped giving interviews\nto journalists, because then they also have to expose themselves to critical\nquestions, and basically just posted their announcements on Twitter.\u201d\n\nThere have always been issues around misinformation and trolling, says Barnet,\nbut the company adopted measures to try to combat some of the worst of the\neffects, by implementing what she calls the \u201cthree pillars\u201d: blue tick\nverification of users, moderation policies and a trust and safety team.\n\n\u201cThese things all worked in concert to make it reasonably reliable during a\nbreaking news event, which is why people went there. Misinformation did go\nviral on the old Twitter, but they would often just kill the trend before it\ngot anywhere,\u201d she said.\n\n## The present: Musk\u2019s wild west\n\nAll three of these pillars were dismantled swiftly after Musk acquired the\nplatform at the end of 2022, Barnet says.\n\nThe trust and safety teams were among those fired by Musk in the wild weeks\nafter he acquired the company for US$44bn and walked into the headquarters on\nhis first day holding a ceramic sink. A video of Musk\u2019s entrance was posted to\nthe site with the caption: \u201cLet that sink in\u201d.\n\nMany of those who had been blocked from the site for breaching its online\nrules, including Donald Trump, had their accounts reinstated (though Trump\u2019s\naccount was later blocked again).\n\nThe verification process changed dramatically. Instead of people being granted\nblue ticks because they were a public figure or worked for a recognised news\nsite, ticks were now available for purchase.\n\nThe approach to moderation also changed. Musk\u2019s spat with the Australian\ngovernment reveals something about his vision for X, which he sees as a\nbastion of free speech.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very reluctant to engage in any kind of moderation,\u201d says Bruns. \u201cTo\nsome extent that represents a broader sense in the US about free speech that\nit is an absolute good above all. Whereas elsewhere in Australia and Europe\nand many other places there\u2019s much more about needing to balance the rights of\nfree speech and the right to freedom from harmful speech. And for many\notherwise quite liberal people in the US, that sounds like censorship,\nessentially.\u201d\n\nIronically, X has suspended accounts of people who have criticised Musk,\nincluding the accounts of several high-profile journalists from CNN, the New\nYork Times and the Washington Post who had been critical of him in 2022. At\nthe same time, he banned an account tracking the whereabouts of his own\npersonal jet using publicly available data.\n\n\u201cElon wants it both ways,\u201d says Barnet. \u201cHe wants it to be the original\nTwitter, which was indeed, absolutely crucial to the news cycle\u201d, but also to\n\u201ctake away the pillars, the processes that Twitter had worked out over years\nand years are what is conducive to a community that can find facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s turning into a toxic mess,\u201d says Barnet.\n\n## The future: an uncontrollable place\n\nResearch from Pew found that in the first few months after Musk\u2019s acquisition\nof Twitter, 60% of US Twitter users took a break of a few weeks or more from\nthe platform. A quarter of those surveyed said they did not see themselves\nusing the site at all within a year.\n\nEven the most prolific tweeters were using the platform less, with a 25% dip\nin the number of tweets they posted per month.\n\nWhether the trend has continued is a harder question to answer, in part\nbecause under Musk, it has become prohibitively expensive for researchers\nstudying social media to keep up their work.\n\nFor many years, Twitter made application programming interfaces (APIs)\navailable to academic researchers and private sector organisations for a\nprice. About a year ago, the cost to access these APIs skyrocketed.\n\nWhat a surprise! Free speech absolutist Elon Musk doesn\u2019t really love free\nspeech\n\nRead more\n\nAaron Smith, director of data labs at Pew, says that his centre has developed\na \u201cfairly rich body of work\u201d on Twitter over many years, but since the prices\nfor accessing tweets increased \u2013 he says the annual fee to access the API is\nnow \u201clarger than our team\u2019s entire research budget for a couple of years\u201d \u2013\nthey have not been able to do any more research about the platform.\n\nBruns says academics are in the same boat. \u201cYou just can\u2019t do any particularly\nexplorative research, looking for hate speech bots or misinformation on the\nplatform. Essentially, [X] pretty much priced themselves out of the market.\u201d\n\nHe says this is a shame, as academic research on Twitter used to enable the\nplatform to identify and clean up pockets of hate speech and misinformation,\nwhich will now go even more unchecked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly already starting to transform into something that\u2019s more\nsimilar to ... platforms like Gab or Parler, or even [Trump\u2019s] Truth Social\nwhere you\u2019ve got far, far right people furiously agreeing with each other and\nfuriously hating on everyone else.\u201d\n\nEven the former employee has since deactivated her account. \u201cI think what it\nis now is a really dangerous space, it\u2019s uncontrollable,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI miss it sometimes. I always thought it was an amazing newswire for\njournalists and citizen journalists ... I don\u2019t know, I find myself sitting\nwith breaking news and wondering where to go. There\u2019s a hole that has been\nleft behind. I\u2019m hoping someone will try and fill that gap.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * X\n  * Social media\n  * Internet\n  * Elon Musk\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
