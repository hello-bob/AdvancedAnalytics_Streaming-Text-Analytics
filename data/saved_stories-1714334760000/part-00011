With it, the web as we know it begins to\nflourish.\n\nThe web in the early 1990s was mostly text. People were posting images,\nphotos, and audio or video clips on web pages. But these pieces of\n\"multimedia\" were hidden behind links. If you wanted to look at a picture, you\nhad to click on a link, and the picture would open in a new window.\n\nA team of students at the University of Illinois' National Center for\nSupercomputing Applications, or NCSA, decided the web needed an experience\nmore stimulating and user-friendly than that, so they set to work to build a\nbetter browser. Borrowing design and user interface cues from some other early\nprototype browsers, they went through a handful of iterations before arriving\nat the final 1.0 release April 22, 1993.\n\nThe result, NCSA Mosaic, was the first web browser with the ability to display\ntext and images inline, meaning you could put pictures and text on the same\npage together, in the same window.\n\nIt was a radical step forward for the web, which was at that point, a rather\ndull experience. It took the boring \"document\" layout of your standard web\npage and transformed it into something much more visually exciting, like a\nmagazine.\n\nAnd, wow, it was easy. If you wanted to go somewhere, you just clicked. Links\nwere blue and underlined, easy to pick out. You could follow your own virtual\ntrail of breadcrumbs backwards by clicking the big button up there in the\ncorner.\n\nAt the time of its release, NCSA Mosaic was free software, but it was\navailable only on Unix. That made it common at universities and institutions,\nbut not on Windows desktops in people's homes.\n\nThe NCSA team put out Windows and Mac versions in late 1993. They were also\nreleased under a noncommercial software license, meaning people at home could\ndownload it for free. The installer was very simple, making it easy for just\nabout anyone to get up and running on the web.\n\nIt was then that the excitement really began to spread. Mosaic made the web\ncome to life with color and images, something that, for many people, finally\nprovided the online experience they were missing. It made the web a pleasure\nto use.\n\nAnd after viewing dozens of pages with photos on them, people felt compelled\nto learn how to do the same thing with their pictures. Pretty soon, everyone\nhad to have their own homepage on the web.\n\nGary Wolfe described the general euphoria in the October 1994 Wired magazine:\n\n> With Mosaic, the online world appears to be a vast, interconnected universe\n> of information. You can enter at any point and begin to wander; no internet\n> addresses or keyboard commands are necessary. The complex methods of\n> extracting information from the net are hidden from sight. Almost every\n> person who uses it feels the impulse to add some content of his or her own.\n> Since Mosaic first appeared, according to the NCSA, net traffic devoted to\n> hypermedia browsing has increased ten-thousandfold.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\n14 Last-Minute Deals From Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Spring Sale Events\n\nMatt Jancer\n\n  * Gear\n\nProtect Your Home Wi-Fi Network by Setting Up a VPN on Your Router\n\nDavid Nield\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 33 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nMarc Andreessen, the Mosaic-browser project leader, left NCSA in 1993 and\nfounded Mosaic Communications with Jim Clark, the co-founder of Silicon\nGraphics, Inc., or SGI. Under their new corporate banner, they continued to\ndevelop their browser, licensing its page-rendering technology to other\ncompanies.\n\nAndreessen and Clark renamed the company Netscape Communications in 1994 and\nreleased the flagship Netscape Navigator browser. The newer, more powerful\nbrowser soon grew to dominate the fledgling web, quickly surpassing Mosaic. It\ndrew accolades from almost everyone \u2013 except those anxious to kill it.\n\nNetscape enjoyed a short reign as king of the hill before ceding the browser\nthrone to Internet Explorer. The downtrodden Netscape was reborn as Mozilla,\nbut it failed to take off. The Mosaic-Netscape-Mozilla browser eventually\nfound new life as Firefox, released a decade after the first Mosaic browser.\n\nSource: Various\n\nImage: National Center for Supercomputing Applications\n\nSee Also:\n\n  * April 22, 1915: A Fearful Word in the Trenches: 'Gas!'\n  * April 22, 1970: Tell Your Mother You Love Her\n  * June 24, 1993: Concert Goes Live on Net\n  * July 9, 1993: Yes, They're the Romanovs, DNA Tests Confirm\n  * Aug. 21, 1993: Mars Probe Disappears, Never To Be Found\n  * Sept. 2, 1993: U.S., Russia Ink Space Pact\n  * Sept. 24, 1993: Beautiful 'Myst' Ushers In Era of CD-ROM Gaming\n  * Nov. 3, 1993: Theremin Fades Out\n  * Dec. 8, 1993: Location, Location, Location\n\nMichael Calore oversees WIRED's consumer products coverage in print and on the\nweb, and is one of the hosts of WIRED's weekly podcast, Gadget Lab.
