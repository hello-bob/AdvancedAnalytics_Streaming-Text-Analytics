Now, thanks to an apparent dispute within the\nransomware criminal ecosystem, it may have just become far messier still.\n\nIn March, the ransomware group AlphV, which had claimed credit for encrypting\nChange Healthcare\u2019s network and threatened to leak reams of the company\u2019s\nsensitive health care data, received a $22 million payment\u2014evidence, publicly\ncaptured on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, that Change Healthcare had very likely caved\nto its tormentors\u2019 ransom demand, though the company has yet to confirm that\nit paid. But in a new definition of a worst-case ransomware, a different\nransomware group claims to be holding Change Healthcare\u2019s stolen data and is\ndemanding a payment of their own.\n\nSince Monday, RansomHub, a relatively new ransomware group, has posted to its\ndark-web site that it has 4 terabytes of Change Healthcare\u2019s stolen data,\nwhich it threatened to sell to the \u201chighest bidder\u201d if Change Healthcare\ndidn\u2019t pay an unspecified ransom. RansomHub tells WIRED it is not affiliated\nwith AlphV and \u201ccan\u2019t say\u201d how much it\u2019s demanding as a ransom payment.\n\nRansomHub initially declined to publish or provide WIRED any sample data from\nthat stolen trove to prove its claim. But on Friday, a representative for the\ngroup sent WIRED several screenshots of what appeared to be patient records\nand a data-sharing contract for United Healthcare, which owns Change\nHealthcare, and Emdeon, which acquired Change Healthcare in 2014 and later\ntook its name.\n\nWhile WIRED could not fully confirm RansomHub\u2019s claims, the samples suggest\nthat this second extortion attempt against Change Healthcare may be more than\nan empty threat. \u201cFor anyone doubting that we have the data, and to anyone\nspeculating the criticality and the sensitivity of the data, the images should\nbe enough to show the magnitude and importance of the situation and clear the\nunrealistic and childish theories,\u201d the RansomHub contact tells WIRED in an\nemail.\n\n\u201cWe are working with law enforcement and outside experts to investigate claims\nposted online to understand the extent of potentially impacted data,\u201d Change\nHealthcare said in an email to WIRED. \u201cOur investigation remains active and\nongoing. There is no evidence of any new cyber incident at Change Healthcare.\u201d\n\nBrett Callow, a ransomware analyst with security firm Emsisoft, says he\nbelieves AlphV did not originally publish any data from the incident, and the\norigin of RansomHub\u2019s data is unclear. \u201cI obviously don't know whether the\ndata is real\u2014it could have been pulled from elsewhere\u2014but nor do I see\nanything that indicates it may not be authentic,\u201d he says of the data shared\nby RansomHub.\n\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at threat intelligence firm Analyst1,\nsays he believes RansomHub is \u201ctelling the truth and does have Change\nHealthCare\u2019s data,\u201d after reviewing the information sent to WIRED. While\nRansomHub is a new ransomware threat actor, DiMaggio says, they are quickly\n\u201cgaining momentum.\u201d\n\nIf RansomHub\u2019s claims are real, it will mean that Change Healthcare\u2019s already\ncatastrophic ransomware ordeal has become a kind of cautionary tale about the\ndangers of trusting ransomware groups to follow through on their promises,\neven after a ransom is paid. In March, someone who goes by the name \u201cnotchy\u201d\nposted to a Russian cybercriminal forum that AlphV had pocketed that $22\nmillion payment and disappeared without sharing a commission with the\n\u201caffiliate\u201d hackers who typically partner with ransomware groups and often\npenetrate victims\u2019 networks on their behalf.\n\nNotchy\u2019s post suggested that Change Healthcare faced an unprecedented\nsituation: It had allegedly already paid a ransom, yet jilted partners of the\ngang extorting it still felt they were owed money\u2014and still possessed Change\nHealthcare\u2019s stolen data. RansomHub tells WIRED it is associated with notchy.\n\nNow, RansomHub has claimed \u201cthe data remains with the affiliate,\u201d and AlphV\ndid not directly have the data originally. WIRED could not verify these\nclaims. \u201cFor everyone speculating and theorizing on the situation, AlphV stole\nour share of the payment and performed an exit scam,\u201d a RansomHub\nrepresentative wrote to WIRED. \u201cAlphV performed the exit scam before we get to\nthe data deletion part.\u201d\n\nCallow says the incident reinforces that cybercriminals can\u2019t be trusted to\ndelete data, even when they are paid. For example, when a global law\nenforcement operation disrupted the notorious LockBit ransomware group, in\nFebruary, police said they discovered that the cybercriminals still had data\nthat investigators had paid to be deleted.\n\n\u201cSometimes they use the undeleted data to extort victims for a second time,\nand the risk of re-extortion will only increase as law enforcement up their\ndisruption efforts and throw the ransomware ecosystem into chaos,\u201d Callow\nsays. \u201cWhat were always unpredictable outcomes will now be even more\nunpredictable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, DiMaggio says victims of ransomware attacks need to learn they\ncan\u2019t trust cybercriminals. \u201cVictims need to understand that paying a criminal\nwho promises to delete their data permanently is a myth,\u201d DiMaggio says. \u201cThey\nare paying to have their data taken off the public side of the ransomware\nattackers data leak site. They should assume it is never actually deleted.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s website says it is continuing to \u201cmake progress in\nmitigating the impact\u201d of the attack and expanding financial assistance to\nhealth care providers that have been impacted. However, the attack has sent\nlong-lasting ripples across medical facilities in the United States,\ndemonstrating how disruptive ransomware attacks can be and the difficulties in\nrestoring services. Clinicians and patients alike have been impacted, with\nextra strain being placed upon medical business owners.\n\nOn Wednesday, the American Medical Association said \u201cserious disruptions\ncontinue\u201d across physician practices. A survey of AMA members, conducted\nbetween March 26 and April 3, found 80 percent of clinicians had lost revenue\nand many are using their own personal finances to cover a practice\u2019s expenses.\nMedical practitioners responding to the survey said they were heading toward\nbankruptcy, were struggling to \u201cmanage pain care\u201d for cancer patients, and\nthat procedures had been delayed. \u201cPractices will close because of this\nincident,\u201d Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, the president of the AMA said in a statement,\n\u201cand patients will lose access to their physicians.\u201d\n\nIn a message to WIRED, the RansomHub contact claims\u2014for whatever the word of a\nransomware gang is worth\u2014that they are different from other cybercriminals,\nand if Change Healthcare pays them, they wouldn\u2019t try to extort it again. \u201cWe\nwill delete the data,\u201d they write. \u201cThis data is a bomb for us. If we can't\nget payment, we have no choice but to sell it. Of course, if we can reach an\nagreement, it will be better to delete the data and throw the bomb away.\u201d\n\nUpdated 4/12/2024, 9:18 pm ET: Added comment from Change Healthcare.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
