This channel is mostly gonna be about\nhistorical problems physicists had to solve to progress but also about some\ncurrently discussed topics in modern physics, demystifying certain problems in\nphysics that might be counterintuitive for most people so sit down take your\npopcorn and enjoy my content :) You can also support me on Patreon\npatreon.com/user?u=85062254 :)\n\nWhat We REALLY See at Particle Detectors\n\n17:42\n\nShare\n\nAn error occurred while retrieving sharing information.
