When the Automatons mysteriously\nreturned to menace the galaxy, tacticians would take to X and Discord to\nencourage fans to hit the right planets. Super Earth asked Helldivers to kill\ntwo billion bugs, and the player base pulled it off within hours. But the\nbiggest coordinated effort that players have pulled off is not against the\nbugs or bots, but against the game\u2019s publisher, Sony \u2014 and after a weekend of\nprotest, the Helldivers scored a massive triumph.\n\nOn Friday, Sony announced that Helldivers 2 players would need to link their\nin-game accounts to their Sony accounts, requiring a log-in to an additional\nplatform. It was a tremendously unpopular change, and Steam players were vocal\nabout their displeasure. While some players were simply annoyed at an extra\nstep of red tape, or fearful of storing their information on Sony\u2019s servers\nafter previous data leaks, others were locked out entirely. The PlayStation\nNetwork is not accessible in 177 countries and territories, and so players\nfrom regions like the Philippines completely lost access to a game they had\nalready paid for.\n\nHelldivers 2 players immediately moved into action, coordinating on platforms\nlike Reddit, X, and Discord to make their displeasure clear. Helldivers 2 was\nhit with hundreds of thousands of negative Steam reviews, turning its very\npositive ranking upside down. Players made memes and propaganda posters,\nrallying under the slogan \u201cWe dive together, or we don\u2019t dive.\u201d Community\nmembers found that Steam would issue refunds, even for accounts that had gone\nwell beyond the two hours, and encouraged fellow fans to refund en masse. Not\neven the first Helldivers was off limits, as the circa 2015 title was likewise\nruthlessly review-bombed.\n\nThe infrastructure for this sort of effort had already been established\nthrough Helldivers 2\u2019s Major Orders, which typically last around a week, and\nask the players to achieve an objective. That can be something like holding a\ndefensive line, conquering a series of planets, or setting up infrastructure.\nDedicated players will call out priorities on social media to less focused\nfans, encouraging everyone to dogpile on a single planet in order to advance\nthe Major Order, or calling people back from an unwinnable front.\n\nAs one staffer at Arrowhead Game Studios put it, \u201cI do have to give it to the\ncommunity, ya\u2019ll fuckers are good at working together for a major common\ngoal.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Sony caved on Sunday night, announcing that the game would no\nlonger require account linking. Fans, in turn, have started to remove some of\nthe damage their initial protest caused \u2014 and they\u2019re using Helldivers 2\u2019s\nkayfabe in order to make these requests. The Helldivers subreddit has a pinned\npost, marked as a Major Order, which reads:\n\n> \u201cSony has reversed their decision to move forward with the account linking\n> update. Helldivers; should you choose to accept this major order. Please\n> consider reversing your steam review. Arrowhead has worked very hard to make\n> this game special, and you the player have shown both Sony and Arrowhead\n> that your voice matters too. Let us restore Helldivers 2 on steam back to\n> it\u2019s formal [sic] glory. And let us restore this community back to normal.\n> Please reverse any negative reviews you left for any other games that\n> Arrowhead or Sony has worked on. Lets [sic] do better as a community and not\n> do that again.\u201d\n\nThe Helldivers 2 fanbase are enjoying their victory, with one fan even\ncreating physical merch of Helldiver-themed patches celebrating success\nagainst Sony. Arrowhead has created a game that requires its player base to\ncommunicate, work together, and juggle priorities. This latest snafu with Sony\nshows that fans have learned this lesson well, and they\u2019re able to take those\nskills outside of the war table and apply it to the real world. While many\nfans encouraged protestors to focus on Sony, and leave Arrowhead out of the\ncrossfire, others were less discriminating with their anger. It remains to be\nseen whether this trend ends up being a force for positive change, or whether\nthis motivated fanbase will continue to crusade over regular hiccups that tend\nto occur in any live service game. For now, most players seem content with\nthis massive triumph over Sony \u2014 and proud of the community that scored such a\nbig win.\n\n### The next level of puzzles.\n\nTake a break from your day by playing a puzzle or two!
