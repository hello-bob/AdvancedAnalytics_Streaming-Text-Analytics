By time spent, swimming is easily my top hobby though I\u2019m\nunclear if exercising can really be a hobby. It\u2019s just a little too required\nfor my mental and physical health to be considered 100% \u201chobby\u201d.\n\nThe first week of sabbatical was tough. I have an injured ankle so I can\u2019t\nswim, I can\u2019t work, the kids are off school so... what do I do with myself?\n\nI guess this is hobby time?\n\nMy other hobbies are keeping tropical fish in planted aquariums (currently a\n200L and 120L tank), and painting Warhammer 40k Orks. Occasionally I weave\nitems from paracord, build things from wood (like a patio I built 2 years\nago), and in the past I\u2019ve done a lot of landscape photography. I\u2019ve also\ntinkered with electronics and have been known to occasionally write code for\nfun.\n\n## What is a hobby?\n\nThe main things that tie all these hobbies together are that they are skill-\nbased but don\u2019t have any monetary compensation (in fact, they normally have a\nsubstantial outlay). They offer a chance to ride that skills ramp up to an\nexpert-level of competence, driven only by our own desire to do so.\n\nKeeping tropical fish has a relatively easy route to getting started: buy a\ntank, filter, heater etc, fill it up, and throw the fish in. Within days (or\nprobably hours) you are getting a crash course in the nitrogen cycle,\nbacteria, fish anatomy, water chemistry, weird diseases like dropsy, and so\non. This knowledge gets deeper and deeper over the years of intense debugging\ntrying to work out why this small 1\u201d fish has a spinal deformity, that fish\nlooks a bit fat (pregnant or sick?), that fish is aggressive to the other\nfish, and wait-a-second-didn\u2019t-I-buy-10-panda-corydoras? Why is the aquarium\nsuddenly filled with green algae? How do I stop the black beard algae from\ngrowing? The patient can\u2019t talk or communicate and you can\u2019t physically see\nany of the factors at play. It\u2019s nuts. This level of work is the same as\ndebugging multi-threaded race conditions, which pays tens or hundreds of\nthousands of euro a year, but I do it for free for no apparent reason.\n\nAaron Patterson kicked off his RailsConf keynote this year with an anecdote\nabout his mushroom-hunting hobby. After he saw some mushrooms in a shop and\ndecided they were too expensive, he embarked on a quest to gain the knowledge\nand find them in the wild for \u201cfree\u201d\u2014though it took several months, driving\nhundreds of miles, and becoming a licensed mycologist. Clearly, from our\nperspective, this was a costly decision that doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense.\n\nAnd that, dear reader, is what a hobby is.\n\nA friend is making tiny miniature flowers for her tiny model flower shop. My\nwife knits and crochets. Another friend brews beer. At Brighton Ruby last week\neven more hobbies were on display: Joe Hart built a \u201cuseless API\u201d of pride\nflags (his words), and Paul Battley recreated the same Ruby script on versions\ngoing back 20 years, which involved patching 20 year old ruby versions and\nwriting his own JSON parser.\n\nAll very very skilled work that, from an outside perspective, appears to have\nabsolutely no apparent value.\n\n## So, why?\n\nI was sitting down to paint yet another Ork during my first week of sabbatical\nand I hesitated: why am I doing this? What\u2019s the point? When I\u2019m dead, will\nanyone remember these little miniatures? Will I remember and cherish the hours\nI spend here?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is time I don\u2019t have to optimise\u2014and I shouldn\u2019t be\ntrying to. At work I\u2019m always optimising for how to ship projects faster, how\nto maximise our small team, how to make the best use of my own day, how to\nsolve this problem in the best way for the team / company / product etc. When\npainting Orks, I can just live in the moment and get lost in the flow of\npainting.\n\nI keep fish because I enjoy it and I can\u2019t even really explain why! They are\neven more emotionally distant than cats, and much harder to keep, but I like\nwatching them, I enjoy the creative challenge of aquascaping, and I appreciate\nthe beauty of seeing the aquariums in the house. I even went to Georgia\nAquarium in Atlanta and made a beeline\u2014past the giant shark tanks\u2014 to the\ninconspicuous tank containing Rummy-nosed tetras, Serpae tetra, Otos,\nCorydoras, and Angelfish. These were my friends from home!\n\nAnd so it is with all the other hobbies. There really is no rational reason\nfor spending hundreds of euros on Warhammer figures, then spending hundreds of\nhours painting them, to a dubious artistic standard, and then not even using\nthem to play the Warhammer 40K game!\n\nI can buy paracord keyrings on Etsy, or order a catio from a local supplier,\nor purchase a professional print of any landscape vista in the world for a\nfraction of the cost of a camera. Hell, these days an AI can vomit up a\npicture of any landscape, mood, and lighting I can imagine. My wife spends\nmultiples on the wool she uses for knitting & crochet than it would cost her\nto just buy an equivalent garment. None of this makes logical sense to an\noutsider!\n\nWe do it for the internal, intrinsic motivation. We do it for the joy. For the\nfeeling of accomplishment, without the external pressure of having an\nobligation to anyone else. It\u2019s work, often hard and frustrating work, and\nit\u2019s highly skilled, but we also have complete freedom to tackle it in our\nway, at our own pace, and learn along the way. That freedom from commitments\nis what divides hobbies and work.\n\n## Not hobbies\n\nSome things look like hobbies, or we pretend they fill the same gap, but they\nreally aren\u2019t.\n\nI also have two cats and two kids. Both take up some time and energy but they\ndon\u2019t really fulfil my need for skilled work so they definitely aren\u2019t in the\n\u201chobby\u201d category.\n\nWe moved into a new home six months ago and gardening was definitely a hobby\nfor the previous owner. It is not, unfortunately, one of my hobbies so the\nmaintenance and upkeep of the garden is a chore not a hobby. I just don\u2019t have\nthat intrinsic motivation for weeding the beds, dead-heading the flowers, or\nlearning what each of the plants are. I will be replacing the irrigation\nsystem in the polytunnel though and that begins to tickle that maker-itch in\nme.\n\n\u201cWork\u201d is usually a little easier to identify but we have a temptation to\noptimise our hobbies and make them valuable to other people. After all, when\nyou are incredibly skilled at your hobby and this skill could be valuable, why\nshouldn\u2019t you earn money from it? This is how a hobby turns into work.\n\nThat open source library you hack on for fun is a hobby but it becomes work as\nsoon as it becomes popular and people start reporting bugs and creating PRs\nfor improvements. Or when you decide to turn that little app you built for fun\ninto a side-business. Congratulations, you\u2019ve just replaced a hobby with more\nwork.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s great because it\u2019s work that you enjoy but what hobby will\nreplace it? What \u201cuseless\u201d activity will you dedicate time to purely for your\nown enjoyment?\n\nI think the main revelation I\u2019m arriving at is that my life has been too\noptimised for work, with the remaining time dedicated to the necessary chores\nof being a human / dad / husband / parent / cat owner / home owner / manager\netc. Exercising, which for me is swimming, is hard to categorise because I do\nenjoy it for myself (strongly in hobby-land) but it\u2019s also kind of a necessity\n(drifting into chore-territory). Some days it\u2019s a hobby, some days it\u2019s a\nchore.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nI need to set aside time for activities with no apparent value, solely for my\nown enjoyment.
