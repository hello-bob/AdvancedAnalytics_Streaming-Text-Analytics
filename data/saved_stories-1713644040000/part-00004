AgentKit offers a unified framework for explicitly\n> constructing a complex \"thought process\" from simple natural language\n> prompts. The basic building block in AgentKit is a node, containing a\n> natural language prompt for a specific subtask. The user then puts together\n> chains of nodes, like stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be\n> designed to explicitly enforce a naturally structured \"thought process\". For\n> example, for the task of writing a paper, one may start with the thought\n> process of 1) identify a core message, 2) identify prior research gaps, etc.\n> The nodes in AgentKit can be designed and combined in different ways to\n> implement multiple advanced capabilities including on-the-fly hierarchical\n> planning, reflection, and learning from interactions. In addition, due to\n> the modular nature and the intuitive design to simulate explicit human\n> thought process, a basic agent could be implemented as simple as a list of\n> prompts for the subtasks and therefore could be designed and tuned by\n> someone without any programming experience. Quantitatively, we show that\n> agents designed through AgentKit achieve SOTA performance on WebShop and\n> Crafter. These advances underscore AgentKit's potential in making LLM agents\n> effective and accessible for a wider range of applications. this https URL\n\nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.11483 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.11483v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11483arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yue Wu [view email] [v1] Wed, 17 Apr 2024 15:40:45 UTC (4,048 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled AgentKit: Flow Engineering with Graphs, not\nCoding, by Yue Wu and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
