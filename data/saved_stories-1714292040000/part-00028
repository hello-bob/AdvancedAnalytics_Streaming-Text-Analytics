It does not cover the \u201ctelecommunications\ninfrastructure\u201d bit of the Act.\n\nThis is probably the first in a series of blogposts on this theme.\n\nPart 2 covers the different actors and their responsibilities: manufacturers,\nimporters, and distributors.\n\nPart 3 covers the security requirements themselves, and the rules about\nstatements of compliance.\n\nThis regime comes into effect on 29 April 2024.\n\n# In summary\n\nIf you make, import, or distribute to people in the UK pretty much any\nInternet-connected or connectable product or IoT product (see below for proper\ndefinitions), you will soon have new duties depending on your role, including:\n\n  * a duty to comply with security requirements\n  * requirements around statements of compliance\n  * a duty to investigate potential compliance failures\n  * duties to take action in relation to compliance failure\n  * a duty to maintain records\n  * a duty not to supply products where compliance failure by manufacturer\n\nIf you don\u2019t meet your duties, you could be served with:\n\n  * a compliance notice (telling you to comply)\n  * a stop notice (telling you to stop an activity in respect of which you are not complying with your duties)\n  * a recall notice (forcing you to make arrangements for the return of affected products)\n  * a monetary penalty notice (with a maximum fine of the greater of \u00a310 million / 4% of qualifying worldwide revenue for the last complete accounting period).\n\nYou might also be compelled to forfeit the affected products.\n\n# What products are in scope\n\nWorking out what products are in scope - ss5 and 6 - is a bit convoluted.\n\nThe government\u2019s guidance says that it includes:\n\n> A non-exhaustive list of examples includes:\n>\n> \u25cf Connected children\u2019s toys and baby monitors\n>\n> \u25cf Connected safety-relevant products such as smoke detectors and door locks\n>\n> \u25cf Smart cameras, TVs and speakers\n>\n> \u25cf Wearable health trackers\n>\n> \u25cf Connected home automation and alarm systems\n>\n> \u25cf Connected appliances (e.g. washing machines, fridges)\n>\n> \u25cf Smart home assistants\n\nTo fall within scope, a product must be either an \u201cinternet-connectable\nproduct\u201d or a \u201cnetwork-connectable product\u201d, and must not be an \u201cexcepted\nproduct\u201d.\n\nWhether a device is an \u201cinternet-connectable product\u201d or a \u201cnetwork-\nconnectable product\u201d does not really matter: if it is either of these things,\nit is in scope.\n\nThis is potentially relevant given challenges (below) in determining if\nsomething is an \u201cinternet-connectable product\u201d or not.\n\n## What is a \u201cproduct\u201d?\n\nNeither the Act nor the Regulations specify what is a \u201cproduct\u201d.\n\nThis is likely to be pertinent for \u201cmakers\u201d, and people who sell components,\nor partially-made systems, which require additional work before they will\nfunction. Have they sold a \u201cproduct\u201d?\n\n## Excepted products\n\nSome products, which would otherwise be in scope, are deemed not to be in\nscope.\n\nSchedule 3 to the Regulations sets out what these are.\n\nCurrently, they are:\n\n  * Products made available to be supplied in Northern Ireland\n  * Charge points for electric vehicles\n  * Medical devices\n  * Smart meter products (of the kind supplied/installed by a licence holder under either the Gas Act 1986 or the Electricity Act 1989, rather than (for example) smart plugs which can monitor energy usage)\n  * Computers, comprising \u201cdesktop computers\u201d, \u201claptop computers\u201d, or \u201ctablets which do not have the capability to connect to cellular networks\u201d, unless \u201caccording to the manufacturer\u2019s intended purpose, [they] are designed exclusively for children under 14 years old\u201d, in which case they are not excepted.\n\nSo a laptop is out of scope, but a single board computer (like a Raspberry Pi)\nor a rackmount server seemingly is in scope, since neither is a laptop\ncomputer or a desktop computer.\n\nI don\u2019t know if something like my GPD Pocket - a tiny notebook computer -\nwould be in scope or not.\n\nI am not sure if this is intentional or not...\n\n## Internet-connectable products\n\nA product is in-scope if it is an \u201cInternet-connectable product\u201d.\n\nThis means \u201ca product that is capable of connecting to the internet\u201d.\n\nAnd:\n\n> connecting to the internet is a reference to using a communication protocol\n> that forms part of the Internet Protocol suite to send and receive data over\n> the internet.\n\nThe definitions do not talk about the directness of that connection. Does it\ncover just modems or gateways? Or does it cover more than that - as in,\nanything which can connect to a Wi-Fi network, and so onwards to the Internet?\n\nFor example, a router?\n\n(And if a router is an \u201cInternet-connectable product\u201d, what happens if you\nbuild the router out of a desktop computer (an excepted product)? Then you\nprobably have an argument as to whether the product is still a desktop\ncomputer functioning as a router, or it is a router and so no longer a desktop\ncomputer...)\n\nWhat about a single board computer with an Ethernet chipset supplied without\nan operating system? Leaving aside the question of whether it is an excepted\nproduct, without an operating system, the SBC cannot connect to the internet.\n\nBut the test is whether it is \u201ccapable of connecting to the internet\u201d, and it\nis, but only if someone takes the extra steps to make it so. This entails more\nthan just plugging it in: it requires someone to install an operating system.\n\n## Network-connectable products\n\nA product is in-scope if it is a \u201cnetwork-connectable product\u201d.\n\nThis means a product that:\n\n> (a) is capable of both sending and receiving data by means of a transmission\n> involving electrical or electromagnetic energy,\n>\n> (b) is not an internet-connectable product, and\n>\n> (c) meets the first connectability condition or the second connectability\n> condition.\n\nA product meets the first connectability condition if it is:\n\n> capable of connecting directly [disregarding any wire or cable] to an\n> internet-connectable product by means of a communication protocol that forms\n> part of the Internet Protocol suite.\n\nI think this would cover an Ethernet-enabled camera or printer, as well as a\nWi-Fi-enabled plug, camera or dishwasher.\n\nWhat about a wireless access point itself? Does it connect directly to an\ninternet-connectable product if it connects to a PoE switch? Perhaps it is\nsufficient if the WAP could also be powered directly, and cabled into a\nrouter, since it is is \u201ccapable of connecting directly\u201d to an internet-\nconnectable product.\n\nA product meets the second connectability condition if it is:\n\n> capable of connecting directly to two or more products at the same time by\n> means of a communication protocol that does not form part of the Internet\n> Protocol suite, and\n>\n> it is capable of connecting directly to an internet-connectable product by\n> means of such a communication protocol (whether or not at the same time as\n> it connects to any other product).\n\nI think that this would cover something like a ZigBee hub.\n\nI don\u2019t find these definitions particularly helpful or intuitive, I must\nadmit.\n\n# Future blogposts\n\nIn (unspecific) future blogposts, I\u2019ll look at the different types of actor,\nand the different obligations that are imposed.\n\nAll posts CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 or any later version, unless otherwise stated.
