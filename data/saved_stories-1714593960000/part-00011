They also concern\nthe non-availability of an effective third-party real-time civic discourse and\nelection-monitoring tool ahead of the elections to the European Parliament,\nagainst the background of Meta's deprecation of its real-time public insights\ntool CrowdTangle without an adequate replacement.\n\nAfter the formal opening of proceedings, the Commission will continue to\ngather evidence, for example by sending additional requests for information,\nconducting interviews or inspections.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said:\n\n> This Commission has created means to protect European citizens from targeted\n> disinformation and manipulation by third countries. If we suspect a\n> violation of the rules, we act. This is true at all times, but especially in\n> times of democratic elections. Big digital platforms must live up to their\n> obligations to put enough resources into this and today's decision shows\n> that we are serious about compliance. Protecting our democracies is a common\n> fight with our Member States. Today in Prague I want to thank Prime Minister\n> Fiala for his active role in raising the issue at European level, along with\n> the triggering by Belgium of the emergency mechanism for exchange of\n> information between Member States.\n\nRead the full press release and learn more about the supervision of the\ndesignated VLOPs and VLOSEs under DSA\n\n### Related topics\n\nOnline platforms and e-commerce Digital Services Act Package\n\n#### Last update\n\n30 April 2024\n\nPrint as PDF\n\n## Shaping Europe\u2019s digital future\n\nThis site is managed by: Directorate-General for Communications Networks,\nContent and Technology\n\n  * Accessibility\n\n## Contact us\n\n  * Contact DG CONNECT\n\n## Follow us\n\n  * Digital EU on Facebook\n  * Digital EU on Instagram\n  * Digital EU on LinkedIn\n  * Digital EU on Youtube\n  * @DigitalEU on Twitter\n\n## About us\n\n  * Privacy statement\n  * Copyright notice\n  * About Directorate-General CONNECT\n  * Language Policy\n\n  * Contact the European Commission\n  * Follow the European Commission on social media\n  * Resources for partners\n\n  * Language policy\n  * Cookies\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Legal notice\n\n", "frontpage": false}
