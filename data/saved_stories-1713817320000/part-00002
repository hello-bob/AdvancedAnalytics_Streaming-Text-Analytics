Perry\n\n20 Apr 2024\n\n13 min read\n\nVertical\n\nPeter Adams\n\nBlue\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Robert Kahn began thinking about how computers with\ndifferent operating systems could talk to each other across a network. He\ndidn\u2019t think much about what they would say to one another, though. He was a\ntheoretical guy, on leave from the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology for a stint at the nearby research-and-development company Bolt,\nBeranek and Newman (BBN). He simply found the problem interesting.\n\n\u201cThe advice I was given was that it would be a bad thing to work on. They\nwould say it wasn\u2019t going to lead to anything,\u201d Kahn recalls. \u201cBut I was a\nlittle headstrong at the time, and I just wanted to work on it.\u201d\n\n### Robert E.

And he is still\ninvolved in networking research today.\n\nIt is for this work on packet communication technologies\u2014as part of the\nproject that became the ARPANET and in the foundations of the Internet\u2014that\nKahn is being awarded the 2024 IEEE Medal of Honor.\n\n## The ARPANET Is Born\n\nKahn wasn\u2019t the only one thinking about connecting disparate computers in the\n1960s. In 1965, Larry Roberts, then at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, connected\none computer in Massachusetts to another in California over a telephone line.\nBob Taylor, then at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), got\ninterested in connecting computers, in part to save the organization money by\ngetting the expensive computers it funded at universities and research\norganizations to share their resources over a packet-switched network. This\nmethod of communications involves cutting up data files into blocks and\nreassembling them at their destination. It allows each fragment to take a\nvariety of paths across a network and helps mitigate any loss of data, because\nindividual packets can easily be resent.\n\nTaylor\u2019s project\u2014the ARPANET\u2014would be far more than theoretical. It would\nultimately produce the world\u2019s first operational packet network linking\ndistributed interactive computers.\n\nMeanwhile, over at BBN, Kahn intended to spend a couple of years in industry\nso he could return to academia with some real-world experience and ideas for\nfuture research.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hired to do anything in particular,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cThey were just\naccumulating people who they thought could contribute. But I had come from the\nconceptual side of the world. The people at BBN viewed me as other.\u201d\n\nKahn didn\u2019t know much about computers at the time\u2014his Ph.D. thesis involved\nsignal processing. But he did know something about communication networks.\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from City College\nof New York in 1960, Kahn had joined Bell Telephone Laboratories, working at\nits headquarters in Manhattan, where he helped to analyze the overall\narchitecture and performance of the Bell telephone system. That involved\nconceptualizing what the network needed to do, developing overall plans, and\nhandling the mathematical calculations related to the architecture as\nimplemented, Kahn recalls.\n\n\u201cWe would figure out things like: Do we need more lines between Denver and\nChicago?\u201d he says.\n\nKahn stayed at Bell Labs for about nine months; to his surprise, a graduate\nfellowship came through that he decided to accept. He was off to Princeton\nUniversity in the autumn of 1961, returning to Bell Labs for the next few\nsummers.\n\nSo, when Kahn was at BBN a few years later, he knew enough to realize that you\nwouldn\u2019t want to use the telephone network as the basis of a computer network:\nDial-up connections took 10 or 20 seconds to go through, the bandwidth was\nlow, the error rate was high, and you could connect to only one machine at a\ntime.\n\nOther than generally thinking that it would be nice if computers could talk to\none another, Kahn didn\u2019t give much thought to applications.\n\n\u201cIf you were engineering the Bell System,\u201d he says, \u201cyou weren\u2019t trying to\nfigure out who in San Francisco is going to say what to whom in New York. You\nwere just trying to figure out how to enable conversations.\u201d\n\nBob Kahn graduated from high school in 1955.Bob Kahn\n\nKahn wrote a series of reports laying out how he thought a network of\ncomputers could be implemented. They landed on the desk of Jerry Elkind, a BBN\nvice president who later joined Xerox PARC. And Elkind told Kahn about ARPA\u2019s\ninterest in computer networking.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what ARPA was, other than I had seen the name,\u201d Kahn\nsays. Elkind told him to send his reports to Larry Roberts, the recently hired\nprogram manager for ARPA\u2019s networking project.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I know,\u201d Kahn says, \u201cthere\u2019s an RFQ [request for quotation]\nfrom ARPA for building a four-node net.\u201d Kahn, still the consummate academic,\nhadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d have to do much beyond putting his thoughts down on paper.\n\u201cIt never dawned on me that I\u2019d actually get involved in building it,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nKahn handled the technical portion of BBN\u2019s proposal, and ARPA awarded BBN the\nfour-node-network contract in January of 1969. The nodes rolled out later that\nyear: at UCLA in September; the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in October;\nthe University of California, Santa Barbara, in November; and the University\nof Utah in December.\n\nKahn postponed his planned return to MIT and continued to work on expanding\nthis network. In October 1972, the ARPANET was publicly unveiled at the first\nmeeting of the International Conference on Computer Communications, in\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI was pretty sure it would work,\u201d Kahn says, \u201cbut it was a big event. There\nwere 30 or 40 nodes on the ARPANET at the time. We put 40 different kinds of\nterminals in the [Washington Hilton] ballroom, and people could walk around\nand try this terminal, that terminal, which might connect to MIT, and so\nforth. You could use Doug Engelbart\u2019s NLS [oN-Line System] at SRI and\nmanipulate a document, or you could go onto a BBN computer that demonstrated\nair-traffic control, showing an airplane leaving one airport, which happened\nto be on a computer in one place, and landing at another airport, which\nhappened to be on a computer in another place.\u201d\n\nThe demos, he recalled, ran 24 hours a day for nearly a week. The reaction, he\nsays, \u201cwas \u2018Oh my God, this is amazing\u2019 for everybody, even people who worried\nabout how it would affect their businesses.\u201d\n\n## Goodbye BBN, Hello DARPA\n\nKahn officially left BBN the day after the demo concluded to join DARPA (the\nagency having recently added the word \u201cDefense\u201d to its name). He felt he\u2019d\ndone what he could on networking and was ready for a new challenge.\n\n\u201cThey hired me to run a hundred-million-dollar program on automated\nmanufacturing. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, to get on the factory\nfloor, to figure out how to distribute processing, distribute artificial\nintelligence, use distributed sensors.\u201d\n\nBob Kahn served on the MIT faculty from 1964 to 1966.Bob Kahn\n\nSoon after he arrived at DARPA, Congress pulled the plug on funding for the\nproposed automated-manufacturing effort. Kahn shrugged his shoulders and\nfigured he\u2019d go back to MIT. But Roberts asked Kahn to stay. Kahn did, but\nrather than work on ARPANET he focused on developing packet radio, packet\nsatellite, and even, he says, packetizing voice, a technology that led to VoIP\n(Voice over Internet Protocol) today.\n\nGetting those new networks up and running wasn\u2019t always easy. Irwin Jacobs,\nwho had just cofounded Linkabit and later cofounded Qualcomm, worked on the\nproject. He recalls traveling through Europe with Kahn, trying to convince\norganizations to become part of the network.\n\n\u201cWe visited three PTTs [postal, telegraph, and telephone services],\u201d Jacobs\nsaid, \u201cin Germany, in France, and in the U.K. The reactions were all the same.\nThey were very friendly, they gave us the morning to explain packet switching\nand what we were thinking of doing, then they would serve us lunch and throw\nus out.\u201d But the two of them kept at it.\n\n\u201cWe took a little hike one day,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cThere was a steep trail that\nwent up the side of a fjord, water coming down the opposite side. We came\nacross an old man, casting a line into the stream rushing downhill. He said he\nwas fishing for salmon, and we laughed\u2014what were his chances? But as we walked\nuphill, he yanked on his rod and pulled out a salmon.\u201d The Americans were\nimpressed with his determination.\n\n\u201cYou have to have confidence in what you are trying to do,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cBob\nhad that. He was able to take rejection and keep persisting.\u201d\n\nUltimately, a government laboratory in Norway, the Norwegian Defence Research\nEstablishment, and a laboratory at University College London came on\nboard\u2014enough to get the satellite network up and running.\n\n## And Then Came the Internet\n\nWith the ARPANET, packet-radio, and packet-satellite networks all operational,\nit was clear to Kahn that the next step would be to connect them. He knew that\nthe ARPANET design all by itself wouldn\u2019t be useful for bringing together\nthese disparate networks.\n\n\u201cNumber one,\u201d he says, \u201cthe original ARPANET protocols required perfect\ndelivery, and if something didn\u2019t get through and you didn\u2019t get\nacknowledgment, you kept trying until it got through. That\u2019s not going to work\nif you\u2019re in a noisy environment, if you\u2019re in a tunnel, if you\u2019re behind a\nmountain, or if somebody\u2019s jamming you. So I wanted something that didn\u2019t\nrequire perfect communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber two,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou wanted something that didn\u2019t have to wait for\neverything in a message to get through before the next message could get\nthrough.\n\n\u201cAnd you had no way in the ARPANET protocols for telling a destination what to\ndo with the information when it got there. If a router got a packet and it\nwasn\u2019t for another node on the ARPANET, it would assume \u2018Oh, must be for me.\u2019\nIt had nowhere else to send it.\u201d\n\nInitially, Kahn assigned the network part of the IP addresses himself, keeping\na record on a single index card he carried in his shirt pocket.\n\n\u201cVint, as a computer scientist, thought of things in terms of bits and\ncomputer programs. As an electrical engineer, I thought about signals and\nbandwidth and the nondigital side of the world.\u201d\u2014Bob Kahn\n\nHe approached Vint Cerf, then an assistant professor at Stanford University,\nwho had been involved with Kahn in testing the ARPANET during its development,\nand he asked him to collaborate.\n\n\u201cVint, as a computer scientist, thought of things in terms of bits and\ncomputer programs. As an electrical engineer, I thought about signals and\nbandwidth and the nondigital side of the world. We brought together different\nsets of talents,\u201d Kahn says.\n\n\u201cBob came out to Stanford to see me in the spring of 1973 and raised the\nproblem of multiple networks,\u201d Cerf recalls. \u201cHe thought they should have a\nset of rules that allowed them to be autonomous but interact with each other.\nHe called it internetworking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d already given this serious thought,\u201d Cerf continues. \u201cHe wanted SRI to\nhost the operations of the packet-radio network, and he had people in the\nNorwegian defense-research establishment working on the packet-satellite\nnetwork. He asked me how we could make it so that a host on any network could\ncommunicate with another in a standardized way.\u201d\n\nCerf was in.\n\nThe two met regularly over the next six months to work on \u201cthe internetworking\nproblem.\u201d Between them, they made some half a dozen cross-country trips and\nalso met one-on-one whenever they found themselves attending the same\nconference. In July 1973, they decided it was time to commit their ideas to\npaper.\n\n\u201cI remember renting a conference room at the Cabana Hyatt in Palo Alto,\u201d Kahn\nsays. The two planned to sequester themselves there in August and write until\nthey were done. Kahn says it took a day; Cerf remembers it as two, or at least\na day and a half. In any case, they got it done in short order.\n\nCerf took the first crack at it. \u201cI sat down with my yellow pad of paper,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t figure out where to start.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went out to pay for the conference room,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cWhen I came back Vint\nwas sitting there with the pencil in his hand\u2014and not a single word on the\npaper.\u201d\n\nKahn admits that the task wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cIf you tried to describe the United\nStates government,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat would you say first? It\u2019s the buildings,\nit\u2019s the people, it\u2019s the Constitution. Do you talk about Britain? Do you talk\nabout Indians? Where do you start?\u201d\n\nIn 1977, President Bill Clinton [right] presented the National Medal of\nTechnology to Bob Kahn [center] and Vint Cerf [left].Bob Kahn\n\nKahn took the pencil from Cerf and started writing. \u201cThat\u2019s his style,\u201d Cerf\nsays, \u201cwrite as much as you can and edit later. I tend to be more organized,\nto start with an outline.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him to go away,\u201d Kahn says, \u201cand I wrote the first eight or nine\npages. When Vint came back, he looked at what I had done and said, \u2018Okay, give\nme the pencil.\u2019 And he wrote the next 20 or 30 pages. And then we went back\nand forth.\u201d\n\nFinally, Cerf walked off with the handwritten version to give to his secretary\nto type. When she finished, he told her to throw that original draft away.\n\u201cHistorians have been mad at me ever since,\u201d Cerf says.\n\n\u201cIt might be worth a fortune today,\u201d Kahn muses. The resulting paper,\npublished in the IEEE Transactions on Communications in 1974, represented the\nbasis of the Internet as we now know it. It introduced the Transmission\nControl Protocol, later separated into two parts and now known as TCP/IP.\n\n## A New World on an Index Card\n\nA key to making this network of networks work was the Internet Protocol (IP)\naddressing system. Every new host coming onto the network required a new IP\naddress. These numerical labels uniquely identify computers and are used for\nrouting packets to their locations on the network.\n\nInitially, Kahn assigned the network part of the IP addresses himself, keeping\na record of who had been allotted what set of numbers on a single index card\nhe carried in his shirt pocket. When that card began to fill up in the late\n\u201870s, he decided it was time to turn over the task to others. It became the\nresponsibility of Jon Postel, and subsequently that of the Internet Assigned\nNumbers Authority (IANA) at the University of Southern California. IANA today\nis part of ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\n\nBob Kahn and Vint Cerf visited Yellowstone National Park together in the early\n2000s.Bob Kahn\n\nKahn moved up the DARPA ladder, to chief scientist, deputy director, and, in\n1979, director of the Information Processing Techniques Office. He stayed in\nthat last role until late 1985. At DARPA, in addition to his networking\nefforts, he launched the VLSI [very-large-scale integration] Architecture and\nDesign Project and the billion-dollar Strategic Computing Initiative.\n\nIn 1985, with political winds shifting and government research budgets about\nto shrink substantially, Kahn left DARPA to form a nonprofit dedicated to\nfostering research on new infrastructures, including designing and prototyping\nnetworks for computing and communications. He established it as the\nCorporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI).\n\nKahn reached out to industry for funding, making it clear that, as a\nnonprofit, CNRI intended to make its research results open to all. Bell\nAtlantic, Bellcore, Digital Equipment Corp., IBM, MCI, NYNEX, Xerox, and\nothers stepped up with commitments that totaled over a million dollars a year\nfor several years. He also reached out to the U.S. National Science Foundation\nand received funding to build testbeds to demonstrate technology and\napplications for computer networks at speeds of at least a gigabit. CNRI also\nobtained U.S. government funding to create a secretariat for the Internet\nActivities Board, which eventually led to the establishment of the Internet\nEngineering Task Force, which has helped evolve Internet protocols and\nstandards. CNRI ran the secretariat for about 18 years.\n\nCerf joined Kahn at CNRI about six months after it started. \u201cWe were thinking\nabout applications of the Internet,\u201d Cerf says. \u201cWe were interested in digital\nlibraries, as were others.\u201d Kahn and Cerf sought support for such work, and\nDARPA again came through, funding CNRI to undertake a research effort\ninvolving building and linking digital libraries at universities.\n\nThey also began working on the concept of \u201cKnowbots,\u201d mobile software programs\nthat could collect and store information to be used to handle distributed\ntasks on a network.\n\nAs part of that digital library project, Kahn collaborated with Robert\nWilensky at the University of California, Berkeley, on a paper called \u201cA\nFramework for Distributed Digital Distributed Object Services,\u201d published in\nthe International Journal on Digital Libraries in 2006.\n\n## The Digital Object Emerges\n\nOut of this work came the idea that today forms the basis of much of Kahn\u2019s\ncurrent efforts: digital objects, also known as digital entities. A digital\nobject is a sequence of bits, or a set of such sequences, having a unique\nidentifier. A digital object may incorporate a wide variety of\ninformation\u2014documents, movies, software programs, wills, and even\ncryptocurrency. The concept of a digital object, together with distributed\nrepositories, metadata registries, and a decentralized identifier resolution\nsystem, form the digital-object architecture. From its identifier, a digital\nobject can be located even if it moves to a different place on the net. Kahn\u2019s\ncollaborator on much of this work is his wife, Patrice Lyons, a copyright and\ncommunications lawyer.\n\nInitially, CNRI maintained the registry of Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nrecords. Then those came to be kept locally, and CNRI maintained just the\nregistry of prefix records. In 2014, CNRI handed off that responsibility to a\nnewly formed international body, the DONA Foundation in Geneva. Kahn serves as\nchair of the DONA board. The organization uses multiple distributed\nadministrators to operate prefix registries. One, the International DOI\nFoundation, handled close to 100 billion new identifiers last year. The DOI\nsystem is used by a host of publishers, including IEEE, as well as other\norganizations to manage their digital assets.\n\nA plaque commemorating the ARPANET now stands in front of the Arlington, Va.,\nheadquarters of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Bob\nKahn\n\nKahn sees this current effort as a logical extension of the work he did on the\nARPANET and then the Internet. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how we use the Internet to\nmanage information,\u201d he says.\n\nKahn, now 85, works more than five days a week and has no intention of slowing\ndown. The Internet, he says, is still in its startup phase. Why would he step\nback now?\n\n\u201cI once had dinner with [historian and author] David McCullough,\u201d Kahn\nexplains. Referring to the 1974 paper he wrote with Cerf, he says, \u201cI told him\nthat if I were sitting in the audience at a meeting, people wouldn\u2019t say\n\u2018Here\u2019s what the writers of this paper really meant,\u2019 because I would get up\nand say, \u2018Well we wrote that and....\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI asked McCullough, \u2018When do you consider the end of the beginning of\nAmerica?\u2019\u201d After some discussion, McCullough put the date at 4 July 1826, when\nboth John Adams and Thomas Jefferson passed away.\n\nKahn agreed that their deaths marked the end of the country\u2019s startup phase,\nbecause Adams and Jefferson never stopped worrying about the country that they\nhelped create.\n\n\u201cIt was such an important thing that they were doing that their lives were\ncompletely embedded in it,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cAnd the same is true for me and the\nInternet.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * The Do-or-Die Moments That Determined the Fate of the Internet \u203a\n  * The Portrait Artist \u203a\n  * Meet Mr. Internet: Vint Cerf \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * About CNRI - Robert E.
