[+] on Friday.\n\nGetty Images\n\n## Key Facts\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities seized Republic First on\nFriday, amid speculation of a potential seizure and after the bank had looked\nfor a potential buyer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced.\n\nRepublic First had roughly $6 billion in assets and another $4 billion in\ndeposits in January, according to the FDIC.\n\nFulton Bank reached an agreement with regulators to take over Republic First\u2019s\n32 branches in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, which will reopen under\nthe Fulton Bank name, with the Pennsylvania-based bank assuming \u201csubstantially\nall of [Republic First\u2019s] deposits and purchase substantially all of the\nassets,\u201d the FDIC said in a statement.\n\nShares of Republic First Bancorp plummeted Friday as investors moved away from\nthe faltering bank, sinking 60% on the day to just over 1 cent\u2014a drop in the\nbucket of its July 2006 peak at nearly $12.50.\n\n## Key Background\n\nRepublic First\u2019s seizure makes it the fourth in just over a year to be seized\nby state and federal regulators, following the abrupt failure of Silicon\nValley Bank last March, sparking fears about the stability of regional banks\namid a series of bank runs depleting multiple banks\u2019 assets. Just two days\nafter SVB\u2019s failure, New York-based Signature Bank, a leader in crypto\nlending, also shuttered, with New York regulators seizing the 23-year-old\nregional bank, along with its $110 billion in assets and $88 billion in\ndeposits. San Francisco\u2019s First Republic Bank became the next bank to fail\nlast May, when federal regulators oversaw the offload of its assets to banking\ngiant JPMorgan Chase. Sources told Bloomberg this week the FDIC was seeking\nbids for the Republic First, a move that comes less than six months after the\nagency suspended an auction for Republic First just one week after it reached\na $35 million deal with the Norcross-Braca Group in a last-ditch effort to\nstave off a potential seizure and raise capital from investors. Norcross-Braca\nbacked out of that deal last month.\n\n## Big Number\n\n$250,000. That\u2019s the amount of individual customer deposits the FDIC\nguarantees it will protect, meaning that customers can expect up to a quarter\nmillion dollars to be safe even if their bank collapses.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nMORE FROM FORBESFirst Republic Bank Failure: A Timeline Of What Led To The\nSecond-Largest Bank Collapse In U.S. HistoryBy Derek SaulMORE FROM FORBESWhat\nTo Know About Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse-The Biggest Bank Failure Since\n2008By Conor Murray\n\nSend me a secure tip.\n\nBrian Bushard\n\nBrian Bushard is a Boston-based breaking news reporter on the Forbes\n\n...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": true}
