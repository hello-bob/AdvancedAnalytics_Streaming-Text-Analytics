This new method, from\nAMOLF and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, has advantages\nthat could bring new technological applications to reality.\n\n\"This principle offers a new approach to slow down light fields and thereby\nenhance their strength,\" says physicist Ewold Verhagen of AMOLF. \"Realizing\nthis on a chip is particularly important for many applications.\"\n\nThe team's work was based on manipulating electrons using two-dimensional\nmaterials such as graphene. In a conducting material, electrons can move\nfreely, zooming along like a tiny highway. However, applying a magnetic field\ncan restrict movement of the electrons to certain energies, known as Landau\nlevels.\n\nIt's not only magnets that push electrons to Landau levels. Two-dimensional\ngraphene, consisting of a single layer of atoms, can do it too. Normally,\ngraphene is conductive; but if you warp or distort the graphene, such as by\nstretching it, you can confine the electrons to Landau levels, turning the\nnormally conductive material into an insulator.\n\nTogether with Ren\u00e9 Barczyk of AMOLF and Kobus Kuipers of Delft University,\nVerhagen sought to find out if they could find a material that had a similar\neffect on photons to the one that warped graphene has on electrons.\n\nNow, light can be manipulated with a similar material to graphene, called a\nphotonic crystal. And the researchers found that they could stall light waves\nin a similar fashion.\n\n\"A photonic crystal normally consists of a regular \u2013 two dimensional \u2013 pattern\nof holes in a silicon layer. Light can move freely in this material, just like\nelectrons in graphene,\" Barczyk explains.\n\n\"Breaking this regularity in exactly the right manner will deform the array\nand consequently lock the photons. This is how we create Landau levels for\nphotons.\"\n\nThe team's honeycombed photonic crystals were able to confine light to Landau\nlevels using a process that represented different kinds of deformation, such\nas curving or warping. And they were even able to induce different types of\nwarping at different places in the same material, resulting in a photonic\ncrystal in which light can flow freely in some parts, but becomes confined in\nothers.\n\nThe discovery requires further development, but it does bring scientists a\nstep closer to the fine control of light on very small scales.\n\n\"This brings on-chip applications closer,\" says Verhagen.\n\n\"If we can confine light at the nanoscale and bring it to a halt like this,\nits strength will be enhanced tremendously. And not only at one location, but\nover the entire crystal surface. Such light concentration is very important in\nnanophotonic devices, for example for the development of efficient lasers or\nquantum light sources.\"\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Photonics.\n\nTrending News\n\nCommon Blood Pressure Drug Increases Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals\nHealth2 days ago\n\nCannabis Use Linked to Epigenetic Changes, Study Reveals Health3 days ago\n\nIt's Official: Scientists Finally Confirmed What's Inside The Moon Space6 days\nago\n\n", "frontpage": true}
