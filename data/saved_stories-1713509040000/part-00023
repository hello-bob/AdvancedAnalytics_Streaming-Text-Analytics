It sucks. I know because I\u2019ve been there.\n\nThe head is forward (1), shoulders are slouched (2), back is arched (3) and\nyour hips form an angle of less than 90 degrees (4). The evidence is\noverwhelming that sitting this way is really bad for you. Slouching can cause\nproblems with headaches and jaw pain, gastrointestinal problems, give you a\nbeer gut, even cause you to perform poorly at your job and wreak havoc on your\nperceived confidence. In order to avoid these problems, a number of experts\nadvise improving your sitting posture.\n\nThis what the textbook \u201ccorrect\u201d sitting posture looks like. The monitor is\npositioned at or just below eye level so that the head is straight (1). The\nshoulders are back and the back is slightly arched (2). The elbows form a\n90-degree angle (3) so that the forearms are level.\n\nIt\u2019s true that sitting properly may improve your overall posture, but it\u2019s\nonly part of the story. For me, the improvement was marginal at best. I still\nwalked around with slouched shoulders and with my head forward. About a year\nago, I made a concerted effort to change that.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nI\u2019ve always struggled with posture. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m tall and lanky,\nwhich seems to exacerbate the issue. So, last April, when I was offered a free\npersonal training session as part of my new gym membership, I took it as an\nopportunity to learn more about posture and training.\n\nAt the first session, the trainer puts you through a series of exercises to\ntry and determine overall fitness and if there might be any areas which need\nimprovement. Even though I would consider myself a relatively fit individual,\nI had trouble with exercises focusing on the abs and glutes. Why?\n\nThe Kinetic Chain\n\nIn physical therapy, there is a concept known as a kinetic chain. Essentially,\nthe idea is that no joint can be evaluated in isolation. The body tends to\ncompensate for injuries or muscle imbalances in one area by propagating the\nimbalance to other muscles and joints. An imbalance in the hip will propagate\nto the back and shoulders, for instance.\n\nIn my case, I believe I developed a muscle imbalance in the hip resulting from\nhours sitting at a computer. When you are sitting, your abdominal muscles are\nnot being engaged. Furthermore, the hip flexor muscles are contracted which\ncan shorten them over time.\n\nWith shortened hip flexors and weak abs and glues, the result is an excessive\nanterior pelvic tilt, meaning that the hips are excessively tilted forward.\nSome amount of anterior tilt is normal, and the back naturally has some degree\nof arch, between 4-7 degrees in men and about 7-10 degrees in women. Mine was\ncloser to 15 degrees. The anterior pelvic tilt propagates up the kinetic\nchain, resulting an excessive back arch. The excessive back arch means that\nthe shoulders and head must come forward to compensate.\n\nRegardless of whether you are sitting with proper posture or slouching, you\nwill still run into these problems. Of course, sitting properly will help, but\nit may not be a solution in itself \u2013 at least, it wasn\u2019t enough for me.\n\nMy Results\n\nThe solution for an anterior pelvic tilt is actually fairly straightforward in\ntheory \u2013 strengthen the abs and glutes and stretch the opposing muscles, the\nerector spinae and hip flexors. In practice, it\u2019s a little more complicated.\n\nI continued to do roughly the same workout routine I\u2019ve done for years, but I\nmodified it to focus on those goals. I added planks and hip abductor exercises\nto my weight training routine. I added stretches for the erector spinae and\nhip flexors. I also started doing pull ups with a reverse grip so as to focus\non the deltoids (delts) to try to pull my shoulders back.\n\nI also recently switched to a standing desk, which appears to be a trend among\ndevelopers these days. I definitely like my standing desk, but I don\u2019t believe\nit is a solution in itself. In fact, a standing desk can actually cause injury\nfor individuals that have been sitting for years if the switch is abrupt.\nStanding tends to put more stress on the lower back if you previously had\nproblems with weak abs or glutes. When I first switched, I definitely felt\npain in my back, so I dialed it back and gave my body time to adjust.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since I decided to focus explicitly on posture. My\nposture has improved dramatically, though it still isn\u2019t quite where I\u2019d like\nit to be. In other areas, however, I\u2019ve noticed very clear benefits. Since my\nshoulders are farther back, I\u2019ve noticed that I have much greater mobility on\nexercises like the bench press. It\u2019s easier for me to lift things off of the\nground and my butt actually has some curvature to it, which I\u2019m told might\nhelp with the ladies, though I can\u2019t provide any scientific data to support\nthat assertion. A problem I had previously with shoulder impingement is\nessentially gone. I can stand for longer periods of time without feeling\nfatigue. So, in short, I am making progress.\n\nPosture is probably something I will struggle with for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, I have found ways to improve my posture gradually. The bottom line is\nthat our profession is inherently unnatural in that it requires a great deal\nof time to be spent in a stationary position. To the extent that we can break\nup that pattern by taking breaks, stretching, working out and remaining\nmobile, we can be better, healthier, longer-living. more productive and sane\ndevelopers.\n\n### Subscribe to Devid\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Devid R \u00b7 Launched 15 hours ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\n1 Like\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Software Developers Have Health Risks\n\nzetterr.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Devid R\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
