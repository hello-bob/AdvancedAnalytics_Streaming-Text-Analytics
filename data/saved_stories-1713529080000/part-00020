For\nexample, it claims to solve the GapSVP problem, which asks to approximate the\nlength of the shortest nonzero vector in a given n-dimensional lattice, to\nwithin an approximation ratio of ~n^4.5. The best approximation ratio\npreviously known to be achievable in classical or quantum polynomial time was\nexponential in n.\n\nIf it\u2019s correct, this is an extremely big deal. It doesn\u2019t quite break the\nmain lattice-based cryptosystems, but it would put those cryptosystems into a\nprecarious position, vulnerable to a mere further polynomial improvement in\nthe approximation factor. And, as we learned from the recent NIST competition,\nif the lattice-based and LWE-based systems were to fall, then we really don\u2019t\nhave many great candidates left for post-quantum public-key cryptography! On\ntop of that, a full quantum break of LWE (which, again, Chen is not claiming)\nwould lay waste (in a world with scalable QCs, of course) to a large fraction\nof the beautiful sandcastles that classical and quantum cryptographers have\nbuilt up over the last couple decades\u2014everything from Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption schemes, to Mahadev\u2019s protocol for proving the output of any\nquantum computation to a classical skeptic.\n\nSo on the one hand, this would substantially enlarge the scope of exponential\nquantum speedups beyond what we knew a week ago: yet more reason to try to\nbuild scalable QCs! But on the other hand, it could also fuel an argument for\ncoordinating to slow down the race to scalable fault-tolerant QCs, until the\nworld can get its cryptographic house into better order. (Of course, as we\u2019ve\nseen with the many proposals to slow down AI scaling, this might or might not\nbe possible.)\n\nSo then, is the paper correct? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very obviously a serious\neffort by a serious researcher, a world away from the P=NP proofs that fill my\ninbox every day. But it might fail anyway. I\u2019ve asked the world experts in\nquantum algorithms for lattice problems, and they\u2019ve been looking at it, and\nnone of them is ready yet to render a verdict. The central difficulty is that\nthe algorithm is convoluted, and involves new tools that seem to come from\nleft field, including complex Gaussian functions, the windowed quantum Fourier\ntransform, and Karst waves (whatever those are). The algorithm has 9 phases by\nthe author\u2019s count. In my own perusal, I haven\u2019t yet extracted even a high-\nlevel intuition\u2014I can\u2019t tell any little story like for Shor\u2019s algorithm, e.g.\n\u201cfirst you reduce factoring to period-finding, then you solve period-finding\nby applying a Fourier transform to a vector of amplitudes.\u201d\n\nSo, the main purpose of this post is simply to throw things open to\ncommenters! I\u2019m happy to provide a public clearinghouse for questions and\ncomments about the preprint, if those studying it would like that. You can\neven embed LaTeX in your comments, as will probably be needed to get anywhere.\n\nUnrelated Update: Connor Tabarrok and his friends just put a podcast with me\nup on YouTube, in which they interview me in my office at UT Austin about\nwatermarking of large language models and other AI safety measures.\n\nFollow\n\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 16th, 2024 at 12:12 pm and is filed\nunder Announcements, Complexity, Quantum.

Mark Spinelli Says: Comment #1 April 16th, 2024 at 12:26 pm\n\nMahadev used LWE as a way to instantiate her black box, didn\u2019t she? That is,\nshe needed a post-quantum protocol with nice adaptive hard-core bit\nproperties, and she proved that LWE has these properties I think, but I think\nshe indicated that other post-quantum protocols might fit the bill for her\npurposes (much as Yamakawaw and Zhandry use SHA256 for their random oracle).\nOr is it that there are no other candidates besides LWE presently known to\nsatisfy her requirements?\n\nAlso, if this holds up does this give any application to other, non-\ncryptographic and potentially industrially significant problems? Knowing how\nto factor numbers is nest but it doesn\u2019t solve any particularly impressive\nother problems that your average engineer would be interested in, AFAIK. For\nexample does anything cool like Graph Isomorphism reduce to the particular\nGapSVP problem addressed by Chen?\n\n  2. Scott Says: Comment #2 April 16th, 2024 at 12:33 pm\n\nMark Spinelli #1: Yes, Mahadev used LWE (she needed a quantum-resistant\ntrapdoor claw-free 2-to-1 function). Again, the new preprint doesn\u2019t claim to\nsolve LWE with good enough parameters to break schemes like Mahadev\u2019s, but it\nwould put them in a much more precarious position.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know of any non-cryptographic commercial applications of problems\nlike SVP and LWE \u2014 maybe someone else does?\n\n  3. RandomOracle Says: Comment #3 April 16th, 2024 at 12:45 pm\n\nI could be wrong, but since Mahadev\u2019s protocol (and related quantum protocols\nbased on LWE) require the adaptive hardcore bit property, I believe that the\nparameters for which that\u2019s currently known to be true would fall into the\nrange of this new algorithm (and so, the protocol would be quantum-insecure if\nthis new algorithm is correct). Though maybe someone more qualified could\nclarify whether that\u2019s actually the case.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that proof of quantumness protocols (that aim to\ntest for quantum advantage), are unaffected by this result since for those\nprotocols one is merely interested in soundness against classical poly-time\nalgorithms. It\u2019s only for protocols where one wants to have quantum soundness,\nbased on LWE, like verification, that this becomes a problem.\n\nFinally, there was a subsequent preprint by Omri Shmueli pointing out a bug in\nChen\u2019s paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/583.pdf. But Chen claims on his\nwebsite that this is actually not an issue: http://www.chenyilei.net/.\n\n  4. Mark Says: Comment #4 April 16th, 2024 at 12:56 pm\n\nOne can view LWE as defining a very particular coding-theoretic problem. One\nis given the data of a matrix AA, corresponding to the basis of a random\nlattice. One then gets As+eAs+e, where AsAs is an encoding of the message ss\ninto the lattice AA, and ee is concentrated error (which one can view as being\na noisy channel). Recovering the LWE secret ss is then equivalent to decoding\nthis encoded message.\n\nRandom lattices are known to have within constant factors of optimal (whp)\nminimum distance, so the above is a good code whp. That being said, we can get\nwithin polylog (and actually even better than this, \\log(n)^\\epsilonlog(n)\u03b5\nfor \\epsilon>\u03b5>).\n\nThere\u2019s another issue with the above coding-theoretic interpretation of LWE\nthough. LWE is defined with respect to modular arithmetic. Coding theory likes\nviewing things defined in a bounded subset of \\mathbb{Z}^n. I believe (but\nhaven\u2019t talked to an actual coding theorist) one can view LWE as selecting the\nbounded subset [-q/2,q/2]^n. This choice of bounded subset (\u201cshaping region\u201d)\nis not particularly performant. Typically one would want something that is\ncloser to being spherical, as you choose a shaping region to minimize the\nEuclidean norm of your encoded vectors (physically, this corresponds to\nminimizing the power requirement of transmission).\n\nThis is to say that a quantum algorithm for search LWE probably implies\nslightly-better-than-we-currently-have algorithms for channel coding in the\npresence of Gaussian noise, but the gains are relatively small compared to a\ndecade ago (when classical algorithms were much worse).\n\n  5. Scott Says: Comment #5 April 16th, 2024 at 1:49 pm\n\nRandomOracle #3: Oh! I\u2019d assumed that if the algorithm could directly break\nMahadev\u2019s scheme or anything similarly dramatic, Chen would\u2019ve mentioned it.\nAgain, happy to get clarification from someone who knows more.\n\n  6. Scott Says: Comment #6 April 16th, 2024 at 1:51 pm\n\nMark #4: Notwithstanding the comedy of spending tens of billions of dollars to\nbuild a giant fault-tolerant quantum computer able to run this monster of an\nalgorithm just to get slightly better decoding for error-correcting codes\nunder Gaussian noise ... yes, that\u2019s a fair point.\n\n  7. alex Says: Comment #7 April 16th, 2024 at 2:42 pm\n\ncan I get a baby-sized explanation of the GapSVP problem? as stated it sounds\ntrivial (why is it not simply the lattice spacing?)\n\n  8. Scott Says: Comment #8 April 16th, 2024 at 2:52 pm\n\nalex #7: That\u2019s exactly what it is ... in the special case that the basis\nvectors for your lattice are all orthogonal and of the same length.\n\nIn general, though, a lattice can be the set of all integer linear\ncombinations of any set of real basis vectors. And you might be given as input\na \u201cbad\u201d basis, consisting of long vectors, which hides the existence of much\nshorter nonzero vectors (which can be produced by taking some crazy integer\nlinear combination of the \u201cbad\u201d vectors, in 5000- or whatever-dimensional\nspace). Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what happens in lattice-based cryptosystems.\nFinding the short nonzero vectors is then tantamount to breaking the\ncryptosystem.\n\n  9. Mark Says: Comment #9 April 16th, 2024 at 3:47 pm\n\nIt\u2019s worth clarifying that even deciding if a lattice has all vectors\northogonal and of the same length is not easy. This is generally called the\n\u201cLattice Isomorphism Problem\u201d (specifically testing isomorphism with Z^n). See\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1548 .\n\nAs for an explanation as to why (gap)SVP is hard, it really only appears in\nhigh dimensions, and naive \u201cgeometric\u201d reasoning in low dimensions does not\nilluminate the high-dimensional case. Instead, thinking about it algebraically\nas, given A, computing\n\n\\lambda_1(A) := \\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}^n\\setminus\\\\{0\\\\}}|| Ax||_2^2,\n\nis fairly useful. If we were minimizing over some continuous domain (say a\nsubset of \\mathbb{R}^n) one would expect to be able to solve this efficiently\nusing calculus-inspired methods. Over a discrete domain, it becomes hard for\nsimilar reasons that linear programming is poly-time computable, but integer\nlinear programming is NP hard.\n\n  10. Scott Says: Comment #10 April 16th, 2024 at 4:01 pm\n\nMark #9: Yeah, I was careful to say the basis vectors given as input are\northogonal \u2014 otherwise finding the orthogonal basis could indeed be hard.\n\n  11. Izzy Grosof Says: Comment #11 April 16th, 2024 at 5:50 pm\n\nHave there been any previous \u201cplausible\u201d claims of quantum algorithms for any\nof this family of lattice problems? Or is the first claim of its kind to come\nfrom a researcher in the field?\n\n  12. Sean Feeney Says: Comment #12 April 16th, 2024 at 5:53 pm\n\nMark #6 I find it interesting from my small understanding of LWE (Everything I\nhave read today), that LWE search and decision LWE are equivalent under\ncertain conditions:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors#Decision_version\n\nI wonder, albeit naively, if there is a certain niche in decision problems,\nshould this result stand the test of public scrutiny, that this algorithm\ncould fill.\n\nDecision applications, if possible, might have commercial application?\n\n  13. Scott Says: Comment #13 April 16th, 2024 at 6:04 pm\n\nIzzy Grosof #11: No, I don\u2019t remember any previous claim to solve LWE/GapSVP\nquantumly that seemed anywhere near as plausible\u2014maybe someone else does?\n\n  14. Mark Says: Comment #14 April 16th, 2024 at 7:03 pm\n\nShor claimed a solution (with worse approximation factor, for a mildly\ndifferent lattice problem), joint with Lior Eldar in 2016. See for example\n\nhttps://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-\nlattices-or-shor-strikes-again .\n\nIt was also discussed some on this blog\n\nhttps://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2996 .\n\n  15. QMA(2) Says: Comment #15 April 16th, 2024 at 7:26 pm\n\nWhy are all encryption schemes in classical P? Why cannot anyone imagine an\nencryption scheme not in classical P but in BQP?\n\n  16. Ted Says: Comment #16 April 16th, 2024 at 7:29 pm\n\nScott (or anyone else), could you please elaborate on exactly what you mean by\n\u201cbreak the main lattice-based cryptosystem\u201d and (separately) make it\n\u201cvulnerable to a mere further polynomial improvement in the approximation\nfactor\u201d?\n\nMy naive understanding was that any algorithm that allows for decryption in a\nnumber of time steps polynomial in the size of the public key (or perhaps\npolynomial in the number of time steps required for decryption) would\nconstitute a \u201cbreak\u201d, because it would break the qualitative asymmetry between\nthe amounts of time required for encryption and for decryption that underlies\nany strong cryptosystem. Is this wrong? Exactly what (quantitative) polynomial\nimprovement in the approximation factor would constitute a \u201cbreak\u201d?\n\nThanks! Sorry for the naive question.\n\n  17. RandomOracle Says: Comment #17 April 16th, 2024 at 7:36 pm\n\nIzzy, Scott: There was the Eldar Shor result, but it only seemed plausible for\na day or so until Regev pointed out the mistake:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06999\n\n  18. Scott Says: Comment #18 April 16th, 2024 at 7:43 pm\n\nMark #14 and RandomOracle #17: Yeah, you\u2019re right, that was the most plausible\nprior attempt. But it didn\u2019t stand for long, and (if I recall correctly) was\nfor a very weird variant of Bounded Distance Decoding.\n\n  19. Scott Says: Comment #19 April 16th, 2024 at 7:47 pm\n\nTed #16: There are two completely different polynomials in play, the running\ntime and the approximation ratio. We\u2019re concerned here with the approximation\nratio, which has to be below some threshold (often ~\u221an, iirc) in order to\nthreaten a given lattice-based cryptosystem at all.\n\nCould anyone tell us, concretely, how much the new paper\u2019s approximation\nratios for GapSVP and LWE would need to be improved in order to break known\ncryptosystems? I looked through the paper for a direct and explicit answer to\nthat question but didn\u2019t find it.\n\n  20. QMA(2) Says: Comment #20 April 16th, 2024 at 8:23 pm\n\nScott #19 Parameters are in https://nigelsmart.github.io/LWE.html\n\n  21. Anxious Physicist Says: Comment #21 April 16th, 2024 at 8:50 pm\n\nOn one hand if true this is a very exciting development that suggests that\nexponential quantum speed ups might be possible for a much wider range of\nproblems than previously known.\n\nI do however worry about quantum computers developed and being used primarily\nto break cryptosystems. I had assuaged such fears, in myself and my peers, by\npointing out that that Post-quantum cryptography was fairly mature and already\nbeing rolled out However I think all of those are lattice based and, if this\nresult is correct, the status of these are in doubt. I know there are non\nlattice based proposals for post-quantum cryptography but, I\u2019m my admittedly\nlimited understanding, they are much less mature and not currently ready for\ndeployment. I\u2019m also not sure how much to trust that they are resistant to\nquantum attacks.\n\nThis raises the specter that scalable quantum computers are built before we\ncan roll out post-quantum systems and therefor we essential lack secure public\nkey cryptography.\n\nQuantum cryptography might help but in the immediate future it will likely be\neasier for governments to restrict access to or monitor the usage of quantum\ncommunications.\n\nThis of course would make quantum computers much more attractive to the 3\nletter agencies funding its development. But it would not be good for people\nhoping that quantum computers could improve human flourishing.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m still optimistic that quantum simulation could bring about\nworthwhile advancement in human knowledge and welfare. But potentially loosing\npublic key cryptography even temporarily is a bitter pill to swallow.\n\n  22. Scott Says: Comment #22 April 16th, 2024 at 9:31 pm\n\nQMA(2) #20: Thanks! But that website (whose 1990s-style design brings back\nmany fond memories) states everything in terms of LWE, which involves not only\nn but also other parameters \u03b1 and q. Chen\u2019s paper has a paragraph that does\nsomething similar. I was wondering what approximation ratio for GapSVP, in\nterms of n, would suffice to break lattice-based cryptosystems\u2014does anyone\nknow that? Is it indeed around \u221an?\n\n  23. Ted Says: Comment #23 April 16th, 2024 at 10:50 pm\n\nScott #19,\n\nThanks, that\u2019s helpful.\n\nI could be wrong, but it seems to me that the ultimate measure of security for\nany public-key cryptosystem is the amount of computational resources required\nto compute the private key from a given public key. I\u2019m sure that this is not\na simple question to answer, but how does the runtime (or some other measure\nof computational resources) depend on the approximation ratio? Is there some\nkind of \u201cphase transition\u201d where, if the approximation ratio drops below some\nthreshold (~\u221an or whatever), then the required runtime to compute the private\nkey suddenly changes from exponential in n to polynomial in n?\n\n  24. RandomOracle Says: Comment #24 April 16th, 2024 at 11:19 pm\n\nAfter looking more closely at Chen\u2019s paper and the Mahadev and Brakerski et al\npapers on verification and proofs of quantumness respectively, I\u2019m pretty\nconfident now that Chen\u2019s result would indeed break the quantum soundness of\nthose schemes.\n\nThe key point is that Chen\u2019s algorithm works for an LWE instance with m >\n\\Omega(n \\log q) and q \\in \\Omega((\\alpha \\cdot q)^4 m^2) . Both of these\nconditions are satisfied for Mahadev\u2019s protocol. It\u2019s really the second\ncondition that\u2019s important, since the first one is almost always satisfied in\nLWE-based schemes. Mahadev uses the same trapdoor claw-free function as in the\nBrakerski et al paper (this one: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00640.pdf). In\nthat paper it\u2019s mentioned (on page 19, second-to-last paragraph) that q is\nessentially exp(n). In particular, this means that it is indeed the case that\nq \\in \\Omega((\\alpha \\cdot q)^4 m^2) as required for Chen\u2019s result.\n\n  25. Scott Says: Comment #25 April 16th, 2024 at 11:38 pm\n\nTed #23: Yes, there appear to be phase transitions in the hardness of SVP\ndepending on the approximation ratio, although it\u2019s a major open problem to\npin down exactly where they happen. For example, SVP with constant (or even\nslightly super-constant) approximation ratio is known to be NP-hard. SVP with\n\u221an approximation ratio still seems to be hard (?), but it\u2019s almost certainly\nnot NP-hard, since Aharonov and Regev showed that it\u2019s in NP\u2229coNP. And SVP\nwith some exponential approximation ratio can be done in classical polynomial\ntime using the LLL algorithm.\n\n  26. Mark Spinelli Says: Comment #26 April 17th, 2024 at 6:03 am\n\nRandomOracle #24:\n\nEven if you break soundness with Chen\u2019s result, you are still using a quantum\ncomputer to do it. Ergo you\u2019ve demonstrated quantumness.\n\nIndeed Kohonomoku-Meyer et al. use a hash based on x^2 mod N in their\nprotocol, which is broken by Shor. See here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687.\nSo it\u2019s kind of win-win with proofs of quantumness.\n\n  27. Ian Says: Comment #27 April 17th, 2024 at 7:45 am\n\nYou say in the article that the attack would \u201clay waste\u201d to FHE, but I don\u2019t\nthink that\u2019s quite right. Unlike PQC schemes like Kyber, FHE has utility\nbecause of its homomorphic properties, and, since no one actually has a\nquantum computer capable of running this algorithm, FHE would still be\nencryption that resists classical attacks and allows for computation on\nencrypted data. That\u2019s a pretty useful tool, given the non-existence of gate\nmodel quantum computers large enough to run attacks.\n\n  28. RandomOracle Says: Comment #28 April 17th, 2024 at 8:44 am\n\nMark #26: Yes, I mentioned that proofs of quantumness are unaffected by this\nresult. But Mahadev\u2019s protocol is a protocol for delegating and verifying\ngeneral (poly time) quantum computations. For that, you do require quantum\nsoundness. And since that soundness is based on LWE, the prover could cheat\nusing Chen\u2019s algorithm.\n\n  29. Jim Says: Comment #29 April 17th, 2024 at 8:53 am\n\nScott #19 / #22,\n\nI am not an expert, so this is probably a gross oversimplification. What I\u2019ve\ngleaned so far is that the approximation factor would need to be below\nO(n^2.5) to be interesting/worrying for NTRU schemes, and the relevant regime\nfor Kyber (ML-KEM) and Dilithium (ML-DSA) is probably somewhere around O(n) to\nO(n^2). Of course, concrete attacks will depend on the leading coefficients as\nwell.\n\n  30. fred Says: Comment #30 April 17th, 2024 at 8:57 am\n\n\u201cSo then, is the paper correct? I don\u2019t know. [...] The central difficulty is\nthat the algorithm is convoluted, and involves new tools that seem to come\nfrom left field, including complex Gaussian functions, the windowed quantum\nFourier transform, and Karst waves (whatever those are).\u201d\n\nAs I noted before, one striking property of the field seems to be that even\nexperts can\u2019t easily make heads or tails of many of the proposed quantum\nalgorithms that are supposed to be \u201cpractical\u201d (i.e. supposed to leverage\nquantum supremacy). If the algorithms are meant to stay impractical, who\ncares...\n\nThat raises the question \u2013 even if QCs become a reality, they\u2019ll probably be a\nrare resource for quite some time (more like the LHC or the JWT), and it seems\nthat the difficulty of crafting/understanding an algorithm will become a\nserious bottleneck to decide how to put them to the best use. Like, who will\nbe savvy enough to decide how to allocate the compute time? (of course if it\u2019s\nthe NSA owning one, we all know what they\u2019ll be focusing on).\n\nA naive question regarding the correctness of this particular result: is the\nminimum size instance to test this algorithm small enough that it could be\nsimulated (very inefficiently) on classical machines?\n\n  31. Scott Says: Comment #31 April 17th, 2024 at 9:09 am\n\nfred #30: Judging the correctness of proposed classical algorithms has often\nbeen equally difficult, taking weeks or months rather than days. This seems\nlike just a special case of the \u201cmath is hard\u201d principle.\n\n  32. Greg Kuperberg Says: Comment #32 April 17th, 2024 at 9:16 am\n\nalex #7: My answer is yes, the solution to the short vector problem is\n\u201csimply\u201d the minimum lattice spacing. The essence of the problem is that in\nhigh dimensions, for a general shape of lattice, that very thing is far from\nobvious, to the point that it is taken to be computationally intractable.\n\nAs Scott says, if you are only visualizing a rectilinear lattice with an\northogonal basis, then in that case it\u2019s trivial. However, already in two\ndimensions, a general lattice has a parallelogram unit cell rather than a\nrectangular unit cell. In two dimensions the solution is easily to visualize\nand easy to compute, but you might not call it outright trivial. The shortest\nvector certainly doesn\u2019t have to be one of the three non-zero corners of the\nfirst parallelogram unit cell that you are given.\n\nIn three dimensions, for a general lattice, it is now harder to visualize the\nshortest vector, but with practice you can see it and there is a fast\nalgorithm.\n\nIn four dimensions, it now takes a lot of practice to intuit the shortest\nvector of a general lattice, it doesn\u2019t seem obvious at all. Nonetheless there\nis a fast algorithm.\n\nIn fact, in any fixed dimension d, there is a \u201cfast\u201d algorithm to completely\nsolve the short vector problem for d-dimensional lattices. For instance, if L\nis a sublattice of the standard integer lattice, so that L has some basis of\ninteger vectors, then you can solve SVP in polynomial time in the bit\ncomplexity of the d x d generator matrix. You can thus call SVP \u201cfixed-\nparameter tractable\u201d if the dimension d is the parameter.\n\nAs d increases, any known \u201cfast\u201d algorithm degrades inexorably. Even\napproximate SVP looks intractable for wide range of levels of approximation.\nFor a very strict standard of approximation \u2014 within a constant factor of\noptimal \u2014 SVP is known to be NP-complete. One of the key ranges of interest in\ncryptography and CS theory is SVP with poly(d) approximation.\n\nThere is a supremely important algorithm called LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz)\nthat runs in uniform polynomial time that solves approximate SVP, and\ncalculates an approximately optimal lattice basis, with an approximation\nfactor of O(2^d). It was originally published as a subroutine for a\npolynomial-time algorithm to factor polynomials with rational coefficients. As\nthe authors sensed might happen, the \u201csubroutine\u201d became far more important\nthan that first cool and already-interesting application.\n\n  33. Prasanna Says: Comment #33 April 17th, 2024 at 10:28 am\n\nGiven that QCs to do Shor\u2019s algorithm to break current cryptography are not\neven on the drawing board ( I mean we don\u2019t know to do reliable fault\ntolerance), it seems that worrying about breaking post quantum crypto is akin\nto worrying about overpopulation on Mars!\n\n  34.

It received 400 members over the past two days, which is\nexactly one order of magnitude above what I was expecting, and there are some\ninteresting technical discussions already happening there.

Scott Says: Comment #37 April 17th, 2024 at 11:02 am\n\nPrasanna #33: Oh, QCs to do Shor\u2019s algorithm are certainly on the drawing\nboard! And many users (especially, e.g., in the intelligence community) don\u2019t\nwant to use a cryptosystem now if there\u2019s a decent chance it\u2019ll be compromised\nin a decade or two. So I\u2019d say that this is less like overpopulation on Mars\nthan like overpopulation in Texas: maybe not a pressing current concern but\nyou could totally imagine it becoming one!\n\n  38. Vinod Says: Comment #38 April 17th, 2024 at 12:01 pm\n\n@Scott: I\u2019d like to make two points.\n\n1\\. As Ian #27 says, it\u2019s important to say that even if this paper stands up\nto scrutiny, all of lattice-based cryptography is still *classically* secure\n(as far as we know, the usual caveat). Case in point: Shor\u2019s quantum algorithm\nfor factoring and discrete log hasn\u2019t given us any idea whatsoever towards an\nimproved classical algorithm for these problems.\n\nTo me, lattice-based cryptography is much more important because it can\nconstruct primitives like fully homomorphic encryption that have no other\nknown instantiations (save one, from indistinguishability obfuscation, but\nI\u2019ll let that slide for now) and much less so because of its supposed post-\nquantum security. But I will admit I am a little biased.\n\n(Incidentally, the fact that FHE has no other known \u2014 even remotely efficient\n\u2014 instantiations aside from LWE does keep me awake at night.)\n\n2\\. The algorithms that will be irreparably affected are the ones that\n*necessarily* have to assume the post-quantum security of LWE, such as quantum\ncryptographic protocols.\n\nAn example is indeed Urmila and Zvika et al.\u2019s quantum protocols. However,\nmuch of that machinery relies on generic primitives (e.g. trapdoor claw-free\nfunctions with an adaptive hardcore bit) which have other instantiations.\nIndeed, we now know that plain TCFs are sufficient, and that the adaptive\nhardcore bit property is a red herring \u2014 this is from upcoming work of Metger-\nNatarajan-Zhang (https://calendar.csail.mit.edu/events/280870) building on\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2022/400.pdf.\n\nTCFs can now be constructed based on other, presumed post-quantum secure,\nassumptions, in particular ones related to group actions. An example is\nhttps://www.research-\ncollection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/439880/main.pdf?sequence=1\n\n  39. Scott Says: Comment #39 April 17th, 2024 at 12:06 pm\n\nIan #27 and Vinod #38: Fine. I thought it was obvious from context that I was\ntalking about the security of FHE, etc. in an eventual world with scalable\nQCs, but I edited the post to make that 100% clear.\n\n  40. Vinod Says: Comment #40 April 17th, 2024 at 12:12 pm\n\n@Scott: Thank you! Of course, you and I perfectly understand the state of\naffairs, but I have been inundated with so many questions in the last week\nabout the classical (in)security of FHE that I feel like this had to be said.\nThanks again.\n\n  41. QMA(2) Says: Comment #41 April 17th, 2024 at 12:53 pm\n\nMy guess is that the algorithm will not hold up. The climb down to n^a from\nn^4.5 at any a in O(1) seems not totally irrational\nhttps://twitter.com/huckbennett/status/1596760051678863361/photo/1\n\n  42. Ted Says: Comment #42 April 17th, 2024 at 3:14 pm\n\nScott #25 and Jim #29: Last question, I promise!\n\n(I think) I understand the situation with GapSVP: there appears to be a\ncritical power $p$ at which the problem of solving GapSVP to within an\napproximation ratio of $n^p$ transitions between being solvable in polynomial\ntime and not. We can say with high confidence that $p > 0$, but there were no\nknown upper bounds on $p$ until this new preprint, which (if correct) implies\nthat $p \\leq 4.5$.\n\nIn comment #19, Scott says that the approximation ratio \u201chas to be below some\nthreshold (often ~\u221an, iirc) in order to threaten a given lattice-based\ncryptosystem at all.\u201d Am I correct that this is an independent threshold from\nthe phase-transition threshold $p$ for the SVP, and that the cryptosytem will\nbe broken if someone demonstrates (constructively) that $p$ is below that\nthreshold? Does this threshold also represent a sharp phase transition, or is\nit just a \u201crule of thumb\u201d for when the resources required to break the\nlattice-based cryptosystem become concerningly low? How exactly are they\ndefining a \u201cbreak\u201d of the cryptosystem?\n\n(P.S. \\\\\\\\( and \\\\\\\\) don\u2019t seem to be working for me for inline TeX.)\n\n  43. Scott Says: Comment #43 April 17th, 2024 at 4:15 pm\n\nTed #42: To do inline TeX, use two dollar signs, like so: x^2\n\n.\n\nThe approximation ratio below which SVP is useful for cryptography, need not\ncoincide with the ratio above which it\u2019s solvable in polynomial time, but we\ncan at least say that the former is less than or equal to the latter.\n\n  44. Dan Simon Says: Comment #44 April 17th, 2024 at 6:18 pm\n\nFWIW, I\u2019ve believed for years that this was coming. Lattice problems have long\nbeen known to be reducible to DSP, which is a hidden-subgroup problem over one\nof the closest-to-Abelian non-Abelian groups imaginable\u2013and of course hidden\nsubgroups over Abelian groups are quantum-polytime. Moreover, we already knew\nthat DSP has a subexponential-time algorithm (Thanks, Greg #32!), and it\u2019s\njust a weird quirk in the lattice-to-DSP reduction that kept us from putting\nthe two together to get a subexponential-time algorithm for lattice problems.\nFinally, Regev gave a quantum-polytime algorithm for DSP that requires a\nsubset sum oracle, in which the latter isn\u2019t necessary to actually solve the\nproblem\u2013only to clean up some garbage at the end. So the obstacles to a\nquantum-polytime algorithm for lattice problems never seemed at all\nfundamental to me.\n\nInterestingly, Chen includes in his paper a comment along the lines of, \u201cyou\nmay be wondering why this method doesn\u2019t solve DSP directly\u2013well, it turns out\nthat if you try it in one dimension rather than n, you don\u2019t get any\ninformation out.\u201d So I\u2019m now wondering whether just skipping the last step in\nthe lattice-to-DSP reduction, and trying to solve a vector version of DSP\ninstead of the standard one, is the key to making it work...\n\n  45. Scott Says: Comment #45 April 17th, 2024 at 7:22 pm\n\nDan Simon #44: Thanks for the insights! Are you the Dan Simon, of Simon\u2019s\nalgorithm? If so, it\u2019s an honor finally to \u201cmeet\u201d you. I still consider it one\nof the great open problems of quantum complexity theory to find a non-oracular\napplication for your algorithm.\n\n  46. QMA(2) Says: Comment #46 April 17th, 2024 at 8:09 pm\n\nDan Simon #44 \u201cSo the obstacles to a quantum-polytime algorithm for lattice\nproblems never seemed at all fundamental to me\u201d.. statement seems to be loaded\nwithout any caveats. No? Such no restriction algorithms places NP in BQP.\nRight?\n\n  47. Dan Simon Says: Comment #47 April 17th, 2024 at 9:26 pm\n\nScott#45: Honor\u2019s all mine\u2013good luck finding a use for it... :^)\n\nQMA(2) #46: Sorry, I was being terse\u2013by \u201clattice problems\u201d, I meant the\nconstellation of mutually equivalent lattice problems that all the practical-\nlooking post-quantum cryptosystems are based on.

Jenny Says: Comment #48 April 18th, 2024 at 1:06 am\n\nPrasanna #33: Wikipedia defines overpopulation as \u201ca phenomenon in which a\nspecies\u2019 population becomes larger than the carrying capacity of its\nenvironment\u201d. What is the carrying capacity of Mars? Probably zero. So in some\nsense Mars will become overpopulated the moment we land the first human on it!\n\n  49. Scott Says: Comment #49 April 18th, 2024 at 6:54 am\n\nJenny #48: LOL, that might be the best response to the \u201coverpopulation on\nMars\u201d line I\u2019ve heard!\n\n  50. Prasanna Says: Comment #50 April 18th, 2024 at 8:08 am\n\nJenny #48 The year we land the first human on mars successfully is also the\none where we build the QC to do Shor\u2019s algorithm I mean earth\u2019s carrying\ncapacity for useful QC is also currently zero\n\n  51. Daniel Reeves Says: Comment #51 April 18th, 2024 at 11:01 am\n\nFor those confused about how lattice-based encryption works, Veritasium has a\nprimer starting at 18m17s in this video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-UrdExQW0cs?si=glMgmnRYS1gL0nL0&t=1097\n\n(As Scott mentioned last time it came up, that whole video is excellent,\ntotally belying the absurdly clickbait-y title!)\n\n  52. fred Says: Comment #52 April 18th, 2024 at 3:31 pm\n\nSo, if correct, and it\u2019s a problem for which QC seem to have a huge advantage\nover classical machines, just like for prime factorization, does it mean there\ncould be a \u201cpath\u201d between this and prime factorization? (similar to the\nequivalence between all NP-complete problems)\n\n  53. Scott Says: Comment #53 April 18th, 2024 at 3:54 pm\n\nfred #52: There actually is an indirect connection between factoring and\nlattice problems. In Oded Regev\u2019s recent breakthrough paper on factoring using\nquantum circuits of size ~O(n^3/2), for example (one of the first improvements\nover Shor\u2019s algorithm), he points out that his circuits could be improved even\nfurther\u2014to nearly linear size\u2014if there were a fast classical algorithm for\nlattice problems to handle the postprocessing.\n\nI don\u2019t know of any reductions in the other direction, from lattice problems\nto factoring.\n\n  54. QMA(2) Says: Comment #54 April 18th, 2024 at 4:44 pm\n\nScott #53 \u201c..reductions .. from lattice problems to factoring\u201d is a nice\nquestion. Again it should be with a caveat. Or else NP problems reduce to\nfactoring I think. Still good to ask for any other obstructions that will\napply only to LWE flavored problems.\n\n  55. Scott Says: Comment #55 April 18th, 2024 at 4:48 pm\n\nQMA(2) #54: I had in mind GapSVP and the like with approximation ratios that\nput them into classes like NP\u2229coNP and presumably prevent them from being NP-\nhard. Even then we don\u2019t know of reductions from them to purely number-\ntheoretic problems like factoring.\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nYou can use rich HTML in comments!
