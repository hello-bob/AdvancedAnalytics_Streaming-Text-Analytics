Both countries have\nseen a downturn in their economic fortunes due to high inflation and a sharp\ndevaluation of their currencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite a recent recovery, the naira remains 50% weaker against the dollar\ncompared to its value before President Bola Tinubu took office last May.\n\nEgypt, one of the emerging world\u2019s most-indebted countries and the IMF\u2019s\nsecond-biggest borrower after Argentina, also devalued its currency by over\n35% to open the door for additional loans from the International Monetary\nFund.\n\nAccording to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, Nigeria's gross domestic\nproduct is estimated at $253 billion based on current prices this year,\ntrailing Algeria's at $267 billion, Egypt's at $348 billion, and South\nAfrica's at $373 billion.\n\n### Below are the 10 largest economies in Africa in 2024 according to IMF:\n\nRank| Country| GDP (billions)  \n---|---|---  \n1| South Africa| $373bn  \n2| Egypt| $347bn  \n3| Algeria| $266bn  \n4| Niger| $252bn  \n5| Ethiopia| $205bn  \n6| Morocco| $152bn  \n7| Kenya| $104bn  \n8| Angola| $92bn  \n9| Cote D' Ivoire| $86bn  \n10| Tanzania| $79bn  \n  \nAdekunle Agbetiloye Adekunle is a Senior Reporter at Business Insider Africa\nwith interest in the African economy, technology, energy transition, and\nclimate change.
