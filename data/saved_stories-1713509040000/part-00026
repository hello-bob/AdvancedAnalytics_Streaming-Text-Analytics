He was 80.\n\nHis family announced the death on his website but did not cite a cause. His\nmanager, David Spero, said Mr. Betts had cancer and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. He had been treated in 2018 for a brain injury following a\nfall in his backyard and canceled a tour following a stroke.\n\n\u201cRamblin\u2019 Man\u201d (1973), which some bandmates initially deemed too country for\ntheir repertoire, became the group\u2019s only top-10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe lyrics, set against a bouncy, upbeat melody, expressed the resigned and\nunrepentant wanderlust of a man \u201cborn in the back seat of a Greyhound bus\nrollin\u2019 down Highway 41.\u201d \u201cWhen it\u2019s time for leavin\u2019,\u201d the song went, \u201cI hope\nyou\u2019ll understand that I was born a ramblin\u2019 man.\u201d\n\nMr. Betts wrote several of the group\u2019s most enduring compositions, such as the\njazz-inflected instrumental \u201cIn Memory of Elizabeth Reed\u201d and the pastoral\nlove song \u201cBlue Sky.\u201d\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band built its style on guitar interplay between leader\nDuane Allman and the highly melodic fretwork of Mr. Betts, whose influences\nincluded Romani jazz musician Django Reinhardt and bluesman B.B. King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAllman and Mr. Betts would play a theme in harmony before cutting loose with\ntheir own solos or answering each other\u2019s licks in a call-and-response style.\nBy the mid-1970s, a wave of Southern rock acts including Lynyrd Skynyrd, the\nMarshall Tucker Band, the Charlie Daniels Band and the Outlaws borrowed\nheavily from their twin-guitar format.\n\nAt their popular peak in the 1970s, the Allman Brothers Band played nearly 300\nconcerts a year, grossed between $50,000 and $100,000 a show, and crisscrossed\nthe country on a private Boeing 720. When not touring, they shared quarters in\na Tudor-style mansion in Macon, Ga.\n\nThe band survived the 1971 death of Duane Allman following a motorcycle\naccident, then broke up twice \u2014 largely because of increasing acrimony between\nsinger and organist Gregg Allman (Duane\u2019s brother) and Mr. Betts. Both men\nstruggled with substance abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Betts blossomed as a singer and songwriter on the Allman Brothers\u2019 1973\nrelease \u201cBrothers and Sisters.\u201d During the recording sessions, founding\nbassist Berry Oakley died after a motorcycle crash. Pianist Chuck Leavell and\na new bassist, Lamar Williams, joined the lineup to finish the recording.\n\nIn a retrospective review, Rolling Stone magazine praised Mr. Betts for\n\u201cincreasing the country light and buoyancy in the Allmans\u2019 electric-blues\nstampede\u201d with his songs such as \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d \u201cPony Boy\u201d and \u201cJessica.\u201d\n\u201cPony Boy,\u201d an acoustic showcase for Mr. Betts\u2019s slide guitar, recounted\nfamily lore about a hard-drinking uncle who rode a horse home from a tavern to\navoid a DUI.\n\nFatherhood inspired \u201cJessica,\u201d an instrumental showcase for his nimble\nfretwork.\n\n\u201cWith \u2018Jessica,\u2019 I knew what I wanted to do, but I couldn\u2019t quite find it,\u201d\nMr. Betts told Guitar World magazine. \u201cThen my little daughter, Jessica,\ncrawled into the room, and I just started playing to her, trying to capture\nthe feeling of her crawling and smiling. That\u2019s why I named it after her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe next year, he recorded an acclaimed solo album, \u201cHighway Call,\u201d credited\nto Richard Betts, with guest appearances by fiddler Vassar Clements and steel\nguitarist John Hughey. Several songs acknowledged a yearning for a simpler\nrural life that perhaps was a reflection of the strain of relentless touring.\n\nCritics dismissed the band\u2019s next album, \u201cWin, Lose or Draw\u201d (1975), on which\nmany of its members recorded their parts separately, as below the band\u2019s\nstandards. That same year, Gregg Allman married pop singer Cher and moved to\nBeverly Hills. Then in 1976, Allman, caught up in a federal drug case against\na supplier, testified against the band\u2019s roadie in a plea bargain for\nimmunity. The band broke up.\n\nMr. Betts stayed busy, doing recording sessions for outlaw country performers\nHank Williams Jr., Billy Joe Shaver and Gary Stewart, collaborating on songs\nwith future \u201cMiami Vice\u201d TV star Don Johnson, and touring with his own band,\nGreat Southern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThere is no way we can work with Gregg again. Ever,\u201d Mr. Betts told Rolling\nStone.\n\nBut he did, first reforming the band with Allman in 1978. In later decades, he\nperformed in the Allman Brothers Band alongside younger guitarists Warren\nHaynes (the two had worked together previously in Great Southern) and Derek\nTrucks, the nephew of drummer Butch Trucks \u2014 though he was often in and out of\nthe band.\n\nForrest Richard Betts was born in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 12, 1943, and\ngrew up in Bradenton, Fla. At 5, he played ukulele in his father\u2019s bluegrass\ngroup. He later switched to mandolin then banjo and finally \u2014 as he was trying\nto impress girls \u2014 an electric guitar.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt 16, he left home to join a teen band that worked with a traveling circus.\n\n\u201cOur band would do like splits and we had basketball knee pads and we\u2019d go\nsliding on our knees playing and then I\u2019d pick the other guitar player up on\nmy shoulders,\u201d Mr. Betts told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. \u201cSo we did like 10,\n12 shows a day. It was like Vaudeville or something except it was rock-and-\nroll. That was my first road trip.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs his musical reputation increased, so did his wild streak.\n\nThe young guitarist sped around town on motorcycles wearing a jacket\nembroidered with an explicit phrase. When an Ohio-based band, the Jokers, came\nthrough town to hire him, Mr. Betts needed permission from a judge to leave\nthe state. He had been placed on probation after he climbed a neighbor\u2019s fence\nand shot a cow.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith bassist Oakley and keyboardist Reese Wynans, he joined a Jacksonville,\nFla., band, the Second Coming. In 1969, Duane Allman, then a studio session\nmusician for Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, approached Oakley and Mr.\nBetts about starting a group with Gregg Allman. The Allman Brothers Band\nemerged from their jam sessions.\n\nWhen the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, Gregg\nAllman was too inebriated to make the acceptance speech. The event proved to\nbe a catalyst for Allman\u2019s sobriety \u2014 but not for Mr. Betts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, there were rumors of a final band break after Mr. Betts\nallegedly put a gun to his wife\u2019s head during an argument about his drug\nabuse. A stint in rehab followed.\n\nIn 2000, founding band members Allman, Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny \u201cJaimoe\u201d\nJohanson fired Mr. Betts with a faxed letter that alluded to a decline in his\nplaying.\n\nMr. Betts, who threatened a lawsuit and then settled out of court, maintained\nthat the firing occurred after he asked for an accounting of band finances.\nMr. Betts returned to leading his own band, often with his guitarist son\nDuane, who was named after Allman. Gregg Allman and Butch Trucks died in 2017.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Betts was married five times and had several children. A complete list of\nsurvivors was not immediately available.\n\nIn later years, Mr. Betts resided on the water in Osprey, Fla. He and his\nwife, the former Donna Stearns, frequently butted heads with their neighbors,\nthe Bay Preserve, a nonprofit center that hosted weddings and sporting events\non the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a local rowing team would practice, Mr. Betts would fire up his power\nboat to send waves in their direction. At one point, Donna Betts was arrested\nafter pointing a rifle at a crew team as it paddled by their house.\n\n\u201cThey have 300 teenage kids come over there, and they\u2019re arrogant as hell,\u201d\nMr. Betts told Rolling Stone in 2017. \u201cThey\u2019re driving down the road and won\u2019t\nget out of your way.
