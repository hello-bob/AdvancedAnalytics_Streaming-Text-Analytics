April 2024.\n\nNew York\u2019s intermediate appellate courts rarely overturn criminal cases,\nwhether by reversing or remitting them.^1 In extraordinarily rare\ncircumstances, these courts may not only overturn a case but also reassign it\nto a different lower court judge than the one who presided over the initial\nproceedings. Such reassignments, which we refer to as Reassignments to a\nDifferent Judge (RDJs), serve as a red flag, suggesting the possibility of\njudicial impropriety that goes beyond getting the law wrong.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\nFact Sheet (PDF)\n\n1\\.

Conclusion: RDJs Require Close Reading of the Appellate Decision\n\nAppendix: Data & Methodology\n\n# 1\\. Examples of RDJs\n\nClick the boxes below for examples of RDJs.\n\nIn People v. Suazo,^2 a unanimous panel of four appellate judges determined\nthat Judge Kenneth C. Holder had \u201cimprovidently exercised his discretion\u201d to\npreside over the suppression hearing, the hearing that determines whether the\npolice obtained evidence in accordance with, or in violation of, a defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional rights.\n\nJudge Holder\u2019s assessment of the credibility of one witness, a detective, was\n\u201ccritical\u201d to the outcome of the hearing. The detective was also the spouse of\nJudge Holder\u2019s law clerk\u2014the person whose \u201cduties and responsibilities are\nmost intimately connected with the judge\u2019s own exercise of the judicial\nfunction,\u201d in the words of the appellate court. Judge Holder decided to keep\nthe case and rule on the credibility of his own clerk\u2019s spouse.\n\nIn reassigning the case to a different judge, the appellate judges noted that\nJudge Holder \u201cshould have recused himself,\u201d and in choosing not to do so he\n\u201ccreated, at a minimum, the appearance that [he] could not be impartial\u201d in\nassessing the detective\u2019s credibility.\n\nIn People v. Leggett,^3 a unanimous panel of five appellate judges found that\nJudge Robert A. Neary engaged in \u201cpervasive denigration\u201d\u2014repeatedly and\nunfairly criticizing the defense attorney in front of the jury. The appellate\ncourt deemed Judge Neary\u2019s behavior so severe that it undermined the\ndefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\n\nIn one instance, the defense attorney objected during the prosecution\u2019s\nclosing argument, to which Judge Neary responded by stating, \u201cWould you behave\nlike a professional, please and not a clown.\u201d In another instance, Judge Neary\nadmonished defense counsel, in the jury\u2019s presence, \u201cby asking him whether he\nwished to \u2018behave like a gentleman\u2019 or \u2018[be] escorted out.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalling this and other comments \u201csimply inexcusable,\u201d the appellate court\nreversed the case and ordered that a new trial take place before a different\njudge.\n\nIn People v. Ward,^4 three appellate judges determined that the \u201ccumulative\neffect\u201d of Judge Vincent Del Giudice\u2019s \u201crulings and jury instructions,\u201d along\nwith the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at trial, deprived the defendant of his right to\na fair trial. The appellate court explained that Judge Del Giudice\u2019s\n\u201cintemperate remarks\u201d necessitated a new trial to be presided over by a\ndifferent judge. The appellate court quoted the following remarks:\n\n> Sir, you\u2019re a murderer, all right. You lie, you cheat, you do everything you\n> can to get over on society. ... Notwithstanding your nefarious membership in\n> an organization, all right, it\u2019s clear to this Court that not only are you\n> guilty beyond all doubt, not beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond a shadow\n> of a doubt. ... You are just trying to guild the lilly [sic], if you\n> understand what that means, all right. You\u2019re guilty. There is no question\n> about it. ... [Y]our whole life you never, you\u2019ve never done anything\n> worthwhile in your entire life, only been a scourge on society. ...You\u2019re a\n> scourge, a real scourge on society. ... You should be excised from the body\n> politic and be incarcerated for as long as possible.\n\n# 2\\. Different Types of Judicial Conduct Can Trigger a RDJ\n\nWhile RDJs indicate judicial impropriety, the specific reasons for such\nimpropriety, and the types of conduct involved, vary.\n\nWhen an appellate court overturns a case, it does not automatically reassign\nit to a new judge. As discussed in the section \u201cRDJs Are Extraordinarily\nRare,\u201d below, the overturning of a case on appeal is a rare occurrence, and\nreassignment is even rarer.\n\nMoreover, a finding of improper judicial conduct does not necessarily result\nin reassignment. Appellate courts frequently cite a judge\u2019s \u201cimprovident\u201d\nexercise of discretion,^5 \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion,^6 or other \u201cimproper\u201d\nactions^7 as reasons, either wholly or in part, for overturning a case.\nHowever, many such findings do not lead to the reassignment of the case.\n\nThere appears to be no articulable legal framework that specifies which\nimproper judicial conduct mandates reassignment. Among the 66 cases identified\nas RDJs, the appellate courts ordered reassignments in 50 cases due to a range\nof judicial actions, ranging from denigrating the defense counsel to coercing\nguilty pleas. In the remaining 16 RDJ cases, the appellate courts did not\nclearly articulate the reason for reassignment.^8\n\nHowever, the body of RDJs we have identified suggests that, in a significant\nnumber of instances, reassignment occurs when a judge\u2019s improper conduct\nevinces bias, prejudice, or otherwise creates an appearance of bias.\n\n# 3\\. RDJs Are Extraordinarily Rare\n\nOne reason for the rarity of RDJs is that intermediate appellate courts rarely\noverturn cases.^9\n\nFigure 1: Intermediate Appeal Outcomes in NY Criminal Cases, 2007-2023\n\nOf the 49,830 appellate criminal decisions in 2007-2023, only 66 decisions\nreassigned an overturned case to a different judge. This constitutes 1% of all\nreversed and remitted cases, or 0.1% of all cases. Given that only about 7.5%\nof New York felony convictions are appealed,^10 many cases never undergo\nscrutiny by appellate judges for potential improper judicial decision-making\nthat could warrant a reversal, let alone a reassignment.\n\nRDJ rates are relatively uniform across the intermediate appellate courts,\nwith two notable exceptions: the Appellate Division of the Second Department,\nwhich utilizes reassignment more often than its counterparts, albeit still\nvery rarely, and the Appellate Term of the First Department, which has not\nmade an RDJ finding in 17 years.\n\nFigure 2: RDJ Rates Are Extraordinarily Low and Vary by Intermediate Court\n\n# 4\\. Findings: RDJs By Judge\n\nThe table below lists all 66 cases reassigned in New York State from 2007 to\n2023. Considering the variable and fact-specific nature of these cases, we\ninclude a relevant quote and a link to the appellate opinion for each decision\nin our dataset for convenient access.\n\nTable 1: RDJs By Judge\n\n# 5\\. Conclusion: RDJs Require Close Reading of the Appellate Decision\n\nIn our previous report, Excessive Sentencers,^11 we used appellate decisions\nto calculate the number of times a judge engaged in excessive sentencing and\nthe number of years reduced from their sentences. Unlike the central metric in\nthat report, excessive sentence findings, the reassignment metric is not as\neasily quantifiable and requires close scrutiny by interested parties seeking\nto assess judicial decision-making and impacts.\n\nTo help readers understand these decisions, we include links to them and\nselected quotes in our table of findings. We encourage decision-makers and the\npublic to review these decisions as part of analyzing the RDJ metric.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend obtaining other case documents, such as transcripts\nand appellate briefs from the appellate docket, to gain a more detailed\nunderstanding of the conduct that prompted the appellate court to reassign the\ncase.\n\n# Appendix: Data & Methodology\n\nOur dataset includes appellate decisions issued by all four Appellate\nDivisions and both Appellate Terms from 2007 to 2023, covering all\nintermediate appellate decisions in New York State. These appellate decisions\nare publicly accessible via a variety of legal databases.\n\nEach appellate decision provides relevant information about the lower court\nproceeding, including:\n\n  * The county where the case was litigated;\n\n  * The date of the appellate decision;\n\n  * The appellate court that issued the decision;\n\n  * The name of the lower court judge who presided over the appealed case;\n\n  * The outcome ordered by the appellate court, be it a reversal, remittal, modification, or affirmance; and\n\n  * Whether the appellate court reassigned the case to a different judge upon reversal or remittal.\n\nOf 49,830 criminal appellate decisions between 2007 and 2023, we identify 108\n(0.2%) decisions that contain language relating to reassignment upon reversal\nor remittal. We remove 39 decisions that contain language relating to\nreassignment but which do not actually involve reassigning cases,^12 leaving\nus with 69 decisions in which the appellate courts ordered reassignment.\n\nIn three cases,^13 the appellate court reassigned a case because the\nprosecutor failed to abide by their commitment concerning a sentencing\nrecommendation upon a guilty plea. Based on precedent originating from the\nUnited States Supreme Court,^14 New York courts reassign such cases to a\ndifferent judge upon remittal for resentencing. Because these cases definitely\ndo not relate to judicial impropriety, we exclude them from our dataset.^15\n\nWe obtain judges\u2019 statuses (active or retired) through the New York State\nUnified Court System\u2019s Judicial Directory.^16 We consider judges with profiles\non that website to be currently active and those without profiles to be\nretired.\n\nIn three of the 66 cases where reassignment was ordered by the discretion of\nthe appellate court, the lower court judges had already retired when the\nappeal decision was published. These cases do not indicate that the appellate\ncourt uses reassignment for administrative purposes (unrelated to judicial\nconduct, discretion, or decision of the original judge), since, when original\njudges retire, cases are automatically reassigned without the need for\nappellate judges to specify a reassignment, as they did in these instances.\nTherefore, it appears that the appellate court was unaware of the judges\u2019\nretirements when it issued these decisions.\n\n  1. A remittal, or remand, usually means that the lower court must hear part of the case again, for example by conducting a hearing or by resentencing the defendant.
