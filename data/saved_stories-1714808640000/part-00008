In a nutshell, it hypothesizes that\neverything in the universe (stars, planets, nebulae, etc.) becomes so far\napart that it all just cools down to a point where equilibrium is reached, and\nnothing new would be created. This isn't a particularly exciting way for the\nuniverse to go out. Perhaps a much more eventful fate for the universe is the\nbig crunch, which hypothesizes that the observed expansion reverses and\neverything starts moving towards each other, until it all meets in one big\ncrunch. According to Wikipedia, the big crunch isn't very likely to happen.\nBut only time will tell. Regardless, both ideas lend themselves nicely to\ninteresting internet analogies.\n\n## The Heat Death of the Internet\n\nThe article linked in this submission, titled The Heat Death of the Internet,\napplies the idea of the heat death of the universe to the internet. The\nauthor, Gregory Bennett, lists a series of internet situations that convey\nthis analogy, such as\n\n> You want to order from a local restaurant, but you need to download a third-\n> party delivery app, even though you plan to pick it up yourself. The prices\n> and menu on the app are different to what you saw in the window. When you\n> download a second app the prices are different again. You ring the\n> restaurant directly and it says the number is no longer in service. You go\n> to the restaurant and order in person. You mention that their website has\n> the wrong number and the woman behind the counter says they have to contact\n> the company who designed the site for changes, which will cost them, but\n> most people just order through an app anyway.\n\nand\n\n> You want to watch the trailer for an upcoming movie on YouTube but you first\n> have to sit through an ad. Then you sit through a preview for the trailer\n> itself. Then you watch the trailer, which is literally another ad. When it\n> ends, it cues up a new trailer, with a new ad at the start of it.\n\nand\n\n> The first page of Google results are links to pages that have scraped other\n> pages for information from other pages that have been scraped for\n> information. All the sources seem to link back to one another. There is no\n> origin. The photos on the page look weird. The hands are disfigured. There\n> is no image credit.\n\nI think that Bennett, in essence, was attempting to emphasize that the\ninternet is becoming so fragmented with different services, polluted with\nadvertisements, and confusing to navigate that any user of the internet can no\nlonger easily make progress towards their goal. This analogy between the\nuniverse and the internet fits rather nicely. An internet user's ability to\nmake progress towards their goal could be considered analogous to the\nuniverse's processes that increase entropy (e.g., star formation). And both\nthe internet and the universe are showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n## The Big Crunch of the Internet\n\nBut maybe the internet has other forces at play. In one of the examples,\nBennett references ChatGPT:\n\n> Your coworker sends you a PowerPoint pack to support a presentation you are\n> giving to the executive committee, but you can\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\n> You call them over Zoom and they tell you they used ChatGPT to write it. You\n> point out that it is near-unreadable, and they ask what specifically is\n> wrong with it. You mention that, for starters, there are too many words on\n> each slide. They tell you they\u2019ll take care of it. They send you a new pack\n> within the hour saying they asked ChatGPT to remove 30% of the text. It\n> makes even less sense. You tell them you\u2019ll just rewrite it yourself.\n\nAnd this got me thinking - ChatGPT (or more generally, any of the popular,\ngenerative large language models) is trained from years and years of\nhistorical internet data: terabytes of everything that we've ever written,\npublished, and shared on the internet, given to the model to \"learn\" in its\nmodel weights. Speculating on these model sizes is difficult due to their\nproprietary nature, but it is probably safe to say that the sizes of these\nmodels (hundreds of GB) are much smaller than the sizes of their training data\n(tens of TBs).\n\nSticking with our universe-based analogies, this could be thought of as the\n\"big crunch\" of the internet: terabytes of internet data being compressed into\na single generative large language model.\n\n## The Big Crunchy Heat Death?\n\nThe universe doesn't fair too well in either case of heat death or big crunch.\nLuckily for the universe, only one outcome can happen.\n\nBut for the internet, we seem to be seeing both heat death and big crunch\nhappening at once. And to make matters worse, the big crunch's language models\nare generative, meaning that the output of these language models can be put\nback on the internet. This is what I think Bennett was getting at in the\nquoted example with ChatGPT. Not only does this referential loop pollute the\ninternet, but it may even make language models less useful over time.\n\nDoes this mean that the internet is doomed in a big crunchy heat death? My\nguess is that probably not. Intuition tells me that progress in these types of\nareas tend to be a series of actions and reactions, and that it is only a\nmatter of time before new innovations come along that help mitigate the\n\"crunches\" and \"heat deaths\". Of course, I don't have a clue of what or when,\nbut fortunately for us, the need is high, and necessity is the mother of\ninvention.\n\n5805 / 50,000 characters\n\n##### Mentions\n\nTextData\n\nTextData is a social platform for collaboratively creating, sharing, and\nlearning from wiki-style communities.
