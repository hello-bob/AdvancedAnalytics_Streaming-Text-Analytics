Scientists are exploring if it could have a\nsimilar effect on humans\n\nFri, 03 May, 2024 - 02:00\n\nHelen O\u2019Callaghan\n\nMichel Samson turns 80 this month, and his goal is to change the trajectory of\nhis life.\n\nAt 90 or even 100 years old, he\u2019d like to be able to do household chores, have\ngood grip strength, get up off the floor without help, and put his luggage in\nthe overhead compartment of a plane.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in changing the curve of my life. For most people, as they get\nolder, their health starts to fail. Their quality of life isn\u2019t ideal. I\nbelieve it\u2019s possible to change the trajectory of the last decades of one\u2019s\nlife.\u201d\n\nBased in Kentucky, Samson, a violinist who taught at the University of\nLouisville, tells the Irish Examiner that he\u2019s interested in increasing his\nhealth span: the number of years he stays healthy.\n\nHe has been taking Rapamycin for the past five years, a drug popular in the US\nfor promoting longevity and anti-ageing.\n\n\u201cI see Rapamycin as a second-level intervention,\u201d says Samson, whose first\nintervention is exercise.\n\nHe\u2019s convinced his weekly 5mg dose of Rapamycin puts him ahead of peers who\nalso exercise.\n\n\u201cI go to a gym frequented by a lot of people my age. And I\u2019m just more limber.\nI\u2019m more awake in my mental capacity. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s conceivable I\u2019d be\nlike that without Rapamycin.\u201d\n\nRapamycin is FDA-approved for kidney-transplant rejection, cardiac stent use,\nand the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare,\nprogressive condition that causes cysts to form in the lungs, kidneys, and\nlymphatic system.\n\nA prescription-only medicine, in Ireland Rapamycin is sold under the brand\nname Rapamune.\n\nHere, it is authorised by the European Medicines Agency for kidney-transplant\npatients and for people with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.\n\nHowever, the HPRA (Health Products Regulatory Authority) says there are\n\u201ccertain clinical situations\u201d when \u2018off-label\u2019 use of a medicine \u201cmay be\njudged in the best interests of the patient, on the basis of available\nevidence, and such decisions rest with the registered healthcare\nprofessional\u201d.\n\nOff-label use of authorised medicines is outside the HPRA remit.\n\nMatt Kaeberlein, an affiliate professor at the University of Washington and a\nformer director at the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute, was a\nresearcher on a paper published last year on off-label use of Rapamycin.\n\n\u201cSeveral physicians are now prescribing Rapamycin off-label as a preventative\ntherapy to maintain health span,\u201d the paper reported.\n\n\u201cI think Rapamycin is currently the best candidate drug we have that has\nlikely benefits for ageing,\u201d Kaeberlein says, and he outlines the\nramifications of Rapamycin, an inexpensive drug, now being off-patent.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies don\u2019t want to invest in [costly] trials, though\nthere\u2019s a lot of data to say we should for age-related diseases.\u201d\n\nBacteria discovery\n\nRapamycin was collected by scientists in the 1960s from Easter Island, a\nremote tropical island also called Rapa Nui.\n\n\u201cThey [found] several strains of unique bacteria that were unknown to\nscience,\u201d says Robert Lufkin, a physician and professor at USC Keck School of\nMedicine in California.\n\n\u201cOne of the bacteria secreted a compound that had unusual health and\nbiological properties never seen before.... Rapamycin.\u201d\n\nLufkin\u2019s focus is the applied science of longevity and he takes Rapamycin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt better. However, I\u2019m doing many new lifestyle changes and\nit\u2019s difficult to attribute the benefits to any one intervention,\u201d he says.\n\nLufkin, author of Lies I Taught in Medical School: How Conventional Medicine\nIs Making You Sicker and What You Can Do to Save Your Own Life, says Rapamycin\nacts on a molecule called mTOR, a protein present in almost all animal cells,\nfrom yeast to human beings. mTOR, says Lufkin, is \u201carguably the single most\nimportant signalling protein in all of biology\u201d.\n\nWhen TOR senses the presence of nutrients, it tells the cell to grow. It also\nturns up inflammation.\n\n\u201cIf no nutrients are detected, mTOR switches the other way. It turns off cell\ngrowth, it turns off inflammation, and it turns up a repair system called\nautophagy.\u201d\n\nLufkin points to what he calls \u201cone of the most exciting theories of longevity\nand ageing\u201d: That, at its most basic, ageing is driven by mTOR over-\nactivation.\n\n\u201cmTOR is turned on too much, there\u2019s too much cell growth and cell\nproliferation, too much inflammation.\u201d Rapamycin can target this over-\nactivity, says Lufkin. It works on mTOR and \u201cspecifically turns mTOR down\u201d.\n\nDr Brad Stanfield is about to start recruiting patients for a trial looking at\nhow Rapamycin affects human muscle performance.\n\nA New Zealand-based GP, Stanfeld says that if mTOR is over-activated, it\nblocks the separate process of autophagy; basically, a cell-clearance process.\n\n\u201cThink of it like our muscles hoarding all these old, damaged proteins and\ncomponents. By using Rapamycin intermittently, we switch off mTOR and allow\nautophagy to happen, so that our muscles can clear away these old, damaged\ncomponents.\u201d\n\nExcitement around Rapamycin\u2019s anti-ageing potential has come from animal\nstudies that have repeatedly shown benefits for a wide range of age-related\ndiseases across multiple species. Studies have reported increased lifespan in\nlaboratory organisms, including yeast, worms, and mice.\n\nLufkin and other longevity medics believe if we can change certain disease\nprocesses, we can increase lifespan. And, of course, health span.\n\nRapamycin has shown numerous health-span benefits in rodents, including lower\ncancer incidence, improved cognitive, kidney and intestinal function,\npreservation of tendons, preservation of ovarian function, and protection\nagainst hearing loss.\n\n\u201cOver and over again, when Rapamycin is tested in mice, it extends lifespan by\nover 20%,\u201d says Stanfield, who believes that it\u2019s vital to determine if\nRapamycin can offer these benefits to humans.\n\n\u2018Very promising\u2019\n\nRose Anne Kenny is regius professor of medicine at Trinity College Dublin,\nwhere she heads up the ageing research programme.\n\nShe is cautiously positive about Rapamycin.\n\n\u201cOf all the supplements [for anti-ageing], that one shows most promise. But it\nhas side effects and it hasn\u2019t been approved by the FDA. It\u2019s used in oncology\ntreatment, and the way it works in oncology is very similar to the way it\u2019s\nanticipated to work in slowing down ageing.\n\n\u201cIt looks very, very promising, but we need clinical trials to weigh up the\nbenefits and the side effects. And is it going to have an effect on ageing\nmore than getting good sleep and reducing stress?\u201d asks Kenny, author of Age\nProof\u2014The New Science of Living a Longer and Healthier Life, who, on the\nmorning we speak, went for a cold-water swim in the Forty Foot.\n\n(Cold water, she says, benefits a range of systems involved in the ageing\nprocess. \u201cNoradrenaline, a critical neurotransmitter, rises fourfold on cold\nwater exposure, and it\u2019s released in brain areas that control emotions,\nconcentration and memory).\n\nKaeberlein estimates that the number of off-label users of Rapamycin for\nhealth-span reasons in the US is more than 10,000. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s over 50,000\nyet, but now there are a couple of telehealth Rapamycin providers, it\u2019s\npossible,\u201d he says.\n\nA Rapamycin user himself, he first took it for adhesive capsulitis (frozen\nshoulder). \u201cIt was extremely painful. I couldn\u2019t sleep, or throw a ball with\nmy son. My doctor said there was nothing I could do, just get back to physical\ntraining and it\u2019d probably go away in a year,\u201d says the 53-year-old.\n\n\u201cI realised this was a chronic inflammatory condition of the shoulder capsule.\nI knew Rapamycin was very potent at knocking down inflammation in animal\nstudies, and that it was pretty safe in the doses people were taking [5-6mg a\nweek].\u201d\n\nWithin two weeks of taking it, he saw a decline in pain and improvement in\nmobility. \u201cBy the end of 12 weeks, I was 95% back to my full range of motion.\nFor me, it was pretty convincing that, at least for some, Rapamycin can have a\nbig benefit for quality of life.\u201d\n\nKaeberlein, who is also CEO of Optispan, takes Rapamycin in cycles of 12 weeks\nand breaks for six to eight months.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed anything profound [since that first time], but then I\nhaven\u2019t had any severe issues. I do a lot of resistance training. I gradually\nget more aches and pains in my joints when I lift weights.\n\n\u201cAt the point where it\u2019s bothering me, I take Rapamycin. My perception is the\naches and pains go down.\u201d\n\nWith a background in molecular biology, Daniel Tawfik is co-founder of\nHealthspan, which aims to \u201cprovide medication that can increase health-span\u201d.\nHe had seen a \u201creal disconnect\u201d between what is happening in the clinical\ncommunity and the research community. \u201cResearch showing positive effects of\n[some] drugs isn\u2019t making it in to the clinical frontline.\u201d\n\nWhen his wife\u2019s cancer relapsed, she had a stem-cell transplant and was\nprescribed Rapamycin.\n\nIntrigued by Rapamycin\u2019s recalibration of mTOR over-activity back to normal\nlevels \u2014 and that it seemed from research to be \u201ca deterrent against the\nprogression of age-related diseases\u201d \u2014 Tawfik says: \u201cIt gives us a foundation\nto say there\u2019s something here.\u201d\n\nMost of Healthspan\u2019s 3,000 patients are on Rapamycin for longevity and health-\nspan.\n\nTawfik\u2019s telehealth service, costing $105 monthly, aims to make a drug like\nRapamycin available and assure safety by measuring patient progress. \u201cAll\npatients get blood work done at the beginning, and we notify them every four\nto six weeks to get further blood work done.\n\n\u201cOn an individual level, we\u2019re ensuring there\u2019s no immune suppression. It\u2019s\nvery rare we see [it]. Sometimes there can be [metabolic] effects: elevated\nlipids or glucose. Monitoring allows us to fine-tune the dosage.\u201d\n\nTawfik says 50% of clients report no benefits from Rapamycin. \u201cThey don\u2019t\nexperience any monumental shift.\u201d\n\nBut he adds: \u201cIn their blood work, we may be seeing major indicators of good\nmetabolic health, indicating someone\u2019s in a healthy state and going in the\nright direction.\u201d\n\nAnd feedback from patients with systemic inflammation or \u201csome inflammatory\nissue\u201d is very positive. \u201cIf they have some condition that\u2019s clearly related\nto mTOR over-activity, which elevates inflammatory signalling \u2014\nosteoarthritis, psoriasis \u2014 these patients tell us they feel better. Rapamycin\nis solving an active issue for them.\u201d\n\nTawfik, 39, has been taking Rapamycin for almost four years. \u201cNot to feel\nbetter specifically, but to slow down the cellular dysfunction that\naccelerates ageing.\u201d\n\nHealthspan doesn\u2019t prescribe to 15-20% of clients, and Tawfik cautions that\nno-one should take Rapamycin \u201clike an aspirin\u201d: You need to be monitored under\nmedical supervision.\n\nKaeberlein says it\u2019s too early to say how Rapamycin\u2019s anti-ageing promise will\nplay out.\n\n\u201cThere may be gradual build-up of momentum, where we begin to see [much more]\nmainstream use of it, rather than just for transplant patients. There\u2019s a\ngrowing population of people using it off-label and under supervision. What\nhappens may depend on the data from those individuals.\u201d\n\nWhatever else, Kaeberlein believes it\u2019s time to change how we approach health.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve approached it from the lens of disease. Our healthcare\nsystem is a reactive disease-care system. We need to change the paradigm and\nwork on keeping people healthy. Targeting the biology of ageing needs to be\npart of that toolkit.\u201d\n\nRapamycin may become a valuable element of that toolkit for millions\nworldwide.\n\nWe just don\u2019t know yet.\n\nResearch on potential \u2018anti-ageing\u2019 drug\n\nA paper published in 2023 that evaluated off-label Rapamycin use to promote\nhealthspan in 333 adults found general quality-of-life improvement after\nstarting the drug.\n\nThree out of four reported improvements in health, happiness, brain function,\nfeelings of youthfulness, confidence, calmness, anxiety, and generalised aches\nand pains.\n\n\u201cGreater than fivefold more Rapamycin users agreed [with the statement] that\n\u2018family/friends have commented that I look good\u2019 than disagreed\u2019,\u201d the paper\nreported.\n\nOn side effects, the study found that the only significantly more prevalent\nside effect, compared to 172 non-Rapamycin users, was mouth sores.\n\n\u201c[This] makes sense, given that mouth sores are the most common side effect\nseen at high doses in organ transplant patients. Potentially more interesting\nis the significant improvements in pain, depression, and anxiety, as well as\nreduced risk of severe or long covid,\u201d says Professor Matt Kaeberlein.\n\nResearchers acknowledged the study is small and that care must be taken \u201cnot\nto over-interpret the data\u201d.\n\nMore research in the pipeline:\n\nNew Zealand-based researcher Dr Brad Stanfield is starting a trial to see if\nRapamycin can slow or reverse age-related muscle function decline.\n\n\u201cWe lose about one per cent of our strength per year from the age of 40 \u2013 that\ndecline accelerates from age 60. Overall, it\u2019s hoped that by using Rapamycin\nintermittently, we can restore the mTOR balance and improve muscle strength.\u201d\n\nDentist Jonathan An, based at the University of Washington School of\nDentistry, is about to enrol the first participants in a trial examining the\npotential benefit of Rapamycin for periodontal disease.\n\n\u201cGiven the correlation between periodontal disease and other age-related\nconditions \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes \u2014\ntreating periodontal disease in older adults could have broader positive\neffects on age-related health globally,\u201d An tells the Irish Examiner.\n\n### Read More\n\nHow The Fabulous Pharmacist wants to end the shame around women's bodies\n\nwith\n\nMore in this section\n\nThe Mother Wound: Breaking the cycle of generational trauma among women\n\nNatural Health: What can I take for my seasonal cold?\n\nWhy it's critical to replenish those important B-vitamins\n\n## I thought my pain was a pulled muscle \u2014 it was ovarian cancer and I had a\nfull hysterectomy\n\nREAD NOW\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n## Lifestyle Newsletter\n\nThe best food, health, entertainment and lifestyle content from the\nirishexaminer.com, direct to your inbox every Friday.\n\nPlease click here for our privacy statement.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * Fears EU Migration Pact will lead to detention of 'vulnerable groups'\n\n6 minutes ago\n\n  * Cork's dirty water: Call for voucher system for affected households\n\n6 minutes ago\n\n  * Georgian protesters against \u2018Russia-style\u2019 law mark Orthodox Easter with vigil\n\n55 minutes ago\n\n  * End of the road for Wanderly Wagon: Last Travellers living in barrel-top wagon settle down\n\nan hour ago\n\nOutdoor Trails\n\nDiscover the great outdoors on Ireland's best walking trails\n\nOutdoor Trails\n\n###### FOLLOW IRISH EXAMINER\n\nLifestyle Newsletter\n\nThe best food, health, entertainment and lifestyle content from the Irish\nExaminer, direct to your inbox.\n\nSign up\n\n### Family Notices\n\nnews\n\n  * Ireland\n  * Munster\n  * Court & Crime\n  * Spotlight\n  * World\n\nsport\n\n  * GAA\n  * Soccer\n  * Rugby\n  * Racing\n  * Golf\n  * Other Sports\n  * Podcasts\n\nbusiness\n\n  * Economy\n  * Companies\n  * Munster Business\n  * Farming\n  * Technology\n\nopinion\n\n  * Columnists\n  * Comment & Analysis\n  * Our View\n  * Your View\n\nHelp\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Brand Safety\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Push Notification Preferences\n  * Mobile\n  * Subscriptions\n\nInfo\n\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Home delivery\n  * RSS\n  * Newsletters\n  * Place ad\n  * Who We Are\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 Examiner Echo Group Limited, Linn Dubh, Assumption Road, Blackpool, Cork.\nRegistered in Ireland: 523712.\n\nCookie Policy Privacy Policy Brand Safety FAQ Help Contact Us Terms and\nConditions\n\n\u00a9 Examiner Echo Group Limited\n\n## We value your privacy\n\nWe and our 92 partners store and access information on your device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies.
