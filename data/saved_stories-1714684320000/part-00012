Enabled by recent\n> developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes\n> relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather\n> than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain\n> applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph\n> problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal\n> level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated\n> datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software\n> tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in\n> fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we\n> introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs\n> of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node\n> clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to\n> be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of \"shapes\" that money\n> laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new\n> criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques,\n> software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain\n> insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find\n> immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new\n> standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies\n> and other financial networks.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Finance (q-fin.GN)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.19109 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.19109v2 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.19109arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Muhua Xu [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 21:19:41 UTC (472 KB) [v2]\nWed, 1 May 2024 04:55:30 UTC (473 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Shape of Money Laundering: Subgraph\nRepresentation Learning on the Blockchain with the Elliptic2 Dataset, by\nClaudio Bellei and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs q-fin q-fin.GN\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
