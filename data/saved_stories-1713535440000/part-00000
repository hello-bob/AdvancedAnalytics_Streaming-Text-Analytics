And what about\nthose knobs that have detents, set in stone at the time of manufacturing? Oh,\nand those knobs that let you jog left to right and then snap back to center \u2014\nthat can\u2019t be modified...right? Well, you likely know where this is going, and\nin the video below the break, [scottbez1] shows off a new open source haptic\ninput knob that can be all of these things with just some configuration\nchanges!\n\nThe list of possibilities is long: virtual snap points, virtual spring\nloading, virtual detents, virtual end points. It\u2019s a virtual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of\nconfiguration options that make this haptic smart knob a one stop shop for all\nof your knob needs. This is all possible because the knob contains a high\nresolution magnetic encoder chip that has a single degree resolution. The\nsensor is coupled, through software, to a brushless DC motor. The round LCD\ngives visual feedback as well.\n\nAs [Myself] on the Hackaday Discord channel noted, having configurable spacing\nand strength for detents, springs, and stops, is nothing short of incredible.\nBeing able to reconfigure the knob at-will means that it can become context\nsensitive. It\u2019s wonderfully unique and it\u2019s open source, so you can make your\nown with the information available at GitHub.\n\nAnd according to its creator, the only thing the Haptic Smart Knob can\u2019t do is\ndo your taxes or blend your margarita. Well, it\u2019s open source, so perhaps some\nof our more enterprising readers can submit just the right pull request.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Hackaday\u2019s first Motorized Volume Knob feature, but it might be one\nof the neatest we have seen so far. Thanks to [mattvenn] on the Hackaday\nDiscord server for the great tip!\n\nPosted in hardware, Peripherals HacksTagged BLDC, haptic, haptic input, input\nknob, jog wheel, lcd, scroll wheel, strain gauge\n\n## 64 thoughts on \u201cHaptic Smart Knob Does Several Jobs\u201d\n\n  1.

It has one knob, which you use to\nset the tone controls, volume, input source, radio channel... except you can\u2019t\nnavigate it while driving the car because you have to know which state the\ndevice is in by looking at it, so it\u2019s frankly useless.

For instance, default usage is volume control (no need to look at the\ndisplay) and on long press you go into the menu and the parameter that you\u2019re\ngoing to change is called back to you (for instance balance) short press\n(fader), etc. long press or timeout gets you back to the default volume\ncontrol.\n\nReport comment\n\n      2.

It\u2019s the freakiest thing to turn it off and realize you weren\u2019t\nactually moving anything on the touchpad, it was all in your head. When I\nfirst powered off my Mac and clicked the mouse I thought it was some sort of\nlocking mechanism to protect the trackpad from falling in, like I\u2019ve seen some\nother PCs do, only to find out the click is entirely simulation. Even the\nconvincing \u201cdeep\u201d click is entirely motors and software.

The trackpad is pretty easy to take out \u2014 you pretty much just\ntake the bottom case off, unplug the trackpad cable (carefully peeling it away\nfrom the adhesive), remove the screws, and then open the laptop to pull it out\nthe top.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the first things you do when replacing the battery:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Touch+Bar+2017+Battery+Replacement/125636\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      2. no says:\n\nMarch 13, 2022 at 8:43 pm\n\nThat\u2019s just a haptic vibrator no? This thing uses a BLDC to provide anti-\nforce. It can physically stop the knob from turning.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n        1. scottbez1 says:\n\nMarch 14, 2022 at 9:39 am\n\nYeah. This is actually providing \u201creal\u201d torque feedback, so it\u2019s a little\ndifferent (although the click when you push down on the knob is \u201cfake\u201d by\ncomparison).\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that as you make the detents more fine-grained, a purely\nproportional function from angular error (between the desired detent point and\nthe current point) to restorative torque stops working well. The errors are\nmuch smaller, but if you turn up the proportional gain (or normalize it to\npercent error rather than angle error) you can get strange or even unstable\nbehavior due to sensor noise/error or miscalibration between the encoder and\nthe motor\u2019s electrical angle.\n\nSo what I\u2019ve done is increase derivative gain for fine detents, which acts\nmore like vibrator motor \u201cfake\u201d haptics at that point: since the error changes\ndirection when you pass the halfway point, you get a short but large spike in\nthe derivative, so you get a corresponding quick pulse of torque. With fine-\ngrained virtual detents there\u2019s not much restorative torque or spring action,\nbut you at least still get a haptic click as you pass each detent.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.

Tim says:\n\nMarch 14, 2022 at 7:55 pm\n\nI worked in TV for a decade and this was exactly what I thought of when I saw\nand heard it. There are differences in this device compared to the systems I\nsaw used by both Sony and Pannasonic in their gear.\n\nThe \u201cfancy\u201d versions would engage fixed magnetic end stop detents for the\nShuttle mode. I used these on the Sony C Format machines (well older than me\nat the time). The detents would \u201cmagically\u201d appear when engaging Shuttle mode\n(back-stop-forward with speed control). But the control lacked any friction\nfor Shuttle and did not have a simple push control on the knob itself to\nchange modes or use as a stop (tape would stop on mode change in both control\nversions). Interestingly, if you held the knob against the Shuttle detents,\nthe magenets would occaionally release and engage allow the knob to roll on a\nfraction of a rotation. I think this was haptic feedback to say you can\u2019t go\nany faster, Captain.\n\nThe \u201ccheaper\u201d controls were a physical press that would click on/off (like a\npen) to engage a cam wheel for the Shuttle detents. This was how they changed\nfrom Shuttle mode (including some friction on the rotation) to Jog mode\n(single frame per sensing tick and no detents, completely free wheeling). The\nknob would physically raise or lower depending on mode, so you could tell what\nmode it was in by touch. These were common on the earlier Betacam and lower\nend edit controller ranges. Digital Betacam may have used these as well, but I\ndon\u2019t recall the height change.\n\nOther brands had variations of these controls as they adjusted the tech. But\nnone of them that I know of had the same mechanism as this control. There also\nwasn\u2019t the need for that much customisation. I can see this making a great\ncontrol surface for media applications. I can think of one product on the\nmarket now that would benefit from this level of customisation being added to\ntheir control surface.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  11.

We are using MRF, which allows us to create haptic modes like full\nlockout or barriers that feel like real mechanical devices. After some years\nof R&D, we are now providing our HAPTICORE encoders as serial products.\n\nAlong our journey from a concept to the final products, we have developed\nseveral technology demonstrators and are currently thinking about starting an\n\u201cinventors\u2019 program\u201d where we would lend out our HAPTICORE technology for new\nconcepts and projects. Do you guys think this might be interesting? If you\nlike the idea or maybe already have a project in mind where you could need a\nsmart encoder, we look forward to getting in touch with you.\n\nhttps://www.xeeltech.com/request-demonstrator/\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

For those interested, here\u2019s a brief\ndescription of how it works: https://www.inventus.at/en/rotary-haptic-\nsolutions/. TL/DR: a fluid with dispersed magnetic particles changes its\nviscosity in response to a magnetic field.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      2.

You could feel your previous stops as you\nadjusted the focal height. You could even feel the location of each frame\nposition as the stack was configured.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  17.

No springs, just the motors. Then you\ncan implement game data based force feedback, stick shakers, return to center\nin a manner that prevents drift, and a host of other functions.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

The mechanical part of most joysticks is\njust two pots at 90\u00b0 angles, with a slotted sickle-shaped actuator attached to\neach, with the bottom end of the joystick going through the intersection of\nthe slots. Adding a brushless DC motor to each of these is a pretty simple\nmod.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  18. Barry L. Roshto says:\n\nAugust 26, 2023 at 5:24 am\n\nCould I just purchase one from someone who has built one? I think I am capable\nof doing this, just pressed for time... 30. Sept. Performance...
