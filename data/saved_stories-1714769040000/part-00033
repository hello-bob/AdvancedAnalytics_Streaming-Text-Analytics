Using data on college policies and county health,\nwe estimate how mandates affect surrounding communities. Event studies from\nAugust to November 2021 show that mandates covering all colleges in a county\nreduced COVID-19 deaths by 5.6 per 100,000 persons, a 4.6% reduction in the\nU.S. total during this period. Mandates reduced COVID cases by 504 and ICU\nadmissions by 16.2 per 100,000, though we see no statistically significant\nimpact on hospitalizations. Impacts are larger in counties with larger college\npopulations and low estimated ex-ante student vaccination rates.\n\nJEL Codes:\n\n  * H75\n  * I18\n  * I23\n\nThis article requires a subscription to view the full text.
