The Western press has not reported\nmuch on a series of Chinese new restrictions, under the umbrella of anti-\nespionage laws.\n\nNeedless to say, espionage is a show-stopper as far as threats go, as the\ntreatment of Julian Assange, Gonzalo Lira, and detailed Wall Street Journal\nreporter Evan Gershkovich illustrate. No one with an operating brain cell\nwants to fall into the hall of mirrors of its notions of abuses and due\nprocess.\n\nYet despite the severity of potential punishments, and the worry among the\nmany affected parties, there has been perilous little reporting. Reader Dr.\nKevin sent a couple of links but a search on Twitter came up empty. This is\nparticularly surprising, as we\u2019ll discuss soon, due to the existing and soon\nto get worse situation for drug exports, where the US is heavily dependent on\nChina. We long though this was a prime leverage point for China against the\nUS, and it looks like China is staring to make use of it.\n\nIt is not clear whether the near silence by non-Chinese media on this topic is\ndue to press reluctance to report on what sure looks like retaliation, and\npretty bloody-minded at that, and potentially also some self-censorship among\naffected companies. Remember that during Brexit, businesses were stunningly\nsilent about the many negative consequences of Brexit, particularly the super-\nhard version the Tories increasingly favored.\n\nThe limited recognition of these new Chinese policies, which have the\npotential to limit trade, not just various forms of regulatory and contractual\ncompliance, is striking given that the US is continuing to escalate against\nChina. As Politico.eu reported yesterday:\n\n> U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will head to Beijing this week, with\n> a warning for China to curb its technical support for Russia\u2019s military \u2014 or\n> else...\n>\n> \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to take steps when we believe necessary against firms that\n> ... severely undermine security in both Ukraine and Europe,\u201d a State\n> Department official told reporters ahead of Blinken\u2019s trip. \u201cWe\u2019ve\n> demonstrated our willingness to do so regarding firms from a number of\n> countries, not just China.\u201d\n\nAn account below reports that China is expected to further tighten its anti-\nespionage laws this week. That may be a coincidence of timing, but it could be\na warning to the US about what might happen were the US to try to deliver on\nAnthony Blinken\u2019s threat mongering. But the Anglosphere media has barely\nregistered that this is happening. Is the State Department so clueless as to\nbe missing a potentially pretty serious message?\n\nDue to the spotty English-language reporting, yours truly is very much in\nblind man and the elephant mode. So any reader corrections and fillings-in of\ngaps are very much welcome.\n\nPar for the course, one of the best short-form versions of what is happening\ncame in the comments section of one of these new stories, Pharma groups warn\nof supply crunch over China spying law in the Financial Times:\n\n> Martin Berg\n>\n> The new data protection laws in China effectively declare company data to be\n> of national interest, if not national property. By doing so, it has\n> effectively taken a further step in weaponising the economy, and turning\n> economic competition into a battle between states, rather than private\n> enterprises.\n\nThis might answer the question that many of you likely had: what could\noutsourced drug manufacture have that would even rise to the level of being\nprotectable intellectual property, let alone a state secret? As we will see\nsoon, these compounds are either patented (nearly always in the US or EU) or\noff patent. Perhaps the Chinese companies have developed some better\nmousetraps in the form of better or faster manufacturing processes. But again,\nabuses in that arena would seem to fall in the realm of intellectual property\ntheft, and not a threat to the Chinese state.\n\nWellie, as we are now seeing, it can be if the government takes an expansive\nview of what state interest amounts to.\n\nA story today in Nikkei warns that China is tightening its espionage laws. Key\nsections:\n\n> China is preparing to restrict transfers of any information related to\n> national security under an updated counterespionage law, raising fears of a\n> stepped-up crackdown on foreign individuals and companies here.\n>\n> The Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress began deliberating\n> the changes Monday. The legislation, which will broaden the definition of\n> espionage, is expected to pass Wednesday.\n>\n> This will mark the first time since 2014 that the law has been amended.\n>\n> The measure will expand the scope of the law \u2014 now limited to state secrets\n> \u2014 to cover all documents, data, materials or items related to national\n> security and interests. It does not provide further details on what\n> constitutes national security and interests.\n>\n> A greater focus will also be put on cybersecurity. Discussions of a system\u2019s\n> vulnerabilities to cyberattacks could run afoul of the new rules.\n>\n> Security authorities will be granted more power, including in inspecting\n> baggage and electronic devices of those suspected of espionage.\n\nNotice that this plan sounds much less than what pink paper reader Martin Berg\nreported. Perhaps practice is already more aggressive than current law? It\nwould seem so. Nikkei says later:\n\n> In March, a Japanese employee of drugmaker Astellas Pharma was detained for\n> allegedly violating the existing counterespionage law. The man is believed\n> to have had interactions with Chinese government and industry officials as\n> part of his job.\n>\n> Relevant authorities have solid evidence that the man engaged in espionage\n> and will handle the matter in accordance with Chinese law, said Wu Jianghao,\n> the Chinese ambassador to Japan, on April 7...\n>\n> Foreign workers in China are on edge, given ambiguities about what would be\n> considered illegal under the updated law. Activities that are part of\n> regular business operations are seen potentially becoming an issue, and some\n> Japanese companies have warned expatriate workers in China to be especially\n> cautious when entering into new business deals in the technology sector,\n> which Beijing considers a national security priority....\n>\n> The proposed changes are seen giving Chinese authorities justification to\n> monitor foreign companies involved in artificial intelligence,\n> semiconductors and other key fields in the name of national security. This\n> could extend to their communications with their headquarters back home.\n\nThe Nikkei story does not give a clear idea of when and how the the crackdown\nbegan, although it does say that President Xi increased his \u201cfocus\u201d on\nsecurity in recent months.\n\nIn fact, the pink paper pointed out last July that China was putting\ninformational screws on foreign companies operating there:\n\n> Global companies are accelerating their push to decouple China data in\n> response to the country\u2019s increasingly stringent data and anti-espionage\n> laws, as relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate.\n>\n> The drive for full localisation of data in China and separation of\n> information technology systems from the rest of the world has accelerated\n> over recent months as Beijing strengthens its control and regulation of\n> data....\n>\n> On July 1, Beijing put into effect an expanded anti-espionage law to\n> strengthen national security. A series of raids and sanctions on US\n> consultancies such as Bain & Company and Mintz Group, along with\n> semiconductor giant Micron Technology, have put more pressure on companies\n> operating in China.\n>\n> Roberts said the wording in the updated anti-espionage law unveiled in April\n> introduced the possibility of criminal sanctions and being policed by the\n> country\u2019s state security agency for sharing information deemed sensitive.\n>\n> The revised law and the raids \u201chave businesses scrambling to understand\n> their current compliance footing\u201d, he said.\n>\n> In the past, western companies were concerned about taking electronic\n> devices into the country over fears that China could access their data. Now\n> they are equally concerned about sensitive data leaving China for fear of\n> violating Beijing\u2019s rules.\n\nNow let us circle back to the new account at the Financial Times, Pharma\ngroups warn of supply crunch over China spying law:\n\n> Western pharmaceutical groups are warning of worsening disruption to supply\n> chains because of problems certifying manufacturing sites in China, with\n> some factory inspectors refusing to visit the country over fears of arrest\n> for spying and others denied entry to facilities.\n>\n> China is one of the world\u2019s largest makers of active pharmaceutical\n> ingredients and antibiotics and a major supplier of drugs to the EU and US.\n> However, a tightening of anti-espionage laws by Beijing has led to concerns\n> that foreign citizens gathering data on Chinese sites could be deemed spies.\n\nLet\u2019s pause here. \u201cOne of the world\u2019s largest makers of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and antibiotics and a major supplier of drugs to the EU and US\u201d\nunderstates the stranglehold China has as a meds supplier to the US. Even\nthough the particular percentages may have shifted in the intervening years,\nthe general picture from these archival pieces remains the same: the US is\nmassively dependent on China for finished drugs and pharma components. The\nfirst, a 2018 post, also shows China has long been playing hide and seek with\nthe FDA:\n\n> A recent book, China RX: Exposing the Risks of America\u2019s Dependence on China\n> for Medicine by Rosemary Gibson and Janardan Prasad Singh, appears not to\n> have gotten the attention it warrants...\n>\n> The big message of Gibon\u2019s and Singh\u2019s book is that the US relies on China\n> for the production of active ingredients in drugs and in many cases, of the\n> medications themselves, to the degree that we would have a public health\n> crisis if supplies were interrupted. As Gibson said on C-SPAN:\n>\n\n>> Many people that we spoke to, both former government officials and some in\nindustry said that if China shut the door on exports, within months, pharmacy\nshelves in the United States to be empty, and hospitals would cease to\nfunction.\n\n>\n> And don\u2019t assume generics king India would step into the breach. India gets\n> many of the active ingredients for its pharmaceuticals from China. Gibson\n> forecasts that China will overtake India in generics manufacture within a\n> decade.\n>\n> As Gibson explains, the US no longer makes its own penicillin, in part\n> because China dumped penicillin in 2004, driving the last US plant out of\n> business.\n>\n> The medications where the US relies on China include heparin, a blood\n> thinner that among other things is used for IV drips. No heparin, no IV\n> treatments. Due to the difficulty in tracing the source of drug company\n> ingredients, the authors could make only case by case investigations, but\n> they China production to be critical for treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s HIV,\n> depression, schizophrenia, cancer, epilepsy, and high blood pressure.\n>\n> Dependency is not the only risk. US drug companies shifted production to\n> China not just to save cost but to escape regulation. The FDA has only\n> limited access to Chinese factories, with the Chinese having well over 700,\n> yet the FDA able to inspect only 15 a year on average. As Gibson said on\n> C-SPAN:\n>\n\n>> The FDA is trying to get inspection on site in China. The Chinese have\nseverely restricted the number of inspections that they will allow and the\nwhole program has become completely ineffective.\n\n>\n> And the Chinese are often less than cooperative. Gibson describes even then\n> how the agency has been directed to a Potemkin facility, as in the goods\n> were made somewhere else...and the FDA was not able to figure out where.\n> Similarly, reports presented by the health authorities to the FDA is\n> understood to be as reliable as Chinese economic data....Gibson again:\n>\n\n>> In 2015, the FDA inspected a plant in China. It did that because it was\ngetting a lot of customer complaints, presumably industry complaints, about\nthe active ingredients that they were getting from this plant. There was\nbacterial contamination, some of the products. They did not have full\ntherapeutic value. If that\u2019s an antibiotic or chemotherapy, that could be\ndevastating.\n\n>>\n\n>> So the FDA went in and they found what they called systemic data\nmanipulation. This is a plant that had passed muster by the FDA, the Chinese\nFDA and other inspections over many years. So the FDA banned 29 different\nproducts from coming into the United States. But because the United States is\nso dependent, the FDA had to exempt 14 of those products from its own ban.\nSome of those included antibiotics or ingredients for antibiotics and\ningredients for chemotherapies, because the FDA was concerned about drug\nshortages in the United States. That is how dependent we are as a country.\n\nAnd from a 2019 post from SafeHaven that we republished:\n\n> Just like the rare earths dilemma, the U.S. healthcare industry is finding\n> itself in a Catch 22 situation since it cannot easily cut off all drug\n> supplies from China.\n>\n> The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 requires the Defense Health Agency and\n> other federal agencies to only use pre-approved drugs that are made in the\n> U.S. or from a compliant country.\n>\n> As you might imagine, China is not on the approved list; however, the agency\n> has waivers for nearly 150 drugs from the country because it would not be\n> able to procure them from anywhere else. Moreover, the TAA only covers\n> finished products and not their components\u2013though that\u2019s more of a\n> legislative issue that can probably be fixed.\n>\n> Yet, quality is just one of the concerns here. China can potentially cut off\n> actual drug supplies to the U.S. thus crippling the industry.\n\nThe article concluded by saying it would take a long time to solve this\nproblem, as in reshore.\n\nNow back to the Financial Times report:\n\n> ...official data seen by the Financial Times shows some US Food and Drug\n> Administration inspectors have been refused entry to Chinese production\n> sites since the pandemic.\n>\n> This has led to western pharmaceutical regulators struggling to enforce\n> oversight of Chinese manufacturers. Drugs made in third countries and\n> imported into the EU or US require certification by government inspectors\n> and audits of production sites...\n>\n> During the pandemic, some audits of Chinese sites were carried out online or\n> certification was prolonged without inspection \u2014 meaning there is a large\n> inspection backlog with many certifications due \u201cto expire by the end of\n> this year\u201d, according to Fatima Bicane, manager of pharmaceutical technology\n> at BAH.\n>\n> Disruption to inspections increases the risk of Chinese production sites\n> losing their certification for western markets, exacerbating an already\n> strained supply chain for generic pharmaceuticals...\n>\n> \u201cAdrian van den Hoven, director-general of Medicines for Europe, an industry\n> body representing European pharmaceutical companies, said that ambiguity\n> around the new anti-espionage law had led to concerns that \u201can inspector . .\n> . in China could be accused of espionage\u201d....\n>\n> \u201cWhen you talk about antibiotics, the Chinese are in a very critical\n> position as most of the starting materials for antibiotics are made in\n> China,\u201d said Jim Miller, an industry consultant who advises on pharma\n> manufacturing in the US. \u201cThe world is very dependent on China for\n> antibiotic ingredients and active ingredients.\u201d\n\nNow admittedly, the number of FDA inspections in China was more than two times\nhigher in 2023 than 2022. But the new espionage crackdown and the detention\nand espionage accusation against the Japanese drug company employee has had a\nchilling effect on the willingness of drug industry foreign inspectors and\nbusiness partners to visit China. And it\u2019s easy to see if the final law is\nvague that it will allow Chinese officials to greatly toughen enforcement at\nany time. And that could translated into a crippling reduction of essential\nmedicine supplies.\n\nBut the US lets its multinationals sell out our own interests and did nothing\nto stop them. So if worst case scenarios come to pass, we have no one but\nourselves to blame.\n\nThis entry was posted in China, Economic fundamentals, Free markets and their\ndiscontents, Globalization, Health care, Legal, Politics, Surveillance state\non April 22, 2024 by Yves Smith.\n\n##\n\nSubscribe to Post Comments\n\n4 comments\n\n  1. PlutoniumKun April 22, 2024 at 8:38 am\n\nI can\u2019t claim any great insight into current Chinese thinking on retaliating\nagainst the US for its chip policies, but this clamp down to me seems more in\nline with ongoing domestic security policy rather than a deliberate shot\nacross the bows of the US. In the past, when China has wanted to send a\nmessage on trade, its usually been much more direct \u2013 either using domestic\nconsumer pressure (for example, in hyping up domestic boycotts of South Korean\nowned businesses), or in simply stopping the export of particular products on\nsecurity grounds (as they\u2019ve done with rare earths).\n\nThe anti-espionage policies sound to me more like part of the long term\nongoing throttling of foreign influence on domestic industry that has been\npolicy since Xi came to power. A little like the US, China is so large and\nself absorbed that domestic policies are often pursued without any\nconsideration for how it is seen externally. An example would be when\nFujianese police set up offices around Europe to keep tabs on Chinese ex pats,\napparently entirely oblivious to what an enormous breach of international law\nthis represented.\n\nChina is engaging in a very delicate balancing act now with trade. Beijing has\nfailed to inject any life into the domestic economy and are now pursuing a\nmassive growth in exports to maintain the growth targets. This will only work\nif every trading partner is happy to see its domestic economy swamped with\ncheap imports. The reality is that China has far more to lose in a trade war\nthan the US, or for that matter, other Asian economies and Europe \u2013 at\npresent, China is uniquely dependent on maintaining its huge and growing\nsurplus and will remain so until it gets its domestic economic policy right.\nIf China does use its hold over pharmaceuticals as a trade weapon, this could\npotentially play right into the hands of countries such as India, Vietnam and\nIndonesia, who are all watching to see how they can benefit (or at least, not\nget run over) in a China/US trade war. And of course, if China does restrict\nflows of key pharm chemicals, the big loser will not be the US, but poorer\ncountries across the globe, who will find prices rising rapidly even if they\nare not the direct target.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  2.

So Chinese economic growth is excellent,\nwhile domestic economic growth is and has been faster than foreign trade\ngrowth.

The Rev Kev April 22, 2024 at 9:47 am\n\nWith China, it is probably a case of wheels within wheels. But certainly the\nChinese political establishment knows that as the Ukraine winds down, that\nthey are next. So this would be an ideal time to tighten up on security laws\nas well as forming ones that can be weaponized against the west. It may be the\ncase that with pharmaceuticals, it is that old Chinese idiom \u2018Kill the chicken\nto scare the monkey\u2019 at work here. There has been news of shortages of certain\ndrugs in the media for months now though I doubt that it was the Chinese doing\nthis. Ordinary Neoliberalism would be enough to explain these shortages. But\nthe thought that there might be disruptions to drugs coming from China might\nconcentrate some minds. The logical course of action for the US would be to\nre-establish drug manufacturing facilities at home but I seriously doubt that\nBig Pharma would ever allow that. They would be afraid of future competition\nhere.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Tip Jar\n\nPlease Donate or Subscribe!\n\n### Search\n\n### Recent Comments\n\n  * CA on How \u2018Dune\u2019 Became a Rallying Cry For the New Science of Ecologyhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/climate/ocean-heat-records.html April 10, 2024 Ocean Heat Has Shattered...\n\n  * Dr. John Carpenter on Challenging the Duopoly: Jill Stein on Why She\u2019s Running for US President as Green Party CandidateYeah, that was the point I kind of...\n\n  * Lee on Links 4/22/2024Free at archive.ph: https://archive.ph/L5ezv\n\n  * The Rev Kev on Links 4/22/2024\"US-Israel: Netanyahu vows to reject any US sanctions...\n\n  * dave -- just dave on How \u2018Dune\u2019 Became a Rallying Cry For the New Science of Ecology1/I had the good fortune to read an...\n\n### Topics\n\n  * Africa (193)\n  * Australia (191)\n  * Auto industry (229)\n  * Banana republic (4,991)\n  * Banking industry (5,334)\n  * Brexit (352)\n  * CalPERS (275)\n  * Carbon credits (49)\n  * CEO compensation (277)\n  * China (1,102)\n  * Commodities (658)\n  * Corporate governance (546)\n  * Credit cards (207)\n  * Credit markets (4,040)\n  * Curiousities (384)\n  * Currencies (1,145)\n  * Derivatives (741)\n  * Documents (7)\n  * Doomsday scenarios (3,660)\n  * Dubious statistics (1,369)\n  * ECONNED (103)\n  * Economic fundamentals (4,527)\n  * Energy markets (1,320)\n  * Environment (1,639)\n  * Europe (1,648)\n  * Federal Reserve (1,543)\n  * Free markets and their discontents (3,548)\n  * Garrulous insolence (115)\n  * Global warming (1,331)\n  * Globalization (2,046)\n  * Guest Post (15,559)\n  * Health care (1,447)\n  * Hedge funds (509)\n  * Income disparity (2,717)\n  * India (192)\n  * Infrastructure (300)\n  * Investment banks (768)\n  * Investment management (868)\n  * Investment outlook (1,062)\n  * Japan (253)\n  * Legal (3,027)\n  * Links (5,589)\n  * Macroeconomic policy (1,439)\n  * Market inefficiencies (415)\n  * Media appearances (78)\n  * Media watch (1,473)\n  * Middle East (536)\n  * Moral hazard (422)\n  * New McCarthyism (37)\n  * New York Magazine articles (4)\n  * New Zealand (83)\n  * Notices (666)\n  * OCC (17)\n  * Pandemic (1,035)\n  * Payment system (231)\n  * Permaculture (120)\n  * Politics (9,434)\n  * Private equity (827)\n  * Privatization (251)\n  * Real estate (1,742)\n  * Regulations and regulators (5,146)\n  * Ridiculously obvious scams (1,574)\n  * Risk and risk management (954)\n  * Russia (922)\n  * Science and the scientific method (462)\n  * Social policy (2,274)\n  * Social values (2,848)\n  * Species loss (121)\n  * Student loans (118)\n  * Summer rerun (53)\n  * Surveillance state (331)\n  * Taxes (546)\n  * Technology and innovation (1,121)\n  * The destruction of the middle class (2,777)\n  * The dismal science (2,038)\n  * TPP (99)\n  * Turkey (44)\n  * Uber (60)\n  * UK (533)\n  * Water Cooler (2,428)\n\n### Blogroll\n\n  * Angry Bear\n  * Automatic Earth\n  * Bill Mitchell \u2013 billy blog\n  * Credit Slips\n  * Don Quijones\u2019 Rigged Game\n  * Econbrowser\n  * Economic Populist\n  * Ed Harrison\n  * Eyes on Trade\n  * Gaius Publius\n  * Glenn Greenwald\n  * Health Care Renewal\n  * Lambert Strether\n  * Macro Business\n  * mathbabe\n  * Matt Stoller\n  * Michael Hudson\n  * New Economic Perspectives\n  * OilPrice\n  * Pando Daily\n  * TripleCrisis\n  * Warren Mosler\n  * Wolf Richter (WolfStreet)\n  * Yanis Varoufakis\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2006 - 2024 Aurora Advisors Incorporated All Rights Reserved | Privacy Policy | Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nSecure Payments Powered by Clover\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
