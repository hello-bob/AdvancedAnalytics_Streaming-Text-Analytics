Now, it has grown into an ambitious\nexperiment being tested on the front lines in Ukraine, forming a key component\nof the U.S. military\u2019s effort to funnel timely information to the soldiers\nfighting Russian invaders.\n\nSo far the results are mixed: Generals and commanders have a new way to put a\nfull picture of Russia\u2019s movements and communications into one big, user-\nfriendly picture, employing algorithms to predict where troops are moving and\nwhere attacks might happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the American experience in Ukraine has underscored how difficult it is to\nget 21st-century data into 19th-century trenches. Even with Congress on the\nbrink of providing tens of billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv, mostly in the\nform of ammunition and long-range artillery, the question remains whether the\nnew technology will be enough to help turn the tide of the war at a moment\nwhen the Russians appear to have regained momentum.\n\n## \u2018This Became Our Laboratory\u2019\n\nThe war in Ukraine has, in the minds of many American officials, been a\nbonanza for the U.S. military, a testing ground for Project Maven and other\nrapidly evolving technologies. The American-made drones that were shipped into\nUkraine last year were blown out of the sky with ease. And Pentagon officials\nnow understand, in a way they never did before, that America\u2019s system of\nmilitary satellites has to be built and set up entirely differently, with\nconfigurations that look more like Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink constellations of\nsmall satellites.\n\nMeanwhile, American, British and Ukrainian officers, along with some of\nSilicon Valley\u2019s top military contractors, are exploring new ways of finding\nand exploiting Russian vulnerabilities, even while U.S. officials try to\nnavigate legal restraints about how deeply they can become involved in\ntargeting and killing Russian troops.\n\nImage\n\nProject Maven quickly became the standout success among the Pentagon\u2019s many\nefforts to tiptoe into algorithmic warfare.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York\nTimes\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day this became our laboratory,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Christopher\nT. Donahue, commander of the 18th Airborne Division, who is known as \u201cthe last\nman in Afghanistan\u201d because he ran the evacuation of the airport in Kabul in\nAugust 2021, before resuming his work infusing the military with new\ntechnology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd despite the early concerns at Google over participation in Project Maven,\nsome of the industry\u2019s most prominent figures are at work on national security\nissues, underscoring how the United States is harnessing its competitive\nadvantage in technology to maintain superiority over Russia and China in an\nera of renewed superpower rivalries.\n\nTellingly, those figures now include Eric Schmidt, who spent 16 years as\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive and is now drawing on lessons from Ukraine to develop\na new generation of autonomous drones that could revolutionize warfare.\n\nBut if Russia\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine has been a testing ground for the\nPentagon\u2019s drive to embrace advanced technology, it has also been a bracing\nreminder of the limits of technology to turn the war.\n\nUkraine\u2019s ability to repel the invasion arguably hinges more on renewed\ndeliveries of basic weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells.\n\nThe first two years of the conflict have also shown that Russia is adapting,\nmuch more quickly than anticipated, to the technology that gave Ukraine an\ninitial edge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the first year of the war, Russia barely used its electronic warfare\ncapabilities. Today it has made full use of them, confusing the waves of\ndrones the United States has helped provide. Even the fearsome HIMARS missiles\nthat President Biden agonized over giving to Kyiv, which were supposed to make\na huge difference on the battlefield, have been misdirected at times as the\nRussians learned how to interfere with guidance systems.\n\nNot surprisingly, all these discoveries are pouring into a series of \u201clessons\nlearned\u201d studies, conducted at the Pentagon and NATO headquarters in Brussels,\nin case NATO troops ever find themselves in direct combat with President\nVladimir V. Putin\u2019s forces. Among them is the discovery that when new\ntechnology meets the brutality of old-fashioned trench warfare, the results\nare rarely what Pentagon planners expected.\n\nImage\n\nStarlink, the Elon Musk-provided mesh of satellites, was often the only thing\nconnecting Ukrainian soldiers to headquarters, or to one\nanother.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\n\n\u201cFor a while we thought this would be a cyberwar,\u2019\u2019 Gen. Mark A. Milley, who\nretired last year as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, said last summer.\n\u201cThen we thought it was looking like an old-fashioned World War II tank war.\u201d\n\nThen, he said, there were days when it seemed as though they were fighting\nWorld War I.\n\n## \u2018The Pit\u2019\n\nMore than a thousand miles west of Ukraine, deep inside an American base in\nthe heart of Europe, is the intelligence-gathering center that has become the\nfocal point of the effort to bring the allies and the new technology together\nto target Russian forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisitors are discouraged in \u201cthe Pit,\u201d as the center is known. American\nofficials rarely discuss its existence, in part because of security concerns,\nbut mostly because the operation raises questions about how deeply involved\nthe United States is in the day-to-day business of finding and killing Russian\ntroops.\n\nThe technology in use there evolved from Project Maven. But a version provided\nto Ukraine was designed in a way that does not rely on the input of the most\nsensitive American intelligence or advanced systems.\n\nThe goals have come a long way since the outcry at Google six years ago.\n\n\u201cIn those early days, it was pretty simple,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, who\nwas the first director of the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.\n\u201cIt was as basic as you could get. Identifying vehicles, people, buildings,\nand then trying to work our way to something more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s exit, he said, may have slowed progress toward what the Pentagon now\ncalled \u201calgorithmic warfare.\u201d But \u201cwe just kept going.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Ukraine war was brewing, Project Maven\u2019s elements were being\ndesigned and built by nearly five dozen firms, from Virginia to California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet there was one commercial company that proved most successful in putting it\nall together on what the Pentagon calls a \u201csingle pane of glass\u201d: Palantir, a\ncompany co-founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, the billionaire conservative-\nlibertarian, and Alex Karp, its chief executive.\n\nPalantir focuses on organizing, and visualizing, masses of data. But it has\noften found itself at the center of a swirling debate about when building a\npicture of the battlefield could contribute to overly automated decisions to\nkill.\n\nEarly versions of Project Maven, relying on Palantir\u2019s technology, had been\ndeployed by the U.S. government during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Kabul\nevacuation operation, to coordinate resources and track readiness. \u201cWe had\nthis torrent of data but humans couldn\u2019t process it all,\u201d General Shanahan\nsaid.\n\nImage\n\nFrom the start, the Ukrainians understood that to win, or even to stay in the\ngame, they had to reinvent drone warfare. Credit...David Guttenfelder for The\nNew York Times\n\nProject Maven quickly became the standout success among the Pentagon\u2019s many\nefforts to tiptoe into algorithmic warfare, and soon incorporated feeds from\nnearly two dozen other Defense Department programs and commercial sources into\nan unprecedented common operating picture for the U.S. military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut it had never been to war.\n\n## A Meeting on the Polish Border\n\nEarly one morning after the Russian invasion, a top American military official\nand one of Ukraine\u2019s most senior generals met on the Polish border to talk\nabout a new technology that might help the Ukrainians repel the Russians.\n\nThe American had a computer tablet in his car, operating Project Maven through\nPalantir\u2019s software and connected to a Starlink terminal.\n\nHis tablet\u2019s display showed many of the same intelligence feeds that the\noperators in the Pit were seeing, including the movement of Russian armored\nunits and the chatter among the Russian forces as they fumbled their way to\nKyiv.\n\nAs the two men talked, it became evident that the Americans knew more about\nwhere Ukraine\u2019s own troops were than the Ukrainian general did. The Ukrainian\nwas quite certain his forces had taken a city back from the Russians; the\nAmerican intelligence suggested otherwise. When the American official\nsuggested he call one of his field commanders, the Ukrainian general\ndiscovered that the American was right.\n\nThe Ukrainian was impressed \u2014 and angry. American forces should be fighting\nalongside the Ukrainians, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do that,\u201d the American responded, explaining that Mr. Biden forbade\nit. What the United States can provide, he said, is an evolving picture of the\nbattlefield.\n\nToday a similar tension continues to play out inside the Pit, where each day a\ncareful dance is underway. The military has taken seriously Mr. Biden\u2019s\nmandate that the United States should not directly target Russians. The\npresident has said that Russia must not be allowed to win, but that the United\nStates must also \u201cavoid World War III.\u201d\n\nSo, the Americans point the Ukrainians in the right direction but stop short\nof giving them precise targeting data.\n\nThe Ukrainians quickly improved, and they built a sort of shadow Project\nMaven, using commercial satellite firms like Maxar and Planet Labs and data\nscraped from Twitter and Telegram channels.\n\nInstagram shots, taken by Russians or nearby Ukrainians, often showed dug-in\npositions or camouflaged rocket launchers. Drone imagery soon became a crucial\nsource of precise targeting data, as did geolocation data from Russian\nsoldiers who did not have the discipline to turn off their cellphones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis flow of information helped Ukraine target Russia\u2019s artillery. But the\ninitial hope that the picture of the battlefield would flow to soldiers in the\ntrenches, connected to phones or tablets, has never been realized, field\ncommanders say.\n\nOne key to the system was Starlink, the Elon Musk-provided mesh of satellites,\nwhich was often the only thing connecting soldiers to headquarters, or to one\nanother. That reinforced what was already becoming blindingly obvious:\nStarlink\u2019s network of 4,700 satellites proved nearly as good as \u2014 and\nsometimes better than \u2014 the United States\u2019 billion-dollar systems, one White\nHouse official said.\n\n## Dreams of Drone Fleets\n\nFor a while, it seemed as if this technological edge might allow Ukraine to\npush the Russians out of the country entirely.\n\nIn a suburb of Kyiv, Ukrainian high school students spent the summer of 2023\nworking in a long-neglected factory, soldering together Chinese-supplied\ncomponents for small drones, which were then mounted onto carbon-fiber frames.\nThe contraptions were light and cheap, costing about $350 each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSoldiers on the front lines would then strap each one to a two-or-three pound\nexplosive charge designed to immobilize an armored vehicle or kill the\noperators of a Russian artillery brigade. The drones were designed for what\namounted to crewless kamikaze missions, intended for one-time use, like\ndisposable razors.\n\nImage\n\nUkraine\u2019s ability to repel the invasion arguably hinges more on renewed\ndeliveries of basic weapons and ammunition.Credit...Nicole Tung for The New\nYork Times\n\nThe broken-down factory near Kyiv encapsulated all the complications and\ncontradictions of the Ukraine war. From the start, the Ukrainians understood\nthat to win, or even to stay in the game, they had to reinvent drone warfare.\nBut they could barely keep enough parts coming in to sustain the effort.\n\nThe mission of remaking Ukraine\u2019s drone fleet has captivated Mr. Schmidt, the\nformer chief executive of Google.\n\n\u201cUkraine,\u201d he said in October, between trips to the country, \u201chas become the\nlaboratory in the world on drones.\u201d He described the sudden appearance of\nseveral hundred drone start-ups in Ukraine of \u201cevery conceivable kind.\u201d\n\nBut by the fall of 2023 he began to worry that Ukraine\u2019s innovative edge alone\nwould not be enough. Russia\u2019s population was too big and too willing to\nsacrifice, oil prices remained high, China was still supplying the Russians\nwith key technologies and parts \u2014 while they also sold to the Ukrainians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd while Ukrainian pop-up factories churned out increasingly cheap drones, he\nfeared they would quickly be outmatched.\n\nSo Mr. Schmidt began funding a different vision, one that is now, after the\nUkraine experience, gaining adherents in the Pentagon: far more inexpensive,\nautonomous drones, which would launch in swarms and talk to each other even if\nthey lost their connection to human operators on the ground. The idea is a\ngeneration of new weapons that would learn to evade Russian air defenses and\nreconfigure themselves if some drones in the swarm were shot down.\n\nIt is far from clear that the United States, accustomed to building exquisite,\n$10 million drones, can make the shift to disposable models. Or that it is\nready to bring on the targeting questions that come with fleets driven by A.I.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of moral issues here,\u201d Mr. Schmidt acknowledged, noting\nthat these systems would create another round of the long-running debates\nabout targeting based on artificial intelligence, even as the Pentagon insists\nthat it will maintain \u201cappropriate levels of human judgment over the use of\nforce.\u201d\n\nHe also came to a harsh conclusion: This new version of warfare would likely\nbe awful.\n\n\u201cGround troops, with drones circling overhead, know they\u2019re constantly under\nthe watchful eyes of unseen pilots a few kilometers away,\u201d Mr. Schmidt wrote\nlast year. \u201cAnd those pilots know they are potentially in opposing cross hairs\nwatching back. ...
