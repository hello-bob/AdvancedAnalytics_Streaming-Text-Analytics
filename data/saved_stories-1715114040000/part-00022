He declared that two of\nAmerica\u2019s most important allies, India and Japan, are \u201cxenophobic\u201d, and placed\nthem in the same category as Russia and China:\n\n> \u201cYou know, one of the reasons why our economy is growing is because of you\n> and many others. Why? Because we welcome immigrants. We look to \u2013 the reason\n> \u2013 look, think about it \u2013 why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is\n> Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they\u2019re\n> xenophobic. They don\u2019t want immigrants,\u201d Biden said, according to an\n> official White House transcript released Thursday.\n\nFrom a diplomatic standpoint, this was extremely stupid, since it insults our\nallies while gaining absolutely nothing. It\u2019s also a little hypocritical,\ngiven that Biden just vowed to block a Japanese steel company from acquiring\nU.S. Steel on incredibly flimsy pretexts \u2014 not to mention all the restrictive\nmeasures Biden has taken towards immigration over the course of his presidency\nin order to appease the U.S. public. Glass houses, etc.\n\nThe White House should have walked the comment back and apologized, but\ninstead it defended the remark, saying it was part of a \u201cbroader point\u201d. The\nfact that even a Democratic administration can so casually insult key allies\nshould make us a little more pessimistic about the U.S.\u2019 ability to assemble a\nglobal coalition of democracies in the decades to come.\n\nBut beyond the diplomatic stupidity of the remark, it\u2019s just not factually\ntrue. I don\u2019t know enough about India to make a judgement, but I do know a\nfair amount about Japan, and the common trope that it\u2019s a xenophobic country\nthat doesn\u2019t want immigrants is just provably false.\n\nFirst, I think we should define our standards here. Every country has some\nelement of xenophobia within its populace. And every country has some\nadditional wariness of large-scale immigration that doesn\u2019t rise to the level\nof what we\u2019d probably be willing to call \u201cxenophobia\u201d, since \u201cxenophobia\u201d is\nan insulting word. This is why no country on the planet has anything even\nremotely approaching an open-borders policy \u2014 not Canada, not Sweden, not\nSingapore, and certainly not the United States.\n\nSo when I say \u201cJapan is not a xenophobic country\u201d, what I mean is that it\u2019s\nnot abnormally xenophobic. If you want to call every country in the world\n\u201cxenophobic\u201d, well, fine, that\u2019s your prerogative, but I think that renders\nthe word a little useless.\n\nAnyway, there are a few basic facts we can look at in order to gauge Japan\u2019s\nlevel of xenophobia. First, we can observe the number of immigrants Japan\nactually takes in. Second, we can look at the policies it uses to select who\ngets to come. And third, we have data on Japanese attitudes toward\nimmigration.\n\n####\n\nImmigrant flows and immigrant policies\n\nIt is true that until recently, Japan had relatively little immigration in the\npostwar period. That changed slowly starting in the 1990s, and then in 2013,\nwhen the late Abe Shinzo came to power, it began to change even faster.\nRecognizing Japan\u2019s dire demographic situation, Abe resolved to open up the\ncountry to immigration. The result was a sea change that has rapidly altered\nthe face of Japan.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at some numbers. Here is the official number of foreign\nresidents in Japan:\n\nBy Yuasan - Own work, Data from National Institute of Population and Social\nSecurity Research (IPSS)\n\nIn fact, this chart is misleading, because almost none of the \u201cKoreans\u201d in\nJapan \u2014 the orange line on the graph \u2014 are actually Korean. They are what\u2019s\ncommonly known as zainichi \u2014 people of Korean descent, who were born in Japan\nand usually only speak Japanese, but who have Korean passports, because Japan\ndoes not have birthright citizenship. Zainichi people are free to take\nJapanese citizenship at any time, and over time most have been doing this,\nand/or intermarrying, which is why the orange section on the chart is\nshrinking.\n\nIn other words, the increase in the number of foreigners in Japan is even more\nrecent and dramatic than the chart indicates. In the 1980s, Japan deserved its\nreputation as a country that didn\u2019t accept immigrants. In the 90s there was an\ninflux of people from China and Brazil (the latter being mostly ethnically\nJapanese), followed by the Philippines. In the post-Abe age, there has been an\nexplosion of Vietnamese immigration, in addition to an influx from India and\nvarious other countries.\n\nAs of 2023, there were 3.2 million foreign residents of Japan. That\u2019s 2.6% of\nthe country\u2019s population. That might not sound like a lot, and it\u2019s not a lot\ncompared to countries in Europe or the Anglosphere. In fact, it\u2019s lower than\nthe world average of 3.5%. But the rate of change matters a lot \u2014 it\u2019s a very\nsteep increase over a very short period of time. The stock of immigrants in\nJapan is not large, but the flow is substantial.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re talking about Japan right now, the flow is what you should look\nat, not the stock. The Japan of 2024 is not the Japan of 1984. This often\ncomes as a surprise to those Westerners who are used to thinking about Japan\nthrough the lens of century-old essentialist stereotypes, but Japanese social\nattitudes and political policies tend to change a lot over time.\n\nWhen we look at how Japan got all those immigrants, we see that it was a very\ndeliberate result of government policy. Here is what I wrote for Bloomberg in\n2019:\n\n> In 2017 Japan implemented fast-track permanent residency for skilled\n> workers. In 2018 it passed a law that will greatly expand the number of\n> blue-collar work visas, and -- crucially -- provide these workers with a\n> path to permanent residency if they want it.\n>\n> These changes thus represent true immigration, as opposed to temporary\n> guest-worker policies (despite the common use of the term \u201cguest worker law\u201d\n> to describe the new visas)...Permanent residents are allowed to apply for\n> Japanese citizenship after five years. Some foreigners will also marry\n> Japanese nationals, and their children will thus be citizens as well.\n\nAnd this is from a recent article in the Spectator:\n\n> In June 2023 Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expanded a visa which allowed\n> foreign labourers and their families to stay in Japan indefinitely from just\n> two industries (construction and shipbuilding) to 11. Crucially this now\n> includes the hard to define \u2018service sector\u2019 which is probably why it\u2019s\n> rarer to see a Japanese assistant in a convenience store now than a foreign\n> born one. Largely via this pathway the number of Vietnamese is believed to\n> have surged to nearly half a million.\n>\n> There has also been a focus on highly skilled workers and those in the top\n> income brackets, such as researchers and engineers, and potential\n> entrepreneurs. From April 2023, foreign workers who fulfilled specific\n> criteria became eligible for permanent residency after one year instead of\n> the previous three. Japanese universities have started offering special\n> programmes aimed at luring graduates (\u2018future creative talent\u2019) from the\n> world\u2019s top 100 universities, who would then be granted special residency\n> status. A \u2018start up\u2019 visa for would be tycoons is also available.\n\nGearoid Reidy (who is very good at busting myths about Japan) has another\ngreat article about this.\n\nThe reason the government is doing this is in order to compensate (partially)\nfor Japan\u2019s rapidly aging society. Japan needs workers to support its\nindustries, and taxpayers to support its pensions.\n\nBut if the general Japanese populace was opposed to this increase in\nimmigration, they would put a stop to it \u2014 just as they put a stop to attempts\nto revise the country\u2019s constitution. The Japanese government is generally\nvery responsive to public opinion. And public opinion in Japan is pretty pro-\nimmigration.\n\n####\n\nJapanese attitudes toward immigration\n\nThere are numerous polls that ask Japanese people what they think about\nimmigration. My favorite is the Pew survey, which asks the same questions to\npeople in a bunch of developed countries. Here\u2019s some data from the 2019\nsurvey:\n\nSource: Pew\n\nAccording to this poll, Japan is not the most pro-immigrant country in the\nworld, but it\u2019s near the top. In fact, the Pew survey asks many different\nquestions, regarding crime, terrorism, mass deportation of illegal immigrants,\nand so on. In every single one of Pew\u2019s questions, Japan is more pro-immigrant\nthan the median country surveyed.\n\nPew\u2019s is not the only poll, of course. Gallup surveyed a much wider array of\ncountries than Pew did, and found that Japan was still well above median \u2014\nabout the same as France, and ahead of Brazil \u2014 in terms of openness to\nimmigration.\n\nDo Japanese people want immigrants in the local areas where they themselves\nlive? Yes. Kyodo News found that most Japanese prefectures want to add\nimmigrants, in order to keep their communities from disappearing. And here\u2019s a\npoll by NHK:\n\nSource: NHK via Gearoid Reidy\n\nNor is the reason for the pro-immigration sentiment a mystery. It\u2019s just\neconomics. Here\u2019s the result of a Nikkei survey:\n\n> Nearly 70% of Japanese think it is \"good\" to see an increase in the number\n> of foreign people, both at work and in the community, a recent Nikkei survey\n> found...People who favored the increase cited \"important as workers\" as the\n> reason for their decision.\n\nThe Nikkei survey did find some trepidation about the changes among the\npopulace \u2014 50% of Japanese people said they didn\u2019t like that the country had\nto welcome in large numbers of foreign workers, but that it couldn\u2019t be\nhelped. But whatever unease Japanese people feel about the rapid\ndiversification of their country, it hasn\u2019t yet caused a political backlash or\nany kind of visible intercommunal strife. America and most European countries\ncan\u2019t say the same.\n\nBut when they\u2019re asked about specific concerns about immigrants, Japanese\npeople are generally not very worried. For example, Pew finds that Japanese\npeople are extremely confident that immigrants will integrate to their way of\nlife:\n\nSource: Pew\n\nHow do we know Japanese people aren\u2019t just being politically correct when they\nanswer these surveys? Igarashi and Kagayoshi (2022) have actually done some\nresearch on this. They find that Japanese people actually think that being\nanti-immigrant is more politically correct, and are giving pro-immigrant\nresponses in spite of what they think they ought to be saying:\n\n> We conducted two list experiments using online surveys and compared the\n> answers to those of list experiments and direct questions about attitudes\n> towards immigrants to reveal Japanese citizens\u2019 perceptions of norms. The\n> results show that Japanese citizens attempt to show more negative attitudes\n> upon direct questions than in list experiments, indicating that it is\n> normative to express prejudice against immigrants rather than suppressing\n> it.\n\nThis is a very interesting experiment, because it suggests that many Japanese\npeople also buy into the idea that their country is closed to immigration, and\nare expressing their own pro-immigration opinions in spite of that stereotype.\nThat in turn suggests a country whose attitudes have shifted substantially in\nthe last few decades.\n\nIn fact, I should add that the average Japanese person is less worried about\nimmigration to Japan than I am. I am personally worried that immigration will\nincrease crime in Japan, because A) Japan is such an incredibly low-crime\ncountry to begin with that even immigrants who are very law-abiding by\ninternational standards will probably be more likely to break the rules, and\nB) Japanese corporations\u2019 rigid hiring system may systematically exclude some\nimmigrants from economic opportunities, causing frustration among second-\ngeneration youth. But my worry about crime is actually a minority viewpoint\namong Japanese people themselves:\n\nSource: Pew\n\nIn other words, every piece of systematic data we have shows that Japan\u2019s\nopening to immigration is being driven not by elite machinations, but by\nbroad-based public opinion.\n\n####\n\nAnecdotes and impressions\n\nJapan\u2019s xenophobia may be largely a thing of the past, but the trope of Japan\nas a closed-off, stubbornly homogeneous nation seems to be deeply rooted in\nthe Western psyche. When there\u2019s a persistent stereotype like that, people\ntend to A) come up with creative interpretations of evidence in order to\nprotect that stereotype, and B) seize on anecdotes, real or false, that seem\nto confirm the stereotype.\n\nAs an example of the latter, a lot of people on social media claim that there\nare a bunch of restaurants and other establishments in Japan that refuse to\nserve foreigners. If you do a Google search for this, you will find a huge\nnumber of people asking about it.\n\nIn fact, there are a very, very few restaurants in Japan that do refuse to\nserve foreigners. Once in a very great while, someone finds one of these, and\nputs a picture of it on Twitter or Reddit, and it makes its way around the\ninternet and reinforces everyone\u2019s stereotypes. But the truth is that this\nsort of thing is incredibly rare. I\u2019ve never encountered it. No one I know in\nJapan has ever encountered it.\n\nLike certain other notorious urban myths about Japan, restaurants that refuse\nto serve foreigners are almost entirely apocryphal. The myth is perpetuated by\nA) people lying on the internet, B) gullible Westerners\u2019 willingness to\nbelieve in a myth that conforms to their stereotypes, and C) tourists\nencountering restaurant hosts who can\u2019t speak English, and assuming they were\nturned away for being foreign.\n\nAnother example of confirmation bias is when Americans come back from a trip\nto Tokyo and tell me how homogeneous it was. They tend to assume that all the\nEast Asian people they see riding the train or working in convenience stores\nare Japanese, rather than Vietnamese or Chinese or Filipino immigrants (which\na substantial portion are). And when they see White or Black or South Asian\npeople, they tend to assume they\u2019re tourists instead of residents. The large\nnumber of Indian people working at Narita airport may be changing that\nperception, but in general it can be easy to ignore the diversity around you\nif you start off by assuming it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn fact, after living in Japan for about four years, my own impression is that\nJapanese society is roughly as welcoming to immigrants as the U.S. is. In some\nways, it\u2019s more accepting. On occasion I\u2019ve seen Western expats treat Japanese\nservice workers like dirt with zero repercussions \u2014 a phenomenon colloquially\nknown as the \u201cgaijin smash\u201d. The same forbearance would not be shown in most\nof the places I\u2019ve lived in America.\n\nYes, some Westerners living in Japan will tell you that they never quite felt\naccepted, or like they fit in. To be frank, I think this is usually some\ncombination of A) failure to learn Japanese, and B) being the type of person\nwho wouldn\u2019t feel accepted in their home country either. If I were you, I\nwould not accept these tales as evidence of Japanese xenophobia.\n\nAnd yes, occasionally you will hear an elderly, right-wing Japanese politician\ndeclare that Japan is a racially homogeneous nation. You should treat this\nexactly like you would treat someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene or Louie\nGohmert declaring that America is a Christian nation, or someone like Stephen\nMiller claiming that the children of immigrants will never become truly\nAmerican.\n\nI know that there are a lot of people who are not going to be convinced by\nthis post. Stereotypes are beloved, cherished things, and the impulse to\nexplain the world through cultural essentialism is deep-rooted and strong.\nThere is a certain segment of the population who is always going to believe\nthat Japanese people are still a bunch of 18th-century samurai, contemplating\nthe cherry blossoms as they polish their swords. Old canards survive because\nthey\u2019re comforting \u2014 they\u2019re easy shortcuts toward the feeling that we\u2019ve\nsomehow made sense of a complex and fast-changing world.\n\nSo you know what? If after seeing all of the evidence, you\u2019re still firm in\nyour conviction that Japan is a closed-off, xenophobic society, don\u2019t move\nthere. Both you and Japan will be better off as a result. But if you\u2019re the\nPresident of the United States, or another important figure in the U.S.\ngovernment, please refrain from calling Japan xenophobic. If you\u2019re going to\nbe wrong about this, at least be wrong silently.\n\nShare\n\n103 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n13 Restacks\n\n103\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Japan is not a xenophobic country\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n51\n\nShare\n\n51 Comments\n\nKinamediaKinamedia nyhetsbrev6 hrs ago\u00b7edited 6 hrs agoI agree that Japan has\nan undeserved reputation for \"xenophobia\", but your post would benefit on\ndistinguishing between migrants and refugees.In 2022, Japan accepted 202\nrefugees after turning down 98% of the applications. It's rather easy to\nanswer \"no\" to the question \"are immigrants to blame for crime\" if the\nmigrants you are accepting are \"skilled labour\" or otherwise goes straight\ninto a work they already applied for before entering the country.The reason my\nnative Sweden and Germany have a high \"yes\" answer on this question as per the\nPEW Research poll above, is related to the fulfilment of rich nations'\nresponsibility to accept people seeking refugee in our countries, for better\nor worse.As long as Japan is refusing to do the same, it will be hard to wash\noff that \"xenophobic\" reputation together with countries like South Korea or\nTaiwan where are I live now.Expand full commentLike (13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nIan8 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithI've just come back from Kyoto, and in the west\n(less touristy part of town) there was a 7-11 that had a handwritten sign by\nthe counter saying that many of the staff were non Japanese, and had imperfect\nlanguage skills, but please understand as they are gambatte-ing.I did see a\nrestaurant in the really touristy heart, between Gion and Shijo, that had a\nsign in English on the door saying it served only Japanese speakers (to ensure\nthat they could give a full and proper service). It struck me as a massive own\ngoal, given the location; who knows whether there's some history behind it.In\nthe 25 years I've been visiting Japan, it has internationalised really\nstrikingly. In general, I think Japan's attitudes/relations with foreigners is\npath dependent, and so markedly different to those of the US or the UK or\nWestern countries with similar (albeit not identical) historical patterns.\nIt's not unproblematic, as you say, but what country's situation is?
