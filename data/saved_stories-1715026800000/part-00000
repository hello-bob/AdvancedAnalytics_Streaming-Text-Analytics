It may seem to some of us non-\nmathematicians that geometry and trigonometry were created by the Greeks as a\nform of torture, so imagine our amazement when we heard two high school\nseniors had proved a mathematical puzzle that was thought to be impossible for\n2,000 years.\n\nWe met Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson at their all-girls Catholic high\nschool in New Orleans. We expected to find two mathematical prodigies.\n\nInstead, we found at St. Mary's Academy, all students are told their\npossibilities are boundless.\n\nCome Mardi Gras season, New Orleans is alive with colorful parades, replete\nwith floats, and beads, and high school marching bands.\n\nIn a city where uniqueness is celebrated, St. Mary's stands out \u2013 with young\nAfrican American women playing trombones and tubas, twirling batons and\ndancing - doing it all, which defines St. Mary's, students told us.\n\nJunior Christina Blazio says the school instills in them they have the ability\nto accomplish anything.\n\nChristina Blazio: That is kinda a standard here. So we aim very high - like,\nour aim is excellence for all students.\n\nThe private Catholic elementary and high school sits behind the Sisters of the\nHoly Family Convent in New Orleans East. The academy was started by an African\nAmerican nun for young Black women just after the Civil War. The church still\nsupports the school with the help of alumni.\n\nIn December 2022, seniors Ne'Kiya Jackson and Calcea Johnson were working on a\nschool-wide math contest that came with a cash prize.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson and Calcea Johnson 60 Minutes\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: I was motivated because there was a monetary incentive.\n\nCalcea Johnson: 'Cause I was like, \"$500 is a lot of money. So I-- I would\nlike to at least try.\"\n\nBoth were staring down the thorny bonus question.\n\nBill Whitaker: So tell me, what was this bonus question?\n\nCalcea Johnson: It was to create a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. And\nit kind of gave you a few guidelines on how would you start a proof.\n\nThe seniors were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental\nprinciple of geometry. You may remember it from high school: a2 + b2 = c2. in\nplain English, when you know the length of two sides of a right triangle, you\ncan figure out the length of the third.\n\nBoth had studied geometry and some trigonometry, and both told us math was not\neasy. What no one told them was there had been more than 300 documented proofs\nof the Pythagorean Theorem using algebra and geometry, but for 2,000 years a\nproof using trigonometry was thought to be impossible, ... and that was the\nbonus question facing them.\n\nBill Whitaker: When you looked at the question did you think, \"Boy, this is\nhard\"?\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: What motivated you to say, \"Well, I'm going to try this\"?\n\nCalcea Johnson: I think I was like, \"I started something. I need to finish\nit.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: So you just kept on going.\n\nCalcea Johnson: Yeah.\n\nFor two months that winter, they spent almost all their free time working on\nthe proof.\n\nCeCe Johnson: She was like, \"Mom, this is a little bit too much.\"\n\nCeCe and Cal Johnson are Calcea's parents.\n\nCeCe Johnson: So then I started looking at what she really was doing. And it\nwas pages and pages and pages of, like, over 20 or 30 pages for this one\nproblem.\n\nCal Johnson: Yeah, the garbage can was full of papers, which she would, you\nknow, work out the problems and-- if that didn't work she would ball it up,\nthrow it in the trash.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you look at the problem?\n\nNeliska Jackson is Ne'Kiya's mother.\n\nNeliska Jackson: Personally I did not. 'Cause most of the time I don't\nunderstand what she's doing (laughter).\n\nMichelle Blouin Williams: What if we did this, what if I write this? Does this\nhelp? ax2 plus ....\n\nTheir math teacher, Michelle Blouin Williams, initiated the math contest.\n\nMichelle Blouin Williams 60 Minutes\n\nBill Whitaker: And did you think anyone would solve it?\n\nMichelle Blouin Williams: Well, I wasn't necessarily looking for a solve. So,\nno, I didn't\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: What were you looking for?\n\nMichelle Blouin Williams: I was just looking for some ingenuity, you know\u2014\n\nCalcea and Ne'Kiya delivered on that! They tried to explain their\ngroundbreaking work to 60 Minutes. Calcea's proof is appropriately titled the\nWaffle Cone.\n\nCalcea Johnson: So to start the proof, we start with just a regular right\ntriangle where the angle in the corner is 90\u00b0. And the two angles are alpha\nand beta.\n\nBill Whitaker: Uh-huh\n\nCalcea Johnson: So then what we do next is we draw a second congruent, which\nmeans they're equal in size. But then we start creating similar but smaller\nright triangles going in a pattern like this. And then it continues for\ninfinity. And eventually it creates this larger waffle cone shape.\n\nCalcea Johnson: Am I going a little too\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: You've been beyond me since the beginning. (laughter)\n\nBill Whitaker: So how did you figure out the proof?\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Okay. So you have a right triangle, 90\u00b0 angle, alpha and\nbeta.\n\nBill Whitaker: Then what did you do?\n\nBill Whitaker with Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson 60 Minutes\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Okay, I have a right triangle inside of the circle. And I\nhave a perpendicular bisector at OP to divide the triangle to make that small\nright triangle. And that's basically what I used for the proof. That's the\nproof.\n\nBill Whitaker: That's what I call amazing.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Well, thank you.\n\nThere had been one other documented proof of the theorem using trigonometry by\nmathematician Jason Zimba in 2009 \u2013 one in 2,000 years. Now it seems Ne'Kiya\nand Calcea have joined perhaps the most exclusive club in mathematics.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you both independently came up with proof that only used\ntrigonometry.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: So are you math geniuses?\n\nCalcea Johnson: I think that's a stretch.\n\nBill Whitaker: If not genius, you're really smart at math.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Not at all. (laugh)\n\nTo document Calcea and Ne'Kiya's work, math teachers at St. Mary's submitted\ntheir proofs to an American Mathematical Society conference in Atlanta in\nMarch 2023.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Well, our teacher approached us and was like, \"Hey, you might\nbe able to actually present this,\" I was like, \"Are you joking?\" But she\nwasn't. So we went. I got up there. We presented and it went well, and it blew\nup.\n\nBill Whitaker: It blew up.\n\nCalcea Johnson: Yeah.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: It blew up.\n\nBill Whitaker: Yeah. What was the blowup like?\n\nCalcea Johnson: Insane, unexpected, crazy, honestly.\n\nIt took millenia to prove, but just a minute for word of their accomplishment\nto go around the world. They got a write-up in South Korea and a shout-out\nfrom former first lady Michelle Obama, a commendation from the governor and\nkeys to the city of New Orleans.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why do you think so many people found what you did to be so\nimpressive?\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Probably because we're African American, one. And we're also\nwomen. So I think-- oh, and our age. Of course our ages probably played a big\npart.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you think people were surprised that young African American\nwomen, could do such a thing?\n\nCalcea Johnson: Yeah, definitely.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: I'd like to actually be celebrated for what it is. Like, it's\na great mathematical achievement.\n\nAchievement, that's a word you hear often around St. Mary's academy. Calcea\nand Ne'Kiya follow a long line of barrier-breaking graduates.\n\nThe late queen of Creole cooking, Leah Chase, was an alum. so was the first\nAfrican-American female New Orleans police chief, Michelle Woodfork ...\n\nAnd judge for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Dana Douglas. Math teacher\nMichelle Blouin Williams told us Calcea and Ne'Kiya are typical St. Mary's\nstudents.\n\nBill Whitaker: They're not unicorns.\n\nMichelle Blouin Williams: Oh, no no. If they are unicorns, then every single\nlady that has matriculated through this school is a beautiful, Black unicorn.\n\nPamela Rogers: You're good?\n\nPamela Rogers, St. Mary's president and interim principal, told us the\nstudents hear that message from the moment they walk in the door.\n\nSt. Mary's Academy president and interim principal Pamela Rogers 60 Minutes\n\nPamela Rogers: We believe all students can succeed, all students can learn. It\ndoes not matter the environment that you live in.\n\nBill Whitaker: So when word went out that two of your students had solved this\nalmost impossible math problem, were they universally applauded?\n\nPamela Rogers: In this community, they were greatly applauded. Across the\ncountry, there were many naysayers.\n\nBill Whitaker: What were they saying?\n\nPamela Rogers: They were saying, \"Oh, they could not have done it. African\nAmericans don't have the brains to do it.\" Of course, we sheltered our girls\nfrom that. But we absolutely did not expect it to come in the volume that it\ncame.\n\nBill Whitaker: And after such a wonderful achievement.\n\nPamela Rogers: People-- have a vision of who can be successful. And-- to some\npeople, it is not always an African American female. And to us, it's always an\nAfrican American female.\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings: What we know is when teachers lay out some\nexpectations that say, \"You can do this,\" kids will work as hard as they can\nto do it.\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, has\nstudied how best to teach African American students. She told us an\nencouraging teacher can change a life.\n\nBill Whitaker: And what's the difference, say, between having a teacher like\nthat and a whole school dedicated to the excellence of these students?\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings: So a whole school is almost like being in Heaven.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you mean by that?\n\nBill Whitaker and Gloria Ladson-Billings 60 Minutes\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings: Many of our young people have their ceilings lowered,\nthat somewhere around fourth or fifth grade, their thoughts are, \"I'm not\ngoing to be anything special.\" What I think is probably happening at St.\nMary's is young women come in as, perhaps, ninth graders and are told, \"Here's\nwhat we expect to happen. And here's how we're going to help you get there.\"\n\nAt St. Mary's, half the students get scholarships, subsidized by fundraising\nto defray the $8,000 a year tuition. Here, there's no test to get in, but\nexpectations are high and rules are strict: no cellphones, modest skirts, hair\nmust be its natural color.\n\nStudents Rayah Siddiq, Summer Forde, Carissa Washington, Tatum Williams and\nChristina Blazio told us they appreciate the rules and rigor.\n\nRayah Siddiq: Especially the standards that they set for us. They're very\nhigh. And I don't think that's ever going to change.\n\nBill Whitaker: So is there a heart, a philosophy, an essence to St. Mary's?\n\nSummer Forde: The sisterhood\u2014\n\nCarissa Washington: Sisterhood.\n\nTatum Williams: Sisterhood.\n\nBill Whitaker: The sisterhood?\n\nVoices: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: And you don't mean the nuns. You mean-- (laughter)\n\nChristina Blazio: I mean, yeah. The community\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: So when you're here, there's just no question that you're going\nto go on to college.\n\nRayah Siddiq: College is all they talk about. (laughter)\n\nPamela Rogers: ... and Arizona State University (Cheering)\n\nPrincipal Rogers announces to her 615 students the colleges where every senior\nhas been accepted.\n\nBill Whitaker: So for 17 years, you've had a 100% graduation rate\u2014\n\nPamela Rogers: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: --and a 100% college acceptance rate?\n\nPamela Rogers: That's correct.\n\nLast year when Ne'Kiya and Calcea graduated, all their classmates went to\ncollege and got scholarships. Ne'Kiya got a full ride to the pharmacy school\nat Xavier University in New Orleans. Calcea, the class valedictorian, is\nstudying environmental engineering at Louisiana State University.\n\nBill Whitaker: So wait a minute. Neither one of you is going to pursue a\ncareer in math?\n\nBoth: No. (laugh)\n\nCalcea Johnson: I may take up a minor in math. But I don't want that to be my\njob job.\n\nNe'Kiya Jackson: Yeah. People might expect too much out of me if (laugh) I\nbecome a mathematician. (laugh)\n\nBut math is not completely in their rear-view mirrors. This spring they\nsubmitted their high school proofs for final peer review and publication ...\nand are still working on further proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. Since\ntheir first two ...\n\nCalcea Johnson: We found five. And then we found a general format that could\npotentially produce at least five additional proofs.\n\nBill Whitaker: And you're not math geniuses?\n\nBoth: No.\n\nBill Whitaker: I'm not buying it.
