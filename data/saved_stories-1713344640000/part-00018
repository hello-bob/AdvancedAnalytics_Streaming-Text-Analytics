WebXR, too, will offer opportunities\nto continue to expand XR (eXtended Reality), in the model of the Web - and\nthat is most ideally experienced through a browser built for XR. It\u2019s true\nthat XR is full of interesting things, but huge amount of information is\nalready on the web and will continue to be created on the web. You don\u2019t want\nto leave the immersive environment to access it. Wolvic also lets you find\nimmersive stuff on the web and jump into it.\n\nWolvic is built for XR, and that matters. How we interact with content in XR\nis fundamentally different than interacting on a mobile device or desktop\ncomputer. Instead of being limited to 2D surfaces, everything can be placed in\n3D (including multiple 2D surfaces!). Wolvic rethinks content interaction in\nways that make sense for XR.\n\n## Target devices and how to get Wolvic\n\nOur first focus is on AOSP-based, stand-alone XR systems and HarmonyOS\ntethered systems, including: Huawei VR Glass, HTC Vive Focus, Oculus, Pico\nInteractive, Magic Leap 2, and Lynx. We are also hoping to work with companies\nsuch Lenovo to get the browser running in their XR devices.\n\nLook for the Wolvic in the Huawei AppGallery, the Oculus App store, and the\nPico Store, or you can download and build it yourself.\n\n## Join the pack: Help us make Wolvic a success\n\nIf you have one of these devices, you can help make this project successful,\nreach stable release sooner, help us enrich browser diversity in the XR space,\nand ensure the web remains important and vibrant in XR, by helping us test it\nout on your device. Bugs can be filed on the GitHub repository.\n\n## About Wolvic: Origins\n\nWolvic begins a new branch of the evolutionary tree of the Firefox Reality\nBrowser. Firefox Reality was an interesting and important development that\nbegan in Mozilla Research while XR devices were still quite young.\n\nSince then, more mature standalone devices have entered much wider consumer\nmarkets and the Firefox Reality Browser project needed new investment, updates\nand nurturing. In 2022, Igalia took over stewardship of this project and are\ncalling the project \u201cWolvic\u201d.\n\nLegal terms Privacy\n\n2024 Igalia SL\n\n", "frontpage": false}
