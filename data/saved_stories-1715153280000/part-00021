Credit: CAST\n\nHELSINKI \u2014 China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 spacecraft appears to carry a previously\nundisclosed lunar rover as part of the mission\u2019s far side exploration plans.\n\nChang\u2019e-6 launched on a Long March 5 rocket from Wenchang early May 3. The\nmission will attempt to bring back to Earth the first ever samples from the\nlunar far side.\n\nChina had disclosed objectives, a landing site and science payloads for the\nmission ahead of launch. However, following launch, the spacecraft\u2019s maker,\nthe China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), revealed an image showing a\nrover attached to the mission lander.\n\nChang\u2019e-6 is a backup to the 2020 Chang\u2019e-5 nearside sample return mission.\nWith that mission successful, Chang\u2019e-6 has been repurposed for a more\nambitious lunar far side sampling mission. A similar process saw the backup\nChang\u2019e-4 mission land in Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater on the lunar far side, following\nthe success of the Chang\u2019e-3 lander and rover mission.\n\nThe Chang\u2019e-6 mission includes new, international payloads\u2014from France,\nSweden, Italy, and a Pakistani cubesat\u2014and now an additional rover, something\nnot carried by Chang\u2019e-5.\n\nLittle is known about the rover, but a mention of a Chang\u2019e-6 rover is made in\na post from the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics (SIC) under the Chinese Academy\nof Sciences (CAS). It suggests the small vehicle carries an infrared imaging\nspectrometer.\n\n> Yeah, okay. That looks like a previously undisclosed mini rover on the side\n> of the Chang'e-6 lander lol. Via CAST: https://t.co/gS0Jy5L9hw\n> pic.twitter.com/9vvTnribpl\n>\n> \u2014 Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) May 3, 2024\n\nThe payload would utilize how different minerals and compounds absorb and emit\ninfrared radiation in characteristic ways to determine the composition of\nrocks, soil, and regolith on the lunar surface. This could be used for water\ndetection.\n\nIt is not clear how the rover, attached to the side of the lander, will\ndescend to the surface. It could be released, or use a foldout ladder or other\nmechanism. The rover may communicate with the lander using WiFi. Given the\ndiminutive size of the vehicle and short lifetime of the mission lander, it is\nlikely the rover will have limited operational time and objectives.\n\nChina\u2019s Tianwen-1 orbiter and rover imaged in deep space by an ejected camera\nin October 2020. Credit: CNSA\n\n## Surprise packages\n\nIt is not the first time China has included bonus spacecraft on missions.\nChina\u2019s Tianwen-1 Mars provided a series of punctuated surprises. It first\nreleased a disposable spacecraft while on its transfer orbit, taking pictures\nof the Tianwen-1 orbiter in deep space on its way to Mars.\n\nThe Zhurong rover, which landed on the Red Planet as part of the mission, also\ndropped a camera. This imaged the posing rover and used WiFi to send images to\nZhurong.\n\nThe Tianwen-1 orbiter then repeated the selfie trick with another detachable\ncamera while in orbit around Mars.\n\n## Chang\u2019e-6 mission timeline\n\nChang\u2019e-6 is likely to reach the moon late Tuesday Eastern (early Wednesday\nUTC, May 8) and enter lunar orbit. China has yet to publish a clear, official\ntimeline for the mission. It is however expected to last 53 days from launch\ntill landing, according to information published by the Deep Space Exploration\nLaboratory (DSEL) under the China National Space Administration (CNSA).\n\nLighting conditions over the target landing area within Apollo crater will\nlikely not be immediately suitable for a landing and surface operations.\nSunset over Apollo crater will occur early UTC May 13, according to moon\nobservation software.\n\nSunrise will occur May 28, meaning Chang\u2019e-6 will likely attempt to land early\nJune. This means the spacecraft will spend more than three weeks in lunar\norbit before attempting landing. Timing of the attempt will be dependent on\nthe spacecraft\u2019s orbit and constraints regarding surface lighting conditions\nfor generating power.\n\nSampling operations will, as with Chang\u2019e-5, likely be wrapped up within 48\nhours of landing. Samples will be sent into lunar orbit via an ascent vehicle,\nwhich will then track the Chang\u2019e-6 orbiter. Based on the earlier mission, the\npair will likely rendezvous and dock around two days after launch, with the\nascender to be discarded a further couple of days later.\n\nThe orbiter would then prepare to leave lunar orbit at a calculated time. It\nwould then release a reentry capsule just ahead of its return to Earth, around\nJune 25. The orbiter will likely fire its engines to send the spacecraft onto\na secondary mission, should it have remaining propellant. The Chang\u2019e-5\norbiter visited Sun-Earth Lagrange point 1 and entered a lunar distant\nretrograde orbit as part of extended missions.\n\nIf successful, samples delivered by the Chang\u2019e-6 mission could change our\nunderstanding of the Earth and moon. They could also provide new clues as to\nthe history of the early solar system.\n\n### Related\n\n#### China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-7 moon mission to target Shackleton crater\n\nChina will attempt to land on the illuminated rim of Shackleton crater near\nthe lunar south pole with its 2026 Chang\u2019e-7 mission.\n\n#### China ready to launch lunar far side sample return mission\n\nChina rolled out the rocket to launch its Chang\u2019e-6 mission early Saturday,\nwith the aim of collecting the first lunar far side samples.\n\n#### China launches Chang\u2019e-6 mission to collect first samples from the moon\u2019s\nfar side\n\nChina launched its complex and ambitious Chang\u2019e-6 mission Friday to collect\nthe first ever samples from the far side of the moon.\n\nTagged: chang'e 5, Chang'e 6, China, Moon\n\n## Andrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones covers China's space industry for SpaceNews.
