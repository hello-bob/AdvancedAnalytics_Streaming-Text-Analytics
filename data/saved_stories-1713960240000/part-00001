I\nthink Sublime has been around since the start of my \"real\" career over 10\nyears ago, but I could be mistaken1. It certainly feels that long. And in that\ntime I have never gotten upset with Sublime. I've never rage quit or ran into\nan issue of Sublime not being able to do the thing I wanted it to do. As much\nof a cliche it may sound: it just works.\n\nEven when I switch editors (VSCode, Geany, kitty+vim etc.) for a period of\ntime, I find myself always coming back to Sublime. The only reason I try other\neditors is simply that: to try them. Maybe that's why these editors don't\nclick with me. Maybe I'm giving Sublime an unfair advantage since I'm simply\n\"testing\" other editors, rather than looking for a solid alternative.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I understand why editors like VSCode are extremely\npopular. VSCode has a massive ecosystem and new plugins are generally\ndeveloped for that editor before all others. Finding solutions to problems\nonline is very easy, since it is so popular. But best of all - it's open\nsource2.\n\nSo why am I using a non-open source editor? (Spoilers: because it's a great\neditor)\n\n## \"A Proprietary Editor - How Could You?!\"\n\nI know, I know. If you're familiar with me or the things I write about it must\nseem odd that I would willingly use proprietary software over open source.\nThis is something I struggle with constantly day-to-day in the realm of\n\"personal tech\". I find with age I become more open-minded to having a diverse\nrange of software and hardware choices. Open source is best in concept but not\nalways best in practice.\n\nThe problem is that Sublime is just such a great editor. I can't ignore\nquality and refuse to use good software solely based on it's licensing. A few\npersonal things I love about Sublime:\n\n  * Incredibly fast\n  * Handles massive files without breaking a sweat\n  * Minimal resource footprint (ex. uses <0.1% CPU working on huge projects)\n  * Large ecosystem of plugins/themes\n  * No Electron\n\nOther editors can certainly check off a few of those boxes as well, but you'd\nbe hard-pressed to find one that checks off them all.\n\n## Being a Cheapskate\n\nI must confess something that I think most Sublime users are guilty of: I've\nnever bought a license. I've installed and used Sublime on countless machines,\non multiple operating systems from Linux to Windows to MacOS. That\nUnregistered text in the top right application bar has been with me since the\nbeginning. But that in no longer the case.\n\nI finally purchased a license. I bundled it with Sublime Merge, so it ended up\ncosting me $168 USD. When I initially looked at that price tag I must admit I\nwas tempted to close the browser tab and forget the whole thing. But then I\nrealized I have been using this editor free of charge for over 10 years. (Not\nto mention using Sublime Merge for quite some time as well!)\n\nSo I did a little math:\n\n    \n    \n    $168 / 10 years = $16.80\n\nLooking at it in that perspective, it's actually a great deal. Not to mention\nthey have very respectable terms for their licenses:\n\n> Personal licenses come with 3 years of updates. After 3 years, you'll be\n> able to continue to use the last version released within 3 years of purchase\n> (in other words, licenses do not expire). Any versions released 3 years or\n> more after the purchase date will require a paid upgrade to use.\n>\n> Individual licenses are valid for 3 years of updates, but do not expire\n> after 3 years. Only if you wish to use newer versions will an upgrade fee be\n> required.\n>\n> Licenses are per-user, so you're welcome to use the one license on all\n> computers and operating systems where you are the primary user.\n\nI won't copy everything from their main FAQ page but as you can see it is very\nreasonable. I also get to feel decent for supporting developers who make very\ngood software.\n\n## Final Notes\n\nThis post is not meant to convince you to switch or anything of that nature.\nUse what works for you! I just wanted to share my own personal preference when\nit came to my main text editor. Maybe this will also convince \"hardcore\" open\nsource people (like me!) to realize it is okay to pay for software\nsometimes...\n\nI should be very clear about something: this post is not an advertisement. I\nhave not received any money or \"kick backs\" to write about my happy times with\nSublime. This is purely my own opinion that I wanted to share with the\ninternet!\n\nBTW if anyone from SublimeHQ happens to come across this post: PLEASE look\ninto building a \"native\" version of Sublime Text for FreeBSD/OpenBSD. I (and\nmany others) would be forever grateful!\n\n  1. Sublime does mention copyright since 2006... \u21a9\n\n  2. Not the pre-packaged Microsoft version \u21a9\n\nAdd a comment\n\n\u2190 New Domain and Code Forge | posts | Switching Things Over to ikiwiki \u2192\n\nLast edited January 2, 2024 Created January 2, 2024 Powered by ikiwiki and\nFreeBSD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
