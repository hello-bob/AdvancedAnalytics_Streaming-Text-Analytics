Credit: Wikipedia/CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nIn a first-ever human clinical trial of four adult patients, an mRNA cancer\nvaccine developed at the University of Florida quickly reprogrammed the immune\nsystem to attack glioblastoma, the most aggressive and lethal brain tumor.\n\nThe results mirror those in 10 pet dog patients suffering from naturally\noccurring brain tumors whose owners approved of their participation, as they\nhad no other treatment options, as well as results from preclinical mouse\nmodels. The breakthrough now will be tested in a Phase I pediatric clinical\ntrial for brain cancer.\n\nReported May 1 in the journal Cell, the discovery represents a potential new\nway to recruit the immune system to fight notoriously treatment-resistant\ncancers using an iteration of mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticles, similar\nto COVID-19 vaccines, but with two key differences: use of a patient's own\ntumor cells to create a personalized vaccine, and a newly engineered complex\ndelivery mechanism within the vaccine.\n\n\"Instead of us injecting single particles, we're injecting clusters of\nparticles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of\nonions,\" said senior author Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric\noncologist who pioneered the new vaccine, which like other immunotherapies\nattempts to \"educate\" the immune system that a tumor is foreign.\n\n\"And the reason we've done that in the context of cancer is these clusters\nalert the immune system in a much more profound way than single particles\nwould.\"\n\nAmong the most impressive findings was how quickly the new method, delivered\nintravenously, spurred a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor,\nsaid Sayour, principal investigator of the RNA Engineering Laboratory within\nUF's Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy and a UF Health\nCancer Center and McKnight Brain Institute investigator who led the multi-\ninstitution research team.\n\n\"In less than 48 hours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer\nto as 'cold'\u2014immune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune\nresponse\u2014to 'hot,' very active immune response,\" he said.\n\n\"That was very surprising given how quick this happened, and what that told us\nis we were able to activate the early part of the immune system very rapidly\nagainst these cancers, and that's critical to unlock the later effects of the\nimmune response.\"\n\nGlioblastoma is among the most devastating diagnoses, with median survival\naround 15 months. The current standard of care involves surgery, radiation and\nsome combination of chemotherapy.\n\nThe new publication is the culmination of promising translational results over\nseven years of studies, starting in preclinical mouse models and then in a\nclinical trial of 10 pet dogs that had spontaneously developed terminal brain\ncancer and had no other treatment options.\n\nThat trial was conducted with owners' consent in collaboration with the UF\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine. Dogs offer a naturally occurring model for\nmalignant glioma because they are the only other species that develops\nspontaneous brain tumors with some frequency, said Sheila Carrera-Justiz,\nD.V.M., a veterinary neurologist at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who\nis partnering with Sayour on the clinical trials. Gliomas in dogs are\nuniversally terminal, she said.\n\nAfter treating pet dogs that had spontaneously developed brain cancer with\npersonalized mRNA vaccines, Sayour's team advanced the research to a small\nFood and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial designed to ensure safety\nand test feasibility before expanding to a larger trial.\n\nIn a cohort of four patients, genetic material called RNA was extracted from\neach patient's own surgically removed tumor, and then messenger RNA, or\nmRNA\u2014the blueprint of what is inside every cell, including tumor cells\u2014was\namplified and wrapped in the newly designed high-tech packaging of\nbiocompatible lipid nanoparticles, to make tumor cells \"look\" like a dangerous\nvirus when reinjected into the bloodstream and prompt an immune-system\nresponse. The vaccine was personalized to each patient with a goal of getting\nthe most out of their unique immune system.\n\n\"The demonstration that making an mRNA cancer vaccine in this fashion\ngenerates similar and strong responses across mice, pet dogs that have\ndeveloped cancer spontaneously and human patients with brain cancer is a\nreally important finding, because oftentimes we don't know how well the\npreclinical studies in animals are going to translate into similar responses\nin patients,\" said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., director of the UF Clinical\nand Translational Science Institute and the UF Brain Tumor Immunotherapy\nProgram and a co-author of the paper.\n\n\"And while mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are certainly a hot topic since the\nCOVID pandemic, this is a novel and unique way of delivering the mRNA to\ngenerate these really significant and rapid immune responses that we're seeing\nacross animals and humans.\"\n\nWhile too early in the trial to assess the clinical effects of the vaccine,\nthe patients either lived disease-free longer than expected or survived longer\nthan expected.\n\nThe 10 pet dogs lived a median of 139 days, compared with a median survival of\n30 to 60 days typical for dogs with the condition.\n\nThe next step, through support from the Food and Drug Administration and the\nCureSearch for Children's Cancer foundation, will be an expanded Phase I\nclinical trial to include up to 24 adult and pediatric patients to validate\nthe findings.\n\nOnce an optimal and safe dose is confirmed, an estimated 25 children would\nparticipate in Phase II, said Sayour, an associate professor in the Lillian S.\nWells Department of Neurosurgery and the department of pediatrics in the UF\nCollege of Medicine, part of UF Health.\n\nFor the new clinical trial, Sayour's lab will partner with a multi-institution\nconsortium, the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, to send the immunotherapy\ntreatment to children's hospitals across the country. They will do this by\nreceiving an individual patient's tumor, manufacturing the personalized\nvaccine at UF and sending it back to the patient's medical team, said Sayour,\nco-leader of the Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program at the UF\nHealth Cancer Center.\n\nDespite the promising results, the authors said one limitation is continued\nuncertainty about how best to harness the immune system while minimizing the\npotential for adverse side effects.\n\n\"I am hopeful that this could be a new paradigm for how we treat patients, a\nnew platform technology for how we can modulate the immune system,\" Sayour\nsaid.\n\n\"I am hopeful for how this could now synergize with other immunotherapies and\nperhaps unlock those immunotherapies. We showed in this paper that you\nactually can have synergy with other types of immunotherapies, so maybe now we\ncan have a combination approach of immunotherapy.\"\n\nSayour and Mitchell hold patents related to the vaccine which are under option\nto license by iOncologi Inc., a biotech company born as a \"spin out\" from UF\nin which Mitchell holds interest.\n\nMore information: RNA aggregates harness the danger response for potent cancer\nimmunotherapy, Cell (2024).
