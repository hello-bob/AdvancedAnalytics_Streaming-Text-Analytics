Those drops caused a\ndeadly multi-state outbreak in humans over many months last year, with at\nleast 81 people ultimately infected across 18 states. Fourteen people lost\ntheir vision, an additional four had eyeballs surgically removed, and four\npeople died.\n\nThe preliminary data on the dogs\u2014presented recently at a conference of disease\ndetectives hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014highlights\nthat now that the deadly outbreak strain has been introduced around the US, it\nhas the potential to lurk in unexpected places, spread its drug resistance to\nfellow bacteria, and cause new infections in people and animals who may have\nnever used the drops.\n\nThe two dogs in New Jersey were not known to have received the drops linked to\nthe outbreak: EzriCare Artificial Tears and two additional products made by\nthe same manufacturer, which were recalled in February 2023. Such over-the-\ncounter products are sometimes used in animals as well as people. But the\ndogs' separate owners said they didn't recall using the drops either. They\nalso didn't report any exposures in health care settings or recent\ninternational travel that could explain the infections. One of the dogs did,\nat one point, receive eye drops, but they were not an outbreak-associated\nbrand. The only connection between the two dogs was that they were both\ntreated at the same veterinary hospital, which didn't stock the outbreak-\nassociated eyedrops.\n\nThe dogs' infections were caught between March and June 2023 when clinicians\nat the veterinary hospital were working to address a chronic cough in one of\nthe dogs and a stubborn ear infection in the other, according to CBS News,\nwhich was present for the CDC's conference of its Epidemic Intelligence\nService in Atlanta. The ear and lung swabs were sent to an academic veterinary\nlaboratory in Pennsylvania, where a microbiologist noticed that bacteria from\nboth swabs had uncommon drug-resistance features. The microbiologist then\nuploaded genetic sequences of the bacterial strains to a national database,\nwhere they caught the attention of the CDC and state health authorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe genetic sequences uploaded were of the carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-\nresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CP-CRPA) strain\u2014and they were highly similar\nto the bacterial strain identified in the deadly eyedrop outbreak. These\nbacteria are extensively resistant to antibiotics, resisting even last-line\ndrugs, and can silently colonize animals and humans for months or years. An\ninvestigation ensued.\n\n## Infection gaps\n\nEmma Price, the CDC epidemic intelligence service officer who presented the\ninvestigation's findings at the conference, suggested it was fortunate they\nwere able to make the connection. \"Because [the academic veterinary\nlaboratory] had a grant and a veterinary microbiologist works there, he did\nhis great due diligence and uploaded the results. That's how we got the\nnotification, because the strain matched the outbreak strain,\" Price told CBS\nNews.\n\nHowever, the disease detectives were ultimately unable to identify exactly how\nthe two dogs became infected. \"Shared exposures included treatment in the\nveterinary hospital\u2019s surgical preparation and recovery areas for both canines\nand ophthalmology department visits by either the affected canine or another\nanimal in the same household,\" Price and colleagues wrote in their findings.\nBut all of the sampling done of the veterinary hospital where the dogs were\ntreated turned up negative for the eyedrop outbreak strain.\n\nIn the process of the investigation, the epidemiologists also conducted an\ninfection control assessment of the veterinary hospital, finding a variety of\n\"gaps.\" These included problems with hand hygiene practices, personal\nprotective equipment use\u2014including use of gloves\u2014and equipment and\nenvironmental cleaning and disinfection at the hospital. Price noted that\nthese problems are not uncommon and that there is a general lack of emphasis\non infection control in veterinary settings.\n\nThough Price and her colleagues were unable to identify the direct route of\ninfection, they suspect the dogs were likely infected either by exposure to a\ncontaminated product or secondary transmission at the veterinary hospital.\n\nBoth dogs have since made full recoveries, but because CRPA strains can\nsilently colonize many body sites on both humans and animals, it's possible\nthat the bacteria still linger on the dogs or on the other pets and people in\ntheir households. Price warned the owners of possible future transmission and\nrecommended they flag this risk to their health care providers. She also noted\nthe potential for the bacteria to spread from dog to dog. It would be ideal to\n\"keep the dogs away from other dogs in the future, which we understand is a\ndifficult thing to do,\" she said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n37\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
