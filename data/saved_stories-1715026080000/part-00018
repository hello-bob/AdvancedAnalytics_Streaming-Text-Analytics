(#11277)\n  * Reduced main thread hangs under very high system load (#11278)\n\n### Zed 0.134.0\n\n05/01/2024\n\nDownload (Apple silicon)\n\nDownload (Intel chip)\n\nDownload (Universal binary)\n\n## Enhancements\n\n### General\n\n  * Added the ability to open directories using macOS context menu (Right click -> Open With -> Zed).\n  * Added support for avatars in git blame for repositories hosted on codeberg (#11043).\n  * Added diagnostics for main-thread hangs on macOS. These are only enabled if you've opted into diagnostics.\n  * Added support for replacing the current preview tab when using code navigation (enable_preview_from_code_navigation).\n  * Added icons for JS, React, C, and C++ file types.\n  * Improved the behavior of launching an empty already-running Zed application by respecting the user's restore_on_startup setting.

The original behavior can be restored by adding the following section to your keybindings:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"context\": \"ProjectPanel\", \"bindings\": { \"backspace\": \"project_panel::Delete\", \"delete\": \"project_panel::Delete\", } }\n\n  * Added displaying of cursor markers in the scrollbar.
