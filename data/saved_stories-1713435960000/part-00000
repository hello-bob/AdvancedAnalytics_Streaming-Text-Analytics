On this measure, TikTok Shop outperformed other e-commerce\nplatforms, including Temu, Shein, and Etsy, as well as fellow social-commerce\nchannels Whatnot, Flip, and Instagram Checkout. It also performed better than\nWalmart.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAmazon was the only e-commerce platform that beat TikTok Shop in Earnest's\ndataset, which looked at customer-retention data between January 2022 and\nFebruary 2024. That company saw around 36% of shoppers return after five\nmonths of their first purchase.\n\nAbout one in 10 US households have made a TikTok Shop purchase since\nSeptember, when the platform rolled out in the US, per Earnest's analysis.\n\nMichael Maloof, head of marketing at Earnest, said that TikTok Shop has been\nable to build a customer base in a relatively short period of time because it\nalready has the attention of millions of potential buyers. While Temu\nreportedly spent $2 billion on Facebook and Instagram advertising to acquire\nnew customers in 2023, TikTok was able to tap into its existing large and\ndedicated user base.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Ultimately, they didn't have to really spend to market this product. It was\nalready in everyone's pocket,\" Maloof told Business Insider.\n\nThe timing of the platform's launch \u2014 in the fall of 2023 \u2014 also likely gave\nit an advantage, as it came when people were shopping for the holidays. TikTok\nran several Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions at the time, offering big\ndiscount coupons to users and credits to sellers who uploaded engaging\nshopping videos.\n\n## TikTok's recommendation algorithm is its secret sauce\n\nTikTok Shop's sales are driven heavily by customers who stick around. More\nthan 81% of its sales in February came from repeat customers, up from 64% in\nNovember, per Earnest's dataset.\n\nThe app's sophisticated recommendation algorithm may be driving repeat sales.\nIt's optimized to show users content tied to what they've already engaged\nwith. When it comes to shopping, that means spinning up videos related to\nproducts a user has already bought, which may help drive additional purchases.\n\n\"When you are purchasing a product and you are engaging with that content,\nyou're going to start getting more of that kind of content,\" Nicole\nRechtszaid, cofounder at the social-commerce firm and TikTok Shop partner\nGhost Agency, told BI. \"The second I bought my first TikTok Shop product,\nwhich was probably a year and a half ago, from that moment on, I started to\nget more TikTok Shop content.\"\n\nTikTok Shop seems to have become a place for impulse purchases, as well.\nEarnest's data shows that TikTok shoppers make an average of one or two\npurchases a month, with an average transaction size of $40. They typically buy\none item at a time rather than building a cart of products like they might\nwith other online retailers.\n\n\"These are pretty small transactions that aren't generating too much cognitive\ndissonance,\" Maloof said. \"Not many people are going to think too critically\nabout spending $40 or a little less on a transaction.\"\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Marketing leaders from TikTok, Roku, Mastercard and more tell\nInsider how consumer behavior has changed across industries\n\nTikTok Amazon\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
