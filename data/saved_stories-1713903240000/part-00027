A lot has changed in the\nlast 12 months. It\u2019s been...intense:\n\n  * In June, we went viral with the AI Analyst\u2728. Like, 30 million views on social media and 100k sign-ups in a week viral.\n\n  * Then, just 2 weeks later, we removed the rows.com homepage and introduced Instant Rows\u26a1, the fastest way to start a spreadsheet in the world.\n\n  * The summer was busy: we added Combo charts, Pivot tables, Hyperlinks, Descriptions, and Footnotes to Tables.\n\n  * After the Summer break, we launched a Notion Integration alongside 300+ handcrafted Notion avatars for anyone who took part in the launch.\n\n  * We ended 2023 with a big AI Analyst update, support for more currencies, and tens of other smaller improvements.\n\n  * 2024 started with our Hackathon Launch Week. Our RowsX extension and side-by-side Charts stole the show. But we also launched a new CMD+K experience, a Google Ads Integration, a cool Custom Color picker, and the ability to hide Rows/Cols.\n\n  * We wrapped Q1 with Comments, Recommended Reports, and the AI Analyst 2.0, including AI-generated subtitles for Charts and Tables.\n\nWe went off script a couple of times with unconventional brand campaigns. We\nloved doing an homage to the early computer age with a retro Reference Card,\nthe mock billboard campaign, and this year\u2019s April Fools.\n\nThrough it all we kept sharing: How we\u2019re thinking about AI, how we used\nReddit as a growth marketing channel, the details of Instant Rows, and the\nweekly CEO diary on building Rows.\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words. But what about an embed? I say\nit is worth more. Almost 1 million.\n\n## Rows 4.0\n\nNow that 3.0 is done, we\u2019re moving to the next integer.\n\nLast week, Humberto wrote a blogpost with a short story titled \u201cA Week in the\nLife of our Customer\u201d. It\u2019s our not-so-secret plan. Think of it as a blueprint\nto 10x the life of business users and spreadsheet wizards. We are committed to\nbeing the fastest spreadsheet for importing data, the easiest one at analyzing\nit, and the prettiest when sharing it.\n\nIn practice, this means:\n\n  * More integrations and (a lot more) templates to get started.\n\n  * New (and old) ways to transform data with the help of AI.\n\n  * Big updates to how your reports look and feel when shared. The spreadsheet IS the dashboard, the report, and the presentation!\n\nSome of the features you can expect in the next 12 months\n\nBack to building the spreadsheet.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, visit rows.com to see a modern spreadsheet at work.\n\nHint: It doesn\u2019t need a homepage \ud83d\ude09\n\nNext\n\n10 Best Excel Alternatives & Competitors in 2024\n\nIn this article we are going to review the best Excel alternatives you can use\nin 2024.\n\n\ud83c\udf6a\n\nWe use cookies to enhance your user experience and analyze website\nperformance.
