Here we can look\nover the shoulders of two giants and see them working together.\n\nScience writers are sometimes fond of \u2018Eureka\u2019 moments. The original legend is\nthat Archimedes exclaimed \u2018Eureka', Greek for \u2018I have found it\u2019 when he\nrealized that the volume of water displaced from his bath must equal the\nvolume of his own body. Archimedes reportedly used his discovery to test\nwhether a golden crown had been debased with cheaper silver.\n\nThe authenticity of this story is dubious. A more authentic \u2018Eureka\u2019 moment is\ndocumented by mathematician Gauss writing EUREKA in one of his notebooks on\nthe discovery of the proof of a theorem in number theory.\n\nGold mining in California led to Eureka becoming the state\u2019s motto:\n\n> During the 1849 California State Constitutional Convention at Monterey, the\n> delegates had to agree upon a design for the Great Seal of California, which\n> included a representative motto. ... Since the seal\u2019s design included a gold\n> miner, it seemed most fitting to the delegates to adopt this phrase as the\n> State Motto. It became the official State Motto in 1963. Seventeen\n> California locations bear the name Eureka.\n\nToday\u2019s post is about a Eureka moment in the 1950s that would be far more\nvaluable for California, and for the world, than any gold find. It was a key\nstep towards the development of the modern integrated circuit. Like Gauss\u2019s\ndiscovery, it\u2019s documented in a handwritten notebook.\n\n> Incidentally, I\u2019m a big fan of\n>\n> Noted\n>\n> by\n>\n> Jillian Hess\n>\n> , a Substack that shares the contents of notebooks written by a wide range\n> of writers, artists, scientists, and much more.\n\nThe integrated circuit was invented twice. First, by Jack Kilby at Texas\nInstruments in September 1958, and then independently, a few months later, by\nRobert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. Noyce\u2019s monolithic version formed the\nbasis for future development and commercialization of the integrated circuit.\n\nA crucial earlier step in the creation of the monolithic integrated circuit\nwas the development of the \u2018planar process\u2019 for manufacturing transistors by\nJean Hoerni, a physicist colleague of Noyce\u2019s at Fairchild. Hoerni had been\nborn in Switzerland and educated there and in the U.K. After traveling to the\nU.S., he worked at Shockley Semiconductor before joining Noyce and Gordon\nMoore as one of the \u2018traitorous eight\u2019 engineers who left Shockley to found\nFairchild Semiconductor.\n\nFairchild Semiconductor started operations on 1 October 1957 at unremarkable\noffices in Palo Alto.\n\nFairchild Semiconductor\u2019s Original Offices in Palo Alto - By Dicklyon -\nCopyrighted free use, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2990329\n\nMost of the \u2018traitorous eight\u2019 were grappling with getting the company started\nand with issues with making \u2018mesa\u2019 transistors, so-called because, like a\ngeological mesa, they stood proud from the surrounding silicon chip.\n\nHoerni was diverted with something else though. Gordon Moore later wrote:\n\n> Where most of us were setting up the facilities and developing the early\n> processes, Hoerni was drawing in his notebook.\n\nAt Fairchild, like other researchers, Hoerni kept \u2018patent notebooks\u2019 in which\nhe methodically recorded his experiments and results, for use in subsequent\npatent applications. Hoerni was sketching his ideas for the \u2018planar process\u2019\nwhich would create transistors embedded into the \u2018plain\u2019 of the chip.\n\nHoerni\u2019s entries in the notebook where he documented the planar process start\nwith a heading that provides a brief description of what is to follow:\n\n> December 1, 1957\n>\n> Method of protecting exposed p-n junctions at the surface of transistors by\n> oxide masking techniques\n\nThe next page has Hoerni\u2019s illustration of a wafer with holes created where\nthe oxide layer has been removed.\n\nAnd below this, is the first cross-section illustration of Hoerni\u2019s idea.1\n\n> Added oxide layer after the diffusion of the base impurity.\n\nThe added silicon dioxide layer would protect the exposed \u2018p-n\u2019 junction\nexposed at the surface of the transistor.\n\nNext to the diagram is a short inscription made in a different hand:\n\n> Read and understood Dec 1, 1957 R. N. Noyce\n\nHoerni had shown his idea to Robert Noyce on the same day he drew it in his\nnotebook.\n\nIt would be many months, though, before Hoerni and his colleagues could test\nthe idea. According to Gordon Moore, they were delayed by the limitations of\ntheir photolithography:\n\n> Even at Fairchild, we did not attempt to make Hoerni\u2019s planar structure for\n> some time after he proposed it. The original photolithography we developed\n> only made three masks in a set. To make Hoerni\u2019s planar transistor took a\n> set of four.\n\nWhen they did manage to try Hoerni\u2019s idea then, according to Moore, \u201cthe\nresults were fantastic\u201d. Particularly important was that this new approach led\nto transistors that were better suited to the demanding environments where one\nkey customer wanted to use them: in intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n> We had an approach that would allow us to make the highly reliable\n> transistors that were being specified for the Minuteman intercontinental\n> missiles.\n\nFairchild would file Hoerni\u2019s idea as this patent, No 3,025,589, dated May 1,\n1959, with Hoerni as the sole inventor.\n\nExtract from Hoerni\u2019s Patent Application - see the link at the end of this\npost for the full patent\n\nThis was a big step forward. Hoerni published details of the planar process in\nan October 1960 paper Planar Silicon Diodes and Transistors where he\nhighlighted one key advantage of his approach:\n\n> Another advantage of planar structures is that they are the natural first\n> step in any integrated approach where several elements, transistors or\n> diodes, are built simultaneously on the same piece of semiconductor.\n\nAn integrated approach!\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t yet, quite, the monolithic integrated circuit. The\nillustration of the final state of Hoerni\u2019s device in the patent shows three\nvertical wires attached to the surface of the \u2018chip\u2019. To create a working\ncircuit these wires would have to be attached, probably by hand, in what would\nhave been an expensive and time-consuming process and one that would probably\nprevent transistors from being made much smaller.\n\nBut Robert Noyce hadn't just read and understood Hoerni\u2019s idea. He carried on\nthinking about it and soon contributed his own crucial idea: to add a layer of\nmetal connecting the transistors as an additional stage in the manufacturing\nprocess. By doing so he invented the monolithic integrated circuit.\n\nNoyce\u2019s patent for a \u201csemiconductor device-and-lead structure'\u201c No 2,981,877\nwas filed just three months after Hoerni\u2019s.\n\nThe modern semiconductor industry is built on Hoerni\u2019s and Noyce\u2019s ideas. The\nComputer History Museum records what happened next and its importance:\n\n> Fairchild introduced the 2N1613 planar transistor commercially in April 1960\n> and licensed rights to the process across the industry. The billion-\n> transistor integrated circuits of today rely on Hoerni's breakthrough idea.\n> One historian has called it \"the most important innovation in the history of\n> the semiconductor industry.\"\n\nBy 1965 Fairchild was making \u2018monolithic\u2019 integrated circuits with 60\ncomponents and Gordon Moore felt confident enough to make his famous\nprediction of a doubling of the number of components every year.\n\n#### Moore on Moore\n\nBabbage\n\n\u00b7\n\nJan 21\n\nRead full story\n\nI caught a shiver down my spine reading Hoerni\u2019s original diagrams and Noyce\u2019s\ncomment and signature. It\u2019s often said that we stand on the shoulders of\ngiants. Here we can look over the shoulders of two giants and see them working\ntogether.\n\nRobert Noyce died in 1990. Jean Hoerni in 1997. Jack Kilby was awarded the\nNobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for the invention of the integrated circuit.\nNoyce, and I think Hoerni too, had they lived, would surely have shared that\nprize with Kilby.\n\n####\n\nPostscript\n\nThere is a label stuck on the inside cover of Hoerni\u2019s notebook, instructing\nthe researcher to:\n\n> Make all entries legibly, neatly and in ink.
