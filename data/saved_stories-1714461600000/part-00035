The outlet points out that in 2022, the\nBrownsville, Texas facility reported 4.8 injuries per 100 workers. That number\njumped to 5.9 in 2023. For reference, the aerospace industry average is 0.8\ninjuries per 100 workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nDid Musk Propose Hyperloop to Stop California High-Speed Rail?\n\nNASA Spent $5 Million On Probe Into Drug Use At SpaceX, But Won't Release The\nDetails\n\nAccording to Bob: Public Transit Is a Car Enthusiast's Best Friend\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nAccording to Bob: Public Transit Is a Car Enthusiast's Best Friend\n\nHowever, those numbers may not be telling the whole story. Last year, Reuters\ninvestigated these injury numbers and found at least 600 previously unreported\nworker injuries at SpaceX. Some of those injuries led to crushed limbs,\namputations, and serious head injuries as well as a death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2023 data is the most complete report provided by SpaceX to date, and it\nhighlights injuries from eight major facilities, two more than in 2022. In\nprevious years, Musk\u2019s company hadn\u2019t reported any data for most of its sites,\nincluding manufacturing and launching facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraphic: Reuters\n\nThese astronomical (I\u2019m so sorry) injury rates should be a great cause for\nconcern for SpaceX clients like NASA, according to safety experts. From\nReuters:\n\n> The federal space program has increasingly relied on SpaceX in recent years\n> and as of 2022 had paid the company at least $11.8 billion for various\n> contracts.\n>\n> \u201cNASA should be concerned about the quality of the work,\u201d said David\n> Michaels, a former OSHA administrator who is now a professor at The George\n> Washington University. High injury rates, he added, can be \u201can indicator of\n> poor production quality.\u201d\n>\n> A NASA spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe further you delve into these numbers from SpaceX, the more alarming it\ngets. A unit that retrieves rocket boosters in the Pacific Ocean has reported\n7.6 injuries per 100 workers. That is nine times higher than the industry\naverage. In other words, SpaceX is a menace to safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the eight facilities reported by SpaceX, not a single one is at or below\nthe industry average. If you want to work at the aerospace company and\nmitigate the risk of being injured as much as possible, you\u2019ll need to work at\nits Redmond facility which still had a 1.5 injuries per 100 workers rate in\n2023.\n\nShockingly, neither Musk or SpaceX as a whole have ever commented on the\ncompany\u2019s disastrous safety record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
