He has been committed to the supreme court for\ntrial.\n\n> ABC IT staff are being instructed by police to search through our internal\n> email systems for key words.

It\u2019s a dangerous law\nthat goes too far and damages press freedom and should urgently be reformed,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nThe media union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, said the ABC raid\nrepresented \u201ca disturbing attempt to intimidate legitimate news journalism\nthat was in the public interest\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n  * Australian federal police\n  * Australian security and counter-terrorism\n  * Australian media\n  * Sydney\n  * Press freedom\n  * New South Wales\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Australia\n  * World\n  * AU politics\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Indigenous Australia\n  * Immigration\n  * Media\n  * Business\n  * Science\n  * Tech\n  * Podcasts\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
