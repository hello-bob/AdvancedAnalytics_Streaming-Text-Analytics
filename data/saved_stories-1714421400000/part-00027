They are named for Richard Beeching, then-chair of the\nBritish Railways Board and the author of two reports \u2013 The Reshaping of\nBritish Railways (1963) and The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes\n(1965) \u2013 that outlined the necessity^[citation needed] of improving the\nefficiency of the railways and the plan for achieving this through\nrestructuring.\n\nThe first report identified 2,363 stations and 5,000 miles (8,000 km) of\nrailway line for closure, amounting to 55% of stations, 30% of route miles,\nand the loss of 67,700 British Rail jobs,^[1] with an objective of stemming\nthe large losses being incurred during a period of increasing competition from\nroad transport and reducing the rail subsidies necessary to keep the network\nrunning. The second report identified a small number of major routes for\nsignificant investment. Such was the scale of these cuts that the programme\ncame to be colloquially referred to as the Beeching Axe, though the 1963\nreport also recommended some less well-publicised changes; including a switch\nto the now-standard practice of containerisation for rail freight, and the\nreplacement of some services with integrated bus services linked to the\nremaining railheads.\n\nProtests resulted in the saving of some stations and lines, but the majority\nwere closed as planned. Beeching's name remains associated with the mass\nclosure of railways and the loss of many local services in the period that\nfollowed. A few of these routes have since reopened. Some short sections have\nbeen preserved as heritage railways, while others have been incorporated into\nthe National Cycle Network or used for road schemes. Others have since been\nbuilt over, have reverted to farmland, or remain derelict with no plans for\nany reuse or redevelopment. Some, such as the bulk of the Midland Metro\nnetwork around Birmingham and Wolverhampton, have since been incorporated into\nlight rail lines.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nSee also: History of rail transport in Great Britain\n\nBanchory railway station on the Deeside Railway, Scotland, in 1961. The\nstation closed in 1966.\n\nAfter growing rapidly in the 19th century during the Railway Mania, the\nBritish railway system reached its height in the years immediately before the\nFirst World War, with a network of 23,440 miles (37,720 km).^[2] The network\nhad opened up major travel opportunities for the entire country that had never\nbeen available before. However, lines were sometimes uneconomic, and several\nMembers of Parliament had direct involvement with railways, creating a\nconflict of interest.^[3] In 1909, Winston Churchill, then President of the\nBoard of Trade, argued that the country's railways did not have a future\nwithout rationalisation and amalgamation.^[4] By 1914, the railways had some\nsignificant problems, such as a lack of standard rolling stock and too many\nduplicated routes.^[3]\n\nAfter the war, the railways faced increasing competition from a growing road\ntransport network, which had increased to 8 million tons of freight annually\nby 1921.^[5] Around 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of passenger railways closed\nbetween 1923 and 1939. These closures included the Charnwood Forest Railway,\nclosed to passengers in 1931, and the Harborne Line in Birmingham, closed to\npassengers in 1934.^[6]^[page needed] Some lines had never been profitable and\nwere not subject to loss of traffic in that period.^[7] The railways were busy\nduring the Second World War, but at the end of the war they were in a poor\nstate of repair and in 1948 nationalised as British Railways.\n\nThe Branch Lines Committee of the British Transport Commission (BTC) was\nformed in 1949 with a brief to close the least-used branch lines. This\nresulted in the loss (or conversion to freight-only operation) of some 3,318\nmiles (5,340 km) of railway between 1948 and 1962.^[6]^[page needed] The most\nsignificant closure was that of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint\nRailway in 1959. In opposition to these cuts, the period also witnessed the\nbeginning of a protest movement led by the Railway Development Association,\nwhose most famous member was the poet John Betjeman.^[8]^[page needed] They\nwent on to be a significant force resisting the Beeching proposals.\n\nEconomic recovery and the end of petrol rationing led to rapid growth in car\nownership and use. Vehicle mileage grew at a sustained annual rate of 10%\nbetween 1948 and 1964.^[9] In contrast, railway traffic remained steady during\nthe 1950s^[10] but the economic situation steadily deteriorated, with labour\ncosts rising faster than income^[8]^[page needed]^[10] and fares and freight\ncharges repeatedly frozen by the government to try to control\ninflation.^[8]^[page needed] By 1955, the railways' share of the transport\nmarket had dropped from 16% to 5%.^[11]\n\nThe 1955 Modernisation Plan promised expenditure of over \u00a31,240 million; steam\nlocomotives would be replaced with diesel and electric locomotives, traffic\nlevels would increase, and the system was predicted to be back in profit by\n1962.^[12]^[page needed] Instead losses mounted, from \u00a368 million in 1960 to\n\u00a387 million in 1961, and \u00a3104 million in 1962 (\u00a32.36 billion in 2021\nterms).^[13]^[14] The BTC could no longer pay the interest on its loans.\n\nBy 1961, losses were running at \u00a3300,000 a day;^[15] since nationalisation in\n1948, 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of line had been closed,^[16]^[failed\nverification] railway staff numbers had fallen 26% from 648,000 to\n474,000,^[17] and the number of railway wagons had fallen 29% from 1,200,000\nto 848,000.^[18]\n\n## The Beeching reports[edit]\n\n### The Reshaping of British Railways (Beeching I)[edit]\n\nA copy of The Reshaping of British Railways report, displayed beside the\nNational Union of Railwaymen's response pamphlet\n\nThe first Beeching report, titled The Reshaping of British Railways, was\npublished on 27 March 1963.^[19]\n\nThe report starts by quoting the brief provided by the Prime Minister, Harold\nMacmillan, from 1960: \"First, the industry must be of a size and pattern\nsuited to modern conditions and prospects. In particular, the railway system\nmust be modelled to meet current needs, and the modernisation plan must be\nadapted to this new shape\"^[20] and with the premise that the railways should\nbe run as a profitable business.^[21]\n\nBeeching first studied traffic flows on all lines to identify \"the good, the\nbad, and the indifferent\".^[22] His analysis showed that the least-used 1,762\nstations had annual passenger receipts of less than \u00a32,500 each (\u00a361,000 as of\n2024^[14]), that over half of the 4,300 stations open to passengers in 1960\nhad receipts of less than \u00a310,000,^[23] that the least-used 50% of stations\ncontributed only 2% of passenger revenue,^[24] and that one third of route\nmiles carried just 1% of passengers.^[25]\n\nBy way of example, he noted that the line from Thetford to Swaffham carried\nfive trains each weekday in each direction, carrying an average of nine\npassengers with only 10% of the costs of operating the line covered by fares;\nanother example was the Gleneagles-Crieff-Comrie line which had ten trains a\nday and five passengers on average, earning only 25% of costs. Finally there\nwas the service from Hull to York via Beverley (using part of the Yorkshire\nCoast Line, which was not closed, and the York to Beverley Line, which was).\nThe line covered 80% of its operating costs, but he calculated that it could\nbe closed because there was an alternative, albeit less direct, route.^[26]\n\nOut of 18,000 miles (29,000 km) of railway, Beeching recommended that 6,000\nmiles (9,700 km)\u2014mostly rural and industrial lines\u2014should be closed entirely,\nand that some of the remaining lines should be kept open only for freight. A\ntotal of 2,363 stations were to close, including 435 already under threat,\nboth on lines that were to close and on lines that were to remain open.^[27]\n\nHe recommended that freight services should mainly be for bulk commodities\nsuch as minerals and coal, and that the freight system make use of new\ncontainerised handling systems rather than less efficient and slower wagon-\nload traffic. The latter recommendation would prove prescient with the rise of\nintermodal freight transport in the following decades.^[28]\n\n### The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes (Beeching II)[edit]\n\nA map of Great Britain, showing \"major lines\" identified by Beeching II in\nbold\n\nOn 16 February 1965, Beeching introduced the second stage of his\nreorganisation of the railways. In his report, The Development of the Major\nRailway Trunk Routes, he set out his conclusion that of the 7,500 miles\n(12,100 km) of trunk railway only 3,000 miles (4,800 km) \"should be selected\nfor future development\" and invested in.\n\nThis policy would result in long-distance traffic being routed along nine\nlines. Traffic to Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland\nwould be routed through the West Coast Main Line to Carlisle and Glasgow;\ntraffic to the north-east of England would be concentrated through the East\nCoast Main Line as far as Newcastle; and traffic to Wales and the West Country\nwould go on the Great Western Main Line to Swansea and Plymouth.\n\nUnderpinning Beeching's proposals was his belief that there was too much\nduplication in the railway network: \"The real choice is between an excessive\nand increasingly un-economic system, with a corresponding tendency for the\nrailways as a whole to fall into disrepute and decay, or the selective\ndevelopment and intensive utilisation of a more limited trunk route\nsystem\".^[29] Of the 7,500 miles (12,100 km) of trunk route, 3,700 miles\n(6,000 km) involves a choice between two routes, 700 miles (1,100 km) a choice\nof three, and over a further 700 miles (1,100 km) a choice of four.^[30] In\nScotland, only the Central Belt routes and the lines via Fife and Perth to\nAberdeen were selected for development, and none were selected in Wales, apart\nfrom the Great Western Main Line as far as Swansea.\n\nBeeching's secondment from ICI ended early in June 1965 after Harold Wilson's\nattempt to get him to produce a transport plan failed. It is a matter of\ndebate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if\nhe was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the\nHouse of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom\nFraser, then Minister of Transport.^[31] Beeching denied this, pointing out\nthat he had returned early to ICI as he would not have had enough time to\nundertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his\nsecondment.^[32]\n\n## The closures[edit]\n\nProspect Tunnel lay on the Harrogate to Church Fenton Line, one of the first\nlines to be closed\n\nThe first report was accepted by the Conservative government of the day, which\nargued that many services could be provided more effectively by buses.^[33]\nMost recommendations were subsequently taken forward by the Labour government\nelected in 1964, but many of the proposed closures sparked protests from\ncommunities that would lose their trains, a number of which (especially rural\ncommunities) had no other public transport.^[34]^[better source needed]\n\nLine closures had been running at about 150\u2013300 miles per year between 1950\nand 1961. They peaked at 1,000 miles (1,600 km) in 1964 and came to a virtual\nhalt by the early 1970s.^[35]^[failed verification] One of the last major\nclosures was the 98-mile (158 km) Waverley Route between Carlisle, Hawick and\nEdinburgh in 1969; the reopening of a 35-mile section of this line was\napproved in 2006 and passenger services resumed in September 2015.^[36]\n\nHoliday and coastal resorts were severely affected by the closures. The report\nrecommended closing almost all services along the coasts of north Devon,\nCornwall and East Anglia aside from Norwich to Great Yarmouth. All services on\nthe Isle of Wight were recommended for closure, as were all branch lines in\nthe Lake District. One of the most significant closures was the Great Central\nMain Line from London Marylebone to Leicester and Sheffield.^[33]\n\nNot all the recommended closures were implemented. Reprieved lines include:\n\n  * Lines through the Scottish Highlands, such as the Far North Line, were kept open, in part because of pressure from the powerful Highland lobby.^[6]^[page needed]\n  * The Central Wales Line was said to have been kept open because it passed through so many marginal constituencies that no-one dared to close it.^[6]^[page needed]^[8]^[page needed]\n  * The Tamar Valley Line, between Gunnislake and Plymouth, was kept open because the local road network was poor, with no direct route from the towns served to Plymouth.^[37]\n  * The Marshlink line between Ashford and Hastings remained open because of problems running a replacement bus service with the existing network.^[38]\n  * Other routes (or parts of routes) planned for closure that survived include the Settle-Carlisle line, Ipswich\u2013Lowestoft, the Hope Valley line, the Buxton line,^[39] the Avocet line, Ayr\u2013Stranraer, Glasgow\u2013Kilmarnock, Glasgow\u2013Edinburgh via Shotts, Barrow\u2013Whitehaven, Middlesbrough\u2013Whitby, York\u2013Harrogate, Leeds/Bradford\u2013Ilkley, Nottingham\u2013Lincoln, Boston\u2013Skegness, Birkenhead\u2013Wrexham, Liverpool\u2013Southport (and other Merseyside commuter routes), Bury-Manchester, Leicester\u2013Peterborough, St Erth\u2013St Ives, and Ryde\u2013Shanklin.\n\nThe Beeching Report was intended to be the first stage in the rail network's\ncontraction.^[40]^[page needed] As a result, some lines it had not recommended\nfor closure were subsequently shut down, such as the Woodhead line between\nManchester and Sheffield in 1981, after the decline of the freight traffic\n(mostly coal) on which it had relied.^[41] Many surviving lines were\nrationalised, including reduction to single track and consolidation of\nsignals.^[42] Most of the Oxford\u2013Cambridge Varsity Line closed despite its\nstrategic location serving Milton Keynes, Britain's largest \"new town\".^[43]\nKinross-shire, and Fife especially, suffered closures not included in the\nReport, including the main line from Edinburgh to Perth. King's Lynn was to\nhave remained at the centre of routes towards Norwich, Hunstanton and Wisbech,\nall of which closed.\n\nWith a few exceptions, after the early 1970s proposals to close other lines\nwere met with vociferous public opposition and were shelved.^[citation needed]\n\n## Critical analysis[edit]\n\n### Disposals of land and structures[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(August 2016) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this template message)  \n---  \nA demolition train during the dismantling of the Salisbury and Dorset Line in\n1965Both Wednesbury Town railway station and the South Staffordshire Railway\nwere closed, and were still in ruins in 2003.\n\nBeeching's reports made no recommendations about the handling of land after\nclosures. British Rail operated a policy of disposing of land that was surplus\nto requirements. Many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and\nthe land sold for development. Closed station buildings on remaining lines\nhave often been demolished or sold for housing or other purposes. Increasing\npressure on land use meant that protection of closed trackbeds, as in other\ncountries, such as the US Rail Bank scheme, which holds former railway land\nfor possible future use, was not seen to be practical.^[44]\n\nMany redundant structures from closed lines remain, such as bridges over other\nlines and drainage culverts. They often require maintenance as part of the\nrail infrastructure while providing no benefit. Critics of Beeching argue that\nthe lack of recommendations on the handling of closed railway property\ndemonstrates that the report was short-sighted. On the other hand, retaining a\nrailway on these routes, which would obviously have increased maintenance\ncosts, might not have earned enough to justify that greater cost. As demand\nfor rail has grown since the 1990s, the failure to preserve the routes of\nclosed lines, such as the one between Bedford and Cambridge, which was closed\ndespite Beeching recommending its retention, has been criticised.^[45]\n\n### Acceptance of rail subsidies[edit]\n\nBy 1968, the railways had not been restored to profitability and Beeching's\napproach appeared to many to have failed. It has been suggested that by\nclosing almost a third of the network Beeching achieved a saving of just \u00a330\nmillion, whilst overall losses were running in excess of \u00a3100 million per\nyear.^[8]^[page needed] However, the precise savings from closures are\nimpossible to calculate.^[35]^[page needed] The Ministry of Transport\nsubsequently estimated that rail operating costs had been cut by over \u00a3100\nmillion in the wake of the Beeching Report but that much of this had been\nswallowed up by increased wages. Some of the branches closed acted as feeders\nto the main lines, and that feeder traffic was lost when the branches closed;\nthe financial significance of this is debatable, for over 90% of the railways'\n1960 traffic was carried on lines which remained open ten years\nlater.^[40]^[page needed]\n\nWhatever the figures, towards the end of the 1960s it became increasingly\nclear that rail closures were not bringing the rail system out of deficit and\nwere unlikely ever to do so.^[6]^[page needed] Transport minister Barbara\nCastle decided that some rail services, which could not pay their way but had\na valuable social role, should be subsidised. Legislation allowing this was\nintroduced in the Transport Act 1968. Section 39 made provision for a subsidy\nto be paid by the Treasury for a three-year period. This was later repealed in\nthe Railways Act 1974. Whether these subsidies affected the size of the\nnetwork is questionable: the criteria for reprieving loss-making lines had not\naltered, merely the way their costs appeared in the railways\naccounts\u2014previously their contribution to the railways' overall loss was\nhidden in the total deficit.^[40]^[page needed]\n\n### Replacement buses and proposed alternatives[edit]\n\nThe \"bustitution\" policy that replaced rail services with buses also failed.\nIn many cases the replacement bus services were slower and less convenient\nthan the trains they were meant to replace, and so were unpopular.^[8]^[page\nneeded] Replacement bus services were often run between the (now disused)\nstation sites (some of which were some distance from the population centres\nthey served), thus losing any potential advantage over the closed rail\nservice. Most replacement bus services lasted less than two years before they\nwere removed due to a lack of patronage,^[46] leaving large parts of the\ncountry with no public transport.\n\nThe assumption at the time^[citation needed] was that car owners would drive\nto the nearest railhead (which was usually the junction where the closed\nbranch line would otherwise have taken them) and continue their journey\nonwards by train. In practice, having left home in their cars, people used\nthem for the whole journey. Similarly for freight: without branch lines, the\nrailways' ability to transport goods \"door to door\" was dramatically reduced.\nAs in the passenger model, it was assumed that lorries would pick up goods and\ntransport them to the nearest railhead, where they would be taken across the\ncountry by train, unloaded onto another lorry and taken to their destination.\nThe development of the motorway network, the advent of containerisation,\nimprovements in lorries and the economic costs of having two break-bulk points\ncombined to make long-distance road transport a more viable alternative.\n\nMany of the closed lines had run at only a small deficit. Some lines such as\nthe Sunderland-to-West Hartlepool line cost only \u00a3291 per mile to\noperate.^[6]^[page needed] Closures of such small-scale loss-making lines made\nlittle difference to the overall deficit.\n\nPossible changes to light railway-type operations were attacked by Beeching,\nwho wrote: \"The third suggestion, that rail buses should be substituted for\ntrains, ignores the high cost of providing the route itself, and also ignores\nthe fact that rail buses are more expensive vehicles than road buses.\" There\nis little in the Beeching report recommending general economies (in\nadministration costs, working practices and so on). For example, a number of\nthe stations that were closed were fully staffed 18 hours a day, on lines\ncontrolled by multiple Victorian era signalboxes (again fully staffed, often\nthroughout the day). Operating costs could have been reduced by reducing staff\nand removing redundant services on these lines while keeping the stations\nopen. This has since been successfully achieved by British Rail and its\nsuccessors on lesser-used lines that survived the cuts, such as the East\nSuffolk Line from Ipswich to Lowestoft, which survives as a \"basic\nrailway\".^[8]^[page needed]\n\nThe Marshlink line between Ashford International and Hastings, threatened with\nclosure in the Beeching Report, is now seen as important due to the opening of\nthe Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1.^[47] Traffic on the single-track Golden\nValley Line between Kemble and Swindon and the Cotswold Line between Oxford\nand Worcester has increased significantly, and double track has now been\nreinstated on the Golden Valley Line, partly to facilitate a diversionary\nroute during electrification and other works on the Severn tunnel\nline.^[citation needed]\n\n### The people and the politics[edit]\n\nThe Conservatives increased their Commons majority in the general election of\n8 October 1959, their first with Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister. Ernest\nMarples, previously Postmaster General, was made Transport Minister two weeks\nlater in a cabinet reshuffle; Macmillan noted that the Northern working-class\nboy who had won a scholarship to a grammar school was one of only two \"self-\nmade men\" in his cabinet.^[48]\n\nMarples had a background with a successful road construction company. When\nopening the M1 motorway, he said: \"This motorway starts a new era in road\ntravel. It is in keeping with the bold scientific age in which we live. It is\na powerful weapon to add to our transport system.\" His association with the\nhigh-profile construction company Marples Ridgway became a matter of concern\nto both the public and politicians. As is customary, he resigned as a director\nof the company in 1951 on becoming a junior minister, but he only disposed of\nhis shares in the company in 1960 after the company won a contract to build\nthe Hammersmith Flyover, when questions were asked both in the media and also\nin the Commons on 28 January 1960;^[49] he made a statement to the House later\nthat day confirming that the sale of shares was in hand and would be completed\n\"very soon\", noting that as part of the agreement he could be required to buy\nthe shares from the purchaser at the original price after he ceased to hold\noffice, if so desired by the purchaser.^[50] While it was reported that he\nsold the shares to his wife, she denied in a newspaper interview, that any\ntransaction had taken place. It was reported that he had transferred his\nshares into an Overseas Trust.^[citation needed] In July 1964, Marples Ridgway\nand Partners Limited^[51] were awarded a \u00a34.1 million contract for the \"Hendon\nUrban Motorway\" extension of the M1,^[52] in the same year that the company\nwas taken over by the Bath and Portland Group.^[53] There was no evidence of\nany wrongdoing on anyone's part in this or any of the other contracts awarded\nto the company during his term of office, but it did lead to a sense of\nunease, not least within the railway sector.^[54]\n\nIn April 1960, Sir Ivan Stedeford established an advisory group known as the\nStedeford Committee at the request of Harold Macmillan to report on the state\nof the British Transport Commission and to make recommendations.^[55] Sir\nEwart Smith, a retired former Chief Engineer at Imperial Chemical Industries\n(ICI), was asked by Ernest Marples to become a member of an advisory group;\nSmith declined but recommended Richard Beeching in his place, a suggestion\nthat Marples accepted.^[56] Beeching, who held a PhD in physics, had been\nappointed to the main board of ICI at the age of 43. The board consisted of\nsenior figures in British businesses, and none of the board had previous\nknowledge or experience of the railway industry.^[55] Stedeford and Beeching\nclashed on a number of issues,^[57] but the future size of the railway system\nwas not one of them. For all the suspicion it aroused, the committee had\nlittle to say on this and the government was already convinced of the need to\nreduce the size of the rail network.^[40]^[page needed] In spite of questions\nbeing asked in Parliament, Sir Ivan's report was not published at the time. In\nDecember 1960 questions were asked in the Lords about this \"secret\" and\n\"under-the-counter\" study group, criticising the continued withholding of the\nreport and its recommendations.^[58] It was later suggested that Stedeford had\nrecommended that the government should set up another body \"to consider the\nsize and pattern of the railway system required to meet current and\nforeseeable needs, in the light of developments and trends in other forms of\ntransport ... and other relevant considerations\".^[59]\n\nMarples then appointed Beeching as Chairman of the British Transport\nCommission in March 1961.^[15] He would receive the same yearly salary that he\nwas earning at ICI, the controversial sum of \u00a324,000 (\u00a3568,000 in 2021 terms),\n\u00a310,000 more than Sir Brian Robertson, the previous chairman of the BTC,\n\u00a314,000 more than Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and two-and-a-half times\nhigher than the salary of any head of a nationalised industry at the time. At\nthat time the government was seeking outside talent to sort out the huge\nproblems of the railway network, and he was confident that he could make the\nrailways pay for themselves, but his salary, at 35 times that of many railway\nworkers, has been described as a \"political disaster\".^[60]\n\nThe Transport Act 1962 dissolved the British Transport Commission (BTC), which\nhad overseen the railways, canals and road freight transport and established\nthe British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963, with Dr\nBeeching as its first chairman. The Act put in place measures that simplified\nthe process of closing railways by removing the need for the pros and cons of\neach case to be heard in detail. It was described as the \"most momentous piece\nof legislation in the field of railway law to have been enacted since the\nRailway and Canal Traffic Act 1854\".^[61]\n\nThe general election in October 1964 returned a Labour government under Prime\nMinister Harold Wilson after 13 years of Conservative government. During the\nelection campaign Labour had promised to halt rail closures if elected, but it\nquickly backtracked, and later oversaw some of the most controversial\nclosures. Tom Fraser was appointed Minister of Transport, but was replaced by\nBarbara Castle in December 1965. Castle published a map in 1967,^[62] Network\nfor Development, showing the railway system \"stabilised\" at around 11,000\nroute miles (17,700 km).^[40]^[page needed]\n\nSection 39 of the Transport Act 1968 made provision for grants to be paid in\nrelation to loss-making lines and services,^[63] but many of the services and\nrailway lines that would have qualified had already been closed. A number of\nbranch lines and local services were saved by this legislation.^[64]^[full\ncitation needed]\n\nAfter 1970, when the Conservatives were returned to power, serious thought was\ngiven to a further programme of closures, but this proved politically\nimpossible.^[40]^[page needed] In 1982, under the government of Margaret\nThatcher, Sir David Serpell, a civil servant who had worked with Beeching,\ncompiled the Serpell Report which said that a profitable railway could be\nachieved only by closing much of what remained.^[46] The report's infamous\n\"Option A\" proposed greatly increasing fares and reducing the rail network to\na mere 1,630 miles (2,620 km), leaving only 22 miles (35 km) of railway in\nWales (a section of the South Wales Main Line from the Severn Tunnel to\nCardiff Central) and none in Somerset, Devon or Cornwall. The Midland Main\nLine was planned to close, leaving Leicester and Derby without a rail link,\nwhile the East Coast Main Line, part of the key London/Edinburgh link, was\nintended to be cut north of Newcastle. The report was published on 20 January\n1983 and received an immediate backlash from the media. It was quietly shelved\nin the run up to the 1983 election.^[65]^[66]\n\nIan Hislop comments that history has been somewhat unkind to \"Britain's most\nhated civil servant\", by forgetting that Beeching proposed a much better bus\nservice that ministers never delivered, and that in some ways he was used to\ndo their \"dirty work for them\". Hislop describes him as \"a technocrat [who]\nwasn't open to argument to romantic notions of rural England or the warp and\nweft of the train in our national identity. He didn't buy any of that. He went\nfor a straightforward profit and loss approach and some claim we are still\nreeling from that today\".^[67] Beeching was unrepentant about his role in the\nclosures: \"I suppose I'll always be looked upon as the axe man, but it was\nsurgery, not mad chopping\".^[68]\n\nOn 7 June 2019, former Minister for Transport Andrew Adonis delivered a speech\non \"Reversing Beeching\".^[69]\n\n## Reopenings[edit]\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date\n\nRail modal share 1952\u20132015^[70]Rail passengers in Great Britain 1829\u20132021\n\nSince the Beeching cuts, road traffic levels have grown significantly. As\nwell, since privatisation in the mid-1990s, there have been record levels of\npassengers on the railways owing to a preference to living in smaller towns\nand rural areas, and in turn commuting longer distances^[71] (although the\nimpact of this is disputed). A few of the railway closures have been reversed.\nHowever, despite the considerable increase in railway journeys since the\nmid-1990s, rail transport's share of the total passenger transport market\nremains below that of the early 1960s, with road overwhelmingly the dominant\nmode: rail's market share was 13% in 1961, 6% in 1991 and 2001, and 10% in\n2014.^[70]\n\nSome closed stations have reopened, and passenger services have been restored\non a few lines where they had been removed.\n\n### Heritage railways[edit]\n\nFurther information: List of British heritage and private railways\n\nSome lines closed under the Beeching cuts have reopened as private heritage\nrailways. Some examples are East Lancs Railway, Great Central Railway\n(heritage railway), Mid Hants Railway, North Yorkshire Moors Railway, North\nNorfolk Railway and West Somerset Railway.\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\nFlanders and Swann, writers and performers of satirical songs, wrote a lament\nfor lines closed by the Beeching cuts entitled \"Slow Train\" (1963). Michael\nWilliams' book On the slow train takes its name from the Flanders and Swann\nsong. It celebrates 12 of the most beautiful and historic journeys in Britain,\nsome of which were saved from the Beeching cuts.^[72] It perpetuated the myth\nthat the Beeching cuts were concerned solely with sleepy rural branch lines,\nbut they actually also concerned well-used \"industrial\" and commuter lines.\n\nThe BBC TV comedy series Oh, Doctor Beeching!, broadcast from 1995 to 1997,\nwas set at a small fictional branch-line railway station threatened with\nclosure under the Beeching cuts.\n\nIn the satirical magazine Private Eye, the \"Signal Failures\" column on railway\nissues is written under the pseudonym \"Dr. B. Ching\".\n\nThe lyrics of the I Like Trains song \"The Beeching Report\" are a criticism of\nDr Beeching and the Beeching cuts.^[citation needed]\n\n## Closures by year[edit]\n\nThe remains of Rugby Central Station on the former Great Central RailwayAn\nabandoned stone bridge spans the route of the Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway\nthrough Otley, which was closed in 1965.\n\nThe list below shows over 7,000 miles (11,000 km) of closures:\n\nYear| Total length closed  \n---|---  \n1950| 150 miles (240 km)  \n1951| 275 miles (443 km)  \n1952| 300 miles (480 km)  \n1953| 275 miles (443 km)  \n1954 to 1957| 500 miles (800 km)  \n1958| 150 miles (240 km)  \n1959| 350 miles (560 km)  \n1960| 175 miles (282 km)  \n1961| 150 miles (240 km)  \n1962| 780 miles (1,260 km)  \nBeeching report published  \n1963| 324 miles (521 km)  \n1964| 1,058 miles (1,703 km)  \n1965| 600 miles (970 km)  \n1966| 750 miles (1,210 km)  \n1967| 300 miles (480 km)  \n1968| 400 miles (640 km)  \n1969| 250 miles (400 km)  \n1970| 275 miles (443 km)  \n1971| 23 miles (37 km)  \n1972| 50 miles (80 km)  \n1973| 35 miles (56 km)  \n  \nAfter this period, \"residual\" Beeching closures took place: Bridport to Maiden\nNewton in 1975,^[73] Alston to Haltwhistle in 1976,^[74] and Woodside to\nSelsdon in 1983.^[75]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of closed railway stations in Britain\n  * List of heritage railway stations in the United Kingdom\n  * Specified local lines, similar legislation undertaken in Japan\n\n## References[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n  1. ^ Macintyre, D.
