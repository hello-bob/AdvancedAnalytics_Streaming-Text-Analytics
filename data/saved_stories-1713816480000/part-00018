If anyone has research on this please send to\nthe appropriate public bodies.\n\nA critical feature of information security, especially for financial activity,\nis non-repudiation - activity recorded is strong enough to hold up in court.\n\nBy sharing access to login credentials or capabilities for spoofing login\nforms, the banks no longer can differentiate between what a customer or one of\ntheir chosen third party's does.\n\nBy allowing arbitrary code to be executed by the third parties, the banks can\nno longer differentiate actions in your web browser to those of a third party.\n\n## Remote Access: The Post Office Online Banking Scandal\n\nIf your bank is impacted the following may help you understand the risk by\ncomparing to events sub-postmaster suffered.\n\nSub-postmasters used Post Office supplied Fujitsu Horizon tills. Bank\ncustomers use online banking supplied websites.\n\nFujitsu had remote access to sub-postmasters' tills. Various companies have\nremote access to your online banking pages.\n\nFujitsu's systems could execute code in tills due to a backdoor available to\ntheir systems. Various companies' servers can execute code in the online\nbanking page, on your web browser, due to a backdoor to their servers that the\nbank gave them.\n\nCode used allowed Fujitsu to falsify till records and the resultant records\nappeared as the actions of the sub-postmasters. Various companies' code can\nread your login credentials, banking details and perform online banking\nactions, with any records appearing as you.\n\nInvented cash discrepancies left in the tills were blamed on sub-postmasters.\nAny malicious banking activity will likely be blamed on banking customers,\ndata thefts may be used for fraud such as identity theft and a ransomware\nattack may be easy to achieve.\n\nFujitsu were a highly respected and reputable tech company. The various\ncompanies are a mix of web startup, social media, analytics, major tech and\nforeign companies.\n\nSub-postmasters were financially ruined and some jailed. What will happen to\nyou if someone else can use your online banking as you or control the online\nbanking page you are looking at?\n\n## Some stats\n\n### How many banking websites give these sites remote access as you?\n\n### How many banking websites give these companies remote access as you?\n\n## This design flaw is near everywhere\n\nNobody should be able to use your logged in account, this is likely a critical\nsecurity breach.\n\nIf you hand your passwords to others, you will be held negligent for any\ndamage that results.\n\nBut what if the system you use, just gives another your access?\n\nWhat you may not know is that it is common for websites to give others remote\naccess to act as you on their webpages, access to your user account.\n\nWorse, in many cases access includes to credentials, thus risking continued\naccess at any time.\n\nIf access is abused, any logs are likely to indicate the activity was by the\nlegitimate user, much like the poor sub-postmasters.\n\n## This has happened and can happen again\n\nThe UK regulator responsible in this domain, the ICO, were themselves hacked\nby this vulnerability in 2018, resulting in visitors to the ICO website having\ntheir devices hijacked to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nHad the attackers been more aggressive, they could have captured data from\nwhistleblowers, industry data breach reports and the public's complaints (the\nICO got lucky) - or at least we think they did, the ICO servers have no logs\nof what the attackers actually did.\n\nDespite being hacked, the ICO have failed to enforce data protection law and\nstop this vulnerability.\n\n## It doesn't require malice\n\nIn one famous instance a third party accidentally hoovered up users passwords,\npersonal identifiers and more.\n\nThis incident is not alone and the capturing of sensitive data, including\ncredit card details has happened by accident on other sites too.\n\nWhen companies just install some of these integrations to their website it can\nresult in significant data breaches regardless of remote access being\nattempted.\n\n## A breakdown by UK banks\n\nThis is not exhaustive.\n\nWebsite| Provide remote access to  \n---|---  \nBank of Ireland| Amazon  \nAppDynamics  \nCookie Law  \nGoogle  \nBank Of Scotland| Dynatrace  \nLivePerson  \nLloyds  \nTealium  \nYext  \nCitibank| Cheq  \nCitibank  \nGoogle  \nCoutts| Adobe  \nCookie Law  \nLivePerson  \nFirst Direct| AppDynamics  \nGoogle  \nHSBC  \nLivePerson  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \nOptimizely  \nTealium  \nHSBC| AppDynamics  \nGoogle  \nLivePerson  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \nOptimizely  \nTealium  \nTikTok  \nTwitter  \nLloyds| Dynatrace  \nLivePerson  \nLloyds  \nTealium  \nYext  \nMetro Bank| Google  \nMicrosoft Application Insights  \nOne Trust  \nOptimizely  \nNationwide| Adobe  \nLivePerson  \nOne Trust  \nNatwest| Adobe  \nCookie Law  \nLivePerson  \nRBS| Adobe  \nCookie Law  \nLivePerson  \nNatwest  \nSainsbury's| Corvidae  \nGoogle  \nMarin Software  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \nSnapchat  \nTealium  \nThe Trade Desk  \nTikTok  \nTransUnion  \nTwitter  \nSantander| Adobe  \nOne Trust  \nsplash-screen.net  \nStarling| AB Tasty  \nGoogle  \nInstana  \nMatamo  \nMicrosoft  \nNextdoor  \nThe Trade Desk  \nTrust Pilot  \nTesco| Cheq  \nGoogle  \nMedallia  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \nOracle Maxymiser  \nTrust Pilot  \nTwitter  \nThe co-operative bank| GlassBox  \nTealium  \nTrust Pilot  \nTSB| Adobe  \nBioCatch  \nClick Tale  \nDynatrace  \nGoogle  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \nTealium  \nTwitter  \nVirgin Money| Adobe  \nBioCatch  \nContentsquare  \nCrownpeak  \nGoogle  \nInfinity Tracking  \nMeta  \nMicrosoft  \neGain  \n  \n## How does this happen?\n\nAccess depends on a site loading third parties' web apps\n\nApps loaded directly not from the servers of the website you have trusted, but\nfrom a third parties' server that they have delegate control to.\n\nThose apps have remote access within these pages and this has been validated\nby tests to check for capabilities.\n\nThe following capabilities were checked and if any failed it resulted in their\nappearance here.:\n\n  * Can their scripts access login forms?\n  * Can their scripts create login forms?\n\n## Further technical details\n\nA significant failure here is the lack of use of the Subresource Integrity\nfeature.\n\nWhilst far from providing complete security for third parties it does\nsignificantly limit what they can do and offers a starting point for\nprotecting against remote access.\n\nThis combined with ensuring the application doesn't evaluate any JavaScript\nitself (uses eval or similar functions) can lock down remote access risks.\nHowever, it will be a minefield as the site has to ensure it maintains any\nsafeguards at all times when using third parties. The default security model\nin the web is to give third party JavaScript remote access.\n\nThis nature of remote access is often technically known as remote code\nexecution.\n\nThe code offered by a server can be modified by whoever controls the server or\nwhoever can control which server the domain points to.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
