But that soon changed when the details \u2013 total debt forgiveness with\nno strings attached \u2013 emerged in the media. \u201cWith the exposure, people are\nactually ringing us up and saying: \u2018Well, I have to give this a chance. I\nthink it\u2019s a blessing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe councillor hopes 40-60 families will sign up to the two-year pilot\nproject, which will pay off their debts, without asking for anything in\nreturn. Families with children are prioritised, with the size, duration of\ndebt and number of creditors also taken into account when deciding on\nparticipation. Debt repayment will be covered by four charitable foundations,\nrather than the taxpayer, leaving the council and national government only to\nmeet the project\u2019s costs, including research.\n\nIn the Netherlands, councils are responsible for helping indebted families.\nBut the current model isn\u2019t working, Lauriks argued: \u201cWe have a system in\nplace, but it doesn\u2019t work for the people that need it most. And the entire\nsystem costs us billions and billions more than the initial debt.\n\n\u201cThe costs are much, much higher than the initial debt ... There are welfare\ncosts, health costs. Debts are literally making people sick,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the debt is erased, people get a grip on their own life again.\u201d\n\nDutch families were struggling with problem debts worth \u20ac3bn to \u20ac3.5bn\n(\u00a32.6bn-\u00a33bn) in 2018, while the costs of dealing with the social and economic\nconsequences of the liabilities were \u20ac17bn, including \u20ac8bn on debt assistance\nand \u20ac9bn on the wider fallout, such as health problems, absenteeism and\nunderemployment, according to De Argumentenfabriek, a data company.\n\nThe Arnhem experiment follows debt-relief initiatives from other Dutch cities\ngrappling with entrenched poverty. Although the Netherlands is one of Europe\u2019s\nwealthiest countries, 16.5% of the population is at risk of poverty and social\nexclusion, according to Eurostat.\n\nIn 2020, Amsterdam took over the debts of young people and allowed them to\nrepay the city, rather than the original creditor. Young people could also\nhave a portion of their debts cancelled if they took up education or training.\n\nUtrecht was reported in 2023 by Dutch media to have halved the number of\nresidents in debt to 12,000, after it took over the finances of the city\u2019s\npoorest households.\n\nBut Arnhem\u2019s approach is even more radical because families face neither\nconditions, nor repayment obligations. The council argues this offers instant\nhelp that could be more effective in the long run. \u201cThe chance to get your\nlife together is immediate,\u201d Lauriks said. \u201cWe also think that\u2019s a bigger\nchance for these families in the long run, with even lower costs, health care\ncosts, etc.\u201d\n\nThis approach to debt forgiveness may surprise anyone who associates the\nNetherlands with flinty prudence. In 2017, the then Dutch finance minister\nJeroen Dijsselbloem caused outrage across Europe when he appeared to suggest\nthat indebted southern European countries had blown their money on alcohol and\nwomen. At the height of the first coronavirus lockdown three years later,\nanother Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, infuriated some European\nleaders by asking why other governments didn\u2019t have the means to deal with the\nshock of the pandemic.\n\nTellingly, the Dutch word for debt, \u201cschuld\u201d, as in German, also means fault\nor guilt.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Headlines Europe\n\nFree newsletter\n\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed\ndirect to you every week day\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s got all these\nconnotations of crime, immorality, of not being able to fulfil your end of the\nbargain,\u201d Robert Vonk, professor of the history of social security at Utrecht\nuniversity, said in an interview. \u201cIf you are in debt, you can get assistance\n... but this help has always had the implicit message that you have done\nsomething wrong and you need to atone for it.\u201d\n\nThe proliferation of debt aid schemes are a sign that public attitudes are\nchanging, Vonk said. Growing numbers face \u201ccrippling debt\u201d, which he\nattributed to more flexible labour markets that have spawned low-paying jobs\nwith uneven income streams.\n\nAnother factor changing people\u2019s minds, experts believe, is the child benefit\nscandal, where more than 20,000 families were wrongly accused of fraud by\nDutch authorities over several years from 2012. Some victims were forced into\nbankruptcy, others moved house, or separated from their partner, after unjust\nclaims for repayment, often triggered by simple administrative errors.\n\nThe scandal was \u201ca catalyst\u201d in changing public opinions on debt, Vonk said.\n\u201cThe government caused people to get into problematic debt and was also the\nleast lenient creditor.\u201d\n\nMaurits de Jongh, assistant professor at the ethics institute at Utrecht\nuniversity, was supportive of debt-relief programmes, but questioned whether\nthe Arnhem scheme would keep people out of debt, highlighting \u201cthe structural\ncauses of people living in poverty and incurring debts\u201d, including illiteracy,\nillnesses or incomes that were just too low.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge risk,\u201d Lauriks acknowledged, arguing \u201cthe minimum wage is just\ntoo low to make ends meet\u201d. He also acknowledged \u201cthe legitimate question\u201d\nthat low-income families who have stayed out of debt may perceive unfairness.\n\u201cI would like to help all people in our town, and maybe in all the\nNetherlands, but [this] is an experiment to let the whole country see there is\nanother way.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Netherlands\n  * Europe\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
