There really is such a thing as a numbat. It's a pocket-\nsized marsupial anteater (see above). And now, it's also the mascot for\nCanonical's latest Linux distro, Ubuntu 24.04.\n\nI've been running Noble Numbat on my 2020 vintage Dell Precision 3451. This PC\noriginally came with Ubuntu 20.04 and is powered by an Intel 8-core 3GHz\ni7-9700 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.\n\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nYou don't need anywhere near that much hardware to run the latest Ubuntu. You\ncan install and run Ubuntu 24.04 on any system with a 2GHz, 2-core 64-bit\nprocessor, 4GB RAM, and 25GB storage. Any Windows 7 PC can run it. Heck, it\nwill run just fine on a Raspberry Pi 5.\n\nLike installing any modern Linux, installing Ubuntu 24.04 is simple. The short\nversion: Download Ubuntu 24.04, burn it to a USB stick, boot it from the\nstick, run it to see if it likes your hardware, and -- if it does -- press the\ninstall button. That's it.\n\nOh, it's a little fancier than that. The installer now has an accessibility\npage where you can customize Ubuntu to meet your particular needs. You can\nalso choose between a Default or Full installation. The Default installation\nincludes only the bare essentials, while the Full installation includes all\nthe usual programs you expect from a desktop Linux distribution.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nTechnically, behind the scenes, the new installer is using the Subiquity back-\nend. The brand-new front end was written with Flutter. Not a developer or a\nsystem administrator? Don't worry about it. You'll never need to know.\n\nIf you are an IT professional, you'll be glad to know that you can now build\ncustomized Ubuntu Linux installations. With autoinstall, you can create a\nrepeatable, automated installation flow using an autoinstall YAML file with\nSubiquity to set up specialized desktops over your network.\n\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 10 things you need to know\n\nBoth versions use GNOME 46 for their default desktop and Firefox 125.0.1 for\nthe web browser. If GNOME isn't to your taste, you can also get Ubuntu 24.04\nwith Budgie, Ubuntu Budgie, KDE, Kubuntu, MATE, Ubuntu MATE, Cinnamon, Ubuntu\nCinnamon -- and on and on. If there's a Linux desktop environment, there's a\ncustomized Ubuntu release for it.\n\nIn the Full version, you'll also find desktop applications such as LibreOffice\n24.4.2 for the office suite, Thunderbird 115 for e-mail, Rhythmbox 3.4.7 to\nplay music, and Snapshot for your webcam.\n\nProgrammers will find that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS now comes with Python 3.12, Ruby\n3.2, PHP 8.3, and Go 1.22. It also includes .NET, Java, and Rust. Looking\nahead, .NET 8 will be fully supported on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS for\nthe entire lifecycle of both releases. That means developers can upgrade their\napplications to newer .NET versions without upgrading their Ubuntu release.\n\nWhen Canonical says the \"entire\" lifecycle, that's longer than any other\ncompany supports their operating systems. Canonical will support Ubuntu 24.04\nuntil 2036. Yes, that's right. Unlike some operating systems I could name --\ncough, Windows 10, cough -- Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS) releases now come\nwith 12 years of support.\n\nAlso: How to add a GUI for your Ubuntu firewall (and why you should)\n\nIf you need more programs, the new Ubuntu App Center offers a wide variety.\nWhile it defaults to Snap-based applications, it still offers traditional DEB\ninstalls.\n\nThe heart of this release is performance, bolstered by the inclusion of the\nLinux 6.8 kernel. Oliver Smith, Ubuntu product manager, says this isn't just\nan incremental update. The kernel brings with it numerous performance\nenhancements that are optimized further by Canonical's low-latency tweaks.\nThis commitment to speed and efficiency signals that Ubuntu is built for those\nwho need a robust, high-performance operating system. While I didn't benchmark\nthis edition, it did feel faster than its predecessor, Ubuntu 22.04, on the\nsame PC.\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS isn't just fast; it's also a fortress. Canonical has layered\nthis release with a slate of security upgrades that harden the system against\nthe ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. The operating system now employs\nmore stringent controls on unprivileged user namespaces -- a common attack\nvector -- significantly reducing vulnerabilities.\n\nAlso: Canonical turns 20: Shaping the Ubuntu Linux world\n\nAre you running both Linux and Windows? Ubuntu's Active Directory (AD) Group\nPolicy client, available via Ubuntu Pro, now supports enterprise proxy\nconfiguration, privilege management, and remote script execution. It also\ncontinues to support AD Group Policy Objects. Ubuntu 24.04 is also available\non Windows via Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\nWhile I'm sticking with Linux Mint 21.3 for my default desktop, there's a lot\nto like about Ubuntu 24.04. If you're looking for a solid, secure, and fast\nLinux desktop, the newest Ubuntu is well worth your time.\n\n#### Linux\n\nThe best Linux laptops for consumers and developers\n\nWant to save your aging computer?
