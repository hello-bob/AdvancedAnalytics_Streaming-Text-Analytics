The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

Photographs by Balazs Gardi. March 26, 2024\n\n## Two research labs known for some of the tech industry\u2019s most important\ninnovations have merged in hopes of recapturing their glory days.\n\nIt is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s enduring legends.\n\nIn 1979, a 24-year old Steve Jobs was permitted to visit Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto\nResearch Center (PARC) to view a demonstration of an experimental personal\ncomputer called the Alto. Mr. Jobs took away a handful of ideas that would\ntransform the computing world when they became the heart of Apple\u2019s Lisa and\nMacintosh computers.\n\nJobs was shown the Alto\u2019s graphical user interface, later saying of the\nexperience, \u201cit was obvious to me that all computers would work like this some\nday.\u201d SRI\n\nFour decades later, PARC has become a footnote in the nation\u2019s technology\nheartland, even as Silicon Valley\u2019s influence has ballooned. Last April, Xerox\nquietly donated the lab to SRI International, an independent research\nlaboratory that is a nonprofit organization with an equally storied history\nthat has also fallen from its peak of influence. (The organization shortened\nits name this year to SRI. It used to be the Stanford Research Institute and\nwas separated from the university in 1970. It changed its name to SRI\nInternational in 1977.)\n\nPARC's inventions defined the personal computing revolution, from laser\nprinting to ethernet.\n\n1969\n\nXerox opens the Palo Alto Research Center as an R&D division on the edge of\nStanford\u2019s campus. The mandate of the laboratory is to create \u201cthe office of\nthe future.\u201d\n\nSRI, via Computer History Museum\n\n1972\n\nAmong the first innovations to come out of PARC is a complete system for laser\nprinting, pictured here in a prototype printer model, the Xerox Dover.\n\n1973\n\nPARC creates the Xerox Alto, the first modern personal computer. The Alto\nfeatures the first graphical user interface, making it possible to control the\nsystem by pointing and clicking on menus rather than typing cumbersome\ncommands.\n\n1974\n\nA key part of PARC office of the future vision is a network to tie office\nsystems together. The Ethernet standard is developed at PARC and gradually\nwins wide industry adoption.\n\nIn January, SRI began to disclose its plans for PARC, describing a combined\nnonprofit research organization, called the Future Concepts division, intent\non reclaiming some of the original wizardry that was created when the Xerox\nCorporation set out to build a basic research laboratory to invent the \u201coffice\nof the future\u201d in 1970.\n\nThe PARC laboratory, set in the foothills just south of Stanford, is now\nlargely empty, hosting less than 100 researchers, far from a peak of almost\n400. For those who remember its glory days, however, it is a reminder of the\nresearch done by a diverse group of scientists and engineers who crossed\ndisciplines and collaborated in a spirit similar to other powerful corporate\nresearch centers of that era, such as AT&T\u2019s Bell Laboratories and IBM\u2019s\nThomas J. Watson Research Center.\n\nPARC has become a footnote in the nation\u2019s technology heartland, even as\nSilicon Valley\u2019s influence has ballooned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still magical,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s former chief executive and\nexecutive chairman, who began his career at PARC as a computer scientist and a\nmember of the research team. He remembers, \u201can amazing cafeteria, the most\nincredible view from the roof deck of the Bay Area and very large labs on the\nground floor that they once used for physics and semiconductor work.\u201d\n\nToday, however, in an era of tightening corporate budgets and more targeted\ngovernment spending, basic research largely happens at universities. Silicon\nValley has adopted a venture capital-based research funding model focused on\nquickly bringing products to market \u2014 often failing just as promptly.\n\nFor reasons that range from the more competitive world of computing research\nto the fact that the communities that surround the laboratory are now among\nthe most expensive places to live in the world, there are many skeptics about\nthe idea of a rejuvenated PARC. And in a technology region now dominated by\nventure-funded start-ups, some argue that basic research labs like PARC and\nSRI are pass\u00e9.\n\n\u201cPARC is dead,\u201d said Bernardo Huberman, a physicist who was a PARC researcher\nduring the 1970s and 1980s and who now heads a research group at CableLabs, a\ndevelopment organization sponsored by the cable television industry. He added\nthat \u201cthe value system that made people feel like they were part of something\nintellectually by working at PARC has disappeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the culture is more mercenary and focused on money rather than knowledge\nfor its own sake,\u201d Mr. Huberman said.\n\nPARC and SRI share a complicated history. During Silicon Valley\u2019s formative\nyears in the 1960s and \u201970s, SRI, which is in neighboring Menlo Park, and PARC\ninvented defining concepts that even today continue to shape the computer\nindustry, including advanced chip design, personal computing, laser printing,\noffice networking and what is described as the Internet of Things.\n\nSome of PARC\u2019s computing innovations have their roots in prior research work\ndone in the SRI lab of Douglas Engelbart, the computer scientist who invented\nthe computer mouse and hypertext, the forerunner to the World Wide Web.\n\nAcross its 78-year history, SRI\u2019s inventions have evolved from early computer-\nbased check processing systems to the initial version of Siri.\n\n1950\n\nBank of America contracts with SRI to design a computer-based system to\nautomate the processing of checks. By 1966, the Electronic Recording Machine,\nAccounting can process 750 million checks a year.\n\n1966\n\nA robot called Shakey moves about its environment. A variety of innovations\nwill come from it, including advances in computer vision, voice recognition\nand an algorithm that would become the basis for modern navigation and mapping\nprograms.\n\nSRI\n\n1968\n\nThe computer scientist Douglas Engelbart does a live demonstration of the \u201coN-\nLine system\u201d his team at SRI has been developing, showcasing the computer\nmouse and hypertext \u2013 later to become the foundational concept underlying the\nWorld Wide Web.\n\nSRI\n\n1969\n\nTwo young programmers, Bill Duvall at SRI in Menlo Park and Charley Kline at\nUCLA in Los Angeles, test remotely connecting to a computer via a Pentagon-\nfunded experimental computer network known as ARPAnet.\n\n2003\n\nSiri, which will eventually be turned into a commercial product by Apple,\nbegins as part of a Pentagon-funded SRI artificial intelligence research\neffort known as CALO, which stands for Cognitive Assistant That Learns and\nOrganizes.\n\nDavid Parekh, SRI\u2019s chief executive, said that although PARC could not compete\ndirectly for talent because of the high salaries now routinely offered by tech\ngiants, it would still be possible to attract scientists and engineers\ninterested in the research freedom that the laboratory would provide. The new,\ncombined lab will have about 1,000 researchers.\n\nMr. Parekh, who is a mechanical engineer whose background is in the aerospace\nindustry and who became SRI\u2019s chief executive in 2021, said PARC would be able\nto attract both early-career researchers as well as mid-career and senior\nresearchers.\n\nHe acknowledged that while the reinvented PARC would not have a single \u201cinvent\nthe office of the future\u201d style-vision of the original laboratory, it would\nattempt to make advances in a variety of fields ranging from material science\ninventions to offset the effects of climate change to quantum computing.\n\nPARC is credited with the original graphical computing breakthrough known as\nthe WIMP interface, an acronym for Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer, that\ndescribes a style of human-computer interaction that was popularized by\nMacintosh and Windows personal computers.\n\nMr. Parekh said that the stage was now set for a second leap forward in the\nway humans interacted with computers. That was foreshadowed in basic research\ndone at SRI in the 2000s that led to the commercial spinoff of SIRI, a speech\nassistant that Mr. Jobs placed at the heart of the iPhone just before his\ndeath in 2011.\n\nMr. Parekh said he believed that the new research center could make major\ncontributions in research on more trustworthy and explainable artificial\nintelligence systems. SRI has been a pioneer in A.I. research since the 1960s,\nand Mr. Parekh said that combining today\u2019s neural net technologies with the\ntraditional symbolic A.I. work would pave the way for powerful systems that\nhave the ability to reason.\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, he said, is now funding PARC\u2019s\nresearch on futuristic human-machine collaboration, intended to make it\npossible for people and machines to plan and work together on tasks in both\ndigital and physical worlds.\n\nThe challenge, said Curtis Carlson, a physicist who was SRI\u2019s chief executive\nfrom 1998 to 2014, will be to create a culture that is able to make the\nconnection between invention and innovation, which he described as invention\ndelivered into the marketplace with a viable business model.\n\nPARC\u2019s inventiveness has always been a source of contention. Xerox was accused\nof \u201cfumbling the future,\u201d by not effectively commercializing the technology it\ninvented to become a major player in the computer industry. Mr. Jobs took away\nthe technology that still defines Apple\u2019s products, and Charles Simonyi, a\nyoung PARC software designer who left to work for Microsoft, took the ideas\nthat would become the heart of both Office and Windows.\n\nXerox executives had always responded that though they did not successfully\ncompete in the computer market, they got a huge return on their investment by\ncommercializing the laser printer technology PARC invented.\n\nBut many researchers who were at PARC\u2019s halcyon early days said that its\nstrength was that their research was unconstrained by the need to create a\nspecific product \u2014 a notion that seems hard to imagine in today\u2019s product-\noriented Silicon Valley.\n\nIn the 1970s, PARC was originally thought of as \u201chippie-ville,\u201d said Jan\nVandenbrande, a former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency project\nmanager who is now head of research at PARC. That culture, he said, has\nchanged and evolved since then, but has retained a spirit of \u201chow do you make\na difference in the world?\u201d and \u201chow do you democratize certain technologies?\u201d\n\nHead of Research Jan Vandenbrande wears a Halo vision device at the Palo Alto\nResearch Center.\n\nJohan De Kleer, a scientist who spent almost four decades at PARC before\nleaving recently to found an A.I. software company, said that PARC could be\nrevived only if Mr. Parekh could find a way to build some \u201cslack\u201d into the\nsystem by finding money to support open-ended research projects.\n\nSRI may have found that slack. The research laboratory is located in Menlo\nPark, Calif., in walking distance to the San Francisco to San Jose commuter\nrail line on 63 of Silicon Valley\u2019s most valuable acres.\n\nMr. Parekh is now planning to build a modern research campus and residential\ncommunity with new SRI buildings and space to attract other high-tech\ncompanies. The developer will share revenue from the project with SRI.\n\n\u201cThis is our annuity for the future for investing in research,\u201d Mr. Parekh\nsaid.\n\nProduced by Nico Chilla, Aliza Aufrichtig and Jeanne Noonan-DelMundo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\n\nSee subscription options\n\n", "frontpage": true}

And their only known plan to fix it involves a\n\"Professional Shaman\" & \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\". Seriously.\n\nBryan Lunduke\n\n17 hours ago\n\nIt's no secret that many Open Source organizations struggle to fund themselves\n-- with the GNOME Foundation being on more of a shoestring budget than you\nwould expect for a project as widely used as GNOME.\n\nTo make matters worse, the GNOME Foundation has been paying for most of their\nexpenses by draining their savings account (as they spend far more than they\ntake in).\n\nNow, apparently, those savings are running out.\n\nWhat's more: The GNOME Foundation has been unusually silent about their\noperations -- not publishing any public reports for closing in on 2 years now.\nAnd their strategy to save themselves from bankruptcy appears to center around\n\"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\nSeriously.\n\n### GNOME has \"hit the buffers\"\n\nFrom an April 26th announcement from GNOME Foundation President, Robert\nMcQueen:\n\n> \"As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit\n> (nonprofit speak for a loss \u2013 ie spending more than we\u2019ve been raising each\n> year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on reserves\n> from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The Foundation has a\n> reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in\n> our accounts. This is so that if there is a significant interruption to our\n> usual income, we can preserve our core operations while we work on new\n> funding sources. We\u2019ve now \u201chit the buffers\u201d of this reserves policy,\n> meaning the Board can\u2019t approve any more deficit budgets \u2013 to keep spending\n> at the same level we must increase our income.\"\n\nIn short: GNOME has run out of money. In order to \"keep spending at the same\nlevel\" GNOME needs to find some money.\n\n### What sort of money are we talking about?\n\nTo fully understand the dire straits the GNOME Foundation finds itself in,\nlet's take a look at what we know about their finances.\n\nUnfortunately, the GNOME Foundation has not published any data in close to two\nyears. They have not published an annual report for 2023, and their most\nrecent IRS records only cover their fiscal year up through September of 2022.\n\nWhich means we are forced to look at previous year's data and extrapolate\nforward based on what information we do have.\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 2022 Annual Report\n\nIn short, total expenses for the GNOME Foundation:\n\n  * 2021: $926,821\n  * 2022: $659,537\n\nAnd the revenue for those same years...\n\n  * 2021: $286,708\n  * 2022: $363,380\n\nNotice how the expenses far exceed the revenue? Not good. Subtract the\nexpenses from the revenue and you have the net income. And, boy howdy, is it\ndeep into the negative. Which means this is the amount they need to take out\nof their savings, every year, just to keep the lights on.\n\n  * 2021: - $640,113\n  * 2022: - $296,157\n\nWe know that GNOME is burning through between $296K and $640K, of savings, per\nyear. Which begs the question... how much do they have left in terms of cash\nreserves?\n\n### The GNOME Foundation Nest Egg\n\nThe most recent information we have, on the GNOME assets, comes from their IRS\nfilings up through September of 2022 (their last publicly available filing).\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 990 IRS Filing for September, 2022\n\nWhile those numbers don't exactly line up with the numbers stated in the GNOME\nFoundation's annual report, that's not entirely surprising. Oftentimes, for\nthese foundations, the annual reports and IRS filings will cover slightly\ndifferent time periods (and be filed at different times, when different data\nis available).\n\nJust the same, the numbers are close enough to the annual report that we can\nwork with it.\n\nBut the listed assets on this page, as of 2022, really don't give us enough\ninformation. This lists $909,107 in total net assets... but what we really\nneed to know is how much \"Savings and temporary cash investments\" they have.\n\nIn other words: How much money can GNOME get their hands on, in short notice,\nto actively use for funding their immediate expenses? For that, we'll need to\nlook a few pages further down their IRS 990 form... at this line:\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 990 IRS Filing for September, 2022\n\nBoom. There we go. $765,011.\n\nThat's how much the GNOME Foundation had, in September of 2022, in available\nsavings.\n\n### How much money does GNOME have left... today?\n\nNow here's where we're going to need to make some assumptions based on the\ndata above.\n\nI hate making assumptions... but, considering the lack of data from the GNOME\nFoundation, we're left with no other choice.\n\nLet's assume that, in 2023, GNOME managed to keep their annual expenditures\ndown to their 2022 levels (which was far, far lower than the 2021 levels... so\nthis is close to \"best case scenario\"). And let's also assume that their\nincome stayed steady as well. How much savings would they have left?\n\nMath time. Savings minus the amount they need to withdraw from savings.\n\n  * Oct, 2022 through Sep, 2023: $765,011 - $296,157 = $468,854\n\nNow let's make the same assumption from that point (October 2023) through to\npresent (April, 2024). 7 months in total.\n\nWe know that the total amount that GNOME would need to draw from their savings\n-- every month -- is roughly $24,679.75 ($296,157, the yearly savings\nwithdrawal, divided by 12 months). Thus, to get the amount of savings they've\nspent over the last 7 months... we simply multiply that number by 7. For which\nwe get $172,758.25.\n\n  * Oct, 2023 through Apr, 2024: $468,854 - $172,758.25 = $296,095.75\n\nIn theory, that's how much money the GNOME Foundation has left in savings.\n$296,095.75.\n\nWhy is that number significant? Because that is almost exactly the amount of\nsavings they will need to withdraw to stay afloat... for one year.\n\nRemember. From the announcement this week: \"The Foundation has a reserves\npolicy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in our\naccounts.\"\n\nCould this be related to that number we came up with above? It's possible. It\ncertainly would seem reasonable. But, without better records and communication\nfrom the GNOME Foundation, we won't know for sure.\n\n### GNOME Foundation has One Year Left?\n\nIf their numbers have stayed consistent since September of 2022 -- which is a\nbig if -- this means that The GNOME Foundation has enough funds to continue\ncurrent operations through April of 2025.\n\nAt which point... the GNOME Foundation will need to significantly scale back\ntheir expenditures.\n\nThey will be forced to lay off the majority of their staff.\n\nAll of which raises a number of questions.\n\n### What is the new Executive Director doing to save GNOME?\n\nIn October of 2023, the GNOME Foundation hired a new Executive Director. A\nperson whose previous job was as a self-described \"Professional Shaman\" -- not\nreligiously associated with Shamanism, mind you, but a person who sold\n\"flavored Shaman water\" and offered paid \"Start your own Shaman business\"\ntraining.\n\nIn the half year since that time, the new GNOME Executive Director, Holly\nMillion, has had very little public presence -- no blog posts (after a short\nintroduction), no social media activity, no major interviews, no response to\npress requests... totally quiet. During the one publicly held event (a \"Meet\nand Greet\" last year), journalists were kicked out before it started and the\nplanned recording was canceled for unknown reasons.\n\nWhat has this GNOME Executive Director been doing to make sure that the GNOME\nFoundation does not go out of business? It is a mystery. Total silence.\n\nIn fact, one of the few indications we have as to the direction that the GNOME\nFoundation is taking, comes from Twitter posts by other GNOME Board members.\nNamely, one from the GNOME Vice President, stating:\n\n> \"excited about the progressive conversation we had with the executive\n> director Holly Million. We engaged in extensive discussions regarding the\n> strategic direction of @gnome, focusing on #sustainability, #diversity, and\n> #inclusion. The future looks green\"\n\nSource: Twitter account for GNOME Vice President, Regina Nkenchor\n\nFrom what little information we have, it appears that the GNOME profitability\nefforts are centered around \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\nOh, and \"Hashtag: Technology\". With a shamrock emoji.\n\n\"How does that result in GNOME not going out of business,\" you ask? I wish I\ncould tell you.\n\nBut, according to this week's announcement by the GNOME President, fundraising\nis one of the key reasons why Holly Million was hired away from her Shaman\njob.\n\n> \"One of the board\u2019s top priorities in hiring Holly was therefore her\n> experience in communications and fundraising, and building broader and more\n> diverse support for our mission and work. Her goals since joining \u2013 as well\n> as building her familiarity with the community and project \u2013 have been to\n> set up better financial controls and reporting, develop a strategic plan,\n> and start fundraising.\"\n\nCommunications. Fundraising. Financial reporting.\n\nThat's why their Executive Director was hired -- and those were her goals\nsince she started work over half a year ago.\n\nIn that time the GNOME Executive Director has:\n\n  * Given no interviews.\n  * Been totally radio silent (no articles, social posts, podcasts, videos... nothing).\n  * Not published any financial reports of any kind. We have no clue what GNOME has been doing, financially, for almost 2 years now.\n  * And, from what little we're being told, she has continued GNOME's deathmarch towards running out of money.\n\nThose goals again: Communications. Fundraising. Financial reporting.\n\nSounds like a massive, unmitigated failure of all three goals to me. And their\nplan to turn things around sounds like it centers on \"sustainability,\ndiversity, and inclusion\"... which is not exactly a strong business plan.\n\n### What happens now?\n\nIt sounds like things are getting desperate. And the GNOME Foundation will be\nannouncing their plan to save The GNOME Foundation in the weeks ahead.\n\n> \"The biggest prerequisite for fundraising is a clear strategy \u2013 we need to\n> explain what we\u2019re doing and why it\u2019s important, and use that to convince\n> people to support our plans. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Holly has been\n> working hard on this and meeting with many stakeholders across the\n> community, and has prepared a detailed and insightful five year strategic\n> plan. The plan defines the areas where the Foundation will prioritise,\n> develop and fund initiatives to support and grow the GNOME project and\n> community. The board has approved a draft version of this plan, and over the\n> coming weeks Holly and the Foundation team will be sharing this plan and\n> running a consultation process to gather feedback input from GNOME\n> foundation and community members.\"\n\nWhat is that plan? How likely is that plan to succeed in bringing in enough\nfunding to keep the foundation float?\n\nAt this point, we simply don't know. The GNOME Foundation -- and their\nExecutive Director -- is staying tight lipped and secretive.\n\nAll we know is that it includes \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\n### Wait. What about that Million Euro investment?!\n\nRight about now you might be remembering that, last year, the GNOME Foundation\nannounced that they would be receiving 1 Million Euros from the Sovereign Tech\nFund.\n\nIt sounds like those funds aren't for the foundation, but for specific\ndevelopment purposes:\n\n> \"This money is received in the form of a contract for services rather than a\n> grant to the Foundation, and must be spent on the development areas agreed\n> during the planning and application process. It\u2019s included within this\n> year\u2019s budget (October 23 \u2013 September 24) and is all expected to be spent\n> during this fiscal year, so it doesn\u2019t have an impact on the Foundation\u2019s\n> reserves position.\"\n\nIn other words: That million Euro? It won't be beefing up their savings\naccount.\n\n### What about Red Hat, SUSE, & Canonical?\n\nGNOME is heavily relied upon by some of the biggest Linux companies on Earth.\n\nRight about now it's worth considering... why haven't Red Hat (or SUSE &\nCanonical, for that matter) stepped up to provide the needed funding for the\nfoundation which supports their default Desktop Environment?\n\nMaybe they can't. Maybe they don't want to. The reason for the lack of funding\nis entirely unknown. But it's worth asking, just the same.\n\nFor that matter, where is The Linux Foundation? This seems like exactly the\nsort of thing a \"Linux\" foundation -- with over a quarter of a Billion dollars\nin annual revenue -- could do to help \"Linux\".\n\n### This isn't the first time... but...\n\nIs the GNOME Foundation poised to run out of money? It certainly appears so.\nAnd, clearly, the foundation leadership is concerned.\n\nBut this isn't the first time they've had money trouble.\n\nBack in 2014 (10 years ago), there were serious concerns about the financials\nof the GNOME Foundation. So much so that a spending freeze was put into place.\n\nGNOME survived that 2014 financial dip, just as it could certainly survive\nthis new one. Yet the actions of the GNOME Foundation raises serious concerns\nand doubts.\n\n  * Why is GNOME staying so secretive? No published plans, no communication at all from their Executive Director, no published recent reports.\n  * The only known details of their secret plan to avert a shut down are... \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\". That can't be real... can it? No serious software foundation would stare at possible bankruptcy... and make that a significant part of their strategy.\n  * What has the Executive Director been doing for half a year? Why hasn't there been any noteworthy fundraising or sponsorships? Considering GNOME's unique place in the Linux and Open Source world, funding GNOME should not be an issue for anyone even slightly familiar with fundraising and the Linux corporate world.\n  * Why have the large Linux & Open Source companies -- and The Linux Foundation -- not gotten involved? What's going on there?\n\nIn the coming weeks, the GNOME Foundation has said that they will announce\ndetails of their secretive plan to keep their foundation alive.\n\nFor what it's worth, The Lunduke Journal is rooting for them -- and their\nsecret plan. Whatever it may be. I truly hope it succeeds.\n\nBut, considering the bad financials and all of the other reasons outlined\nhere, I remain less than optimistic.\n\nJoin the Lunduke Community\n\nTo read more articles like this, sign up and join my community today\n\n28\n\nView All\n\n30\n\nWhat else you may like...\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nPosts\n\nArticles\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n5 hours ago\n\nLet's talk about the GNOME Foundation being out of money.\n\nThe foundation behind the biggest Linux Desktop environment -- the one used by\nRed Hat, Ubuntu, & SUSE -- is in dire straights.

Internet Archive\" lawsuit (for which, judgment was handed\ndown, against Internet Archive, last year).\n\nWhat is curious, is that this final brief fails -- almost completely -- to\nreasonably address the core issues of the lawsuit. What's more, the public\nstatements that followed, by The Internet Archive, appeared to be crafted to\ndrum up public sympathy by misrepresenting the core of the case itself.\n\nWhich suggests that The Internet Archive is very much aware that they are\nlikely to lose this appeal.\n\nAfter a careful reading of the existing public documents relating to this\ncase... it truly is difficult to come to any other conclusion.\n\nThe Internet Archive does some critically important work by archiving, and\nindexing, a wide variety of culturally significant material (from webpages to\ndecades old magazine articles). In this work, they help to preserve history. A\nextremely noble, and valuable, endeavor. Which makes the likelihood of this\nlegal defeat all the more unfortunate.\n\n### What is \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"?\n\nHere's the short-short version of this lawsuit:\n\nThe Internet Archive created a program they called \"Controlled Digital\nLending\" (CDL) -- where a physical book is scanned, turned into a digital\nfile, and that digital file is then \"loaned\" out to people on the Internet. In\n2020, The Internet Archive removed what few restrictions existed with this\nDigital Lending program, allowing an unlimited number of people to download\nthe digital copy of a book.\n\nThe result was a group of publishers filing the \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"\nlawsuit. That lawsuit focused on two key complaints:\n\n  1. The books were \"digitized\" (converted from physical to digital form) -- and distributed -- without the permission of the copyright holders (publishers, authors, etc.).\n  2. The Internet Archive received monetary donations (and other monetary rewards) as a result of freely distributing said copyrighted material. Again, without permission of the copyright holders. Effectively making the Internet Archive's CDL a commercial enterprise for the distribution of what is best described as \"pirated material\".\n\nThat lawsuit was decided, against The Internet Archive, in 2023 -- with the\njudge declaring that \"no case or legal principle supports\" their defense of\n\"Fair Use\".\n\nThat judgment was appealed by The Internet Archive. Which brings us to today,\nand thier final defense (in theory).\n\n### What is the final defense of The Internet Archive?\n\nLet's take a look at the final brief in The Internet Archive's bid to appeal\nthis ruling.\n\nIn true Internet Archive form, a PDF of the final brief in their appeal has\nbeen posted to Archive.org.\n\nThe general defense of The Internet Archive is fairly simple: The Internet\nArchive's \"Controlled Digital Lending\" falls under \"Fair Use\". And, therefor,\nis legal.\n\nLet's look at two of the key arguments within the brief... and the issues with\nthem.\n\n### Not \"For Anyone to Read\"\n\n> \"Controlled digital lending is not equivalent to posting an ebook online for\n> anyone to read\"\n\nThis argument -- part of the brief's Introduction -- is quite a strange\ndefense to make.\n\nThe \"Controlled Digital Lending\" program, starting in March of 2020, literally\nposted a massive book archive \"online for anyone to read\". This was branded\nthe \"National Emergency Library\".\n\nGood intentions aside, the Internet Archive is now attempting to claim that\nthey did not do... the exact thing that they proudly did (they even issued\npress releases about how they did it).\n\nAs such, I don't see a judge being swayed by this (poorly thought out)\nargument.\n\n### \"Because of the Huge Investment\"\n\n> \"... because of the huge investment required to operate a legally compliant\n> controlled lending system and the controls defining the practice, finding\n> fair use here would not trigger any of the doomsday consequences for\n> rightsholders that Publishers and their amici claim to fear.\"\n\nDid you follow that?\n\nThe argument here is roughly as follows:\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to make, and distribute, digital copies of books\nwithout the permission of the copyright holder... therefore it should be legal\nfor The Internet Archive to do it.\"\n\nAn absolutely fascinating defense. \"Someone else might not be able to commit\nthis crime, so we should be allowed to do it\" is one of the weirdest defences\nI have ever heard.\n\nAgain, I doubt the judge in this case is likely to be convinced by this logic.\n\nThere are many other arguments made within this final brief -- in total, 32\npages worth of arguments. But none were any more convincing -- from a logical\nperspective -- than the two presented here. In fact, most of the arguments\ntended to be entirely unrelated to the core lawsuit and judgment.\n\n### The Court of Public Opinion\n\nLet's be honest: The Internet Archive looks destined to lose this court\nbattle. They lost once, and their appeal is, to put it mildly, weak.\n\nMaybe you and I are on the side of The Internet Archive. Maybe we are such big\nfans of Archive.org that we want to come to their defense.\n\nBut feelings don't matter here. Only facts. And the facts are simple. The\nArchive's actions and statements (and questionable legal defense) have all but\nensured a loss in this case.\n\nSo... what happens next?\n\nWhat do you do when you have a profitable enterprise (bringing in between $20\nand $30 million per year) that is on the verge of a potentially devastating\nlegal ruling which could put you out of business?\n\nWhy, you turn to the court of public opinion, of course!\n\nAnd you spin. Spin, spin, spin. Spin like the wind!\n\nHere is a statement from Brewster Kahle, founder of The Internet Archive\", who\nis working to frame this as a fight for the rights of Libraries:\n\n> \"Resolving this should be easy\u2014just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own,\n> preserve and lend them to one person at a time. This is a battle for the\n> soul of libraries in the digital age.\"\n\nA battle for the soul of libraries! Woah! The soul?!\n\nThat's an intense statement -- clearly crafted to elicit an emotional\nresponse. To whip people up.\n\nBut take another look at the rest of that statement. The Internet Archive\nfounder says that resolving this case \"should be easy\". And he provides a\nsimple, easy-to-follow solution:\n\n> \"just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one\n> person at a time\"\n\nGo ahead. Read that again. At first it makes total sense... until you realize\nthat it has almost nothing to do with this specific case.\n\nLet's ignore the \"one person at a time\" statement, which is a well established\nlie (the Internet Archive proudly distributed digital copies of physical books\nto anyone who wanted them, not \"one at a time\").\n\nBut take a look at this proposed resolution... note that it has very little to\ndo with the actual case. The case is about the digitizing of physical books,\nand distributing those digital copies without permission of the copyright\nholder. This proposed resolution is about... selling eBooks to lenders.\n\nYes. Both have to do with eBooks. And, yes, both have to do with lending\neBooks.\n\nBut that is where the similarities end. And the differences, in this case, are\nabsolutely critical.\n\nLet's take a look at the actual ruling -- which The Internet Archive is\nattempting to appeal:\n\n> \"At bottom, [the Internet Archive\u2019s] fair use defense rests on the notion\n> that lawfully acquiring a copyrighted print book entitles the recipient to\n> make an unauthorized copy and distribute it in place of the print book, so\n> long as it does not simultaneously lend the print book. But no case or legal\n> principle supports that notion. Every authority points the other direction.\"\n\nThe Internet Archive's publicly proposed resolution does not address this\nruling at all. Which means that, when talking to the public, The Internet\nArchive is being dishonest about this case.\n\nBut they are using flowery language -- \"battle for the soul of libraries\" --\nso they'll likely manage to convince many people that they're telling the\ntruth and representing the facts of the case fairly and honestly. Even if they\nare not.\n\n### There Are Important Disagreements Here\n\nNone of which is to say that the points which The Internet Archive is\nmaking... are necessarily wrong.\n\nFrom the announcement of their appeal, the Archive states the following:\n\n> \"By restricting libraries\u2019 ability to lend the books they own digitally, the\n> publishers\u2019 license-only business model and litigation strategies perpetuate\n> inequality in access to knowledge.\"\n\nWhile this statement is designed to evoke specific feelings and responses --\namong specific political demographics (see: \"perpetuate inequality\") -- there\nis an underlying set of issues here that are worth thinking about.\n\n  * Is it important that libraries be able to lend official digital editions of books?\n  * Should publishers, authors, and other copyright holders be forced to supply digital versions of their written works to libraries?\n  * If digital works, borrowed from a library, are then copied and distributed more than the rights allow... who is ultimately responsible for that? The library? The creator of the software system which facilitated the lending? Nobody at all?\n  * Should Libraries or Publishers be able to censor or modify digital works... or should a published digital work be maintained as it is at time of publication? (This issue comes up a lot when talking about censorship and revisions of works.)\n\nThese are legitimate questions. And, while the answers may appear obvious,\nthere truly are distinct disagreements among publishers, authors, and\nlibraries.\n\nSome of these issues are raised by The Internet Archive,\nBattleForLibraries.com, and others.\n\nThe \"Battle for Libraries\" campaign\n\nBut none of these questions -- not one -- are part of the ruling in \"Hachette\nv. Internet Archive\".\n\nThe question that has been answered in this case is simply:\n\n  * If you buy physical media (such as a book), can that media be digitized and distributed on the Internet (without authorization or notification of the copyright owner)?\n\nAnd the answer is, thus far, a resounding... \"No\".\n\n### The Can of Worms\n\nWhat happens if the judge chooses to uphold the existing judgment against The\nInternet Archive?\n\nA number of things seems possible (with some seeming like a downright\ncertainty).\n\n  * Publishers, authors, and copyright holders of works distributed by The Internet Archive may choose to seek damages. Which could put The Internet Archive in a precarious financial position (to say the least).\n  * The Internet Archive may be forced to remove other content of questionable copyright. Including software, video, and audio archives.\n  * Other archival projects may now come under increased scrutiny... thus making it riskier to archive and distribute various types of material.\n  * And, of course, The Internet Archive could attempt to appeal the case ever higher. Which may be tricky.\n\nThen again... The Internet Archive could win this appeal.\n\nUnlikely. But, hey, weirder things have happened.\n\nRead full Article\n\n22\n\nView All\n\n19\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nMS-DOS 4.0 Source Code Fails to Compile\n\nPlus: Source comments, by Microsoft, calling the creator of DOS \"brain-\ndamaged\" get censored.\n\nYesterday, Microsoft released the source code for MS-DOS 4.0... an action\nwhich I have encouraged Microsoft to take for many years (including when I\nworked at Microsoft).\n\nAnd, while this source code release is most definitely a win for the\npreservation of computer history, there are some rather ridiculous issues with\nit.\n\nMost notably:\n\n  * The source doesn't actually fully compile. It is not usable in its current state.\n  * The source code has been modified by Microsoft -- even after the publication this week -- reducing the historical value of the code.\n  * Also Microsoft claims to have lost some source code.\n\nYeah. You read that first bullet point right. It does not compile. I'll walk\nyou through the details (including a step-by-step guide for how you can fail\nto compile MS-DOS 4.0 yourself).\n\nBut, first, a little backstory.\n\n### The MS-DOS 4.0 Story (The Short, Short Version)\n\nMS-DOS 4.0, released back in 1986, was a bit of an oddity. It was a\nmultitasking version of DOS (similar in that way to Wendin-DOS). And,\nimportantly, it was not a direct continuation of the existing MS-DOS line --\nin fact \"MS-DOS 4.0\" was released between versions \"3.1\" and \"3.3\" (almost\nexactly coinciding with the \"3.2\" release).\n\nFun Side Note: There are multiple multitasking variants of DOS (or ways to\nmultitask in DOS). Most of which were not built or supplied by Microsoft. In\ncase you didn't know that... now you do.\n\nThis Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0 was not commercially successful -- to put it\nmildly -- and that line of \"Multitasking MS-DOS\" was quickly abandoned.\n\nLuckily -- or not luckily, depending on how you look at it -- IBM co-developed\na completely different version of \"MS-DOS 4.0\" that had almost nothing to do\nwith the multitasking version Microsoft created. This IBM-made version, a\ncontinuation of MS-DOS 3.x, continued to be single-tasking. But, oh-boy, was\nit buggy. Legendarily buggy.\n\nUltimately, when it was obvious that the Multitasking \"MS-DOS 4.0\" was a dead-\nend, Microsoft took IBM's totally unrelated \"MS-DOS 4.0\" and released it also\nas \"MS-DOS 4.0\". (Two different Operating Systems, same name and same version\nnumber. Because that's not at all confusing.) Then -- quickly -- re-worked a\nbunch of it -- releasing that as \"MS-DOS 4.01\".\n\nThat single-tasking version (\"4.01\") went on to have some success -- though it\nis widely regarded as one of the buggier releases of MS-DOS.\n\n### The MS-DOS 4.0 Source Release\n\nTwo totally different things named \"MS-DOS 4.0\". So what, exactly, is\nMicrosoft releasing the source code for?\n\nWell. There are two parts.\n\n  * A version of the source code for the IBM-developed, not Multitasking version of MS-DOS 4.0.\n  * An earlier Beta build of the Multitasking version of MS-DOS 4.0 (from 1984, long before it was even called \"4.0\"). No source code is available (other than for BIOS related utilities for OEMs), but there are some scanned documentation, which is nice from a historical viewpoint.\n\nFloppies of an early Beta of Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0\n\nBoth are available via GitHub. And everything is released under the MIT\nlicense.\n\nWhich means that, yes, if you can get that single-tasking 4.0 code to build...\nyou can, in theory, fork these releases and continue developing them. (Though\nyou'll need to change the name, as Microsoft still holds the trademarks.)\n\nThis work was announced in a joint blog post by Jeff Wilcox (Head of Open\nSource Programs Office) and Scott Hanselman (Vice President of Developer\nCommunity) at Microsoft.\n\nFun Side Note #2: That Vice President, Scott Hanselman, is the same Microsoft\nexecutive who has previously encouraged people to commit crimes against people\nbased on their skin color and gender. Telling people to be ready to \"go to\njail\" for those crimes. While that bit of information has absolutely nothing\nto do with the MS-DOS 4.0 source code release... it's nice to have background\non the people in the story.\n\n### What code, exactly, did we get?\n\nThis release, from Microsoft, is a valuable and interesting one. It contains a\ngreat deal of historically significant information -- and I am absolutely\nfilled to the brim with nerdy joy as I go through it.\n\nUnfortunately... it does not include code for the multitasking version of\n\"4.0\".\n\nFrom the announcement:\n\n> \"Jeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were\n> unable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00,\n> which we\u2019re releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs\n> of the documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the\n> archives and may update this release if more is discovered.\"\n\nAs a former Microsoft employee... this is... strange. And, quite honestly, not\nat all believable.\n\nDuring my time working at Microsoft, I knew of backed up copies of source code\nfor darned near everything -- including almost every version of MS-DOS from\n3.3 onward (that I, personally, saw).\n\nYet they were unable to find code for the Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0? Knowing,\nintimately, how the various groups within Microsoft handled backing up source\ncode and binaries for releases... this statement from Microsoft makes me\nhighly skeptical.\n\nUnless Microsoft completely forgot how to backup source code in the last few\nyears, I'm going to call this claim utterly bogus.\n\n### Is it Actually MS-DOS 4.0?\n\nJust to make everything far more confusing than it already is... this may not\nactually be MS-DOS 4.0. It might be MS-DOS 4.01... or PC-DOS 4.01... or some\nstrange combination.\n\nTake a look at SETENV.BAT in the source code release and you will find the\nfollowing line:\n\n> echo setting up system to build the MS-DOS 4.01 SOURCE BAK...\n\nWhat files I have been able to build appear to exactly match the MS-DOS 4.0\n(not 4.01) release images. But, being as some of this source code release is\nmangled beyond use, unfortunately we can't really be sure that everything\nmatches the actual 4.0 release. It might be an interim build between 4.0 and\n4.01.\n\nOh! That's right.\n\nDid I mention that this source code release of MS-DOS 4.0 doesn't successfully\nbuild?\n\n### The Code Does Not Compile\n\nAllow me to repeat myself:\n\nThe code that has been supplied contains significant problems which will\nprohibit it from compiling a complete, working version of MS-DOS 4.0.\n\nI attempted build under multiple environments (including on a released version\nof MS-DOS 4.01, MS-DOS 5, PC-DOS, and under DOSBox) -- and dug through the\nerrors until I was confident of the issues (and, importantly, was confident\nthat we weren't simply looking at an obvious case of user error).\n\nERROR! ERROR!\n\nNote: If you want to skip the \"How To Build It\" portion, simply scroll down to\nthe \"BOOM! ERROR!\" section below.\n\nWant to unsuccessfully build MS-DOS 4.0 yourself? Here are some super easy to\nfollow steps.\n\n  1. Download the contents of the MS-DOS 4.0 GitHub repository.\n  2. Install DOSBox. (Seriously, this works just as well in DOSBox as it does anywhere else.)\n  3. Within DOSBox run the following command: \"MOUNT D PATH\" (replace \"PATH\" with the path to that folder you downloaded in step 1).\n\nIf you did everything correctly, you will now -- within DOSBox -- have a D:\\\ndrive with a directory named \"SRC\" in it.\n\nNote the D:\\SRC directory. That's important.\n\nThe BAT and make files which build MS-DOS 4.0 expect all of the files to be in\nD:\\SRC. So replicating that environment will make it so you don't need to\ntweak any files at all.\n\nNow we actually do the build.\n\n  1. Change to the D:\\SRC directory. \"D:\" then \"CD SRC\".\n  2. Now run \"SETENV.BAT\". This will setup the paths and whatnot for the build environment.\n  3. Then simply run \"NMAKE\". That will kick off the build for everything.\n\nEasy, right?\n\n### BOOM! ERROR!\n\nAt this point you will quickly see that several files compile cleanly. Until\nyou get to GETMSG.ASM and, later, USA.INF. Both of these files are mangled. I\nwas able to force GETMSG.ASM to compile by commenting out some lines... but\nUSA.INF is completely hosed.\n\nI don't see how whoever uploaded this source could have possibly done a\nsuccessful compile prior to releasing it.\n\nSeriously. Hosed, I say! Hosed!\n\nIt's not all bad news, luckily. The majority of the code does appear to be\nhere -- and most of it builds without any catastrophic errors. With some work\n(a replaced file here, some re-written code there) I am confident a variant on\nthis MS-DOS 4.0 release will be able to be built... unfortunately, because of\nchanges needed to make it compile, it won't be a historically perfect replica\nof the system.\n\nNot without Microsoft figuring out what they did wrong and re-releasing the\nsource code. Which, considering how rarely Microsoft releases source code for\nthese historical pieces of software... I won't be holding my breath.\n\nFun Side Note #3: After Microsoft announced the source code release of MS-DOS\n4.0, a huge number of articles have popped up on a number of Tech News sites.\nTech Journalist after Tech Journalist praising the release. Yet not one of\nthem has reported that the code does not actually compile. Which means that\nnone of them even tried to verify the claims from Microsoft. Not. One. Except\nfor The Lunduke Journal, of course. I'll let you draw your own conclusion\nabout what that means.\n\n### The historical record has been compromised... a little.\n\nIt doesn't build. That's a problem.\n\nAlso, it's kind of hard to be 100% sure what this specific release even is (is\nit 4.0... is it 4.01... is it from IBM or MS? An interim build? It looks\nmostly like 4.0... but there's some weird bits that could use clarification.).\n\nBut what makes this even worse... is that not only has some of the code been\nmangled and corrupted... but some of the code comments were actively modified\nin the few hours after the source code was publicly posted!\n\nThus further destroying the historical value of this source code. Which, to\nput it mildly, kinda sucks.\n\n### Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\n\nBut, as luck would have it, that source code change... is really, really\namusing. And pretty minor.\n\n\"Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\"\n\nA modified comment. \"Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\" becomes \"Brain-damaged TP\".\n\nIt's a simple change -- obscuring an insult of Tim Patterson (the original\ncreator of Quick & Dirty DOS)... replacing his full name with his initials.\nBut, if this is a historical record, this change should not occur.\n\nHere's a fun question: Who, exactly, made this change? Microsoft is not\naccepting any changes to this source code repository from the outside world.\nSo, whoever made the change has the blessing of Microsoft.\n\nWell, hold on to your butts!\n\nThis change was made by GitHub user \"mzbik\", with the simple comment \"MZ is\nback!\".\n\nOk. Great. But who the heck is \"MZ\"?\n\nNone other than the legendary Mark Zbikowski. One of the early Microsoft\nemployees (joining in 1981) -- and the programmer who took over the MS-DOS\nproject (from Tim Patterson) starting with version 2.0... and leading DOS\nthrough version 4.0.\n\nMark Zbikowski and his epic moustache.\n\nClearly Mark -- who usurped Tim as the Dev Lead / Manager of MS-DOS -- did not\nwant that little \"Brain-damaged\" insult of Tim to be part of the historical\nrecord.\n\nOr, perhaps, he really wanted to call attention to it by making the change.\n\nEither way, we now can be somewhat sure that Mark Zbikowski, himself, wrote\nthat comment way back in the 1980s. And, even more fascinating, Mark\nremembered that comment -- from the '80s -- so clearly that he knew to quickly\ngo and change it -- almost immediately -- once the source was made public. (I\nbarely remember source code comments I made last week, let alone almost 40\nyears ago... this really stuck with him!)\n\nAnd that level of irreverent whimsy -- one historically significant programmer\ninsulting another historically significant programmer... in source code\ncomments -- makes me smile.\n\nOk, sure. That change isn't a huge deal. In fact, I'm now glad it happened as\nit drew my attention to it.\n\nBut what else has been changed? What else will be changed? It's worth asking.\nThis is for the preservation of history, after all.\n\n### Lots and Lots of Questions\n\nIn fact, this release raises a lot of questions.\n\n  * Why was building of this source code not tested prior to release?\n  * What process caused these source code files to be mangled?\n  * What all was changed from the original source archive?\n  * Why has Microsoft only released source code for the 3 least popular versions of MS-DOS (1.25, 2.0, & 4.0)? Microsoft does not profit from versions 3.3, 5.0, or 6.x (far more popular and/or useful releases). Why are those being held back?\n  * Microsoft loves to tell people how much they love Open Source... yet they have released source code for only a very small number of products (far less than 1% of their total software releases). Even ancient software, unsuported for decades, remains closed source. Why?\n  * The last release of MS-DOS source code (versions 1.25 and 2.0) occurred 10 years ago (2014). Why has it taken 10 years to release source code that Microsoft hasn't used since the 1980s? Will the next release of source code be 10 years from now... in 2034?\n  * And, shoot, why has not one other Tech News publication actually tried to compile this code... or notice the changes being made... or look into the details at all?\n\nI don't mean to sound like a Negative Nancy, here. This release is, without a\ndoubt, incredibly interesting and important.\n\nAnd Microsoft is under no obligation to release the source code for these\npieces of software. No obligation whatsoever. If they wanted to keep it all\nlocked away in their vault, that's entirely their call.\n\nThat said, Microsoft's near constant declarations of their \"love for Open\nSource\" -- including their ownership of GitHub -- would suggest to me that\nthey would be eager to release the source for 30 and 40 year old software that\nthey haven't earned a penny on in decades.\n\nIf they truly loved the idea of \"Open Source\"... they would do it. In a\nheartbeat. But they don't. Which tells me a lot about their actual views on\n\"Open Source\".\n\n### Some things never change...\n\nWhen I worked at Microsoft -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s -- I pushed,\nregularly, to release code, binaries, and documentation of historicaly\nsignificant Microsoft software. The old stuff that nobody used anymore, but\nwhich should be preserved and studied for posterity.\n\nBack in those days, I got a lot of push-back. To put it mildly.\n\nMicrosoft management was extremely hesitant to release code -- and even free\nbinaries -- of these historic products. And, honestly, it looks like that\nsituation has barely improved since then. Shoot.

The Lunduke Journal knows better.\n\nRead full Article\n\n24\n\nView All\n\n14\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nRed Hat Whistleblowers say Company Ignores Ethics Violations\n\n... when those violations are in line with racist or sexist policies.\n\nOver the last several months, we've learned a great deal about the racist and\nsexist policies within Red Hat (the largest Linux company on Earth) and parent\ncompany, IBM.\n\nThis includes corporate training which teaches that \"Whiteness\" is a bad\nthing, racist \"pledge\" systems, skin-color based hiring quotas, and more.\n\nNow, thanks to whistleblowers continuing to provide leaked material to The\nLunduke Journal, we have learned that Red Hat ignores reports of corporate\nethics violations... when those violations are in line with Red Hat's\nestablished racist policies.\n\n### Red Hat's Ethics Violation Reporting System\n\nRed Hat provides only one system which allows employees to anonymously report\nethics violations: The \"Red Hat Ethics Hotline\" provided by a company named\nConvercent.\n\nThe Red Hat \"Ethics Hotline\"\n\nThe \"Ethics Hotline\" includes this note from Tom Savage, Senior Vice President\n(and General Counsel) for Red Hat:\n\n> \"Whether you speak up through this Compliance and Ethics Hotline or another\n> reporting channel, take comfort in knowing, as outlined in the Code of\n> Business Conduct and Ethics, that Red Hat is committed to protecting\n> associates from retaliation.\"\n\nFrom the Red Hat \"Ethics Hotline\"\n\nHowever, this statement from Red Hat's General Counsel appears to be untrue.\nOr, at the very least, Red Hat employees do not believe it to be true. As\nreported by whistleblowers within Red Hat, it is felt that making purely\nanonymous complaints is the \"only safe way of reporting politically sensitive\ntopics.\"\n\n### Ethics Violations Ignored by Red Hat\n\nAccording to one whistleblower, reports of ethics violations are \"always\nignored\".\n\nAnother whistleblower submitted multiple reports using the \"Ethics Hotline\",\nonly to have each one \"Closed\" with no details or resolution of any kind.\nReports were closed \"suddenly, with no notice or explanation or marking.\"\n\nThe following is a screenshot of one such ethics violation report, using the\n\"Ethics Hotline\", which has been \"Closed\" with no messages, attachments, or\nresponse of any kind.\n\nSource: Red Hat Whistleblower\n\nYou'll note that this ethics violation report deals directly with race and\nsex-based discrimination within the hiring and career advancement programs at\nRed Hat. A topic which, regardless of outcome, is the type of potential\n\"ethics violation\" (with severe legal consequences) which any company would\nwant to take seriously.\n\nYet this \"Ethics Hotline\" report -- along with several others provided to The\nLunduke Journal for review -- was marked as \"Closed\" with not so much as a\nnote explaining why.\n\nWhether it be the fault of the system being used, an issue with Red Hat\ncorporate policy, or actions of the individuals responsible for reviewing\nthese violation reports... one Red Hat whistleblower says \"there is no real\nway for employees to report ethics violations.\"\n\nWhat we know:\n\n  * Red Hat (along with parent company, IBM) has multiple racist & sexist programs -- of, at best, dubious legality -- many of which would constitute clear ethics violations.\n  * While Red Hat provides a mechanism for employees to report such ethics violations, those reports (at least when dealing with the racist & sexist actions of individiuals within the company, and corporate policy) are ignored and \"Closed\" without a stated reason.\n  * Red Hat employees feel \"unsafe\" reporting such violations in any non-anonymous way.\n\nThese facts paint a highly unsavory picture of Red Hat's commitement (or lack\nthereof) to behaving and doing business in an ethical way.\n\nAs always, The Lunduke Journal invites Red Hat (and parent company, IBM) to\nrespond if any information within this report is inaccurate in any way. The\nLunduke Journal prides itself on accurate, factual reporting and will publish\ncorrections, comments, or clarifications provided by the company.\n\n### Become a Tech Whistleblower\n\nThe Lunduke Journal takes the privacy of whistleblowers incredibly seriously\n-- we have a firm rule of never revealing any information regarding the\nidentidy of whistleblowers, and all leaked material is meticulously researched\nand scrubbed (with all possibly identifying metadata removed) prior to\npublication.\n\nDo you work in the Tech industry?

Follow PsyPost on LinkedIn!\n\nIn recent years, interest in psychedelic-assisted therapy has grown due to its\npotential to treat various psychological disorders such as depression,\nanxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, a new study published in\nthe Journal of Psychedelic Studies raises important concerns. It suggests that\nwhile there may be benefits, there are also significant risks.\n\nThe study focuses on the negative effects reported by therapists who\nfacilitate such treatments, highlighting that the impacts of psilocybin are\nnot universally beneficial and can vary widely from one individual to another.\n\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by over 200\nspecies of mushrooms, commonly known as \u201cmagic mushrooms.\u201d When ingested,\npsilocybin is converted into psilocin, which primarily affects the serotonin\nreceptors in the brain, leading to altered perceptions, emotions, and\nthoughts. This can result in profound changes in consciousness, often\ndescribed as spiritual or transcendental experiences.\n\nPsilocybin-assisted therapy combines the controlled use of psilocybin with\npsychotherapy sessions. The typical protocol involves a preparatory session\nwhere therapists establish rapport with clients and set intentions for the\ntreatment. This is followed by one or more dosing sessions, where clients\nconsume psilocybin in a controlled, supportive environment, allowing them to\nexplore their thoughts and emotions with professional guidance.\n\nIntegration sessions then help clients make sense of their experiences,\nfacilitating psychological healing and personal growth. Research has shown\npromising results, particularly in treating depression, anxiety, and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, offering relief where traditional treatments have\nfailed.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that psychedelic substances like psilocybin\nare generally safe from a physiological standpoint and can be beneficial when\nused in controlled, therapeutic settings. However, the psychological risks\nassociated with these substances, which can profoundly alter perception and\nemotional states, are less understood.\n\nThese substances increase suggestibility, emotional sensitivity, and can\ndramatically alter one\u2019s perceptual framework, which can sometimes lead to\npersistent psychological disturbances. The new study was undertaken to explore\nthe less-discussed potential negative impacts of psilocybin.\n\n\u201cThe potential benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy have been a popular\ndiscussion point recently. I was invited to join a research group that had\nbegun evaluating the potential drawbacks and negative impacts of psilocybin in\npsychotherapy,\u201d explained study author J\u00f3n Ingi Hlynsson, a clinical graduate\nstudent at the University of Iceland.\n\n\u201cWhat intrigued me the most was the chance to map out psilocybin\u2019s negative\neffects and identify potential drawbacks of psychedelic-assisted therapy.\nHowever, much credit is due for my co-authors, especially Moa Nordin, who\nconducted the interviews and conceptualized the study, but also Per Carlbring\nand Jakob H\u00e5kansson without whom the project would not have materialized.\u201d\n\nThe researchers employed a qualitative research design, using semi-structured\ninterviews to gather in-depth data from eight therapists who have facilitated\npsilocybin-assisted treatments. These therapists, based in Scandinavia, varied\nin their professional backgrounds and included psychologists, therapists, and\neven individuals without formal psychological training but with experience in\npsychedelic therapies. The qualitative data from these interviews were then\nthematically analyzed to identify common patterns and themes in the negative\neffects reported.\n\nThe researchers identified three main themes of short-term negative effects.\nFirst, some clients experienced direct negative reactions during the\npsilocybin dosing sessions, including physical symptoms like nausea and\nheadaches, cognitive disturbances such as disorientation and paranoia, and\nemotional challenges characterized by fear and intense distress. These\nreactions can significantly impact the immediate therapeutic experience and\nrequire careful management.\n\nSecond, the study reported undesirable processes in the therapeutic\nrelationship. The altered state induced by psilocybin sometimes complicated\ninteractions between therapists and clients. Issues such as communication\nbarriers, misunderstandings, and a shift in the power dynamics were noted.\nThese could lead to breaches in the therapeutic alliance, potentially\ndiminishing the therapy\u2019s effectiveness and affecting the client\u2019s overall\ntreatment experience.\n\nThird, difficult self-experiences were common, where clients encountered\npainful and sometimes traumatic realizations about themselves. While these\nexperiences could potentially lead to therapeutic breakthroughs, they were\noften overwhelming in the short term and could contribute to emotional\ndistress during and immediately after the session.\n\nIn terms of long-term effects, the researchers outlined four main themes.\nFirstly, destabilization was a significant concern, with clients sometimes\nexperiencing ongoing cognitive and emotional instability after the treatment\nsessions. This included a prolonged sense of confusion, changes in personal\nidentity, and altered life perspectives, which could disrupt daily functioning\nand overall well-being.\n\nSecondly, adaptation difficulties were frequently observed. Clients often\nstruggled to integrate the insights gained during therapy into their lives.\nThis could lead to prolonged periods of adjustment, characterized by\ndissatisfaction with life and difficulties in returning to normalcy, which\ncould exacerbate feelings of isolation or depression.\n\nThirdly, complications in the treatment relationship were noted as a long-term\nissue. Emotional dependencies, continued attachments, and even romantic\nfeelings towards the therapist could emerge, complicating the conclusion of\nthe therapeutic relationship and potentially leading to additional\npsychological strain for clients.\n\n\u201cWe conducted interviews with individuals who have been and are currently\nproviding psychedelic-assisted therapy,\u201d Hlynsson told PsyPost. \u201cSurprisingly,\nmany treatment providers reported issues with romantic transference and\nblurred professional boundaries. Even for experienced therapists, managing\nromantic transference proved to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nLastly, the study highlighted several undesirable outcomes of treatment, such\nas the emergence or worsening of psychological symptoms, including existential\nanxiety and depressive states. Some clients also faced difficulties with\nsleep, increased anxiety, and a persistent sense of disillusionment about\ntheir lives or the treatment.\n\n\u201cBe cautious of unverified claims that psilocybin is a cure-all for\npsychological disorders,\u201d Hlynsson said. \u201cPsilocybin induces a potent altered\nstate of mind, and it\u2019s not self-evident that consuming psychedelic mushrooms\nis beneficial for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that potential negative effects of these substances,\nespecially for vulnerable individuals seeking psychotherapy, are not yet fully\nunderstood. While existing research presents promising findings, we need to\nexercise caution before endorsing psilocybin as a viable treatment for mental\ndisorders. The potential adverse effects of these treatments are still\nunderstudied.\u201d\n\nThe study provides important insights into the potential negative effects of\npsilocybin-assisted therapy. But the study, like all research, includes some\nlimitations. \u201cOur study focuses on the treatment provider perspective; we did\nnot interview people that had received psychedelic-assisted therapy,\u201d Hlynsson\nnoted. \u201cTherefore, the results must be interpreted with consideration for the\nabsence of the treatment receiver\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nFuture research could include larger, more diverse populations and incorporate\nclients\u2019 perspectives to provide a more balanced view of the risks associated\nwith psychedelic-assisted therapy. Additionally, further studies could explore\nthe mechanisms behind the negative effects observed and develop strategies to\nmitigate these risks.\n\n\u201cWe hope our study encourages researchers and clinicians to consider potential\nadverse effects more thoroughly before adopting this form of treatment,\u201d\nHlynsson said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the full impact is not yet clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo quote Carl Jung: Beware of unearned wisdom,\u201d he added.\n\nThe study, \u201cA double-edged sword: Insights from practitioners on the short and\nlong-term negative effects of psilocybin-assisted psychological\ninterventions,\u201d Moa Nordin, J\u00f3n Ingi Hlynsson, Jakob H\u00e5kansson, and Per\nCarlbring.\n\nRecommended for you\n\nRecommended by\n\nTweetSendScanShareSendPinShareShareShare\n\n### RELATED\n\nPsilocybin\n\n### Psilocybin for chronic pain?

This sabbatical is my withdrawal.\n\nI have this itch for achievement, to prove myself to the world. Ultimately, I\nwant the approval of an authority figure to tell me that I\u2019ve done work that\nmatters. Somehow, I believe then, I will finally feel enough. Maybe it\u2019s\nbecause I struggle with feeling enough being me, comparing myself to my peers\nwho have achieved traditional markers of success (promotions and book deals),\nor suffocated by the weight of my parent\u2019s immigrant journey, redoing their\nmedical training at 40. Is that what all that hard work was for, so I can\nwrite silly little words about my silly little life?\n\nThanks for reading The Next Chapter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts\nand support my work.\n\nThis feeling was only magnified when I finished the first draft of my novel,\nat 57K words. The first thing I did after finishing was Google \u201chow many words\nis a novel,\u201d disappointed when most websites said novels were traditionally\n70-80K words. Maybe it could be a novella, a friend suggested. But that felt\nlike admitting failure, maybe because I have a subconscious belief that\nnovellas are inferior to a novel.\n\nYou should still celebrate, they said. The last thing I felt like doing was\ncelebrating. All I could envision was the months and months of revision that\nwould be required to turn this into anything good. Then, a dangerous thought\nappeared. What if this novel is never good enough to get published? Have I\nwasted my potential? In my dreams, I saw the flashbacks of my product career:\nthe highs of shipping big projects, the news that I got promoted, the steady\npaycheck. Maybe my subconscious was trying to tell me something.\n\nOn one particularly low day, I told my partner: maybe I made a mistake\nquitting my job.\n\n####\n\n(Kinda) Missing my job\n\nI don\u2019t think I realized how much having a full-time product job gave me a\nsense of safety, especially in terms of identity, prestige, and finances. As\nmuch as I don\u2019t like to admit it, I am extremely triggered when people ask me\nwhat I do for a living now than I did when I was working full time. And I get\ntriggered a lot, in seemingly mundane and random life situations: explaining\nmy income situation to my CPA, prenup attorneys reviewing asset schedules,\nphysical therapist who casually checks in on my career plans, or even the\nsalon lady who asks me if I\u2019m off today since I came in earlier than usual.\nSometimes, I share the details, because I have to. Other times, I avoid the\nquestion, because I\u2019m exhausted by repeating my story.\n\nThere\u2019s something about the constant validation you receive in the corporate\nenvironment, whether it\u2019s from your manager or peers. I\u2019ve realized that this\nvalidation often masked the growing existential angst inside of me, allowing\nme to stay a productive adult. Whenever I\u2019d feel big, scary questions about my\nsense of self worth or the meaning of life, I\u2019d get some positive reminder at\nwork. I landed the big presentation! I got promoted! I took a fancy vacation!\nIt was easy to avoid my dependence on prestige as a mechanism of self worth\nbecause I didn\u2019t have to.\n\nBut now that I\u2019m no longer in a prestigious job, my self-worth and self-esteem\nissues are magnified. I feel like a failure as a writer, with nothing but\nrejections from fellowships and literary magazines. I feel like a failure of a\ncoach, my business and Substack growth stalled. I feel like a failure of a\nscreenwriter, avoiding networking events with a ten foot pole. I am tempted by\nLinkedIn ads recruiting for staff and director PMs, lured by the promise of a\nsolid paycheck and defined ladder to climb.\n\nLetting go, flying solo in the sky\n\n####\n\nLetting go\n\nAfter one particularly challenging therapy session, I had a startling\nrealization. My entire life had been run by expectations of doing something\ngreat, while fulfilling the roles of what it meant to be a \u201cgood Indian\ndaughter.\u201d I had to be physically fit, stay in complete control of my\nemotions, achieve the highest level at whatever career I did next, leave a\ntangible legacy in this world, start a family, all while emotionally\nsupporting my friends and family unconditionally.\n\nIt was a lot.\n\nI think there was a part of me that felt that if I quit my corporate jobs, the\nenvironment shift would be big enough to remove the weight of these\nexpectations. Sadly, the answer is no. These expectations, primed deep into my\nsubconscious, are still running around in my sabbatical. No wonder I feel\nmiserable in a time that\u2019s supposed to be all about me, but still continues to\nfeel about others.\n\nI was like a kid wearing a heavy bookbag who thought that buying a bigger bag\n(aka a sabbatical) would solve their problems. And it did, to a certain\nextent, create more space for me to explore and try things. But until I\nacknowledge that the number of books is too much and actively reduce the\nnumber of books in the bag, I will still feel tired, unfulfilled, and burnt\nout.\n\nI needed to let go.\n\n####\n\nReprioritizing 2024 goals\n\nI re-examined my list of 2024 goals, a messy four page Notion doc with goals\nacross six categories. No wonder I feel so fragmented and lost, I thought to\nmyself. I challenged myself to cut the list of goals from god knows how many\nto five. It was painful, debating whether it was smart to cut certain goals or\nwhether they were \u201ccomprehensive\u201d enough, but somehow, I got to five.\n\nMy (newly updated) goals for 2024 are:\n\n  * Setting up my newly married life for success (which includes getting married in the first place)\n\n  * Finding some source of financial stability\n\n  * Healing from overachievement\n\n  * Finding joy, progress, and discovery in writing again\n\n  * Develop expertise in one writing form (currently screenwriting)\n\nSome goals are described clearly, with a clear output (like setting up my\nmarried life for success). Others are more open-ended, driven purely by\nintentions (like healing from overachievement). I want to have space for both.\n\nThis clarity has also given me permission to cut things in my life that\nweren\u2019t serving me, like:\n\n  * I took a break from fiction, shelving the novel and fellowship applications. I\u2019m focusing on screenwriting and essays which are giving me more joy now, while thinking through what I want from screenwriting more broadly.\n\n  * I quit language classes, even though I really want to get better at Spanish. But I don\u2019t have time for it now.\n\n  * I stopped requiring that I go for a walk first thing in the AM as part of the \u201cperfect\u201d morning routine. Now, I go for walks when I feel like it.\n\n  * I am not training for any races after my half marathon this year. I\u2019m tired of training for running events.\n\n  * I cut out the regular calendar events I had set up for \u201cinner work\u201d \u201cnetworking\u201d \u201creflect on sabbatical process\u201d and \u201cfriend catch ups,\u201d allowing these opportunities to come organically vs putting pressure on myself to figure it out.\n\n####\n\nSelf unfolding\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I finally feel like I\u2019m enjoying existing\nin my sabbatical, rather than waiting for the enjoyment to reach me.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised that I ended up cutting my list. If I\u2019m honest, there was\nprobably a nagging feeling when I did my goals that I was doing too much, but\nI wasn\u2019t ready to let go of that part of myself yet. It reminds me of Steve\nMarch\u2019s work on self-unfolding, who talks about how a lot of self-improvement\nmethodologies subconsciously tell you there\u2019s something wrong with you, trying\nto get you to some perfect ideal state, versus working with what you have. I\u2019m\nlearning that sometimes, you have to work with where you\u2019re at rather than\nconstantly pushing yourself to some ideal \u201cperfect\u201d state.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t feel like I have it all figured out. One big question I\u2019m\nstill wrestling with: what do I want from my creative career? Do I still want\nto be an author, or go all in on screenwriting? If the latter, then is success\ngetting staffed on a TV show? If so, then am I still craving the very prestige\nthat led to this burnout in the first place?\n\nI don\u2019t know. Normally, this would make me feel ashamed, and that shame would\ntransform into anxiety about whether I\u2019m healing fast enough or brainstorming\nsessions to figure out the answers ASAP. But in this new, self-unfolding\nVinamrata, I feel okay with not knowing (for now). I\u2019m focusing on creating\nconditions for listening, which I have been doing through walks, journaling,\nand therapy.\n\nWhen the time is right, the answer will come to me.\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\nI\u2019m on a journey to create a blended career across the creative arts, tech,\nand business.

In the Ukraine conflict, it appears that one\nworkaround involves using an iPad.\n\nThe U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Dr. William\nLaPlante confirmed that tablets like the iPad are being added to older jets to\nmodernize weapon systems.\n\nSpeaking at the Global Security Forum on April 24, LaPlante offered details of\nthe situation to attendees, reports The WarZone. The Ukrainian Air Force has\nmany Russian and Soviet-era aircraft, which were in need of retrofitting,\nLaPlante explained.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nUse iPad As A Display for PS5, Xbox, or Switch with iPadOS 17!\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\n\"Working with the Ukrainians, we've been able to take many Western weapons and\nget them to work on their aircraft where it's basically controlled by an iPad\nby the pilot.\" he offered. \"And they're flying it in conflict like a week\nafter we get it to him\"\n\nLaPlante didn't explain finer details. A video surfaced shortly after the\ndiscussion showing an Su-27 Flanker fitted with the system.\n\nThe video shows an iPad-like tablet mounted right in front of the pilot.\n\n> Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker Wild Weasel operations, seen here\n> conducting multiple low-level standoff strikes against Russian radars with\n> US-supplied AGM-88 HARMs. pic.twitter.com/7CosjXFNkO\n>\n> \u2014 OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) April 21, 2024\n\nThe tablet is also used to offer other information, such as maps, to the\npilot. Since it dominates most of the instrument panel, it is probable that\nthe iPad also handles some avionics, and flight information crucial to the\npilot.\n\nIt is thought that the iPad is able to work with a number of Western-supplied\nair-to-ground weapons. The video showed the use of U.S-supplied AGM-88 High-\nSpeed Anti-Radiation Missiles.\n\nThe system may also be used to handle Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended\nRange precision-guided bombs. Hammer rocket-assisted bombs from France and\ndual-mode PaveWay IV precision-guided bombs from the UK could also end up\nbeing iPad-deployable.\n\nThis is far from the first time that the iPad has been used in aviation. The\niPad has been in use in commercial flights as an electronic flight bag for a\nnumber of years, eliminating the need to carry pounds of documents, therefore\nsaving weight and fuel.\n\nApple products have also been used in other ways in the Ukraine conflict. In\nApril 2022, one Ukrainian realized retreating Russian forces stole AirPods\nfrom his Kyiv home. He then used Find My to monitor their movements.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\n0 Comments\n\n## There are no Comments Here, Yet\n\nBe \"First!\" to Reply on Our Forums ->\n\n## Top Stories\n\n## Amazon discounts the Apple Studio Display to $1,299 ($300 off)\n\n## An inside look at Apple's various internal iOS variants that aid\ndevelopment\n\n## What to expect in iOS 18: AI, new look, redesigned stock apps, and more\n\n## New iPad Pro models will get the best OLED tablet display ever made\n\n## New iPhone 16 leak blows the cover off of screen sizes & camera bump\n\n## New iPad Air & iPad Pro models are coming soon - what to expect\n\n## Save up to $350 on every Apple M3 MacBook Pro, plus get up to $80 off\nAppleCare\n\n## Latest Exclusives\n\n## Apple's iOS 18 AI will be on-device preserving privacy, and not server-side\n\n## Apple's macOS 15 to get rare cognitive boost via Project GreyParrot\n\n## Apple Notes in iOS 18 looks to up the ante with Microsoft OneNote\n\n## Latest comparisons\n\n## M3 15-inch MacBook Air vs M3 14-inch MacBook Pro \u2014 Ultimate buyer's guide\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M1 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M2 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## Latest News\n\n## Apple starts replacing titanium Apple Cards from original 2019 batch\n\nApple has begun notifying users of the first-generation titanium Apple Card\nrolled out in 2019 about its upcoming expiration and replacement.\n\nAndrew Orr | 3 hours ago\n\n1\n\n## iPad at war: How the iPad is crucial to the Ukraine war effort\n\nThe iPad is being used for an unusual purpose in the Ukraine-Russia conflict \u2014\nthey're helping the Ukraine Air Force use modern weapons on older fighter\njets.\n\nMike Wuerthele and Malcolm Owen | 5 hours ago\n\n0\n\n## New iPad Pro models will get the best OLED tablet display ever made\n\nSamsung has reportedly had difficulties adapting its production line to the\ntwo-stack OLED needed for the new iPad Pro line, which is said to be the best\nOLED tablet panel on the market.\n\nRumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd2f Likely\n\nWilliam Gallagher and Mike Wuerthele | 8 hours ago\n\n2\n\n## More Matter products, and a big new Sonos app update on the HomeKit Insider\nPodcast\n\nOn this episode of the HomeKit Insider Podcast, we check out a new humidifier\nthat uses moss, new Matter products, and Sonos' giant app update.\n\nAndrew O'Hara | 9 hours ago\n\n0\n\n## What to expect in iOS 18: AI, new look, redesigned stock apps, and more\n\nThe releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 is shaping up to be Apple's biggest OS\nrefresh in a decade.

Today, we'll learn how to build an AI Voice assistant like Siri that can\nunderstand what we say and speak back to us.\n\n## Demo AI Voice assistant\n\nHere's what we're going to build:\n\nThis post will focus on implementing it as a web application. Therefore, we\nwill use HTML for the interface and Javascript for the voice features. You\nmight want to adjust this if you build for another platform (mobile, desktop,\netc.).\n\nRegardless of the platform, knowing the components of how to build this will\nhelp us along the way.\n\nTutorial to build an AI Voice assistant like Siri illustration\n\n## Basic Voice AI assistant Structure\n\nJust like other applications, we will have this basic structure:\n\ninput, logic, and output illustration.\n\nHere is what it looks like on our app:\n\nAI Voice assistant basic logic illustration.\n\nYou can replace each of these elements with the more advanced option. I'm\ntrying to stick with what we already have in the browser. These are the\nalternatives:\n\n  * Voice input: AssemblyAI or OpenAI Whisper\n  * Voice output: Elevenlabs or OpenAI Whisper\n\n## Code Tutorial on how to build a Voice AI assistant\n\nWe'll split our codebase into two parts, one for the front end and one for the\nback end.\n\n> First, we just want to make sure that we can get a text from the user's\n> voice and read a text out loud; there is no AI or conversation involved yet.\n\nHere is the final code result of this post\n\nGitHub - hilmanski/simple-ai-voice-assistant-openai-demo\n\nContribute to hilmanski/simple-ai-voice-assistant-openai-demo development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.\n\nGitHubhilmanski\n\n### Step 1: Basic frontend Views\n\nSince we're building a web application, we'll use HTML. - We need two buttons\nto start and stop the recording - A div to display the text\n\n    \n    \n    <button id=\"record\">Record</button> <button id=\"stop\">Stop</button> <div id=\"output\">Output</div>\n\n(Optional) If you want to copy the style I implemented:\n\n    \n    \n    <style> body { margin: 50px auto; width: 500px; } #output { margin-top: 20px; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll; } #output p:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f8f6b1; } </style>\n\n### Step 2: Listen to speech\n\nLet's trigger the actions from Javascript:\n\n    \n    \n    <script> // Set up const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition; const SpeechGrammarList = window.SpeechGrammarList || window.webkitSpeechGrammarList; const SpeechRecognitionEvent = window.SpeechRecognitionEvent || window.webkitSpeechRecognitionEvent; const recognition = new SpeechRecognition(); const speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList(); recognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList; recognition.continuous = true; recognition.lang = 'en-US'; recognition.interimResults = false; recognition.maxAlternatives = 1; // Start recording document.getElementById('record').onclick = function() { recognition.start(); } // Stop recording document.getElementById('stop').onclick = function() { recognition.stop(); console.log('Stopped recording.'); } // Output recognition.onresult = async function(event) { // Get the latest transcript const lastItem = event.results[event.results.length - 1] const transcript = lastItem[0].transcript; document.getElementById('output').textContent = transcript; recognition.stop(); // await sendMessage(transcript); // we'll implement this later } recognition.onspeechend = function() { recognition.stop(); } </script>\n\n### Step 3: Backend structure\n\nWe're using NodeJS/Express for the backend. Make sure to install the necessary\npackages in your new directory (separate from the frontend code):\n\n    \n    \n    npm init -y #initialize NPM package npm init express cors dotenv openai --save touch index.js #create a new empty file\n    \n    \n    const express = require('express'); const cors = require('cors') // Setup Express and allow CORS const app = express(); app.use(express.json()); app.use(cors()) // allow CORS for all origins // Main route app.post('/message', async (req, res) => { const { message } = req.body; res.json({ message: 'Received: ' + message }); }); // Start the server const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; app.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`); });\n\nRun node js in your terminal to run the server. Your application is running on\nlocalhost:3000.\n\nWe only have one route, which is /message , which receives a message from the\nclient and echoes it back. This is to ensure that the input and output parts\nare running smoothly.\n\n### Step 4: Send a message from frontend\n\nLet's add a fetch method to send the message to that endpoint.\n\nUpdate your recognition.onresult event to call the sendMessage function like\nthis:\n\n    \n    \n    recognition.onresult = async function(event) { // Get the latest transcript const lastItem = event.results[event.results.length - 1] const transcript = lastItem[0].transcript; document.getElementById('output').textContent = transcript; await sendMessage(transcript); // New addition }\n\nNow, let's declare the sendMessage method:\n\n    \n    \n    async function sendMessage(message) { const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/message', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ message }) }); const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); speak(data.message); } function speak(message) { if (synthesis) { const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(message); synthesis.speak(utterance); } }\n\nI also added a new method called speak to use the Web Speech API, specifically\nSpeechSynthesis method to speak. The SendMessage will hit the endpoint we\nprepared previously.\n\n### Step 5: Try the App\n\nNow, run your HTML file, you can use something like VS Code Live server.\n\n  * press record\n  * say anything\n\nAI Voice assistant web application screenshot\n\nNow, you should see your message echo back to you (it's coming from the\nserver). Press the record button again to send a different message.\n\nNow, we have an app that can listen and speak to us. Let's dive into the AI\npart!\n\n## Smart AI assistant\n\nWe'll use the OpenAI Assistants API as the brain.\n\nStep 1: Install the OpenAI package We've previously installed the OpenAI\npackage for NodeJS. Make sure you've installed it as well.\n\nStep 2: Grab your API Key Get your API Key from the OpenAI dashboard. Create a\nnew .env file and paste it there.\n\n    \n    \n    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_OPENAI\n\nStep 3: Import OpenAI and dotenv\n\n    \n    \n    require(\"dotenv\").config(); const OpenAI = require('openai'); const { OPENAI_API_KEY } = process.env; // Set up OpenAI Client const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY, });\n\nStep 4: Implement assistants API If you're not familiar with the assistants\nAPI, I suggest to read this introduction blog post first:\n\nAssistant API by OpenAI (Basic Tutorial)\n\nLearn the basics of Assistant API by OpenAI. We\u2019ll create a super simple\ncoding example to understand the barebone of Assistant API\n\nSerpApiHilman Ramadhan\n\nWe'll use the same logic and code for this tutorial (with some updates soon).\nYou can also get the code sample for the API assistants here:\n\nGitHub - hilmanski/assistant-API-openai-nodejs-sample: A simple example for\nAssistant API by OpenAI using NodeJS\n\nA simple example for Assistant API by OpenAI using NodeJS -\nhilmanski/assistant-API-openai-nodejs-sample\n\nGitHubhilmanski\n\n> Note: I won't explain and show the whole code here.\n\nStep 5: Add the assistants API\n\nWe need to tell the AI assistants that they will act as general helpers who\ncan help us with anything.\n\nCreate the AI assistant via OpenAI dashboard\n\n*Make sure to update the assistant_id key on your code.\n\nStep 6: Assign a thread ID Since the API needs a thread unique ID for each\nconversation, I'll add a new fetch request on our frontend to automatically\nask for a thread id on the first visit. The ID will also updated on browser\nrefresh.\n\nReminder: we have this route to create a thread ID from the OpenAI assistant\ntutorial\n\n    \n    \n    // Open a new thread app.get('/thread', (req, res) => { createThread().then(thread => { res.json({ threadId: thread.id }); }); })\n\nLet's add this block to our HTML file (frontend part)\n\n    \n    \n    let threadId = null; // onload window.onload = function() { fetch('http://localhost:3000/thread') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { console.log(data); assistant_id = data.threadId; }); }\n\nWe'll adjust our sendMessage method to attach the threadId when sending a\nmessage.\n\n    \n    \n    async function sendMessage(message) { const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/message', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ message, threadId }) // <- update here }); // continue\n\nStep 7: Return the last message only\n\nLet's update our checkingStatus method to only return the latest message from\nthe AI\n\n    \n    \n    async function checkingStatus(res, threadId, runId) { const runObject = await openai.beta.threads.runs.retrieve( threadId, runId ); const status = runObject.status; console.log(runObject) console.log('Current status: ' + status); if(status == 'completed') { clearInterval(pollingInterval); const messagesList = await openai.beta.threads.messages.list(threadId); const lastMessage = messagesList.body.data[0].content[0].text.value res.json({ message: lastMessage }); } }\n\nOur voice assistant is ready!\n\nStep 8: Show all messages\n\nIf you want to add all previous transcriptions to the user interface, here is\nthe code to collect all the previous messages in the div.\n\nFirst, every time we speak:\n\n    \n    \n    recognition.onresult = async function(event) { // Get the latest transcript const lastItem = event.results[event.results.length - 1] const transcript = lastItem[0].transcript; // Update: Append new text to div const newText = \"<p>\" + transcript + \"</p>\"; document.getElementById('output').insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", newText); recognition.stop(); await sendMessage(transcript); }\n\nSecond, every time we got a response from the AI:\n\n    \n    \n    async function sendMessage(message) { console.log('Sending message: ', threadId); const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/message', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ message, threadId }) }); const data = await response.json(); // update: add new text here const newText = \"<p>\" + data.message + \"</p>\"; document.getElementById('output').insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", newText); speak(data.message); }\n\n> Make sure to re-run your NodeJS app. Now try to have a chat with your AI!\n\n## Things we can improve\n\nThere are several things we can improve for this voice assistant\n\nAI Instruction Since we're building a voice assistant, it shouldn't explain\nthings too long for a simple question. We can adjust the instructions like\nthis:\n\n    \n    \n    You're a general AI assistant that can help with anything. You're a voice assistant, so don't speak too much, make it clear and concise.\n\nVoice and listening We use native browser API to listen and speak. Better\nalternatives exist, such as Elevenlabs, AssemblyAI, and more.\n\nKnowledge Limitation We're using one of the OpenAI models, where the knowledge\nis cut off at a particular year. We can expand its knowledge by providing PDF\nfiles or connecting the assistant API to the internet.\n\n## Free Plan \u00b7 100 searches / month\n\nGet started\n\n## 4 Cases that Defined Legality of Web Scraping\n\nThe legality of web scraping in the US has been the source of stress and\nconfusion for many people or companies that could use web scraping to their\nadvantage.

This is the goal of Memary, an open-source system designed to equip\nchatbots and other autonomous agents with long-term memory capabilities.\n\nOk. Introduction done. More details in:\n\n  1. Traditional Chatbots and Their Memory Problems\n  2. Memary: Overcoming the Memory Barrier\n  3. Key Benefits of Memary\n  4. Behind the Scenes: Exploring Memary\u2019s Core Components\n\n    1. 1\\. Knowledge Graph (KG)\n    2. 2\\. Memory Module\n    3. 3\\. Routing Agent\n  5. Future Advancements: Pushing the Boundaries of Memary\n\n### Traditional Chatbots and Their Memory Problems\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are the backbone of many chatbots today. These AI\nmodels are trained on massive amounts of text data, allowing them to generate\nhuman-like text in response to prompts and questions. However, LLMs have a\nsignificant limitation: their memory is finite, so they can only consider a\nlimited window of previous conversation history when crafting a response.\n\nThis limited memory can lead to frustrating interactions. It\u2019s like asking a\nchatbot for restaurant recommendations, specifying your dietary restrictions:\nthe chatbot might suggest a great restaurant, but it might not consider your\ndietary needs if those were mentioned earlier in the conversation!\n\n### Memary: Overcoming the Memory Barrier\n\nMemary addresses this limitation by introducing a long-term memory system for\nchatbots. It consists of three main components:\n\n  1. Knowledge Graph: This acts as a central repository of information extracted from past interactions, storing information about entities (like places, people, or concepts) and the relationships between them.\n  2. Memory Module: This component tracks the entities a user interacts with and analyzes their importance based on factors like frequency of mention and how recent they are.\n  3. Routing Agent: This intelligent agent acts as the brain of Memary. It selects the most suitable tool (like a search engine or location lookup) to answer a user\u2019s query based on the context provided by the knowledge graph and memory module.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how Memary works:\n\n  1. User Interaction: You ask the chatbot a question.\n  2. Routing Agent Takes Charge: The routing agent analyzes your question (and the context from the knowledge graph and memory module, taken from the previous interactions with the chatbot).\n  3. Selecting the Right Tool: Based on this analysis, the agent selects the most appropriate tool to answer your question. For example, it might use a search engine if your question requires information retrieval or leverage the knowledge graph itself for related information.\n  4. Knowledge Graph and Memory Module Assist: The knowledge graph and memory module provide relevant information and insights to assist the chosen tool in crafting a response.\n  5. Improved Response Generation: The tool, with the help of Memary\u2019s memory system, generates a response that considers the broader context of the conversation and your past interactions.\n  6. Learning and Adapting: The knowledge graph and memory module are updated with the new information and interaction data, allowing Memary to continuously learn and adapt to your preferences.\n\nIn a flowchart, Memary does this:\n\n### Key Benefits of Memary\n\nBy incorporating long-term memory, Memary offers several advantages:\n\n  * More Personalized Responses: Chatbots can tailor their responses to your specific needs and interests based on your past interactions.\n  * Improved Contextual Understanding: Memary allows chatbots to consider the full context of a conversation, leading to more relevant and informative responses.\n  * Enhanced Conversational Flow: The ability to remember past interactions fosters a smoother and more natural conversation flow.\n  * Ability to Answer Complex Queries: Memary can handle multi-hop questions that require reasoning across different pieces of information stored in the knowledge graph.\n\n### Behind the Scenes: Exploring Memary\u2019s Core Components\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the key components of Memary and understand their\nfunctionalities:\n\n#### 1\\. Knowledge Graph (KG)\n\nImagine the knowledge graph as a giant web of information. Each entity (like a\nrestaurant or a movie) is a node on this web. The relationships between these\nentities are represented by links. For instance, a restaurant node might be\nlinked to a \u201ccuisine\u201d node and a \u201clocation\u201d node.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nMemary leverages a technology called Neo4j to store and manage this knowledge\ngraph. Here\u2019s how information gets into the knowledge graph:\n\n  * Information Extraction: During interactions, Memary extracts key entities and relationships from conversations using techniques like named entity recognition.\n  * External Queries: If the answer to a user\u2019s question isn\u2019t readily available in the knowledge graph, Memary can use external sources like search engines to gather information and add it to the graph.\n\nBenefits of Using a Knowledge Graph:\n\n  * Structured Representation: The knowledge graph provides a structured way to organize information, facilitating efficient retrieval and reasoning.\n  * Improved Multi-Hop Q&A: By connecting related entities, the knowledge graph allows Memary to answer questions that require reasoning across multiple pieces of information stored in different parts of the graph. Imagine asking a chatbot, \u201cWho directed the movie that won Best Picture in 2021?\u201d Memary can efficiently navigate the relationships between \u201cmovies,\u201d \u201cawards,\u201d and \u201cdirectors\u201d within the knowledge graph to find the answer.\n  * Enhanced Context Awareness: The knowledge graph provides context to entities and concepts mentioned in conversations. This context helps chatbots understand the nuances of user queries and generate more relevant responses.\n\n#### 2\\. Memory Module\n\nThe memory module acts like a personal assistant for the knowledge graph,\nkeeping track of the entities a user interacts with and their significance. It\nhas two sub-components:\n\n  * Memory Stream: This component acts as a chronological record of all entities encountered during interactions. It essentially captures the \u201cbreadth\u201d of a user\u2019s knowledge exposure, meaning the variety of concepts they have interacted with.\n  * Entity Knowledge Store: This component goes beyond just recording entities. It analyzes the frequency and recency with which entities are mentioned. This analysis helps determine the \u201cdepth\u201d of a user\u2019s knowledge on a particular topic. Frequently mentioned and recently referenced entities are likely more important to the user.\n\nThe memory module uses this information for several purposes:\n\n  * Personalize Responses: By understanding which entities are most relevant to a user, Memary can personalize chatbot responses to align with their interests and knowledge level.\n  * Predict User Needs: By analyzing trends in entity mentions, Memary can anticipate users\u2019 future questions and tailor responses accordingly.\n  * Summarize User Knowledge: The memory module can provide summaries of a user\u2019s knowledge based on the entities they interact with. This can be helpful for applications like educational chatbots that track a user\u2019s learning progress.\n\n#### 3\\. Routing Agent\n\nThe routing agent acts as the intelligent decision-maker within Memary. It\nanalyzes the user query and it uses as context the one provided by the\nknowledge graph, and insights from the memory module, that have been generated\nduring the previous interactions with the chatbot. Based on this analysis, it\nselects the most appropriate tool to address the user\u2019s needs.\n\nHere\u2019s an analogy: Imagine the routing agent as a librarian in a vast library\n(the knowledge graph and external information sources). The librarian (routing\nagent) understands the user\u2019s request (query) and the layout of the library\n(knowledge graph). They then guide the user (choose the right tool) to the\nmost relevant section (search engine, location lookup, etc.) to find the\ninformation they need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nExamples of Tools Used by the Routing Agent:\n\n  * Search Engine: If a user\u2019s query requires information retrieval from the web, the routing agent might leverage a search engine to gather relevant data.\n  * Location Lookup: For queries related to finding nearby places, the routing agent might use a location lookup service.\n  * Knowledge Graph Search: If the answer lies within the knowledge graph itself, the routing agent can directly query the graph to retrieve the information.\n\n### Future Advancements: Pushing the Boundaries of Memary\n\nMemary is an ongoing project with continuous development efforts. Here\u2019s a\nglimpse into some exciting future advancements:\n\n  * Improved Memory Compression: Currently, Memary considers a limited number of top entities from the memory module when crafting responses. Future advancements aim to develop more sophisticated compression techniques, potentially focusing only on entities directly relevant to the conversation at hand.\n  * Enhanced Knowledge Graph Capabilities: Expanding the knowledge graph\u2019s ability to handle different data types, like images, would allow for richer information representation and more comprehensive reasoning.\n  * Advanced Multiprocessing: Currently, Memary processes queries one at a time. Integrating multiprocessing would enable simultaneous processing of sub-queries within complex questions, potentially leading to faster and more accurate responses.\n  * Self-Learning Memory Module: The memory module could be enhanced to learn from decomposed queries, continuously improving its ability to identify and store relevant information.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSurely, equipping chatbots with long-term memory capabilities is something\nthat must be done: Memary tries to give a solution, and it\u2019s open source, so\nit\u2019s a nice solution!

Sources: Rabbit; Getty.\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nListen to this article\n\n00:00\n\n08:02\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.\n\nThis story was supposed to have a different beginning. You were supposed to\nhear about how, earlier this week, I attended a splashy launch party for a new\nAI gadget\u2014the Rabbit R1\u2014in New York City, and then, standing on a windy curb\noutside the venue, pressed a button on the device to summon an Uber home.\nInstead, after maybe an hour of getting it set up and fidgeting with it, the\nconnection failed.\n\nThe R1 is a bright-orange chunk of a device, with a camera, a mic, and a small\nscreen. Press and hold its single button, ask it a question or give it a\ncommand using your voice, and the cute bouncing rabbit on screen will perk up\nits ears, then talk back to you. It\u2019s theoretically like communicating with\nChatGPT through a walkie-talkie. You could ask it to identify a given flower\nthrough its camera or play a song based on half-remembered lyrics; you could\nask it for an Uber, but it might get hung up on the last step and leave you\nstranded in Queens.\n\nWhen I finally got back to my hotel room, I turned on the R1\u2019s camera and held\nup a cold slice of pizza. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are looking at\na slice of pizza,\u201d the voice told me. (Correct!) \u201cIt looks appetizing and\nfreshly baked.\u201d (Well, no.) I decided to try something else. \u201cWhat are top 10\n...\u201d I stumbled, letting go of the button. I tried again: \u201cWhat are the top 10\nbest use cases for AI for a normal person?\u201d The device, perhaps confused by\nour previous interaction, started listing out pizza toppings beginning with\nthe No. 2. \u201c2. Sausage. 3. Mushrooms. 4. Extra Cheese.\u201d\n\nUntil now, consumer AI has largely been defined by software: chatbots such as\nChatGPT or the iPhone\u2019s souped-up autocorrect. Now we are experiencing a\nthingification: Companies are launching and manufacturing actual bits of metal\nand plastic that are entirely dedicated to AI features. These devices are\ndistinguished from previous AI gadgets, such as the Amazon Echo, in that they\nincorporate the more advanced generative-AI technology that has recently been\nin vogue, allowing users more natural interactions. There are pins and\npendants and a whole new round of smart glasses.\n\nRead: Alexa, should we trust you?\n\nYet for all its promise, this new era is not going very well. Take Humane, a\nRabbit competitor that launched a wearable \u201cAI Pin\u201d earlier this month. That\ndevice has been positioned as a smartphone replacement, with a price to match:\nIt costs $699 and requires a $24 monthly subscription fee. Reviewers\nbrutalized the pin, saying it is slow, overheats, and struggles to answer\nbasic queries. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to name a single thing it\u2019s genuinely good\nat,\u201d The Verge wrote.\n\nBy comparison, the R1 is satisfyingly small in its ambition and (relatively)\naffordable in its price ($199, no subscription). The device itself is fun and\nretro-chic: Jesse Lyu, Rabbit\u2019s founder and CEO, reportedly bought every\nmember of his team a Tamagotchi for inspiration. And, in fairness, the R1 does\nsome interesting things. Onstage, Lyu showed how the device can interpret a\nhandwritten table and convert it into a working digital spreadsheet. It\nmanaged to speak a summary of a handwritten page when I asked, though only\nwith about 65 percent accuracy. I was able to use the gadget to order an acai\nbowl on DoorDash, although it couldn\u2019t handle any customizations. (I wanted\npeanut butter.) And I never got Uber to work. (Though at one point, the device\ntold me the request had failed when it in fact hadn\u2019t, leaving me on the hook\nfor a $9 ride I didn\u2019t even take.)\n\nOne of the big selling points of the R1 is that it supposedly runs something\ncalled a large action model, or LAM\u2014a spin on the phrase large language model,\nwhich is the technology powering recent chatbots. Whereas ChatGPT can answer\nquestions and draft you a mediocre essay, the R1 can, in theory, complete\nactions that you might take on different apps (Venmo-ing your friend $20, for\nexample). Rabbit has said the device will be able to learn any app, if you\nteach it. Lyu compared the technology to a Tesla: When on autopilot, a Tesla\ncar can in theory recognize a stop sign not because engineers tell it how a\nstop sign looks but because it has been trained on countless hours of footage\nto recognize the sign\u2019s physical attributes. Likewise, R1 will be able to\naccomplish tasks on your phone without having to be taught each app.\n\nThe problem is, none of this is actually real. At least not yet. As with so\nmany AI products, the R1 is fueled more by hype than by a persuasive use case.\n(So many of its functions could, after all, be done on a smartphone.) Back in\nFebruary, Lyu said the Rabbit was training its model on 800 apps. This week,\nit launched with the ability to use just four: Spotify, DoorDash, Uber, and\nMidjourney (a popular AI art generator). The company says LAM is in \u201cvery\nearly stages.\u201d\n\nRead: Phones will never be fun again\n\nOnstage before an audience of reporters and Rabbit fanboys on Tuesday night,\nLyu seemed nervous at times, at one point encouraging people to laugh in order\nto ease his nerves. Prior to the event, a user had posted on GitHub accusing\nRabbit of misrepresenting its technology. \u201cFor those with a technical\nbackground, it\u2019s painfully clear that there\u2019s no artificial intelligence or\nlarge action model in sight,\u201d the anonymous post, which has since been\ndeleted, read. On X, Lyu characterized the post as \u201call false claims.\u201d Lyu\npromised to fix any bugs that might crop up in R1 devices. Before demoing\nDoorDash onstage, he admitted that the feature doesn\u2019t yet work as fast as\nthey\u2019d like it to: \u201cBut I want to show you, and I want to be frank with you\nguys.\u201d\n\nYet Lyu also breathlessly announced a number of new initiatives, including a\nhigh-concept system that would allow people to someday merge the physical and\nthe digital, so people could point at various smart items in their home and\ncontrol them through Rabbit\u2019s AI. (Never mind that the R1 has launched without\nmany of its promised features.) Toward the end of the presentation, the words\nBe Humble appeared on the giant screen behind him. \u201cWe are a really, really\nhumble team,\u201d Lyu told the crowd. Those words were still displayed when, a few\nmoments later, the curtains on either side of the stage dramatically dropped\nto reveal conveyor belts loaded with boxes of R1s. Music started blasting, and\npeople started lining up to snatch theirs.\n\nThe R1 is a reminder of the disconnect, for better and for worse, between a\nSilicon Valley culture that often prioritizes speed over quality and high\nconsumer expectations about the products they use. And to be fair,\nexpectations are high at least in part because of the extraordinary products\nthat have emerged from that same competitive and iterative culture over the\nyears.\n\nAs the party wound down, news of the first bug arrived: There was no way to\nchange the time zone on the devices, many of which were programmed by default\nto the West Coast. Turns out the future is stuck three hours behind.\n\nCaroline Mimbs Nyce is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
