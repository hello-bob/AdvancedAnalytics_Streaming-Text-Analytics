And when we look beyond the individual,\nwe see variation across space, time, style, and social structure \u2014 among other\ndimensions. And these variations are generally gradient rather than abrupt,\nalthough standardization efforts by national or regional governments may try\nto eliminate the variation.\n\nFor millennia, scholars have noted and catalogued these patterns of variation\n\u2014 and for the past couple of hundred years, this study has been called\ndialectology. But until 1970 or so, people interested in this topic faced an\nuncomfortable choice: you can either pretend (falsely) that the variation can\nbe put into a few well-defined boxes; or else you can limit your research to\ncompiling very large lists of who said what where, when, and why.\n\nAbout 50 years ago, some European researchers began trying to get past this\ndichotomous barrier, under the banner of \"dialectometry\". For a recent survey,\nsee Martijn Wieling and John Nerbonne, \"Advances in dialectometry\", 2015 (from\nwhich I'll quote a long explanation):\n\nThe great tradition of European dialect geography produced innumerable\ndetailed maps depicting the geographic distribution of variation, especially\nin word choice, pronunciation, and morphology. Researchers naturally sought to\nidentify the deeper geographic and social structures that might be assumed to\nunderlie many details and that might be examined as potentially explanatory.\nBut as Bloomfield\u2019s (1933, p. 340ff) classic discussion of this work noted,\nthe maps of individual features often simply did not coincide, leading him to\nconclude that \u201cin this respect [...] dialect geography proved to be\ndisappointing.\u201d The problem usually revolved around how one should distinguish\ndialect areas, but modern dialectology recognizes that geographic\ndistributions may involve continua or even scattered settlements.\n\nJean S\u00e9guy (1971, 1973) is credited with taking the liberating step of\nexamining not individual features, but rather large aggregates of features,\neffectively asking how often two sites differ with respect to a given set of\nfeatures (such as lexicalizations, but also the pronunciation of selected\nsounds, or the realization of a given morpheme). It is historically noteworthy\nthat Haag (1898) had suggested something very similar, namely counting the\nisoglosses that separated sites to assay the strength of a putative border\nseparating them, as noted by Bloomfield (1933) in the chapter cited above.\nS\u00e9guy not only took this step but presciently applied it to one of the\nfoundational questions in dialect geography, the relation between aggregate\nlinguistic differences and geographic distance (S\u00e9guy 1971).\n\nIn a programmatic article, Nerbonne (2009, p. 179) summed up the motivation\nfor dialectometry\u2019s attention to aggregates rather than individual features,\narguing that the common practice of abstracting away from many details of\nphonetic variation is an implicit sort of aggregation that all variationists\nhave accepted, and further noting that individual features are inevitably\nnoisy (interpreting Bloomfield\u2019s point above in this way). He also observed\nthat the sheer number of available features makes it likely that a researcher\nfocused on individual features can find some feature or other that coincides\nwith a putative social or geographical influence, exposing the researcher to\nthe danger of \u201ccherry picking\u201d \u2014 working with features that are selected\n(perhaps innocently) to confirm his or her hypotheses. Nerbonne (2009, pp.\n190\u201391) finally notes that moving the analysis from the (categorical) level of\nindividual features to the (numerical) level of aggregates enables language\nvariationists to study general relations such as the law-like relation between\nlinguistic differences and geographic distance demonstrated by S\u00e9guy (1971).\n\n[...]\n\nWhereas Black (1976) introduced multidimensional scaling (MDS) to linguistics,\nEmbleton (1993) applied the technique specifically to dialectometry (see\nEmbleton et al. 2013 for more recent work on alternative MDS visualizations).\nMDS takes a site \u00d7 site distance table as input and tries to assign the sites\nin the table to coordinates in a small-dimensional space, typically consisting\nof two or three dimensions. Nerbonne et al. (1999) mapped MDS coordinates to\ncolor values for the first time, providing visual correlates in response to\nthe frequent critique found in dialect atlases and treatises that the division\nof the language area into different dialect areas did little justice to the\ngradual nature of dialect boundaries. Figure 1 shows an example of one of\nthese MDS maps, visualizing Dutch phonetic variation, together with a legend\nproviding examples of words and how they are pronounced in their \u201cfuzzy\u201d\nareas. Heeringa\u2019s (2004) dissertation used this form of presentation as well.\nHeeringa identified \u201ctypical\u201d word pronunciations by selecting words whose\ndistances correlated highly with the (distances on the basis of the)\ndimensions proposed in MDS, effectively the intensity of the colors shown in\nFigure 1 .\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 legend: The three most important multidimensional scaling\ndimensions (together accounting for more than 85% of the variation in the\nlocation \u00d7 location distance table) have been mapped to red, green, and blue,\nthereby providing a comprehensive visualization of Dutch phonetic variation.\nThe five legends provide some typical pronunciations in the areas with the\npurest colors. Note that areas are genuine, even though borders are gradual.\n\nFor more, you can read the rest of that article \u2014 or some of the other\nreferences offered by Google Scholar.\n\nYou'll learn that similar approaches have also been used to characterize\nstylistic, social, and temporal patterns of variation. And you'll also learn\nthat this tradition has not in general tried to add to (or even really use)\nthe inventory of terms for ways of talking, such as dialect, topolect,\nsociolect, idiolect, ethnolect, variety, style, ...\n\nRather, the point has been find insights to replace Bloomfield's\ndisappointment \u2014 by exploring new ways to analyze and visualize the complex\npatterns of variation. This effort has been most successful as a way of\nlooking at patterns in space, as in the figure reproduced above.\n\nBeyond applications to European languages, such techniques have been applied\nto Berber, Javanese, Iranian, Lalo, and others. But as far as I know, the\n(different varieties of) Han languages (or dialects or topolects or whatever)\nhave not yet been analysis in this way, although a large initial tranche of\nneeded data has been provided by the Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects.\n\nAnd based on that source, He Huang, Jack Grieve, Lei Jiao, and Zhuo Cai have\npublished \"Geographic structure of Chinese dialects: a computational\ndialectometric approach\". One of that publication's many maps is reproduced\nbelow \u2014 the authors comment that\n\nThis map clearly shows that the Chinese dialect landscape is highly complex,\nconsisting neither of a single dialect continuum nor a collection of distinct\ndialect areas separated by sharp borders. Instead, it includes clear dialect\nareas of relative homogeneity and varying sizes separated by both relatively\nsharp borders and areas of more gradual transition.\n\nThe use of the term \"dialect\" in these publications starts with the\n(translations of the) Chinese sources. But the term is problematic, because it\ndescribes a collection of ways of talking that are at least as diverse (and\nmutually (un)intelligible) as the Romance \"dialects\" like French and Italian\nand Spanish, or the Germanic \"dialects\" like German and Dutch and English. For\nsome of the varieties, it probably makes sense to use the term \"language\" \u2014\nand for others, perhaps Victor Mair's term \"topolect\" makes more sense. But\nthe point of the dialectometric approach is to examine the data without\nassuming any particular bin boundaries, and to let the number and nature of\nthe divisions emerge from the quantitative analysis.\n\nThere are many interesting methodological issues in the Huang et al. paper,\nbut (for now) I'll leave readers to explore them on their own.\n\nUpdate \u2014 I should note that a different approach to making sense of multi-\ndimensional patterns of linguistic variation was pioneered by Bill Labov, also\nin the mid-20th century, under the name of \"sociolinguistics\". As that term\nimplies, it focuses on social dimensions (age, gender, ethnicity, socio-\neconomic status, formality, etc.) more strongly than on geographical\ndimensions. The quantitative analysis methods are drawn from multi-variate\nstatistics, and also include purely linguistic factors as independent\nvariables.\n\nApril 26, 2024 @ 7:59 pm \u00b7 Filed by Mark Liberman under Variation\n\nPermalink\n\n## 6 Comments \u00bb\n\n  1. ### Garrett Wollman said,\n\nApril 26, 2024 @ 8:30 pm\n\nThis inevitably reminds me of Bill Kretzschmar's work on quantifying\n(distributions of) phonetic features and his diatribe(s) against taking the\narithmetic mean of a non-normal distribution (statistically meaningless) and\nthen treating that one number as characteristic of a population of speakers.\n\n  2. ### AG said,\n\nApril 26, 2024 @ 8:45 pm\n\nPlease forgive me a brief geographical sally \u2013 LOL at Chinese researchers\nbeing compelled to put the 9-dash line on every map but then having no data to\ninclude for that part, because... well, because it's so obviously not part of\nChina, linguistically or otherwise.\n\n  3. ### Mark Liberman said,\n\nApril 26, 2024 @ 8:49 pm\n\n@Garrett Wollman: This inevitably reminds me of Bill Kretzschmar's work on\nquantifying (distributions of) phonetic features [...]\n\nSee John Nerbonne and William Kretzschmar. \"Introducing computational\ntechniques in dialectometry\", Computers and the Humanities 37 (2003): 245-255.\n\nWhich reference would you recommend for the cited diatribe?\n\n  4. ### Chris Button said,\n\nApril 26, 2024 @ 10:25 pm\n\nWhat does the \"quantitative\" analysis measure exactly? Does it measure the\nnumber of variations or the degree of each variation? And how does one define\nthat?\n\nSurely widespread borrowing also throws wrinkles in it all too? The most\nextreme case would be Japanese \"on\" readings as representing a dialect, or\nrather co-existing dialects, of Chinese within the Japanese language.\n\n  5. ### Garrett Wollman said,\n\nApril 27, 2024 @ 12:03 am\n\n@myl My most immediate reference is to his talk at the 2024 ADS annual\nmeeting. I emailed him afterwards and he sent me a couple of papers but I\ndon't have them to hand. (I'm pretty sure he said something similar at the\n2019 ADS meeting but that's long enough ago that I wouldn't stake anything on\nit. As you note he's been doing this line of research for a long time.)\n\n  6. ### Mark Liberman said,\n\nApril 27, 2024 @ 5:32 am\n\n@Chris Button: \"What does the \"quantitative\" analysis measure exactly?\"\n\nThere are many variant approaches, depending on the goals and the available\ndata \u2014 you can sample the literature to find the details.\n\nFor producing a geospatial map, the starting place is an array of linguistic\ndata (which might be word choices, morphological choices, pronunciation\nchoices, whatever) from M subjects located at N map coordinates. Then using\none of many methods, an MxM or NxN array of inter-point distances is computed,\nand Multidimensional Scaling (or similar) is used to calculate a low-\ndimensional version of the distance matrix, which would then be turned into\nmap colors.\n\nRSS feed for comments on this post \u00b7 TrackBack URI\n\n## Leave a Comment\n\n  * ## Follow us on Twitter\n\n## Archives [+/\u2013]\n\n  *
