BTC-e received criminal proceeds of numerous computer intrusions\nand hacking incidents, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes, corrupt\npublic officials, and narcotics distribution rings. Vinnik operated BTC-e with\nthe intent to promote these unlawful activities and was responsible for a loss\namount of at least $121 million.\n\nDespite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e was not\nregistered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as federal law\nrequires. BTC-e had no anti-money laundering (AML) and/or \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d\n(KYC) processes and policies in place, as federal law also requires. BTC-e\ncollected virtually no customer data at all, which made the exchange\nattractive to those who desired to conceal criminal proceeds from law\nenforcement.\n\nBTC-e relied on shell companies and affiliate entities that were similarly\nunregistered with FinCEN and lacked basic anti-money laundering and KYC\npolicies to electronically transfer fiat currency in and out of BTC-e. Vinnik\nset up numerous such shell companies and financial accounts across the globe\nto allow BTC-e to conduct its business.\n\nA federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering\nthe U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nIn 2017, FinCEN announced that it assessed an approximately $110 million civil\nmoney penalty against BTC-e for willfully violating U.S. AML laws, and a $12\nmillion civil penalty against Vinnik for his role in the violations.\n\nThe FBI; IRS Criminal Investigation\u2019s Cyber Crime Unit and Oakland Field\nOffice; U.S. Secret Service Criminal Investigative Division; and Homeland\nSecurity Investigations (HSI) are investigating the case. The lengthy\ninvestigation was supported by numerous former prosecutors and investigators\nfrom multiple agencies.\n\nTrial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claudia Quiroz and\nKatie Lloyd-Lovett for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the\ncase. Pelker and Quiroz are members of the Department\u2019s National\nCryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET).\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided valuable\nassistance in securing the extradition of Vinnik. The Justice Department\nthanks the Government of Greece for its cooperation in securing Vinnik\u2019s\ntransfer to the United States.\n\nUpdated May 3, 2024\n\nTopic\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponents\n\nCriminal Division\n\nCriminal - Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\n\nCriminal - Office of International Affairs\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n\nOffice of the Deputy Attorney General\n\nUSAO - California, Northern\n\nPress Release Number: 24-574\n\n## Related Content\n\nPress Release\n\nSodinokibi/REvil Affiliate Sentenced for Role in $700M Ransomware Scheme\n\nA Ukrainian national was sentenced today to 13 years and seven months in\nprison and ordered to pay over $16 million in restitution for his role in\nconducting over 2,500...\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nPress Release\n\nExtradited Nigerian National Convicted of Business Email Compromise Scheme\n\nA federal jury in New Haven, Connecticut, convicted a Nigerian national today\nfor operating a business email compromise scheme out of multiple countries,\nincluding the United States.\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nPress Release\n\nJustice Department Charges Four Iranian Nationals for Multi-Year Cyber\nCampaign Targeting U.S. Companies\n\nAn indictment was unsealed today in Manhattan federal court charging Iranian\nnationals Hossein Harooni (\u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646\u06cc), Reza Kazemifar (\u0631\u0636\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc \u0641\u0631), Komeil\nBaradaran Salmani (\u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0644 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc), and Alireza Shafie...\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n## Archived Press Releases\n\nArchived News\n\nPara Not\u00edcias en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n  * Office of Public Affairs U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington DC 20530\n\n  * Office of Public Affairs Direct Line 202-514-2007\n\nDepartment of Justice Main Switchboard 202-514-2000\n\n  * Signup for Email Updates Social Media\n\n    * twitter\n    * facebook\n    * youtube\n    * instagram\n    * linkedin\n\n  * About\n  * Archives\n  * FOIA\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Legal Policies & Disclaimers\n  * Privacy\n  * For Employees\n\n  * Office of the Inspector General\n  * No FEAR Act Data\n  * Vulnerability Disclosure\n\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * Vote.gov\n\nHave a question about Government Services?\n\n  * Contact USA.gov\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
