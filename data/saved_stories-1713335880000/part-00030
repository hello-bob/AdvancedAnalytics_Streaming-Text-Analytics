The emulator is called Bimmy, and it was developed by Tom Salvo.\n\nOn the App Store, Bimmy is described as a tool for testing and playing public\ndomain/\"homebrew\" games created for the NES, but the app allows you to load\nROMs for any NES games available for download online, such as Super Mario\nBros. and Donkey Kong. Nintendo released the NES game console in 1985, so some\nof these games are nearly 40 years old. On its website, Nintendo says\n\"downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal.\"\n\nThe release of Bimmy comes after Apple removed Game Boy emulator iGBA from the\nApp Store for ripping off another emulator known as GBA4iOS, which was\ndistributed outside the App Store. Apple said it had approved of iGBA's\nfunctionality prior to learning that the app was a knockoff, suggesting that\nemulators for older Nintendo game consoles are permitted on the App Store, and\nBimmy seems to be the first proof of that.\n\nApple updated its App Review Guidelines to permit retro game console emulators\nearlier this month. Apple says developers of emulators are \"responsible for\nall such software\" offered in the app, including compliance with \"all\napplicable laws.\"\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 44 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nWalkingdead\n\n59 minutes ago at 11:46 am\n\n> Waiting for someone to download and let me know if it\u2019s legit or not.
