He is wearing a tie embossed with a DNA double helix which is the\nperfect accessory for the occasion, because what he\u2019s here to remind Whitehall\nof is a basic science.\n\n> There\u2019s a kind of Puritan revulsion against even discussing certain things\n> and you can essentially be cancelled just for inviting discussion\n\nIn his speech to the politicians, Dawkins railed against the \u2018debauching of\nlanguage\u2019 and the assault on science and reason. In particular, he took aim at\nGender Studies Professor Anne Fausto-Sterling for her nonsensical argument\nthat \u2018sex in humans is a non-binary continuum\u2019.\n\n\u2018There are two sexes\u2019, he said. \u2018Exactly two sexes and only two sexes.\u2019\n\nThat Dawkins should feel the need to explain this to a roomful of educated\nadults is an indictment of the times in which we are living. \u2018My view is that\nif you are a logical rational person who thinks about science, it\u2019s quite hard\nto believe in anything supernatural and it\u2019s quite hard to believe that the\nsexes are not real, because in both cases, science and reason point in the\nsame way,\u2019 he tells me.\n\nDawkins has weathered his fair share of media storms. In 2013, he sparked\noutrage on Twitter when he said: \u2018All the world\u2019s Muslims have fewer Nobel\nPrizes than Trinity College, Cambridge.\u2019 In the midst of the Muslim backlash\nhe tweeted: \u2018A statement of simple fact is not bigotry. And science by Muslims\nwas great in the distant past.\u2019 Predictably, this drew accusations of\nIslamophobia and howls of outrage. \u2018Muslims did great things in the Middle\nAges, though,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018As I\u2019m retired I have less to lose than others,\u2019 he says now, \u2018and I feel I\nhave a responsibility to speak out... I don\u2019t invite confrontation but I don\u2019t\nthink I would feel that my feelings were hurt if somebody yells or protests\noutside where I\u2019m going to speak.\u2019\n\nIt was in 2015 that Dawkins first signalled that he was shuffling out-of-step\nwith many of the other left-leaning thought leaders of the New Atheists. He\nasked on X, \u2018Is a trans woman a woman?\u2019 Then he posted: \u2018Purely semantic. If\nyou define by chromosomes, no. If by self-identification, yes. I call her\n\u201cshe\u201d out of courtesy.\u2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until six years later, after reading the manuscript of Helen Joyce\u2019s\nbest-selling book Trans, that Dawkins took the plunge in earnest. He asked why\nRachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP had been vilified for\nidentifying as black, when at the same time as it had become taboo to question\ntrans identities. The question proved incendiary.\n\nIn the storm that followed, the American Humanist Association withdrew his\nHumanist of the Year award, 25 years after he received the honour, claiming he\nhad an \u2018approach antithetical to humanist values\u2019.\n\nToday Dawkins seems lightly amused by this public reprimand. He explains that\nin his working life as an Oxford tutor, asking open questions was crucial.\n\n\u2018In tutorials with my students they\u2019d discuss counterfactual issues,\ncontroversial topics and puzzling paradoxes. They\u2019d hammer issues out, have a\ndiscussion and they might come down one way or the other. That\u2019s why so many\nof the tweets that I put out have ended up with the word \u201cdiscuss\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018Now there\u2019s a kind of Puritan revulsion against even discussing certain\nthings and you can essentially be cancelled just for inviting discussion of\nsomething. I think there\u2019s a sort of attitude that even to simply discuss is\nto align yourself, is to put yourself on one side.\u2019\n\nIt angers Dawkins that universities have become the crucible for this\ndestructive silencing. \u2018A university is about learning to change your mind,\nrational discussion and being curious. It\u2019s about listening to all points of\nview. University is the very last place where you should expect to find dogma,\nclosing down of speech and curiosity. It\u2019s a tragedy that it\u2019s universities of\nall places, which have become associated with suppression rather than open\nmindedness.\u2019\n\nDawkins seems bemused by the \u2018spineless\u2019 university administrators who have\nallowed censorious students to set the parameters of debate, and the impact of\n\u2018harassment, bullying and intimidation\u2019 on what gets published. He tells me\n\u2018I\u2019ve met more than one publisher, who has said people in the publishing\nindustry are intimidated by young people in their own publishing house into\nsuppressing or censoring books.\u2019\n\nDawkins is reluctant to hypothesise about the social factors that have led to\nthis: \u2018I think that the current epidemic we\u2019ve been talking about may have its\nroots in what\u2019s been called postmodernism. But I\u2019ve never come across a decent\ndefinition of postmodernism. Even people who espouse it don\u2019t know what it\nis.\u2019\n\nIt is on the need to protect scientific rationalism, which he has described as\n\u2018crowning glory of the human spirit\u2019, that Dawkins is at his most animated.\n\u2018Science belongs to all humanity,\u2019 he tells me. \u2018The best hope we have of\ngetting to the truth is through science. And science has methods in place to\navoid subjective feelings and bias.\u2019\n\nBut science now under threat, says Dawkins, from an ideology that dismisses\nscience itself as a colonial project. \u2018I was recently in New Zealand where I\ngot involved in a different issue. This is not the sex issue, but it\u2019s the\nidea that Indigenous ways of knowing are just as valuable as scientific ways\nof knowing.\u2019\n\n\u2018The New Zealand government has sent out an education policy in which M\u0101ori\nso-called Ways of Knowing are given equal status to science. This is a kind of\nbending over backwards to assuage colonial guilt. And, obviously, it\u2019s\nimportant and valuable that the people in New Zealand should know about M\u0101ori\nhistory and M\u0101ori legends and myths and beliefs. But not as science.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think there\u2019s similar movements in Canada and the United States to give\nsuch respect to indigenous culture, that it actually infects the science\ncurriculum, instead of just being treated as valuable history and valuable\nmythology.\u2019\n\nWhile Dawkins is concerned about the writing of unreason into laws and\npolicies, he believes reason will be reasserted once faddish ideas about\ngender and \u2018different ways of knowing\u2019 have run their course. He compares the\ncurrent assault on truth to \u2018a measles epidemic that spreads memetically\nthrough the population.\u2019\n\n\u2018I suspect it is a temporary fashion, like McCarthyism. Though my crystal ball\nis no better than anyone else\u2019s.\u2019\n\nDawkins has famously called bringing children up with a religion \u2018child\nabuse.\u2019 Does he worry that, as Chesterton said, those who \u2018don\u2019t believe in\nGod will be in anything.\u2019 Does the blame for the modern madness lie with the\nNew Atheists? \u2018I just care about what\u2019s true. And so, I never said to myself,\n\u201cOh dear, if we remove God, maybe we\u2019ll have a vacuum filled with all sorts of\nother monsters\u201d.\u2019\n\nYet however misguided he thinks the search for a \u2018creative intelligence at the\nroot of the universe\u2019 might be, Dawkins is clear that it\u2019s not as misguided as\nthe current attempt to ignore science. At least if theism were true it would\nbe an \u2018astonishingly important scientific fact,\u2019 he explains. \u2018It\u2019s false.\nIt\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s important and it\u2019s something that really matters.\u2019\n\n\u2018But the sex identity question is not something that a tribesperson in Africa\nwould worry about. It\u2019s not something that a Martian or somebody from outside\nthe West would worry about. It\u2019s just a trivial thing blown out of all\nproportion. It is only important because so many people do take it seriously.\u2019\n\nAt the end of the interview, I stroll with Dawkins through Parliament. On the\nceiling of a fan vaulted corridor, outside what was once Oliver Cromwell\u2019s\noffice, is a rare depiction of the Christian God. I watch as the world\u2019s most\nfamous atheist tilts his neck backwards to look up at the carving of the\nbearded head. I look in vain for evidence of the stone God gazing back.\n\n## A blooming good offer\n\nSubscribe to The Spectator this spring and get 3 months for just \u00a33\n\nCLAIM OFFER 3 months for \u00a33 REGISTER 2 articles a week\n\nAlready a subscriber?
