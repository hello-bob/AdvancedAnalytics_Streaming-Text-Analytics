The lab at Cal State Long Beach was\none of the first places in the United States to study sharks in a rigorous\nway. Spielberg was developing a character who was a shark researcher, so he\nsent an art director to campus. There, the art director found the office of\nDonald Nelson, the unflappable biologist, spear fisherman, and shark fanatic\nwho founded the lab in 1966. Nelson\u2019s office was an art director\u2019s dream,\nfilled with maps, scientific papers, shreds of napkins with engineering plans\non them, various shark repellents.\n\nThe director took every single piece of paper\u2014all the photographs, nautical\ncharts, scribbled notes on napkins\u2014off the wall and made photocopies. Then he\nput all these pieces back in their places, one by one. He used them to build\nthe character of Matt Hooper, the charismatic double-denim-wearing shark\nscientist played by Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

It earned over $260 million in its\ninitial domestic release in 1975, enough to make it the biggest moneymaker in\nHollywood history to that point. It also left its mark on the reputation of\nsharks. The opening lines alone, backed by that daggered two-note musical\nscore, gave a sense that sharks were a nearly demonic force: \u201cIt lives to\nkill. A mindless eating machine. It will attack and devour anything. It is as\nif God created the devil, and gave it ... jaws.\u201d David Shiffman, a marine\nbiologist and author of Why Sharks Matter, says, \u201cJaws made a generation\nabsolutely terrified of sharks.\u201d\n\n> Nelson had an epiphany: Sharks must be attracted to sound.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNelson was credited as a science advisor and fully supported the film, as well\nas its 1978 sequel, Jaws 2. But over the next two decades, as Nelson\u2019s\nresearch career took off, he would flip the script about sharks, bringing them\nout of the dark realm of fevered imagination into the clear light of science.\nBy researching shark behavior up close for the first time, and making\ncountless documentaries that allowed people on their couches into the\nunderwater world he loved, he began to change people\u2019s minds. A deadly,\ndespised predator with a face full of teeth began to seem vulnerable, even\nelegant, a critical choreographer of the ocean ecosystem. By the time Nelson\ndied in 1997, sharks had become the focus of conservation programs across the\nplanet.\n\nNelson was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, as an only child, near the eastern\nshore of New Jersey. He grew up fascinated by fishing, photography, and\nornithology\u2014when other kids were playing sports, Nelson was often looking at\nbirds, collecting bird nests, and taking pictures. A lover of cameras and\ntechnology, as a child he had a bold ambition to photograph every living\nspecies of bird on Earth.\n\nBut the ocean tugged at him, and his ability to spearfish meant he could make\na nice side income selling fish to restaurants. He got a biology degree at\nRutgers University in 1958, and then moved to Florida to study biology at the\nMarine Laboratory of the University of Miami. It helped that Miami was the\nspear fishing capital of the United States at the time. Nelson joined a\ncompetitive team of spear fishers called the Glug Glugs. Aboard a 22-foot\nProwler, he could spend a whole weekend catching grouper\u2014and contributing to\nhis education.\n\nIt was on a spear fishing trip in 1959, the story goes, that Nelson met his\nfirst shark. He had speared a small grunt\u2014a bottom-dwelling fish known for the\nguttural noises it makes\u2014and as the fish was making a racket on the seafloor,\na shark darted in out of nowhere. \u201cHere was this 4-meter tiger shark looking\nat Don as if he were a somewhat impaired, large, marine organism\u2014perhaps a\nstrange sea turtle,\u201d recalled colleague and former graduate student Samuel\nGruber in a eulogy to Nelson published in 2001. No one knew, at the time,\nwhether such a shark might attack on the spot. Don speared it and took it home\nwith him. \u201cThat encounter on the reefs in 1959 was both to change Don\u2019s life\nand eventually much of what we know about shark behavior,\u201d Gruber writes.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

It would allow him to safely antagonize\nsharks and record their behavioral responses. The submarine once hung in the\nSmithsonian Museum in Washington D.C., but is now housed at the Shark Lab at\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach, which he founded. Courtesy of the\nShark Lab at California State University\n\nAfter the encounter, Nelson had an epiphany: Sharks must be attracted to\nsound. That insight led to one of the first studies of shark senses and\nbehavior in the world. Together, Nelson and Gruber crafted synthetic sounds of\nstruggling fish and recorded them on audio tape. Then they used an ultrasonic\nunderwater speaker developed by the Navy and a tape player and set up field\ntests with quiet, control periods.\n\nIn the initial playback series, a total of 22 sharks came to investigate their\nphony fish sounds. The sharks only appeared when they were playing the\nrecordings, not when it was quiet. The results suggested that sharks were\nattracted over potentially long distances to pulsed low-frequency vibrations\nlike those emitted by wounded fish\u2014or thrashing swimmers. Though the duo were\nstill just graduate students at the time and their research had never appeared\nin a scientific journal before, the findings were published in Science in\n1963.\n\nSharks are notoriously difficult to study. They live in the murk, tend to shy\naway from divers, and travel constantly. Too large to keep in the lab, and\ndifficult to track in the wild due to their extensive ranges and secretive\nnatures, they weren\u2019t the focus of rigorous study until the 1950s. As a\nresult, much of what people knew about sharks derived from brief, spontaneous\nencounters out at sea\u2014or reports and media coverage of shark attacks.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nOne attack in particular captured the public\u2019s attention. In 1945, a Navy\nheavy cruiser called the Indianapolis sank between Guam and the Philippines,\nand sailors were thrown into the sea. Oceanic whitetip sharks were drawn to\nthe scene. Over the course of the next few days, the sharks devoured sailor\nafter sailor. Of the 1,196 men on board, only 318 survived\u2014150 were eaten by\nsharks. (The event even turns up in Jaws as Quint, the shark-obsessed boat\ncaptain, is a survivor of the attacks.)\n\nThe incident is often cited as the worst shark attack in history, but it\nwasn\u2019t the only attack on Navy crews. Because many naval battles during and\nafter World War II took place in the warm tropical waters of the Pacific\nOcean, as well as the temperate waters of the South Atlantic Ocean and\nCaribbean Sea, and because rescues at sea could often take days in the time\nbefore GPS beacons became commonplace, sharks became a significant concern for\nthe Navy. It began funding lab research into the development of methods that\ncould prevent attacks\u2014with little result.\n\n> Sharks are notoriously difficult to study.\n\nIn 1965, Nelson received his Ph.D. in marine biology and was hired at Cal\nState Long Beach as a professor in the biology department. By that time, his\nwork had a new focus\u2014using his growing knowledge about shark senses to protect\npeople from them. \u201cU.S. military morale was so low that they were having a\nhard time getting sailors on ships, they were so afraid of shark attacks,\u201d\nsays Chris Lowe, current director of the Shark Lab at California State\nUniversity, Long Beach. Nelson had a grant from the Navy for 17 years.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNelson and his students wanted to design shark repellents that would deter but\nnot harm sharks. They tried creating shark tasers\u2014cattle prods that shock the\nshark if it came too close (the problem was, it also shocked the diver).\nAnother project looked at surfactants\u2014soap-like substances\u2014that could be\nsquirted into a shark\u2019s mouth. Students would fill fire extinguishers with\nsoapy water of different concentrations and go out into the Catalina channel\nwith blue sharks. \u201cYou would hold a mackerel in your hand with one hand, and\nwhen the shark could come in you stick this hose in its mouth and give it a\nsquirt,\u201d says Lowe. The shark would swim away with his mouth open. \u201cThe\nproblem was that 20 minutes later, it would turn around and come back.\u201d\nNelson\u2019s shark repellents never panned out.\n\nThat Nelson spent years trying to develop shark repellents was ironic, because\nmore than any marine biologist, Nelson was dedicated to getting close to\nsharks, observing them in their natural environments. He was completely at\npeace in the ocean, calm and unflappable. Nicknamed Reef by his friends, he\nwas said to be more comfortable in the water than out. He would free dive to\n60 feet deep and just swim around, peeking into the nooks and crannies of the\nreef. \u201cHe had zero fear of sharks,\u201d his widow, Ginger Nelson, told me. \u201cZero.\u201d\n\nAn expert free-diver, Nelson swam right up to sharks to observe their\nbehavior. He was famous for what became known as the Kamikaze Technique. \u201cHe\nwould simply free dive on a reef shark minding its own business and chase it\nalong the reef face until it became rather trapped,\u201d writes Gruber. \u201cAt that\nmoment, the shark would either flee or begin the sinister underwater ballet\nDon called an \u2018agonistic display.\u2019 \u201d The shark would raise its snout, depress\nits pectoral fins, arch its back, hold its tail sideways, and swim in an\nexaggerated figure-eight pattern. If he continued to approach, the shark would\nlaunch a warp speed attack, lunging forward and then retreating rapidly.\nNelson thought this ritualized behavior was motivated by self-defense against\na perceived predator, in part because it almost never occurred in feeding\ncontexts and did not seem to be specific to a particular home range.\n\nBut after a 1976 brush with a \u201crather pugnacious\u201d shark, as Nelson called\nit\u2014he ended up driving it away with his spear\u2014he realized new techniques would\nbe needed to study sharks up close. \u201cWith absolutely no engineering\nbackground, over dinner with his students, Don got out his pencil and on the\nback of a napkin, his favorite teaching device, he sketched out a design for a\nwet, one-man sub,\u201d writes Gruber. He called it the SOS: Shark Observation\nSubmersible. A variation of the SOS is still in use today.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

They are wide-ranging, shy away from divers and tend to be most\nactive at night. Courtesy of the Shark Lab at California State University.\n\nA fiberglass contraption, the SOS allowed Nelson to lie on his belly and look\nout on the underwater world, controlling it with fins and a small motor. Air\ntanks meant he could stay below the surface for more time. While he lay there\nin the submersible\u2019s bed, he was multitasking. He would control the direction\nof his own submersible and film the shark, while another submersible filmed\nhim chasing the animals. \u201cLogistically, it was a nightmare to do,\u201d Lowe says.\n\u201cAnd dangerous as hell.\u201d Occasionally, the batteries would die and he\u2019d sink\nto the bottom, in need of rescue. Or a shark would bite the propeller off the\nsubmersible.\n\nBut the SOS had other limitations, too: The amount of time Nelson could spend\ntracking sharks in it was brief\u2014and it couldn\u2019t tell him anything about what\nthey did or where they went under cover of darkness\u2014at night or in the deeper\nwaters of the ocean that the SOS couldn\u2019t reach. So Nelson also dreamt up new\nacoustic transmitter technology that would allow him to track sharks and study\nthem remotely for much longer periods of time. This same technology forms the\nbasis for modern studies of sharks and rays.\n\n\u201cThis occurred in the prehistoric era, before integrated circuits, lithium\nbatteries, and well-stocked telemetry vendors,\u201d writes Timothy Tricas, a shark\nresearcher at the Florida Institute of Technology and former student of\nNelson\u2019s, in an essay about Nelson\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere were even fewer biologists\nwho could tackle the custom electronics designs needed for their research\nprojects. Nevertheless, Don and his students (the present author included)\nspent countless weekends and holidays designing and soldering together\nultrasonic transmitters from discrete transistors, capacitors, and resistors.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Transmitters\u2014either attached to the\nanimal or popped inside a fish that would be fed to them\u2014opened up an entirely\nnew world of remote shark research\u2014following them as they moved over hundreds\nof miles of open ocean.\n\nOver 30 years, Nelson\u2019s lab produced almost 50 publications about shark\nbehavior. His detailed field studies of large free-ranging shark species, such\nas the gray reef, reef whitetip, blue, angel, leopard, and megamouth sharks,\ntook him to sites all over the world, including the Gulf of California,\nMarshall Islands, Polynesia, Australia, and the Bahamas. In study after study,\nNelson uncovered evidence that sharks are complex and intelligent social\nanimals, rather than the solitary, unpredictable killers driven by primitive\ninstincts and insatiable hunger featured in Jaws.\n\nMany shark behaviors are, in fact, extremely predictable, Nelson found. One of\nthe most elegant examples is the agonistic display. But Nelson also found that\nshark feeding and migratory activity is closely tied to the rising and the\nsetting of the sun: Though it varies somewhat from one species to the next,\nmost sharks travel primarily after dark and feed at dawn and dusk, with some\nseeming to use the sun as an orientation cue. Nelson and his colleague Richard\nJohnson studied one species of shark in French Polynesia that is so regular in\nits daily movements that they were able to forecast where the sharks would\nappear along an established route within a matter of minutes.\n\n> Nelson swam right up to sharks to observe their behavior.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNelson also found that many sharks are social and capable of learning: In\nrepeated studies of sensory function, he showed they were able to \u201chabituate\u201d\nto both visual and auditory stimuli and to the presence of humans. And they\nmake friends: A number of species travel in groups, he found, most notably the\nscalloped hammerhead shark, which forms daytime schools off of several islands\nand seamounts in the Sea of Cortez. The lemon shark also associates with its\nown kind, as well as with other species of sharks and rays and certain species\nof fish, relationships that are mutually beneficial\u2014the shark offers\nprotection to the fish, for example.\n\nOvert aggression, he found, is actually unusual in sharks, outside of the gray\nreef shark. Few species engage in chasing or threats\u2014either to other sharks or\nto humans. Even during active feeding, including infamous \u201cfeeding\nfrenzies\u201d\u2014in which multiple sharks vigorously feed together over an extended\nperiod in a single area\u2014sharks seem interested only in getting food as opposed\nto competing with one another. And few species exhibit territorial behavior,\nNelson reported in his research.\n\nObserving and describing shark behavior put them in the category of animals\nthat could be understood. Nelson learned to decode their body language and\ncreate a dictionary of that language for others. Taken as a whole, his work\npainted a sympathetic picture of a creature that is like so many other\nfamiliar species roaming the Earth: defensive when threatened, social by\nnature, providing ecosystem benefits to other creatures, driven by the rhythms\nof the sun and the seasons.\n\nIn October 1990, the lab\u2019s phone rang. The message: A shark considered to be a\nliving fossil had been caught in a fisherman\u2019s gill net off Dana Point,\nCalifornia. The fisherman had brought it in, alive, in the waters off the\npoint.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNelson was teaching a class, but everyone in the lab knew what to do. They\nstarted mobilizing a small army of researchers\u2014armed with transmitters\u2014to meet\nthe shark. Nelson would drive his boat, The Discovery, to Dana Point, while\nothers raced there in cars.\n\nWhen the researchers arrived, they found a circus of action around the animal.\nIt looked like a hippo\u2019s head had been pasted onto an enormous fish body\u201415\nfeet long, bronze like a statue, with a wide jaw. Tied by its tail to the boat\nthat caught it, the animal garnered gawkers from both land and sea. Jet skis\nzoomed in, and a helicopter circled. Some onlookers were shouting about\nletting the shark\u2014dubbed Mega\u2014go free, while others stripped off their clothes\nand dove into the cold waters to have the chance to swim with such a rare\nshark. Only five megamouths had ever been discovered, and they were all dead\nby the time they were caught. This was the first one caught alive.\n\nA diver with a dart gun implanted two transmitters into the shark that would\nsend back signals about how deep the shark dove and its location.\n\nAnd then, the rope was untied and the shark disappeared into the waters of\nsouthern California. Nelson hadn\u2019t made it with his boat yet, but the young\ngraduate students caught a ride aboard a boat owned by Ethan Wayne, son of\nmovie star John Wayne, and Nelson met them at sea and took over the chase.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Courtesy of\nthe Shark Lab at California State University.\n\nOver the course of the next three days, the team of biologists tracked the\nshark aboard the boat, as it zigged and zagged south and west, away from\nshore, sending back signals to a radio they monitored from the transmitters it\ncarried under its skin. No one had ever seen or recorded a live megamouth\nbefore. And now, a boat was following one through its murky underwater habitat\nfor days on end. Some of the graduate students free-dived to see if the\nmegamouth emitted bioluminescence. The feeling on the boat was one of total\nelation.\n\n\u201cIt was like walking on the moon,\u201d recalls Jim McKibben, director of the\nScience Learning Center at Cal State Long Beach, then a grad student in\nNelson\u2019s lab, \u201cdoing something that nobody has ever done before.\u201d\n\nNelson spent thousands of hours filming sharks and collected a massive library\nof 16-mm film that includes footage of the animals responding to low-frequency\nsounds and engaging in precisely coordinated behaviors. Between 1968 and 1994,\nhe and his students made 25 documentaries that aired on television or made\ntheir way into school classrooms. These shows reached millions of viewers each\nweek, and much of his footage still appears on television today\u2014for example,\nNelson\u2019s work featured in the popular 2019 documentary Deep Blue, about the\nlargest great white shark ever recorded.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn one of his films from the \u201990s, Shark Doctors, Nelson describes preemptive\nefforts to protect the white shark, which scientists suspected at the time was\nendangered, potentially numbering in the low hundreds of individuals, despite\na lack of precise population data. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much to knock that\npopulation way down and possibly risk extinction,\u201d he tells us, as we witness\non screen the gleaming jaws of a white shark clamp down on a piece of bait.\nShark fishing, for their meat and fins, was already decimating many species of\nsharks: They were dying faster than they could reproduce.\n\nBy the time Nelson died, an international effort to conserve and protect\nsharks had begun. It took another decade before major protections could be put\nin place in the U.S.\u2014two prohibitions of shark finning in U.S. waters were\npassed in 2000 and 2009. Internationally, conservation approaches are still\ngaining steam.\n\nToday, the shark lab that Nelson founded at Cal State Long Beach spends about\nhalf its time on outreach efforts\u2014to educate the beach-going public and\nlifeguards about sharks off California\u2019s coastline\u2014and about half its time on\nresearch. Attitudes are dramatically different from what they were in the\n\u201970s. \u201cThe pendulum has swung from people thinking that sharks are so\ndangerous and violent, that if you dip your toe in your bathtub a shark is\ngoing to eat your whole family\u2014to some people saying sharks are just innocent,\nadorable, cute puppy dogs that just need hugs and kisses and love,\u201d Shiffman\nsays. \u201cWe really have the full spectrum now.\u201d\n\nMany surfers and swimmers around the world, who continue to suffer rare,\nisolated attacks, talk about sharks with reverence and respect, describing\nthemselves as visitors in the sharks\u2019 homes. In Australia, government\nofficials have done away with the term \u201cattack,\u201d instead preferring to use the\nterm \u201cnegative encounters\u201d\u2014which they argue is more accurate, as a third of\nencounters between humans and sharks leave no injuries at all.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNelson\u2019s work somehow straddled both sides of the divide, first helping to\nstoke fear of attacks through his work in Hollywood, then encouraging us\nthrough his research and films to understand sharks as intelligent social\ncreatures, vital partners in the Earth\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nIn 1995, Nelson found a mole on his left forearm and showed it to his wife\nGinger. \u201cHe thought it looked suspicious,\u201d Ginger recalls. Nelson was fair\nskinned, had grown up with no sun protection and spent most of his days diving\nand swimming. So he visited his doctor, who came back with the results:\nnothing to worry about.\n\nAbout a year later, the mole returned and Nelson went back to the doctor, who\nfound evidence of stage four melanoma, which had already spread to his lymph\nnodes, Ginger says. Nelson insisted on continuing to teach and research up to\na month before he died in 1997. \u201cHe just did not want to give up,\u201d Ginger\nsays. \u201cHe absolutely loved what he did.\u201d\n\nLead photo courtesy of the Shark Lab at California State University\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
