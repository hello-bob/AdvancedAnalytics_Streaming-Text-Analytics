This artist's illustration\nshows an outburst from a magnetar. Neutron stars that spin rapidly and give\nout radiation are called pulsars, and specific pulsars are rare in the core of\nthe Milky Way. Credit: NASA/JPL-CalTech\n\nThe Milky Way has a missing pulsar problem in its core. Astronomers have tried\nto explain this for years. One of the more interesting ideas comes from a team\nof astronomers in Europe and invokes dark matter, neutron stars, and\nprimordial black holes (PBHs).\n\nAstronomer Roberto Caiozzo, of the International School for Advanced Studies\nin Trieste, Italy, led a group examining the missing pulsar problem. \"We do\nnot observe pulsars of any kind in this inner region (except for the magnetar\nPSR J1745-2900),\" he wrote in an email.\n\n\"This was thought to be due to technical limitations, but the observation of\nthe magnetar seems to suggest otherwise.\" That magnetar orbits Sagittarius A*,\nthe black hole at the core of the Milky Way.\n\nThe team examined other possible reasons why pulsars don't appear in the core\nand looked closely at magnetar formation as well as disruptions of neutron\nstars. One intriguing idea they examined was the cannibalization of primordial\nblack holes by neutron stars.\n\nThe team explored the missing-pulsar problem by asking the question: could\nneutron star-primordial black hole cannibalism explain the lack of detected\nmillisecond pulsars in the core of the Milky Way? Let's look at the main\nplayers in this mystery to understand if this could happen.\n\n## Neutron stars, pulsars, and little black holes, oh my\n\nTheory suggests that primordial black holes were created in the first seconds\nafter the Big Bang. \"PBHs are not known to exist,\" Caiozzo points out, \"but\nthey seem to explain some important astrophysical phenomena.\" He pointed at\nthe idea that supermassive black holes seemed to exist at very early times in\nthe universe and suggested that they could have been the seeds for these\nmonsters.\n\nIf there are PHBs out there, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Telescope could\nhelp find them. Astronomers predict they could exist in a range of masses,\nranging from the mass of a pin to around 100,000 the mass of the sun. There\ncould be an intermediate range of them in the middle, the so-called \"asteroid-\nmass\" PBHs. Astronomers suggest these last ones as dark matter candidates.\n\nDark matter makes up about 27% of the universe, but beyond suggesting that PBH\ncould be part of the dark matter content, astronomers still don't know exactly\nwhat it is. There does seem to be a large amount of it in the core of our\ngalaxy. However, it hasn't been directly observed, so its presence is\ninferred. Is it bound up in those midrange PBHs? No one knows.\n\nThe third player in this missing pulsar mystery is neutron stars. They're\nhuge, quivering balls of neutrons left over after the death of a supergiant\nstar of between 10 and 25 solar masses. Neutron stars start out very hot (in\nthe range of 10 million K) and cool down over time.\n\nThey start out spinning very fast and they do generate magnetic fields. Some\nemit beams of radiation (usually in radio frequencies) and as they spin, those\nbeams appear as \"pulses\" of emission. That earned them the nickname \"pulsar.\"\nNeutron stars with extremely powerful magnetic fields are termed \"magnetars.\"\n\n## The missing pulsar problem\n\nAstronomers have searched the core of the Milky Way for pulsars without much\nsuccess. Survey after survey detected no radio pulsars within the inner 25\nparsecs of the galaxy's core. Why is that? Caizzo and his co-authors suggested\nin their paper, posted to the arXiv preprint server, that magnetar formation\nand other disruptions of neutron stars that affect pulsar formation don't\nexactly explain the absence of these objects in the galactic core.\n\n\"Efficient magnetar formation could explain this (due to their shorter\nlifetime),\" he said, \"But there is no theoretical reason to expect this.\nAnother possibility is that the pulsars are somehow disrupted in other ways.\"\n\nUsually, disruption happens in binary star systems where one star is more\nmassive than the other and it explodes as a supernova. The other star may or\nmay not explode. Something may kick it out of the system altogether. The\nsurviving neutron star becomes a \"disrupted\" pulsar. They aren't as easily\nobserved, which could explain the lack of radio detections.\n\nIf the companion isn't kicked out and later swells up, its matter gets sucked\naway by the neutron star. That spins up the neutron star and affects the\nmagnetic field. If the second star remains in the system, it later explodes\nand becomes a neutron star. The result is a binary neutron star. This\ndisruption may help explain why the galactic core seems to be devoid of\npulsars.\n\n## Using primordial black hole capture to explain missing pulsars\n\nCaizzo's team decided to use two-dimensional models of millisecond\npulsars\u2014that is, pulsars spinning extremely fast\u2014as a way to investigate the\npossibility of primordial black hole capture in the galactic core.\n\nThe process works like this: a millisecond pulsar interacts in some way with a\nprimordial black hole that has less than one stellar mass. Eventually, the\nneutron star (which has a strong enough gravitational pull to attract the PBH)\ncaptures the black hole. Once that happens, the PBH sinks to the core of the\nneutron star. Inside the core, the black hole begins to accrete matter from\nthe neutron star.\n\nEventually, all that's left is a black hole with about the same mass as the\noriginal neutron star. If this occurs, that could help explain the lack of\npulsars in the inner parsecs of the Milky Way.\n\nCould this happen? The team investigated the possible rates of capture of PBHs\nby neutron stars. They also calculated the likelihood that a given neutron\nstar would collapse and assessed the disruption rate of pulsars in the\ngalactic core. If not all the disrupted pulsars are or were part of binary\nsystems, then that leaves neutron star capture of PBHs as another way to\nexplain the lack of pulsars in the core. But, does it happen in reality?\n\n## Missing pulsar tension continues\n\nIt turns out that such cannibalism cannot explain the missing pulsar problem,\naccording to Caizzo. \"We found that in our current model PBHs are not able to\ndisrupt these objects but this is only considering our simplified model of 2\nbody interactions,\" he said. It doesn't rule out the existence of PHBs, only\nthat in specific instances, such capture isn't happening.\n\nSo, what's left to examine? If there are PHBs in the cores and they're\nmerging, no one's seen them yet. But, the center of the galaxy is a busy\nplace. A lot of bodies crowd the central parsecs. You have to calculate the\neffects of all those objects interacting in such a small space. That \"many-\nbody dynamics\" problem has to account for other interactions, as well as the\ndynamics and capture of PBHs.\n\nAstronomers looking to use PBH-neutron star mergers to explain the lack of\npulsar observations in the core of the galaxy will need to better understand\nboth the proposed observations and the larger populations of pulsars.\n\nThe team suggests that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr\nA* could be very useful. They'd help set stronger limits on the number of PBHs\nin the core. In addition, it would be useful to get an idea of the masses of\nthese PBHs, since those on the lower end (asteroid-mass types) could interact\nvery differently.\n\nMore information: Roberto Caiozzo et al, Revisiting Primordial Black Hole\nCapture by Neutron Stars, arXiv (2024).
