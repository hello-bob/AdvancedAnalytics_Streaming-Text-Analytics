After\nretiring, this native of Seville, in southern Spain, turned her career around:\nshe studied and graduated in Greek philology. After publishing a first book\nabout the adventures of her father, Jos\u00e9 Estrada, a young socialist who was\ndeputy mayor of Seville when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 and who\nfled from Franco\u2019s rebels with the help of a far-right Falangist friend, there\nwas a second one about the role of women in Homer\u2019s The Odyssey. Now, Estrada\nhas just published La herencia de Eva [The Inheritance of Eve], a book in\nwhich she traces the history of science, its influence on culture and its\ncurrent role in society.\n\nQuestion. Many people come to the humanities fleeing the sciences, but almost\nno one comes to the sciences fleeing the humanities, why is that?\n\nAnswer. Due to an incorrect idea of what science is. I try to convey a more\nopen vision that does not focus only on mathematics and physics, for which, I\nbelieve, you must have a special mind. Science has a much broader scope. It is\nabout observing the world and trying to explain it by natural causes. This can\nbe done in many subjects. However, when kids in high school have to choose\nbetween science and the humanities, they are not offered this other side of\nscience. If the majority of people saw that range of possibilities, perhaps\nthey would have a more scientific attitude and would be less fooled by\npseudoscience.\n\nQ. Are we more or less gullible than in times past?\n\nA. Human credulity remains the same. What happens is that now we have a\ntailored bombardment through mobile phones. The information we are providing\nis being used by algorithms, which will send you the content to which they\nbelieve you are most vulnerable, in order to convince you to consume, which is\nthe ultimate goal.\n\nQ. Is there a good side to technology that offsets this problem?\n\nA. The internet is wonderful. I couldn\u2019t have written this book without it.\nBut what are we giving in return? It would be necessary to have ethical\ncontrol of the technology. But since the dominant thing is not ethics, but\nbusiness, we are lost.\n\nCarmen Estrada, after the interview.Moeh Atitar\n\nQ. You warn against faith in science.\n\nA. It\u2019s a contradiction. Science and faith are antagonistic. But there are\npeople, especially in the business and technology world, who blindly believe\nin science as the solution to all our problems, as long as people continue to\nconsume. And then there is the other extreme.\n\nQ. Which one?\n\nA. The one that some environmentalists maintain. Their message is: if you are\ntold that science says so, be suspicious. There are books that go so far as to\nsay that Descartes is to blame for global warming. Because it was in the 17th\ncentury when the thought was born that science should be at the service of\nhumans, that we are the owners of the planet. And from there we are already\nlost. They themselves fall into pseudoscience. They say \u2018don\u2019t buy the drugs,\nbecause what the pharmaceutical companies want is to do business\u2019 \u2014 which is\ntrue. But instead they say \u2018buy this other product that my cousin told me\nabout and which is sold by a herbalist.\u2019 Distrusting science in general and\nthinking that it will solve all the planet\u2019s problems are two equally blind\npositions.\n\nQ. Even so, in your book he maintains that science is the only thing that can\nget us out of the quagmire.\n\nA. Science has to serve the human community. But who represents it? Economic\ninterests are in control, and inequality is increasing. These are such basic\ncontradictions that it would require us to stop and think, but that is not\nhighly valued in our society. Everything goes very fast and you constantly\nhave to be saying something clever and putting it on your mobile. Young people\nare growing up with that, and they have no other point of reference. It makes\nme very worried. I see my grandson very unprepared for today\u2019s world, despite\nhaving a family that strives to give him the right tools, but the outside\ninfluence is stronger.\n\nQ. Don\u2019t you believe that everything will be corrected, that the next\ngeneration is always the best prepared one?\n\nA. No. The current generation of young people will be very well prepared, but\nthey are unmotivated, desperate, and frustrated. It\u2019s a bad time to be young.\n\nQ. What is Eve\u2019s heritage that you defend in your book?\n\nA. If you read about the myth of Eve freely \u2014 I used a direct translation of\nthe Bible from Hebrew that is not so contaminated by the Church \u2014 what it says\nis that, guided by her instinct of curiosity, which is the instinct that\nguides science, Eve eats from the fruit of knowledge and then transmits it to\nothers so they may continue it. Science is a collaborative and collective\ntask. So Eve represents science, the instinct of curiosity, the acquisition\nand transmission of knowledge. The misogynistic interpretation that has been\npredominant until now maintains that the fruit was forbidden, so curiosity\nonly leads to transgression. And hence this whole idea of guilt of the Judeo-\nChristian tradition, which has done a lot of damage.\n\nP. Are science and God incompatible?\n\nR. Yes, they cannot coexist. There are scientists who say they are believers,\nbut either they are not believers or they are not scientists. A truth that is\nnot demonstrated is not a scientific truth. God may exist as a hypothesis, but\na demonstration of his existence has not been nor can ever be made. That is\nwhy they are incompatible.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Music scientists find the connection between music and emotion: \u2018Our\nneurons dance to the same rhythm\u2019\n\nEnrique Alpa\u00f1\u00e9s\n\n### A life without purpose\n\nJavier Sampedro\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Rene Descartes\n  * Internet\n  * Science\n  * Madrid\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nGeVestor\n\nETF-Trends 2024: Erfolgreich investierenGeVestor|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nSolaranlagen Magazin\n\nSolar-T\u00fcftler erfindet \"Technik-Wunder\": Hausbesitzer begeistertSolaranlagen\nMagazin|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nEnpal\n\nSo kosten W\u00e4rmepumpen in 2024 fast nichtsEnpal|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nAnne Heche\u2019s estate cannot pay its debts: The actress had $110,000 and is\nbeing sued for $4 millionEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nWatch: the terrifying moment a train is swallowed by a tornadoAS\n\nAS\n\nFrightening footage of tornado over Nebraska InterstateAS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
