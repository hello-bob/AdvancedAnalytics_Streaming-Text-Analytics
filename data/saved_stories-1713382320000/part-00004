One of them\nhas a magnetic field, as does our sun. Its companion does not. And such\nmassive stars are not usually associated with nebulae.\n\nResearchers now appear to have resolved this mystery while also explaining how\nthe relatively few massive stars that are magnetic got that way. Blame it on\nstellar fratricide, they said. In this case, the bigger star apparently\ngobbled up a smaller sibling star, and the mixing of their stellar material\nduring this hostile takeover created a magnetic field.\n\n\"This merger was likely very violent. When two stars merge, material can be\nthrown out, and this likely created the nebula we see today,\" said Chile-based\nEuropean Southern Observatory astronomer Abigail Frost, lead author of the\nstudy published on Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nComputer simulations previously had predicted that the blending of stellar\nmaterial during such a merger could create a magnetic field in the combined\nstar born in this process.\n\n\"Our study is the observational smoking gun confirming this scenario,\" said\nastronomer Hugues Sana of KU Leuven in Belgium, the study's senior author.\n\nThese two stars - gravitationally bound to each other in what is called a\nbinary system - are located in our Milky Way galaxy about 3,700 light-years\nfrom Earth in the constellation Norma. A light-year is the distance light\ntravels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe researchers used nine years of observations by the Chile-based Very Large\nTelescope.\n\nScience for All | Why is a solar eclipse not equally visible from all parts of the earth?\n\nThe magnetic star is about 30 times more massive than the sun. Its remaining\ncompanion is about 26.5 times more massive than the sun. They orbit at a\ndistance from each other varying from seven to 60 times the distance between\nEarth and the sun.\n\nThe Dragon's Egg is so named because it is located relatively near a larger\nnebula complex called the Fighting Dragons of Ara. The stars inside the\nDragon's Egg appear to have started out 4-6 million years ago as a triple\nsystem - three stars born at the same time and gravitationally bound.\n\nThe triple system's two innermost members included a larger star - perhaps 25\nto 30 times the mass of the sun - and a smaller one - maybe five to 10 times\nthe sun's mass.\n\nThe more massive one evolved more quickly than the other, with its outer layer\nengulfing the smaller star and triggering a merger that ejected into space the\ngas and dust that make up the nebula, the researchers said.\n\nThis occurred very recently in a cosmic time scale - about 7,500 years ago,\nbased on the expansion velocity of the material in the nebula. It consists of\nmostly hydrogen and helium, but also an unusually large amount of nitrogen,\nthanks to the merger.\n\nMany sun-sized stars generate magnetic fields.\n\n\"For low-mass stars like our sun, convective heating - like the movement of\nhot water in a radiator in your home - creates a movement of stellar material.\nThis in turn creates a dynamo effect which induces a magnetic field,\" Frost\nsaid.\n\n\"However, for massive stars - greater than eight times the mass of our sun -\ndifferent heating effects are in play, and so explaining the presence of\nmagnetic fields for these types of stars is more tricky. This merger scenario\nticks all the boxes,\" Frost added.\n\nAbout 7% of massive stars are known to have a magnetic field. The second star\nin this binary system, uninvolved in the violent merger, does not.\n\nStellar magnetic fields store immense amounts of energy. The sun's magnetic\nstorms can interact with Earth's atmosphere and create our planet's thrilling\nauroras, but also can disrupt radio signals and navigation systems.\n\nAn image of the nebula released with the study is visually striking.\n\n\"The richness of the physics and chemistry at play gave rise to a beautiful\nstructure,\" Sana said.\n\n  * Copy link\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Telegram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Reddit\n\nRemove SEE ALL\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * Cosmic \u2018speed camera\u2019 reveals staggering speed of neutron star jets\n\n### Related Topics\n\nscience (general) / science (general) / astronomy\n\n### Popular\n\n  1.
