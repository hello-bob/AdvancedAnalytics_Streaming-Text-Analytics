Colin K.\nKhoury, et al/ Royal Society/ CC BY 4.0\n\nYou cannot walk on water or raise the dead. But you can do something that\nJesus never did: eat a banana. Or a tomato. Or a potato. Just walk into any\nsupermarket on the planet to get either of those, or any of the other once-\nregional crops that have gone global since Golgotha.\n\nThis map shows the various regions of origin for 151 of today\u2019s staple food\ncrops. It illustrates an astounding fact that has become so commonplace that\nwe hardly ever give it a thought: just how \u201cforeign\u201d much of the food on our\nplates actually is.\n\nThe Marriage at Cana: water into wine, yes; bananas, no. See The Holy\nLand/Flickr\n\n### Merciless mixing of old and new\n\nThose bananas Jesus never ate? They come from South Asia. And those tomatoes\nand potatoes? We now firmly associate them with the kitchens of Italy and\nIreland, respectively. But they are both natively American. The latter two\ncrossed the Atlantic in what became known as the Columbian Exchange: the\nmerciless mixing of Old and New World things after 1492.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nWith the specter of famine forever hanging over pre-modern society, new\ncultivars were eagerly sought out and brought over. In 1551, the Spanish saw\ntheir first potato, high up in the Andes. In 1567, just 16 years later, they\nwere already growing them on the Canary Islands.\n\nThat has been the rule ever since: if it fills bellies, it travels. Crops from\nanywhere are now grown and consumed just about everywhere. Food, it can\ncertainly be argued, is the most globalized commodity on the planet. And the\nprocess is still ongoing. In 1961, food crops originating outside the\nbioregion where they were consumed constituted 63 percent of the global diet.\nFifty years on, that share has risen to 69 percent.\n\nAn overview of the centers of origin for some of the world\u2019s most globalized\nfood crops. Colin K. Khoury, et al/ Royal Society/ CC BY 4.0\n\n\u201cWe increasingly depend on each other\u2019s plants\u201d, say the researchers who wrote\nthe paper on food origins that is illustrated by this map (and other\ninteractive graphs). So, where do our favorite foods come from?\n\nBefore looking at the map itself, one important caveat: some crops have\nmultiple regions of origin, having been domesticated at different times, in\ndifferent places, by different people. Wheat, for example, was cultivated in\nboth Central and West Asia and in both the South and East Mediterranean. Hence\nthe doubles on the map.\n\nThe entire map is here; below are some highlights.\n\nMany places would not carve jack-o-lanterns if not for South America\u2019s\npumpkins. Where Our Food Comes From/CC BY 4.0\n\n### America\n\nGlobal staples originating in North America include blueberries and\ncranberries, pumpkins and gourds, and \u2014 perhaps most significant economically\n\u2014 sunflowers. Tropical South America gave the world pineapples, papayas, palm\noil, and cocoa, the raw material for chocolate. Without the Andes, we wouldn\u2019t\nhave any tomatoes or potatoes \u2014 not to mention quinoa.\n\n### Africa\n\nAmong the crops domesticated in both East and West Africa are coffee and\nmillets, melons, and sorghum. West and Central Africa are home to palm oil,\nrice, and kola nuts. In Southern Africa, there are watermelon and peppermint.\n\n### Europe\n\nApples, asparagus, hazelnuts? Lettuce, hops, and sugar beets? The world has\nNortheast (and Northwest) Europe to thank for those. Anise and figs came from\nSouthwest Europe; walnuts and cherries from Southeast Europe.\n\n### Asia/Pacific\n\nSpinach, hemp, and pistachios all go back to Central Asia, while East Asia is\nthe original home of peaches and nectarines, tangerines, and mandarins, as\nwell as cucumbers and kiwis. Eggplants, grapefruit, mangoes, and melons are\nSoutheast Asian natives. From the Pacific region come coconuts. Australia\u2019s\nonly contribution to global food is the Macadamia nut.\n\nCoffee was first cultivated in Africa. Where Our Food Comes From/CC BY 4.0\n\nSome of the other salient points in the paper:\n\n  * Since the mid-20th century, diets around the world have become more diverse and more homogenous, with supermarkets and other retail outlets the world over increasingly offering a similar range of food options.\n  * Regions far removed from centers of origin are most dependent on foreign crops. These include Europe, North America, and Australia. For example, about 92.5 percent of the calories consumed in Canada derive from crops originating outside North America.\n  * Regions with high crop diversity are least dependent on foreign crops. This is so for South Asia and West Africa, for example. Among the countries with the lowest level of \u201cforeign\u201d crop use are Cambodia (19 percent), Bangladesh, and Niger (both 20 percent).\n  * From 1961 to 2011, foreign crops that produced fat saw the fastest growth. Some of the largest increases took place in Indonesia and Malaysia, with the boom in oil palm production (originally from West and Central Africa); and in Brazil, where soya bean production (originally from East Asia) was adopted on a large scale.\n  * U.S. farm production focuses on crops from East Asia (soybeans) and Central America (maize), while U.S. food consumption patterns lean heavily on crops from the Mediterranean and West Asia (wheat, barley, chickpea, almonds, etc.)\n\nCherries come from Southeast Europe. Where Our Food Comes From/CC BY 4.0\n\nThe paper builds on the groundwork laid in the 1920s by Nikolai Vavilov, a\nRussian plant genetics rock star. When young, Vavilov had witnessed first-hand\nhow crop failures can lead straight to devastating famines.\n\nAs a scientist, his plan was to improve crops so they would no longer fail and\nhad the potential for higher yields. To do that, he looked for their regions\nof origin, reasoning that the highest species diversity would occur where\ncrops were first domesticated.\n\nVavilov travelled the world, eventually amassing 250,000 samples of seeds,\nroots, and fruits\u2014then the largest seed bank in the world. He identified\nthree, and ultimately seven, centers of origin for food crops. Although the\nsourcing has become a bit more detailed, these \u201cVavilov centers\u201d still form\nthe basis for research into food origins.\n\nThings didn\u2019t end well for Vavilov. Early in his career, he had mentored one\nTrofim Lysenko but later became a fierce critic of the latter\u2019s\npseudoscientific theories. Unfortunately, Stalin was a fan. Vavilov was\narrested in 1940 and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to 20\nyears. Vavilov died in prison in 1943.\n\nTangerines, mandarins, and many other crops are originally East Asian. Where\nOur Food Comes From/CC BY 4.0\n\n### Saved by starving scientists\n\nMeanwhile, Vavilov\u2019s seedbank in Leningrad was threatened by the Nazi siege of\nthe city, which lasted 28 months and caused widespread starvation. But rather\nthan eat the seeds, scientists took turns guarding the collection. The\ncollection survived, but nine of the scientists themselves died of starvation.\n\nIn the 1950s, Vavilov was posthumously pardoned and soon regained the status\nof \u201cHero of Soviet Science.\u201d Vavilov\u2019s seed bank is now part of an institute\nthat bears his name. There is also a planet and a moon crater named after him.\nThe story of the starving scientists guarding the seed bank has been novelized\n(Hunger, by Elise Blackwell).\n\nResearch into the origins of food crops remains relevant for more than just\nhistorical reasons. Wild relatives and related domesticated species of global\ncrops offer the potential to find new genes that may make those crops more\nresistant to diseases and climate change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Big Think, home of the brightest minds and\nbiggest ideas of all time.
