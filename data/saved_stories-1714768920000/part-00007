Millennia later, in the mid-18th\ncentury, archeologists began to unearth the city, including its famed\nlibraries, but the scrolls they found were too fragile to be unrolled and\nread; their contents were thought to be lost forever.\n\nOnly now, thanks to the advent of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning, scholars of the ancient world have partnered with computer\nprogrammers to unlock the contents of these priceless documents. In this\nepisode of \u201cThere\u2019s More to That,\u201d science journalist and Smithsonian\ncontributor Jo Marchant tells us about the yearslong campaign to read these\nscrolls. And Youssef Nader\u2014one of the three winners of last year\u2019s \u201cVesuvius\nChallenge\u201d to make these clumps of vulcanized ash readable\u2014tells us how he and\nhis teammates achieved their historic breakthrough.\n\nA transcript is below.

He said he was five stories up, and it still sounded like he was on the\nstreet.\n\nNader: We arrived in Alexandria somewhere around 2 a.m. in the morning, so I\ngot some sleep and I woke up to have the interview, basically.\n\nKlimek: Youssef grew up in Cairo, so from a young age he was surrounded by\nancient history.\n\nNader: Papyrus was invented by ancient Egyptians almost 5,000 years ago, so\nlearning about papyrus making, and how the ancient Egyptians went around\ndocumenting their history, is something you learn about very early on, and\nsomething that sticks with you. It\u2019s very common to have souvenirs from Egypt,\nwhich is like papyrus with some hieroglyphs and some writings, and it\u2019s a very\ncommon souvenir or gift that we bring people from here, and I brought my\nfriends a couple of times. So yeah, it\u2019s sort of a cultural heritage.\n\nKlimek: Today, Youssef is a PhD student who works with machine learning and\nA.I.\n\nNader: I do work with image data, but I usually work with 2D images, like\nphotos you take of your dog and stuff like that.\n\nKlimek: One day, Youssef heard about something called the Vesuvius Challenge.\nIt involved some unreadable ancient scrolls and the hope that some A.I. expert\nmight be able to help, with a reward of $700,000.\n\nNader: It had all of the interesting elements: Papyrus, which rings a bell for\nan Egyptian, of course; playing around with historical data of 2,000 years ago\njust on my laptop is not something you come by very often; very interesting\ntechnical problem; a big monetary prize. It was just all of the right elements\nthat make it worthwhile.\n\nKlimek: It was a big challenge, but Youssef decided he was up to the task.\n\nKlimek (to Nader): Have you ever seen one of the scrolls in person?\n\nNader: I have. I recently visited and I got to see scrolls up close. And it\u2019s\ncrazy. I could not believe that this is the same thing I\u2019m working on on my\ncomputer, because it doesn\u2019t look like there is hope. When you look at the\nscroll up close, it really looks like a piece of charcoal, and the sheets look\nlike they merged together, it\u2019s just one, and they\u2019re very, very small. One of\nthe scrolls was just my finger tall, so it was really crazy to think that this\nis what we\u2019re working on and we were reading. It\u2019s a little bit of science\nfiction.\n\nKlimek: From Smithsonian magazine and PRX Productions, this is \u201cThere\u2019s More\nto That,\u201d the show where we may not welcome our robot overlords, but we are\nwilling to let them help us read historically significant ancient papyrus\nscrolls. In this episode, we learn more about the Vesuvius Challenge, what\nhappened and what A.I. means for the future of archaeology. I\u2019m Chris Klimek.\n\nKlimek: What are the Herculaneum scrolls, and why are they important?\n\nJo Marchant: They\u2019re a collection of carbonized papyrus scrolls from around\n2,000 years ago, ancient Roman times, that were buried by the eruption of the\nVesuvius volcano. The same one that buried Pompeii.\n\nKlimek: Jo Marchant is a Smithsonian contributor who\u2019s covered this story for\nseveral years now.\n\nMarchant: Often, the scrolls are described as the only intact library we have\nthat survives from the ancient world. Because they were buried by the volcano,\nyou\u2019ve got these carbonized scrolls that were kept underground for all that\ntime, so they have survived. But the only problem is you can\u2019t unwrap them to\nread them without destroying them. So, they\u2019ve been this big archaeological\nmystery since they were discovered in the 18th century.\n\nKlimek: What do they look like now?\n\nMarchant: Some of them have been pulled apart, and are basically crumbled into\ndust and they\u2019re in hundreds of pieces, but there are a few hundred\u2014the worst,\nmost charred cases, if you like\u2014 that were left intact as a lost cause.\nThey\u2019ve been described as saggy, brown burritos, is one of the least rude\ndescriptions that I\u2019ve heard. They\u2019re kind of crumpled, crushed, wrinkled.\nThey look like nothing. They were thought, supposedly, to have been pieces of\ncoal by the workmen who first uncovered them in the 18th century, so they just\nreally look like very sorry objects indeed. You would not think that you were\ngoing to get a lot of information out of them.\n\nKlimek: Do we know how they were recognized when they were found as carbonized\nscrolls? It sounds like they could have easily been mistaken for something\nelse.\n\nMarchant: Yeah, a lot of them were supposedly just thrown away, or burned,\neven, for heat by the workmen, these 18th-century workmen who had first\nuncovered them.\n\nKlimek: What these workmen had discovered was an ancient library buried\nunderground since the Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D.\n\nMarchant: The library itself was situated in this luxury Roman villa on the\nshore of the Bay of Naples. It possibly belonged to Julius Caesar\u2019s father-in-\nlaw at one point, this beautiful villa with walkways, columns, statues, works\nof art, courtyards, this luxury residence. The workmen are digging tunnels,\nessentially, through the site, uncovering it, find these lumps, initially just\nthink that they\u2019re coal, burn them, throw them away. To be honest with you, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly how it was first realized that that was not what these\nthings were, that they were actually incredibly precious. But once that was\nrealized, then there was incredible interest, then, in trying to read them.\nThis was a really unique, spectacular find. We just don\u2019t have literary\nwritten sources from the classical world. Most of the works of literature or\nphilosophy or whatever it is that we have have been copied and therefore\nselected through the centuries. But to actually have these original pieces\nfrom the time is just really, really incredible. So, there was all sorts of\nefforts to try and open these scrolls, most of which ended up being very, very\ndestructive.\n\nKlimek: What else has hindered efforts to read the scrolls, aside from the\nfact that they fall apart if you try to physically unroll them?\n\nMarchant: Yeah, so technically, this is an incredibly difficult challenge.\nThere have been attempts to open them, and essentially you end up with\nhundreds of pieces or strips, because it\u2019s incredibly thin, this papyrus, you\nmight have hundreds of rolls. So, imagine it\u2019s tearing off in strips, but then\nyou\u2019ve got different layers then stick together. So, each of your strips might\nconsist of a different number of layers, and then you\u2019ve got to try and piece\nthose together as a jigsaw. So, there has been a lot of work going on among\npapyrologists to try and decipher, translate, interpret those pieces, sticking\nthe bits back together. But then they were kind of put aside as a lost course.\nI think a lot of people thought that those were never going to be read, they\nwere just going to sit there in the library archive.\n\nKlimek: As Jo mentioned, the scrolls were incredibly fragile, but that\u2019s\nreally just the beginning of why researchers were so stumped. First, how could\nthey separate all the layers of paper?\n\nMarchant: You\u2019ve got to find a way of looking inside them, working out where\nthe surfaces of the papyrus are, and then reading the ink. They\u2019re so\ncrumpled, and you\u2019ve got all of these layers, some of them are stuck together,\nrolled very tightly. How do you even image and find the surfaces?\n\nKlimek: Yeah. Then there was the ink itself.\n\nMarchant: A lot of ink from ancient papyri has got iron in it, so if you\nX-ray, that ink will glow very brightly. But the problem with this ink is it\u2019s\njust carbon and water. It has exactly the same density in X-ray scans as the\npapyrus. So, you can do your X-rays, you can do beautiful 3D scanning,\nwhatever you\u2019re going to do. But it\u2019s like doing an X-ray of a body: You\u2019re\nlooking for the bones, but the bones are completely transparent; the ink\ndoesn\u2019t show up.\n\nKlimek: Enter Brent Seales, a professor at the University of Kentucky.\n\nMarchant: He\u2019s a computer scientist, so he\u2019s not a classicist, quite an\nunusual person to be spearheading this attempt to read these ancient scrolls.\nBut he was originally interested in computer vision and then got interested\nin, how could you use algorithms to flatten out images? One of the first\nthings that Brent Seales worked on was a very old copy of Beowulf in Old\nEnglish that was kept in the British Library. Part of the problem when you\ntake photographs of very old manuscripts like that is it\u2019s all kind of warped,\nand sort of folded and cockled. The surface isn\u2019t flat, so if you just take a\nphotograph of it, you\u2019re not going to be able to see all of the writing. So,\nthe idea was to develop software where you could scan the not flat three-\ndimensional surface, and then flatten it out, so that you would have a nice,\nflat surface, you could read all the writing.\n\nSo, then moving from there to actually virtually unwrapping something that was\nrolled up. And a few years ago, the team did that on an old scroll from Ein\nGedi, on the shores of the Dead Sea, that was burned by fire in the sixth\ncentury A.D. And they took the CT scans of that and were able to then\nvirtually unwrap that surface, and see that, written inside, was actually some\ntext from the Book of Leviticus. So, that was an incredible advance.\n\nKlimek: Then in 2005, a colleague showed Brent Seales the Herculaneum scrolls.\n\nMarchant: And he told me that that just blew his mind, just the scale of that\nchallenge, and the potential for the information that you could find. But he\u2019s\nquite interesting, in that he isn\u2019t so interested specifically in some of\nthese ancient Greek and Roman sources that most papyrologists would be\ninterested in, he\u2019s actually a devout Christian, and he is really interested\nin the origins of Christianity. The volcano erupted in 79 A.D., these scrolls\nwere buried, so this was the time when Christianity was just beginning, and\nthe philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome, in that world, would\u2019ve been very\naware of what was happening, probably interested in this new religion that was\nstarting up. But he told me that what he was really dreaming of, really\ninterested in, is finding out more information about that. Can we find\ninformation from early Christian sources?\n\nThere\u2019s the huge technical challenges, but one of the biggest problems he\u2019s\nactually had is getting access to the scrolls to even study them, and to try\nto develop these techniques, because they\u2019re incredibly precious and\nincredibly fragile. So, curators who are in charge of these collections, the\nlast thing they want to do is give them to some computer scientist who wants\nto carry them off to a particle accelerator somewhere and send beams of X-rays\nthrough them. This is something that\u2019s taken nearly 20 years to really come\ntogether.\n\nKlimek: I love this. \u201cCan I borrow this irreplaceable treasure of yours? I\u2019ll\nbring it right back, I just need to run it through my particle accelerator\nfirst.\u201d\n\nMarchant: Exactly, exactly.\n\nKlimek: \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nMarchant: And I\u2019ve spoken to curators, and they\u2019d say you breathe on these\nthings, they will fall apart. They are so fragile. So, it really is a kind of\nperfect storm of difficulties.\n\nKlimek: Remarkably, the scrolls were eventually taken to a particle\naccelerator in the U.K. for 3D scanning.\n\nMarchant: You\u2019re making a 3D reconstruction of that volume, and then you have\nto go through, really painstakingly, slice by slice, and kind of mark where\nall the surfaces are. If you think about looking at one of these scrolls in a\ncross section, you\u2019ll see a spiral of where the papyrus is all wound together,\nand you have to mark where all those surfaces are, and then what Brent Seales\nand his team did was work on software for algorithms that could take that data\nand then unwrap that spiral into flat surfaces. So, you get a kind of flat\nimage of what that surface looks like in the CT scan, that you can then work\non and try and look for the ink.\n\nBut as I mentioned, the ink in those images is transparent; you can\u2019t see it.\nSo, that then was the next challenge. How are you actually going to make that\nink visible? They had one tiny fragment which had one letter on it, sigma, and\nthey were able to carry that to the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire, and\nthe idea was that just using that one letter, they were trying to come up with\nimaging techniques, and that\u2019s where, a few years ago, they had the idea of\nusing machine learning, these artificial intelligence techniques, to try to do\nthat.\n\nIf you take some of the papyri that has been opened, some of these fragments,\nand you train your machine learning algorithm, you show it, \u201cThis is what ink\nlooks like, and this is what not ink, just the blank papyrus, looks like.\u201d You\ncan teach it to be able to tell the difference, so then you can run that same\nalgorithm on your CT scans from inside the wrapped-up scroll. That was the\napproach, but they realized that this was going to be an incredibly labor\nintensive ... a lot of work to do this. And I think that\u2019s the point at which\nNat Friedman, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur, he had heard about the\nHerculaneum scrolls and contacted Brent Seales to say, \u201cRight, what\u2019s\nhappening with this? Is there anything that I can do to help?\u201d And that was\nthe origins of this Vesuvius Challenge competition.\n\nKlimek: Nat Friedman is the former CEO of GitHub, an online platform where\ncomputer programmers collaborate.\n\nMarchant: And this whole project, actually, I find fascinating, because of the\ndifferent worlds that come together. You\u2019ve got the computer scientists.\nYou\u2019ve got these classicists and papyrologists who have their own culture and\nworld. You\u2019ve got the curators\u2014they\u2019re just really wanting to keep everything\nsafe, they\u2019re conservators. So, very different motives, very different\ncultures that these people are coming from. If you think of papyrologists,\noften it will take them years, decades to do a translation and edit an edition\nof a particular source. They\u2019re so painstaking, they\u2019re working character by\ncharacter, just trying to work everything out. And then you\u2019ve got the Silicon\nValley entrepreneurs coming in, going, \u201cSpeed is everything! We are going to\nsolve this now!\u201d And you throw those two worlds together, I find it completely\nfascinating how, actually, in this case, that\u2019s actually worked really well.\nIt\u2019s really triggered a lot of progress and creativity.\n\nKlimek: So, how does all of this bring us, in 2023, to the Vesuvius Challenge?\n\nMarchant: Nat Friedman told me that during the pandemic, during lockdown, he\u2019s\nlooking for things to do, like we all were, looking for distractions. Starts\nreading about ancient Rome, getting very interested in that whole world, finds\nout about the Herculaneum scrolls through just Googling, Wikipedia, all of\nthis. Eventually comes across an online talk by Brent Seales talking about all\nof the work, and this problem with not being able to see the ink, and how he\nthinks that machine learning, artificial intelligence, might be the answer to\nthat. And Nat said, from this talk, it sounded like Brent was pretty much\nthere. He was going to solve it pretty soon, so he just thinks, \u201cOh, I look\nforward to finding out what happens with that.\u201d Then, a couple of years later,\nit was like, \u201cOh, they don\u2019t seem to have read the scrolls yet.\u201d\n\nSo, he got in touch with Brent Seales to invite him to a retreat where a lot\nof tech figures, funders, that sort of whole community get together. Seales\ninitially just ignored the email, just didn\u2019t really believe who it was from.\nSo, it took a bit of chasing, but he eventually realized that yes, this was\nNat Friedman who was trying to get in touch with him. He went along to this\nretreat. It\u2019s a camp-out in the woods in Northern California, where they all\nsit around fires and discuss projects, and, I don\u2019t know, important decisions\nin the tech world get made. But nobody was actually interested in funding this\nproject.\n\nSo, Nat Friedman, afterward, is thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want this guy to go home\nwith nothing, after I promised him that we\u2019d be able to do something to help\nhis project.\u201d Basically, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it as a competition?\u201d He\nand his longtime funding partner, Daniel Gross, put forward initial funding\nfor the competition, and the idea was that you make all of your data open\nsource to public, just put it out there, and then you set goals for people who\ncan make different advances toward reading the scrolls. So, things like first\nperson to detect ink, first person to detect a word, first person to read a\nwhole passage. You set all of these different minds onto the challenge at\nonce.\n\nAnd the actual design of the competition is really interesting and really\nclever, I think, because rather than just having one prize and everyone\u2019s\nworking alone, because you\u2019ve got these progress prizes, every time somebody\nwins a progress prize, all of their work, all of their data, all of their\nalgorithms get made public. So, the way that Brent put it to me is you level\neverybody up, then, so everybody has the advantage of that, and then they all\nstart working on the next challenge.\n\nI asked Brent Seales, actually, was that difficult? If you\u2019ve worked on a\nproject for nearly 20 years, and your dream was you were going to be the\nperson to read the scrolls, is that a hard decision to make, then, to say,\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s not going to be me. I\u2019m going to do this prize. I\u2019m going to\nmake everything I\u2019ve done so far, everything I\u2019ve worked for, all of our\nsoftware, all of our data, let\u2019s just make it public, put it out there, and\nthen someone else can come and do that last step, and they will be the person\nto read it.\u201d Can you imagine? How hard. And he said yeah, it was really\ndifficult. The whole team had to talk about that together, and make sure that\nthey were all OK with that.\n\nSeales also said something else to me: He said often with archeology, and I\u2019ve\ncome across this with other stories I\u2019ve written, actually, that somebody\ndecides that they\u2019re going to be the one to solve a mystery or whatever it is,\nmake a discovery, and it\u2019s almost like the ego takes over, it\u2019s theirs, and\nthey\u2019re going to be the one to have all the glory. And he said this was almost\na way to prove to himself that he wasn\u2019t that person. That he\u2019s doing it so\nthat the scrolls can be read.\n\nThey put everything out there, made it public, launched the award toward the\nbeginning of 2023, and it all went from there. I think they had more than a\nthousand teams, in the end, from all over the world, like China, Ukraine,\nAustralia, U.S., Egypt, and they were all on this Discord, this chat platform\nfor gamers, discussing latest advances and questions, because they were just\nreleasing little flat images of the surfaces inside these scrolls, a little\npiece at a time. And then what the entrants for the Vesuvius Challenge were\ndoing was then they would take those segments, those flat segments, and use\nthose to then train their machine learning models to try and recognize that\nink.\n\nKlimek: Were there any unsuccessful avenues that were part of this that were\nincluded in your reporting? Any attempts that didn\u2019t pan out?\n\nMarchant: I think there were lots of teams trying different things, trying to\ntrain their algorithms in different ways. So, one thing that Seales thought\nthey might be able to do was to train the algorithm on the letters from the\nparts of the scrolls that have been read, but that ended up really not working\nvery well. It seems that you have to train your algorithm on the same scroll\nof the scans that you\u2019re trying to read, which is obviously very difficult,\nbecause you can\u2019t see the ink. How are you going to do that?\n\nOne of the first real key breakthroughs, there was an ex-physicist called\nCasey Handmer. He was actually looking at the images that were coming out from\ninside this scroll visually, and just spending hours and hours poring over\nthem. He was convinced that if a machine learning algorithm could see a\ndifference, a lot of those are trained based on the human visual system. So,\nhe was thinking, \u201cIf a machine can see it, it must be possible for a human to\nsee it, if we just look carefully enough.\u201d So, he\u2019s pouring over these images\nand eventually notices this very strange, very subtle difference in texture.\n\nSo, normally in the CT scans, you can sort of see the woven strands of the\npapyrus, and then in some places there was this ... It\u2019s described as being\nlike cracked mud on a riverbed, those geometric kind of cracks you get. So,\nthey called it crackle. He was trying to look at this, trying to work out\nwhere it was, and then realized in one place, it seemed as if it was forming\nthe shape of a letter. So, he was like, \u201cOh my goodness, this is the ink.\u201d\nThis is not showing up as a different color, it\u2019s not glowing bright or\nanything, but there\u2019s just this very, very subtle difference in the texture of\nthe surface where the ink is sitting on the papyrus. And he was awarded the\nFirst Ink Prize for doing that. So, then other competitors were able to use\nthat to train their algorithms. Now they\u2019ve got a foothold, they\u2019ve got\nsomething to start training their algorithms on the difference between ink and\nnot ink.\n\nKlimek: After that, the race was on. Who would find the first word to read\nfrom the Herculaneum scrolls?\n\nKlimek (to Nader): Can you give us a simple definition of what machine\nlearning is?\n\nNader: Machine learning is about how to teach a statistical model to map your\ninput data to some output result that you want. For the Vesuvius Challenge\nespecially, we wanted to teach the A.I. model what ink looks like.\n\nKlimek: Nader again.\n\nNader: So, you give the A.I. model some small images, some patches of the\nimage, because the segments are really huge, it\u2019s like hundreds of thousands\nof pixels by hundreds of thousands of pixels. It\u2019s crazy resolution. So, you\ntake a small piece, you show it to the A.I. model, and the A.I. model needs to\nsay, \u201cI see ink in this small piece\u201d or not. And to train this, you need some\nexamples to show it to begin with. So, we tell it, \u201cOK, this is what ink looks\nlike. This is what ink doesn\u2019t look like.\u201d And you show it these examples, and\nthen it\u2019s able to learn, \u201cOK, how do I differentiate between the two?\u201d And\nthen it notices, \u201cOK, there\u2019s this pattern on top of the papyrus that looks\nquite like cracks, that maybe this I can use to detect the signal.\u201d\n\nAnd of course there were very interesting problems, because to begin with, we\ncan\u2019t see the ink ourselves, so it didn\u2019t have the data that we can show to\nthe A.I. model to say, \u201cOK, this is what ink looks like.\u201d And it took a lot of\nexperiments and a lot of ways to find a first footing of ink from small pieces\nthat fell off the scrolls: first two letters. How do we go from two letters to\n2,000 letters? You train an A.I. model to learn these two letters that you\nfound, and it has a slightly better idea of what letters look like, so it\nfinds another ten letters. You take those 12 letters now, and you train a new\none with the 12 letters. The new A.I. is better, so it finds maybe\n20-something letters.\n\nAnd the beginning was incremental. I would usually just take the predictions\nfrom an A.I. model, like, \u201cOK, these are letters.\u201d I would paint over them in\nPhotoshop to make some examples of what ink is, so just like a black and white\nimage, and I would give it to the next A.I. model. Of course, my drawing is\nnot very accurate, and it was a question of how do you allow the A.I. model to\ndisagree when you have some mislabeled stuff? How do you guarantee that the\nA.I. model is not hallucinating, not making up letters? And we had to operate\non a very, very small scale, such that the letter is never seen by the A.I.\nmodel. It only predicts pixel level: ink, no ink, ink, no ink. And then we, as\nhumans, when we look at the big picture, we see, \u201cOK, yeah, this is actually\nGreek, this is what it means.\u201d\n\nKlimek: This is how you can have confidence in one set of findings before you\nmove on to the next set. You\u2019re verifying the machine learning conclusions\nwith human eyes before you feed those discoveries back into the A.I. to try to\nsolve the next set.\n\nNader: Yeah. So, in the training phase, I was verifying this by my own eyes,\nwhich, I\u2019m no expert in Greek, I actually don\u2019t know any Greek. So, I was just\nlooking at what makes sense as a writing, like any kind of written language.\nYou have some ink deposits, and you draw a letter in some shape. It makes\nsense that the letters are all on a single row, it doesn\u2019t make sense that\nthere\u2019s scrambled rows; fixed-size columns, stuff like that. I go to sleep\nthinking about the Vesuvius Challenge. I wake up, check some stuff, continue\nworking, eat, sleep, then repeat. I wasn\u2019t even getting proper sleep because\nI\u2019m going to bed and thinking, \u201cOK, did I actually try that thing? Maybe I\nhave a different idea, maybe I should do this.\u201d And I run something overnight,\nand I check in the morning if it worked or not. So yeah, we were grateful that\nthe first words that we found was not something like, \u201cand,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d for\nexample. That would\u2019ve been underwhelming. It had some meaning, it had some\nkind of zest to it, and I think that was really cool.\n\nKlimek: Youssef was one of two people to find that first word. It was\u2014drum\nroll, please\u2014\u201cpurple.\u201d\n\nMarchant: So, that was the first word, \u201cpurple.\u201d Which is lovely, I love that\nit was just such a rich, evocative word.\n\nKlimek: Marchant.\n\nMarchant: So, immediately that said to the papyrologists, \u201cWe think this is a\nnew work we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Because \u201cpurple\u201d is quite a rare word.\nPurple, porphyras, is the name of a dye. It was made from sea snails, so very\nexpensive, difficult to make, so used to dye the emperor\u2019s robes. This was a\nsign of wealth, luxury, rank. It\u2019s just this lovely sort of ... Yeah, just\nevocative word. So, that was the First Letters Prize, awarded in October to\nLuke Farritor, who got the first place for that prize.\n\nKlimek: Luke Farritor was a 21-year-old computer science student at the\nUniversity of Nebraska. Youssef won second place. The two reached out to one\nanother after the announcement, eventually deciding to team up. They were\njoined by a third student named Julian Schilliger. Together, the three set\ntheir sights on the next phase of the competition.\n\nMarchant: When the whole challenge was set up in March 2023, they had this big\n$700,000 Grand Prize for reading the first passages from the scroll. And a\ndeadline was set for that prize, which was the 31st December 2023, so the end\nof that year. Nat Friedman said it was getting nearer and nearer to the end of\nthe year, and they\u2019re not getting any entries for this Grand Prize. They were\ngetting pretty worried. They were starting to send out messages going, \u201cSo,\nhow\u2019s everyone getting on? Let us know your progress!\u201d\n\nKlimek: Entrants to the Vesuvius Challenge worked right down to the wire.\nYoussef and his teammates were no exception.\n\nKlimek (to Nader): What were your last few days like, prior to the deadline?\n\nNader: They were quite sleepless. I was trying to make sure that I\u2019m not\nsubmitting on the last day, which I usually do in every other thing. I knew\nthat a lot of people would be submitting at the very last day or the very last\nminute. I was also not sure about ... There was a time factor. If you get to\nthe threshold of winning first, you win. I was not sure: Where are we on that?\nDo we have the best models? Where are we? You don\u2019t know about other teams.\nAnd so you also want to guarantee that you\u2019re first, in case there\u2019s a tie.\nSo, there was the time factor and the quality factor, and you\u2019re trying to,\n\u201cOK, do I submit now? Do I try to make it better over the next week? Is it\ngetting better? It\u2019s not getting better.\u201d And I made one submission 22nd\nDecember, and one 30th December, so, one day before the end of the\ncompetition.\n\nI was just planning to go back to Egypt to visit my family after the long haul\nof the Vesuvius Challenge. It was the date after I arrived in Egypt. They sent\nus an email, saying, \u201cHey, the evaluation process is still ongoing, we\u2019d like\nto meet with you guys.\u201d Of course, we\u2019re in different time zones, and they\nwanted to make sure we\u2019re all in one meeting when they tell us the news. So,\nwe didn\u2019t know that we were getting the announcement, and we were suspicious.\n\u201cOK, why do you need all three of us in a meeting?\u201d We were like, \u201cWe can\nanswer the questions over email.\u201d Julian was saying, \u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t make\nsense.\u201d\n\nWe went to the meeting, and then they were asking us normal questions, and we\nwere like, \u201cOK, yeah, maybe it\u2019s still ongoing.\u201d And then Nat was like, \u201cHow\nwould you guys feel if we told you that you won the Vesuvius Grand Prize?\u201d And\nit was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I think it took us a couple of days for it to sink\nin, actually, that we actually won. And we were in disbelief, but we were\necstatic, and it just felt amazing.\n\nMarchant: The three of them working together, they\u2019d actually read, I think it\nwas more than 2,000 characters from this scroll, more than 5 percent of the\nentire scrolls. And these are really big, long, long scrolls. And it was\ndiscovered that it was a work of philosophy by an ancient Greek philosopher\ncalled Philodemus. And that in itself was not a huge surprise, because of the\nscrolls that had been attempts made to open them and partially read, a lot of\nthose scrolls were written in Greek and were philosophy works by Philodemus.\nHe was a follower of Epicurus who founded the Epicurean school of Greek\nphilosophy. They thought everything in nature was made of atoms that swerve\nand collide. And there\u2019s so many works, actually, of Epicurean philosophy that\nthey think that that part of the library was probably the working library of\nthis philosopher, Philodemus.\n\nAnd it seems to be a work on pleasure, and the senses, and on what gives us\npleasure, possibly relating to music. It\u2019s mentioning the color purple, it\u2019s\nmentioning the taste of capers. There\u2019s a character called Xenophantus who is\nmentioned, who is possibly, there\u2019s a Xenophantus known who was a very famous\nflute player, who apparently his playing was so evocative and stirred the\nheart so much that his playing always caused Alexander the Great to\nimmediately reach for his weapons. So, you get a sense of all these lovely\nsensory sources of pleasure that are being mentioned in this piece. So yeah,\npapyrologists are really, really excited about that. But then also what this\nmeans for what else we could be reading from now.\n\nKlimek: I asked Youssef what other archaeological problems he\u2019d like to see\nmachine learning tackle.\n\nNader: I think there are very interesting projects of machine learning in\narchaeology, even outside of reading a scroll. I think there has been\ndiscussions of using similar techniques to read writings on wrappings of\nmummies. I know of one other project in our university that has to do with\nusing 3D reconstruction and imaging for archaeological sites, using drones to\nscan the sites, and figure out structures and stuff. There are some\ninteresting problems that are either really hard to solve, or require a lot of\nman effort, and A.I. could really help us speed things up.\n\nKlimek: Do you think most people who don\u2019t have your specialized background\nand education, do people understand generally what artificial intelligence is?\n\nNader: Artificial intelligence has been getting a lot of bad reputation\nrecently, also because of how it has been used. I think sometimes people think\nit\u2019s a lot smarter than it actually is, and some people think it\u2019s a lot\ndumber than it may be. I believe it\u2019s a very interesting tool, depends really\nhow you use it. A lot of the fear and concern from A.I. comes from not\ntreating it as a tool, but as an entity of its own that wants to do either\ngood or bad. But the good or bad is basically coming from the human operating\nthe tool. I think there\u2019s a lot of debates coming from the world-leading\nexperts in A.I. about what actually are the risks, and how to interpret what\nwe are doing. So, it\u2019s still kind of an ongoing process, but there is some\nawareness of, OK, there is this new technology that is shaping the world.\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad that the Vesuvius Challenge came at this time, because it also\nshows, yeah, you can do harm with A.I., but you can also do so much good, and\nso much benefit to mankind. So, some people are starting to think, \u201cYeah,\nmaybe this is not really as bad as we thought.\u201d Or, \u201cWe could really use this\nfor our own good.\u201d\n\nKlimek: Thank you, Youssef, this has been fascinating.\n\nNader: Yeah, thank you, Chris.\n\nKlimek: To read more of Smithsonian magazine\u2019s coverage of the Vesuvius\nChallenge, check out the links in our show notes. And as always, we\u2019d like to\nsend you off with a dinner party fact. This time, we bring you a brief\nanecdote about another fragile thing that lives buried, not under ash, but\nunder ice.\n\nMegan Gambino: Hi, I\u2019m Megan Gambino, and I\u2019m a senior web editor at\nSmithsonian magazine. I recently edited a story about ice worms. I had no idea\nwhat these things were until this story, and they\u2019re tiny, about inch-long,\nworms that live in glacial ice. They\u2019re actually the only macroscopic animals\nthat live in glaciers. But what I found interesting about them is that they\u2019re\nboth hardy and fragile at the same time. And what I mean by this is they can\nlive for years without food, and they live at freezing temperatures, and yet\nthey can only survive at this tiny temperature range, hovering right around 32\ndegrees Fahrenheit. Any colder, they get hypothermia; any warmer, they get\nroom temperature, their membranes melt. So, I found that they were this\ninteresting critter that was both tough and delicate at the same time.\n\nKlimek: \u201cThere\u2019s More to That\u201d is a production of Smithsonian magazine and PRX\nProductions.
