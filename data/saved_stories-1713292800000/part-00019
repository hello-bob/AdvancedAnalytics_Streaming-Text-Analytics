This is common within enterprise data \u2014 emails, invoices,\nCVs, support tickets, log messages, and tabular data all contain substantial\ncontent with contextual relationships. Retrieval of this data is an ongoing\nchallenge because 1) enterprise data can contain many concepts, and 2) the\nrelationship between concepts needs to be understood.\n\nTo address this, developers would need to create a classification layer to\nidentify and match distinct aspects from a query to specific metadata fields\nin the documents. This is quite difficult to build and host, and would be\nconstrained to the values only understood by the classifiers.\n\nAlso, existing embedding approaches aren\u2019t able to address the problem. The\nbest existing embedding models, such as Cohere Embed v3, convert documents\ninto a single vector within a semantic vector space:\n\nExample Vector Space for Retail Products\n\nWhile this works well when your document is focused on a single attribute,\nthese embedding models start to struggle once several aspects and concepts are\npresent in the data. In the above example, we see that the jeans that are\navailable in blue and yellow have a similar embedding as the T-shirt that is\navailable in green and red. These embeddings are placed between each color\npairing, losing any semantic tie to the specific colors. Now if searching for\na \u201cred T-shirt\u201d, we are unlikely to return similar T-shirt products. In fact,\nthe top result for \"red t-shirt\" in our limited example here would be the\n\u201cblue and yellow jeans\u201d.\n\nCohere Compass is designed to address multi-aspect data. With Compass, data\ncan be passed as JSON documents to the Compass embedding model, which\ntransforms it into a special format and stores its representation in vector\ndatabases. The embeddings output can be stored in any vector database.\n\nCohere Compass Captures Multi-Aspect Representations\n\n## Convert Your Multi-Aspect Data to JSON with the Compass SDK\n\nIn a traditional RAG pipeline, we would index an email with a PDF attachment\nindependently. We would convert the PDF to text, and then chunk the text on\nparagraph or page level, and index the chunks individually in our vector\ndatabase. See the diagram below for a visual explanation of this process.\n\nChunking Can Lose Context\n\nThe challenge with this approach is that we lose the contextual information\nthat the PDF was sent via email and was sent by a specific person at a\nspecific time, with potentially additional context as part of the email\nsubject or body.\n\nWith Compass, the parsing SDK helps with all these details. Converting your\ndata to JSON and then into an embedding output is a two-stage process:\n\n  1. The Compass SDK parses the email and all the attachments into a single JSON.\n  2. The JSON is passed to the Compass embedding model resulting in an embedding output that can be stored in any vector database.\n\nThe metadata and text are stored, along with multi-aspect representations\ncapturing the relationship between concepts present in the multi-aspect data.\n\nCompass SDK Converts Multi-aspect Data to JSON\n\nWith this setup, the user can search over all the embedded information, and\nqueries like \"What was the due date for the invoice I received from Peter?\"\ncan now be handled by your RAG system.\n\n## GitHub Search Example\n\nBelow is an example where we're searching for GitHub issues that contain bugs,\nfeature requests, pull requests, investigations, and questions. The query is\n\u201cfirst cohere embeddings PR\u201d, and it contains a time aspect (first), a\nsemantic subject (cohere embeddings), and then the type (PR -> Pull Request).\n\nOn the right, we see that the dense embedding models do not fulfill the\nrequest for the \u201cfirst Cohere embeddings PR.\u201d In the first search result, it\ngets the PR type right but wrong subject and wrong time. The second search\nresult gets the subject right but not the time or type. And the third result\nreturns the wrong subject, wrong type, and wrong time.\n\nCompass on the left was able to correctly disentangle the multiple aspects\n(time, subject, type) in the search query and return the right pull request.\n\n## Join the Private Beta\n\nDo you have some multi-aspect data and want to test our newest Compass model?\nCompass is still in a private beta, but we are seeking partners to test the\nsystem and give us feedback.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be involved in early testing, please sign up for our beta and\nwe will be in touch.\n\nKeep reading\n\nRobin Gainer, Kosta Starostin \u2014 Apr 12, 2024\n\n## How LLMs Can Boost Legal Productivity (with Accuracy and Privacy)\n\n  * For Business\n\nRead full article\n\nSylvie Shi, Nils Reimers \u2014 Apr 11, 2024\n\n## Introducing Rerank 3: A New Foundation Model for Efficient Enterprise\nSearch & Retrieval\n\n  * Product\n  * Developers\n\nRead full article\n\nAidan Gomez \u2014 Apr 04, 2024\n\n## Introducing Command R+: A Scalable LLM Built for Business\n\n  * Newsroom\n  * Product\n\nRead full article\n\nCohere \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
