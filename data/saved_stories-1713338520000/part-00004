On average in that time, the\nreport found, millionaires were paying an effective tax rate of 50.1 percent.\n\nBy contrast, in 2021, the latest year for which data is available,\nmillionaires were paying an average effective tax rate of 26.2 percent, while\nhouseholds with incomes over $10 million paid an average rate of 25.1 percent.\nSince data on the $10 million income households became available in the early\n2000s, their effective tax rate has always been slightly lower than households\nwith income over $1 million, likely due to a larger portion of income coming\nfrom investments, the group found.\n\nAs a result, the federal government is missing out on billions in tax revenue.\nIf households with $10 million in income were being taxed at the same average\ntax rate as millionaires paid in the mid-20th century, the federal government\nwould have collected an additional $370 billion in tax revenue in 2021 alone,\naccording to the report.\n\nThe downturn in the effective tax rate on the wealthy began in the 1980s, when\na wave of neoliberalism began shifting power and wealth away from the working\nclass and toward corporations and the rich. Over the course of just a decade,\nAmericans for Tax Fairness found, the effective tax rate went from roughly 50\npercent to roughly 25 percent, a rate that it has hovered around ever since.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nWar & Peace\n\n## How Are US Tax Dollars Being Spent?

While 22 percent of federal revenue came from corporate taxes\non average between 1945 and 1980, this proportion dropped to 10 percent in\n1981, the year that Ronald Reagan took office, and has hovered around that\nsame rate ever since.\n\n\u201cAmericans filing their taxes today may have a strong sense that the richest\nhouseholds and most powerful corporations aren\u2019t paying their fair share \u2014 and\nthey\u2019re right,\u201d said David Kass, executive director of Americans for Tax\nFairness, in a statement. \u201cThe plummeting tax rate on million-dollar incomes\nshows how the tax code has become skewed in favor of the wealthy and\ncorporations and against the interests of working families.\u201d\n\n> The top 1% now account for 30% of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n>\n> The top 10% account for 67%.\n>\n> It's been forty years since \"trickle-down economics\" began.\n>\n> It's not trickling down, it's trickling up.\n>\n> Tax the rich. pic.twitter.com/ZBB4FhNvdS\n>\n> \u2014 Americans For Tax Fairness (@4TaxFairness) April 15, 2024\n\nThe slashing of the tax rate for the wealthy has caused wealth inequality to\nsurge, especially in recent years following the 2017 Donald Trump tax cuts.\nAnother recent Americans for Tax Fairness report found that billionaires have\nbenefited massively from the Trump tax cuts, with the U.S.\u2019s 806 billionaires\u2019\ncollective wealth hitting an all-time high this month of $5.8 trillion. This\nis double the amount of wealth they controlled in 2017, the year the bill was\npassed, and amounts to 1 in every 25 dollars of American wealth.\n\nAmericans for Tax Fairness suggests a number of tax code reforms in order to\nmake tax rates more equitable, including raising the estate tax, statutory tax\nrates for high-income households, ending benefits for offshore tax havens, and\nmore.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
