The nature walks he took under\nthe tutelage of his third grade teacher, Mr. Moore, entranced him. \u201cWe got to\ninteract and engage with wildlife and see animals in their native\nenvironment,\u201d he recalled. Abdus-Saboor also brought a menagerie of creatures\n\u2014 cats, dogs, lizards, snakes and turtles \u2014 into his three-story home, and\nsaved up his allowance to buy a magazine that taught him about turtles. When\nadults asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, \u201cI said I wanted to\nbecome a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cI always raised eyebrows.\u201d\n\nAbdus-Saboor did not stray from that goal. Today, he is an associate professor\nof biological sciences at the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior\nInstitute at Columbia University, where he studies how the brain determines\nwhether a touch to the skin is painful or pleasurable. \u201cAlthough this question\nis fundamental to the human experience, it remains puzzling to explain with\nsatisfying molecular detail,\u201d he said. Because the skin is our largest sensory\norgan and a major conduit to our environment, it may hold clues for treating\nconditions from chronic pain to depression.\n\nTo find those clues, Abdus-Saboor probes the nervous system at every juncture\nalong the skin-to-brain axis. He does not focus on skin alone or home in on\nonly the brain as many others do. \u201cWe merge these two worlds,\u201d he said. That\napproach, he added, requires mastering two sets of techniques, reading two\nsets of literature and attending two sets of scientific meetings. \u201cIt gives us\na unique leg up,\u201d he said. It has led to a landmark paper published last year\nin Cell that laid out the entire neural circuit for pleasurable touch.\n\nAbdus-Saboor has also pioneered a new quantitative measure of pain in mice, a\ntool he and his team adapted to gather evidence for the transgenerational\ninheritance of opioid addiction. His results in rodents hint that excessive\nparental opioid use may alter gene expression in ways that put children at\nrisk for the same.\n\nA recipient of numerous awards for his accomplishments, Abdus-Saboor was named\nto the inaugural class of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Freeman\nHrabowski scholars last May. The award provides up to $8.6 million over a\ndecade to rising-star early-career researchers whose labs foster diversity and\ninclusion.\n\nQuanta spoke with Abdus-Saboor about his penchant for starting over in\nscience, his zebra fish eureka moment and his hopes for a newly imported naked\nmole rat colony. The interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nTo quantify precisely how much pain or pleasure lab animals experience during\nexperiments, Abdus-Saboor explained, he has often had to build new measurement\ntools from scratch. \u201cI like charting new courses.\u201d\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\n### When you were a child, did your parents support your interest in science?\n\nThey certainly did. I would start to get animals as birthday presents because\nthey saw how fascinated I was with them. Fast-forward to high school. In ninth\ngrade, my parents allowed me to take over the third floor of our house for the\nyearlong science fair project I was doing for honors biology. I had hundreds\nof crayfish everywhere. My parents are not scientists, but they were very\nsupportive of my escapades and adventures in the scientific realm.\n\n### What do your parents do?\n\nMy mother is chief financial officer at an accounting firm. My dad was an\nactuary before he retired. So I may have inherited a mathematical bent. To\napproximate an animal\u2019s pain, we do statistical modeling to condense its\nbehavioral features into a single easy-to-read scale. My dad has come to some\nof my talks, and although the biology is often over his head, he gets super\nexcited about the math part of my work.\n\n### How did college shape your career?\n\nI attended an historically black college, North Carolina A&T. I come from a\nlineage of people who attended these sorts of universities. My parents\nattended Howard University. So did my aunt. An uncle attended Virginia State,\nmy grandfather Lincoln University. I don\u2019t know if I had a choice but to\nattend one of these universities.\n\nStill, I think it was a wise decision. It increased my self-confidence to see\npeople who looked like me really doing well. And the culture of the college is\nnurturing, not competitive. Faculty members care about you. Students work\ntogether and want to see each other succeed.\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\nEarly in his career, Abdus-Saboor was drawn to neuroscience, which seemed to\nbe entering a \u201cgolden age,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like there were still more\nquestions than answers, so there was space for me to make an impact.\u201d\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Did you do research in college?\n\nYes. I knew research experience was important, so for my first month on\ncampus, I went door to door asking faculty for research opportunities. I got\nhired to work on a pig farm. It\u2019s funny because I don\u2019t eat pork, but I was\nstudying whether a change in the pigs\u2019 diet altered the taste of their meat.\n\nAt the time, I was flirting with the idea of becoming a veterinarian. So in my\nsophomore year, I worked in veterinary hospitals, spaying, neutering and\ncleaning animals. That\u2019s when I realized that the thrill I felt as a kid with\nscience wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t in love with that work.\n\nBut between junior and senior year, I worked in a molecular biology lab at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, and a lightbulb went off. I thought, \u201cWow, people\nget paid to think about big ideas and try to find solutions to problems with\nimportance to human health.\u201d I remember telling my parents, \u201cThis is it. I\nwant to get a Ph.D. in molecular biology.\u201d\n\n### What led you to study pleasure and pain?\n\nIt was a bit of a winding road. I got my Ph.D. at the University of\nPennsylvania studying a molecular pathway in roundworms that\u2019s involved in\ncellular development. The genes for the proteins in this pathway are mutated\nin at least 30% of human cancers. My work demonstrated how these pathways\ncontrol the basic type and shape of a cell. I was the first in that lab to\nstudy that pathway, so I had to build a lot of tools from scratch. That\u2019s been\na theme throughout my career: I like charting new courses.\n\n### And the next course you charted took you to neuroscience. Why?\n\nNeuroscience seemed to be in its golden age. People from various disciplines\nwere coming together to study the brain, yet it seemed like there were still\nmore questions than answers, so there was space for me to make an impact. I\nmoved into sensory neuroscience in part because of its logical simplicity:\nReceptors in the skin become activated, and then you somehow get perception in\nthe brain after a series of relays. Of the sensory systems, touch is the least\nstudied. Some of the big questions are still open.\n\n### How did you make up for your lack of knowledge?\n\nAt first, I was insecure about my lack of formal training. As a postdoc I had\nnever taken a neuroscience class. At meetings and in conversations with\nneuroscientists, I often found I couldn\u2019t keep up. I didn\u2019t know the lingo.\nBut I had been meeting regularly with Michael Nusbaum, the director of\nbiomedical research at Penn, after asking him to mentor me. One day in his\noffice, he suggested he tutor me in neuroscience. For two hours a week for\nover a year, we\u2019d discuss neuroscience papers, starting back in the 1970s and\n1980s. I learned neuroscience that way. It emboldened me to say, \u201cOK, I am a\nneuroscientist.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m African American. Mikey Nusbaum is a white Jewish man from New York City.\nSometimes the people in life who support you the most may not have any direct\nconnection to you and your culture.\n\nThough he has sometimes faced racism, Abdus-Saboor appreciates the network of\nsupport that has always been there for him. \u201cSometimes the people in life who\nsupport you the most may not have any direct connection to you and your\nculture,\u201d he said.\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\n### How did you come up with your pain scale?\n\nFor my work in pain, I took a step back. If we were going to use mice to study\npain and potentially develop new painkillers, we first needed to answer the\nquestion: How do we know the animal is experiencing pain? Traditionally,\nresearchers look at how often an animal withdraws its paw from a stimulus, but\nanimals move their paws for all sorts of reasons. And because there was no\nstandardization, different labs would decide that the same stimulus was\ninnocuous, painful or very painful depending on the experiment. So I said, \u201cWe\nneed to develop a whole new system.\u201d\n\n### How did you get the idea for that?\n\nI got the idea from Michael Granato, a Penn neuroscientist whose lab was near\nours. He was studying the acoustic startle response in larval zebra fish. I\nwent to a lab meeting in which Roshan Jain, then a postdoc in the Granato lab\nand now faculty at Haverford College, talked about the use of high-speed\nvideography to capture response movements that are too rapid to appreciate\nwith the naked eye. I realized that we could use the same approach to record\nan animal\u2019s movements in response to a skin stimulus, and use those movements\nto approximate the animal\u2019s pain. That opened up a whole new world.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t gone to that meeting with the zebra fish scientist, I would have\nnever gotten this idea. I still go to talks and listen to people talk about\nworms, flies, fish, yeast, bacteria \u2014 you name it \u2014 because maybe I\u2019ll learn\nsomething I can integrate into the work that we do. The shame of modern\nscience is that everyone is hyperfocused on their system, their approach,\ntheir organism, their discipline. It can stifle innovation when people are not\nbroadly trained and don\u2019t step outside their comfort zone.\n\n### How did you connect a mouse\u2019s movements to its experience to create a\nscale for measuring pain?\n\nFirst, we verified that a stimulus deemed innocuous, like the touch of a soft\nmakeup brush, activated touch neurons in the animal\u2019s skin, and that a needle\npricking the skin activated pain neurons. Then we recorded the animal\u2019s\nresponse movements to each stimulus. For pain, the animal would grimace,\nquickly withdraw its paw and shake it vigorously. We gave a numerical value to\neach type of movement, the speed of withdrawal and the number of paw shakes.\nWe then gave each number a numerical weight, an eigenvalue, based on how\nimportant the feature was to the pain level, and then combined the weighted\nvalues into a single quantitative measure of pain.\n\nAbdus-Saboor is critical of the current tendency for researchers to focus on\ntheir own systems to the exclusion of others. \u201cIt can stifle innovation when\npeople ... don\u2019t step outside their comfort zone.\u201d\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\n### How do you see this new tool being used?\n\nThere are two things we are very excited about. One is studying genetic\nvariability as a driver of pain. The global human population has widely\nvarying pain sensitivities. Some of that is sociocultural, but some of it is\nin the DNA. For instance, people who don\u2019t feel any pain whatsoever have\ngenetic mutations that underlie that trait. In my lab, we\u2019ve used our pain\nscale to measure the pain sensitivities of about 20 different mouse strains.\nWe have identified mice that don\u2019t respond much to pain and others that are\nhypersensitive. We are using genetic mapping approaches to find new genes that\nmay underlie this pain sensitivity.\n\nWe are also super excited about how the brain controls the transition from\nacute to chronic pain. We use our pain scale to measure the pain level in a\nmouse and then take a snapshot of the mouse\u2019s brain activity using functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging. We image the animals every day to find brain\nactivity patterns that underlie the transition from acute to chronic pain.\nOnce we find them, we can try to change them to alter the course of chronic\npain. We\u2019re interested in the emotional as well as sensory components of this\npain.\n\n### Have you studied touch that is not painful as well?\n\nYes, in our recent Cell paper, we went from the skin to the brain to explain\nwhy some forms of touch are rewarding.\n\n### It\u2019s amazing that hadn\u2019t been done before.\n\nThe molecular study of touch is still in its relative infancy. The molecular\nfeatures of the different classes of touch neurons were only identified in the\nlate 2000s. Since then, a lot of the focus has been on discriminative touch,\nthe kind of touch used to discriminate a quarter from a dime based on texture.\nSocial stroking touch has been vastly under-studied.\n\n### How did this project get started?\n\nDavid Anderson\u2019s group at the California Institute of Technology had reported\nin 2013 that certain cells in the skin responded to gentle touch. But they\nhadn\u2019t implicated those cells in any natural behavior or made a connection to\nthe brain. I read the paper and decided to try to fill these gaps. In my final\nyear as a postdoc, I genetically engineered mice to have gentle touch neurons\nthat responded to blue light. My plan was to stimulate the neurons with blue\nlight and see what the mice did.\n\nWhen I started my own lab in 2018, we were ready to start those experiments. I\nstill remember the day the students came into my office to show me what they\nhad found. It was like this eureka moment. When we activated neurons through\nthe skin on the mice\u2019s backs, the animals behaved as if they were being\nstroked there. That launched the whole project. We did a lot more behavioral\ntests and traced the pathway for social touch from the skin to the spinal cord\nto the reward centers in the brain.\n\n\u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d Abdus-Saboor said. He encourages young researchers not\nto let disappointments bring them down. \u201cDon\u2019t crush your own dreams.\u201d\n\nSasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Does finding this skin-to-brain pathway have any medical implications?\n\nYes, the skin is a good therapeutic target. It\u2019s accessible and presents a\ndirect highway to the part of the brain that makes us feel good. What if we\ncould turn on these neurons with a skin cream to improve mental health \u2014 say,\nto offset the harm caused by social isolation or to treat anxiety or\ndepression? When I gave a talk about this in December, the psychiatrists and\nneuropharmacologists in the audience were very enthusiastic about the\ntherapeutic potential.\n\n### You have a colony of naked mole rats. What are you doing with them?\n\nNaked mole rats hail from East Africa. They live underground and are\nessentially blind, relying heavily on touch, using whisker-like hairs to\nnavigate their burrows and interact with each other. Touch occupies an area of\ntheir brain three times larger than in other mammals. We believe touch is\nimportant for shaping their communal social structure.\n\nWe\u2019re also interested in them because mole rats do not feel some forms of\npain. For example, they show no pain response to the molecule capsaicin, the\nactive ingredient in hot peppers, which is quite painful to most mammals. They\nhave receptors in their skin that respond to capsaicin, so I hypothesize that\nthe animals have brain pathways that shut down the pain. If we can find and\ntap into those signals, we might find a new way to block pain.\n\n### As a young researcher, what hurdles have you had to overcome, whether\nscientific, social or cultural?\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve been quite fortunate to have had mentors and colleagues of all\nraces, nationalities and genders who believed in me and supported me. I\u2019ve\nbeen more fortunate than some other underrepresented minorities who\u2019ve worked\nin really challenging environments, and because of that, they\u2019re not here\ntoday.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### Scientists Reveal Structure of Pain Sensor\n\n  2. ### Medicine Nobel Prize Goes to Temperature and Touch Discoveries\n\n  3. ### Emery Brown and the Truth About Anesthesia\n\nThat said, I haven\u2019t gone through unscathed. University police have stopped me\nand harassed me because they did not think I belonged on the campus. I\u2019ve been\nstopped in my own building, and authorities have been called on me. Most other\nBlack scientists I know have had very similar experiences. These things happen\nnot just at the university but also in the neighborhood I live in, and when\nthey do, they don\u2019t feel good and can provoke anger and frustration. But I\u2019ve\nalways had a network of people who support me and have helped me push though\nthe relatively few times in my career where I\u2019ve experienced that sort of\novert racism.\n\n### Do you have advice for aspiring Black scientists?\n\nThe sky is the limit. Don\u2019t be embittered if you look around and don\u2019t see a\nlot of people who look like you, because that\u2019s changing. Surround yourself\nwith good people. Sometimes these folks will look like you, but don\u2019t be\nsurprised if some of your biggest supporters don\u2019t. Be open and make the right\nconnections.\n\nAnd don\u2019t crush your own dreams. We need people from all backgrounds, all\nwalks of life, because we have challenging problems in front of us. I would\nencourage Black scientists or any person who\u2019s interested in this work: If you\nhave a love and passion for it, go for it.\n\nBy Ingrid Wickelgren\n\nContributing Writer\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologyneuroscienceperceptionQ&AAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Biology\n\nviruses\n\n### Viruses Finally Reveal Their Complex Social Life\n\nBy Carl Zimmer\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nneuroscience\n\n### Overexposure Distorted the Science of Mirror Neurons\n\nBy Meghan Willcoxon\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nneuroscience\n\n### The Social Benefits of Getting Our Brains in Sync\n\nBy Marta Zaraska\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
