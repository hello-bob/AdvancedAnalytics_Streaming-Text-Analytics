to post sixth straight losing day as Nvidia\ncraters 10%: Live updates\n\nAlex Harring\n\nYun Li\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 29, 2024.\n\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell for a sixth straight session on Friday, notching its\nlongest losing streak in more than a year. The downtrend comes as Nvidia\ndived, adding to recent market woes tied to geopolitical conflicts and sticky\ninflation.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq pulled back 2.05% to 15,282.01, while the broad S&P 500\nslipped 0.88% to 4,967.23, below the 5,000 level. Both clinched their sixth\nstraight negative days, streaks not seen for either since October 2022.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 211.02 points, or 0.56%, to finish at\n37,986.40. The 30-stock index was lifted by a rally of more than 6% in\nAmerican Express following earnings.\n\nNetflix retreated more than 9% even after quarterly earnings beat on the top\nand bottom lines. The streamer\u2019s subscribers jumped 16% from the previous\nyear, but it said it would no longer report paid memberships starting in 2025.\n\nChip stocks were also under increasing pressure in afternoon trading, a sign\nthat investors were rotating heavily out of the sector that led the bull\nmarket. Nvidia slipped 10%, registering its worst day since March 2020. Super\nMicro Computer plunged more than 23%.\n\nWhile tech put downward pressure on the market, investor concerns over\nintensification of the Middle East conflict following Israel\u2019s limited strike\non Iran appeared largely shaken off by Friday\u2019s open.\n\nOil prices briefly spiked more than 3%, but swung between more modest gains\nand losses in the hours since. Dow futures at one point fell more than 500\npoints overnight amid fears that the attack was enough to spark a broader war.\n\n\u201cThere was a relief sigh\u201d as investors realized Israel\u2019s response was \u201cmuted\u201d\nand designed to minimize escalation, said George Ball, chairman of Sanders\nMorris.\n\nStill, \u201cinvestors are very much on edge,\u201d Ball said. \u201cInvestors are much more\naware of geopolitical risks today in their decision-making than they have been\nfor a long time.\u201d\n\n### A tough week\n\nThose moves come as the S&P 500 posted its worst weekly performance since\nMarch 2023 amid growing fears around the path of inflation and monetary\npolicy.\n\nWith a loss of more than 3%, it was also the large-cap benchmark\u2019s third\nstraight negative week. A chunk of that downward pressure came from tech\nstocks, as the sector was the worst performing in the S&P 500 in both the day\nand week.\n\nThe S&P 500 is now more than 5% off its 52-week high, part of a market\npullback that has been largely driven by tempered expectations for rate cuts\namid sticky prices. Economists and strategists now see the Federal Reserve\nwaiting until at least September to lower the cost of borrowing money.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of cross-currents that the market is working to digest,\u201d\nsaid Bill Northey, investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\nInflation \u201chas been a little bit more problematic than I believe the market\nexpected, or even what the Federal Reserve expected.\u201d\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell 5.5% this week. The tech-heavy index posted its\nfourth straight down week, its longest negative streak since December 2022. It\nalso marked the Nasdaq\u2019s worst weekly performance since November 2022.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s advance, the Dow eked out a gain of 0.01% for the week. That was\nits first positive week of the last three.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version misstated the date when the Nasdaq Composite\nhad its last four-week losing run. It was December 2022.\n\n39 Min Ago\n\n## S&P 500 and Nasdaq finish sixth straight down sessions\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished lower on Friday, marking their sixth\nstraight negative days.\n\nThe Nasdaq lost roughly 2.1%, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.9%. It marked the\nlongest losing streaks for each since October 2022.\n\nThe Dow closed Friday 0.6% higher. That pushed its weekly performance to a\n0.01% gain, making it the only one of the three major averages to finish in\nthe green.\n\n\u2014 Alex Harring\n\n55 Min Ago\n\n## Big Tech outperforming during pullback, Barclays says\n\nYou cannot blame Big Tech for the stock market rally losing its footing,\naccording to Barclays.\n\nStrategist Venu Krishna said in a note to clients Friday that the earnings\nstrength of the biggest tech stocks has somewhat insulated them in this\ndrawback.\n\n\u201cBig Tech has been more resilient than the rest of the tech sector through the\nMTD selloff, likely because Big Tech\u2019s gains were less dependent on multiple\nexpansion. Overall, losses have been more evenly distributed than gains,\u201d\nKrishna said.\n\n\u201c1Q earnings are the next overhang,\u201d Krishna added.\n\n\u2014 Jesse Pound\n\n1 Hour Ago\n\n## Wharton\u2019s Jeremy Siegel still sees two or three rate cuts by end of year\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel remains bullish on the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-\ncutting path, he told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe can all say at the beginning of the year the market was way optimistic\nwith four or five cuts. Now it\u2019s squeezed down to one. And I actually think\nthat we might get two or three cuts by the end of the year,\u201d Siegel said,\npointing out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that if the economy softens,\nthat is another reason to cut rates unless inflation is out of control.\n\nThe professor said he sees \u201cgood trends\u201d looking ahead to the personal\nconsumption expenditures data. He believes the Fed should cut interest rates\nif inflation goes down, even if the economy goes down, and said it would be\nthe \u201csuper best case\u201d for stocks going forward.\n\n\u2014 Pia Singh\n\n1 Hour Ago\n\n## Information technology stocks weigh on S&P 500\n\nMicron Technology\u2019s solid-state drive for data center customers is presented\nat a product launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 24, 2019.\n\nStephen Nellis | Reuters\n\nThe information technology sector dragged on the S&P 500 on Friday, extending\na trend seen this week.\n\nThe sector slid more than 2% on Friday, making it the worst performing of the\n11 that comprise the benchmark. By comparison, the broad index slipped less\nthan 1%.\n\nFor the whole week, the sector was also the biggest loser with a drop of more\nthan 6%. The S&P 500 as a whole lost less than 3%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer and Micron Technology led the sector into the red this\nweek, respectively diving more than 17% and 12%.
