A resonance fluorescence\nsignal is observed in two crystals with different Th-229 dopant\nconcentrations, while it is absent in a control experiment using Th-232. The\nnuclear resonance for the ions in Th: is measured at the wavelength\n148.3821(5) nm, frequency 2020.409(7) THz, and the fluorescence lifetime in\nthe crystal is 630(15) s, corresponding to an isomer half-life of 1740(50) s\nfor a nucleus isolated in vacuum. These results pave the way toward Th-229\nnuclear laser spectroscopy and realizing optical nuclear clocks.\n\n  * Received 5 February 2024\n  * Revised 12 March 2024\n  * Accepted 14 March 2024\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.182501\n\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The VUV source\nconsists of two cw lasers with the frequencies , , two pulsed dye amplifiers\nthat introduce frequency shifts due to Brillouin mirrors, a THG stage, and a\nxenon gas cell. The scanning is provided by tuning of the difference frequency\nvia . The spectroscopy vacuum chamber contains the Th-doped crystal mounted on\na cold finger, signal collection optics, and a PMT.

The measurement time between frequency steps is shorter than\nthe isomer decay time (see Fig. 3), which leads to an asymmetry in the\nresonance curves.
