This\nsuit created lingering suspicions that the defendants had in fact plotted to\ndismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States as an attempt\nto monopolize surface transportation.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, National City Lines and its subsidiaries, American City\nLines and Pacific City Lines\u2014with investment from GM, Firestone Tire, Standard\nOil of California (through a subsidiary), Federal Engineering, Phillips\nPetroleum, and Mack Trucks\u2014gained control of additional transit systems in\nabout 25 cities.^[a] Systems included St. Louis, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and\nOakland. NCL often converted streetcars to bus operations in that period,\nalthough electric traction was preserved or expanded in some locations. Other\nsystems, such as San Diego's, were converted by outgrowths of the City Lines.\nMost of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to\nmonopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses, fuel, and supplies to NCL\nsubsidiaries, but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the transit\nindustry.\n\nThe story as an urban legend has been written about by Martha Bianco, Scott\nBottles, Sy Adler, Jonathan Richmond,^[3] Cliff Slater,^[4] and Robert Post.\nIt has been depicted several times in print, film, and other media, notably in\nthe fictional film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, documentary films such as Taken\nfor a Ride and The End of Suburbia and the book Internal Combustion.^[not\nverified in body]\n\nOnly a handful of U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New Orleans, Newark,\nCleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Boston, have surviving legacy rail\nurban transport systems based on streetcars, although their systems are\nsignificantly smaller than they once were. Other cities, such as Washington\nDC, and Norfolk, have re-introduced streetcars.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Background[edit]\n\nFltr: Horse-drawn, electric, and cable street cars in the United States\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, transit systems were generally rail,\nfirst horse-drawn streetcars, and later electric powered streetcars and cable\ncars. Rail was more comfortable and had less rolling resistance than street\ntraffic on granite block or macadam and horse-drawn streetcars were generally\na step up from the horsebus. Electric traction was faster, more sanitary, and\ncheaper to run; with the cost, excreta, epizootic risk, and carcass disposal\nof horses eliminated entirely. Streetcars were later seen as obstructions to\ntraffic, but for nearly 20 years they had the highest power-to-weight ratio of\nanything commonly found on the road, and the lowest rolling resistance.\n\nStreetcars paid ordinary business and property taxes, but also generally paid\nfranchise fees, maintained at least the shared right-of-way, and provided\nstreet sweeping and snow clearance. They were also required to maintain\nminimal service levels. Many franchise fees were fixed or based on gross (v.\nnet); such arrangements, when combined with fixed fares, created gradual\nimpossible financial pressures.^[5] Early electric cars generally had a two-\nman crew, a holdover from horsecar days, which created financial problems in\nlater years as salaries outpaced revenues.^[6]\n\nMany electric lines\u2014especially in the West\u2014were tied into other real estate or\ntransportation enterprises. The Pacific Electric and the Los Angeles Railway\nwere especially so, in essence loss leaders for property development and long\nhaul shipping.^[7]\n\nBy 1918, half of US streetcar mileage was in bankruptcy.^[8]\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\nThe Menace of the Hour, 1899 illustration by George Luks depicting the new\nelectric subway system in New York City as an octopus (\"the menace\")\n\nJohn D. Hertz, better remembered for his car rental business, was also an\nearly motorbus manufacturer and operator. In 1917 he founded the Chicago Motor\nCoach Company, which operated buses in Chicago,^[9] and in 1923, he founded\nthe Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of buses. He then\nformed The Omnibus Corporation in 1926 with \"plans embracing the extension of\nmotor coach operation to urban and rural communities in every part of the\nUnited States\"^[10] that then purchased the Fifth Avenue Coach Company in New\nYork.^[11] The same year, the Fifth Avenue Coach Company acquired a majority\nof the stock in the struggling New York Railways Corporation^[12] (which had\nbeen bankrupted and reorganized at least twice). In 1926, General Motors\nacquired a controlling share of the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company and\nappointed Hertz as a main board director.^[13] Hertz's bus lines, however,\nwere not in direct competition with any streetcars, and his core business was\nthe higher-priced \"motor coach\".^[9]\n\nA Chicago Motor Coach Company double decker bus in 1936\n\nBy 1930, most streetcar systems were aging and losing money. Service to the\npublic was suffering; the Great Depression compounded this. Yellow Coach tried\nto persuade transit companies to replace streetcars with buses, but could not\npersuade the power companies that owned the streetcar operations to\nmotorize.^[14] GM decided to form a new subsidiary\u2014United Cities Motor\nTransport (UCMT)\u2014to finance the conversion of streetcar systems to buses in\nsmall cities. The new subsidiary made investments in small transit systems in\nKalamazoo and Saginaw, Michigan, and in Springfield, Ohio, where they were\nsuccessful in conversion to buses.^[14] UCMT then approached the Portland,\nOregon, system with a similar proposal.^[15] The UCMT was censured by the\nAmerican Transit Association and dissolved in 1935.^[16]\n\nThe New York Railways Corporation began conversion to buses in 1935, with the\nnew bus services being operated by the New York City Omnibus Corporation,\nwhich shared management with The Omnibus Corporation.^[17] During this period,\nGM worked with Public Service Transportation in New Jersey to develop the\n\"All-Service Vehicle\", a bus also capable of working as a trackless trolley,\nallowing off-wire passenger collection in areas too lightly populated to pay\nfor wire infrastructure.^[18]\n\nOpposition to traction interests and their influence on politicians was\ngrowing.^[dubious \u2013 discuss] For example, in 1922, New York Supreme Court\nJustice John Ford came out in favor of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper\nmagnate, for mayor of New York, complaining that Al Smith was too close to the\n\"traction interests\".^[19] In 1925, Hearst complained about Smith in a similar\nway.^[20]^[full citation needed] In the 1941 film Citizen Kane, the lead\ncharacter, who was loosely based on Hearst and Samuel Insull, complains about\nthe influence of the '\"traction interests\".^[21]^[22]\n\nThe Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which made it illegal for a\nsingle private business to both provide public transport and supply\nelectricity to other parties, forced electricity generator companies to divest\nfrom trolley, streetcar, electric suburban, and interurban transit operators\nthat they used to cross-subsidize in order to increase the basis of their\nlimited return on investment.^[citation needed]\n\n### National City Lines, Pacific City Lines, American City Lines[edit]\n\nIn 1936, National City Lines (NCL), which had been started in 1920 as a minor\nbus operation by E. Roy Fitzgerald and his brother,^[23] was reorganized \"for\nthe purpose of taking over the controlling interest in certain operating\ncompanies engaged in city bus transportation and overland bus transportation\"\nwith loans from the suppliers and manufacturers.^[14] In 1939, Roy Fitzgerald,\npresident of NCL, approached Yellow Coach Manufacturing, requesting additional\nfinancing for expansion.^[24] In the 1940s, NCL raised funds for expansion\nfrom Firestone Tire, Federal Engineering, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of\nCalifornia (now Chevron Corporation), Phillips Petroleum (now part of\nConocoPhillips), GM, and Mack Trucks (now a subsidiary of Volvo).^[24] Pacific\nCity Lines (PCL), formed as a subsidiary of NCL in 1938, was to purchase\nstreetcar systems in the western United States.^[25] PCL merged with NCL in\n1948.^[26] American City Lines (ACL), which had been organized to acquire\nlocal transportation systems in the larger metropolitan areas in various parts\nof the country in 1943, was merged with NCL in 1946.^[25] The federal\ngovernment investigated some aspects of NCL's financial arrangements in 1941\n(which calls into question the conspiracy myths' centrality of Quinby's 1946\nletter).^[27] By 1947, NCL owned or controlled 46 systems in 45 cities in 16\nstates.^[28]\n\nFrom 1939 through 1940, NCL or PCL attempted a hostile takeover of the Key\nSystem, which operated electric trains and streetcars in Oakland, California.\nThe attempt was temporarily blocked by a syndicate of Key System insiders,\nwith controlling interest secured on January 8, 1941.^[29] By 1946, PCL had\nacquired 64% of the stock in the Key System.^[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, NCL and PCL slowly took control of Los Angeles' two\nstreetcar systems: Pacific Electric Railway (known as the \"Red Cars\") and Los\nAngeles Railway (known as the \"Yellow Cars\"). In 1940, PCL acquired Pacific\nElectric's operations in Glendale, Burbank, and Pasadena.^[30] Lines to San\nBernardino were phased out in 1941 and the Hollywood Subway, which ran lines\nfrom Burbank, Glendale, and the San Fernando Valley, closed in 1955.^[31]^[32]\nIn 1945, ACL acquired Los Angeles Railway at a price of about\n$13,000,000.^[33]^[34] Soon after, the company announced it would scrap all\nbut three of the existing Yellow Car lines.^[33]\n\nIn 1953, the remainder of Pacific Electric's network was sold to Metropolitan\nCity Lines, a subsidiary of PCL.^[34]^[35] Subsequently, the remaining assets\nof the original Pacific Electric system and the original Los Angeles Railway\nsystem were sold by Metropolitan City Lines and Los Angeles Transit Lines,\nrespectively, to the newly formed Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit\nAuthority.^[36] Under the new public authority, the final remaining streetcars\nin Los Angeles were phased out, with the final Red Car (Los Angeles to Long\nBeach Line) making its last service on April 9, 1961 and the last Yellow Car\n(V Line) on March 31, 1963.^[37]^[38]\n\n### Edwin J. Quinby[edit]\n\nIn 1946, Edwin Jenyss Quinby, an activated reserve commander,^[citation\nneeded] founder of the Electric Railroaders' Association in 1934 (which\nlobbied on behalf of rail users and services),^[39] and former employee of\nNorth Jersey Rapid Transit (which operated into New York State), published a\n24-page \"expose\" on the ownership of National City Lines addressed to \"The\nMayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The\nCommittee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of\nYour Community\". It began, \"This is an urgent warning to each and every one of\nyou that there is a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out\nof your most important and valuable public utilities\u2013your Electric Railway\nSystem\".^[40] His activism may have led Federal authorities to prosecute GM\nand the other companies.^[41]\n\nHe also questioned who was behind the creation of the Public Utility Holding\nCompany Act of 1935, which had caused such difficulty for streetcar\noperations,^[42] He was later to write a history of North Jersey Rapid\nTransit.^[43]^[full citation needed]\n\n### Court cases, conviction, and fines[edit]\n\nOn April 9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals (officers and\ndirectors of certain of the corporate defendants) were indicted in the Federal\nDistrict Court of Southern California on counts of \"conspiring to acquire\ncontrol of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopoly\"\nand \"conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned\nby National City Lines\"^[44] In 1948, the venue was changed from the Federal\nDistrict Court of Southern California to the Federal District Court in\nNorthern Illinois following an appeal to the United States Supreme Court (in\nUnited States v. National City Lines Inc.)^[45] which felt that there was\nevidence of conspiracy to monopolize the supply of buses and supplies.^[46]\n\nIn 1949, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, GM,\nand Mack Trucks were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses\nand related products to local transit companies controlled by NCL; they were\nacquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. The\nverdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951.^[47] GM was fined $5,000 (equivalent\nto $59,000 in 2023) and GM treasurer H.C. Grossman was fined $1.^[48] The\ntrial judge said \"I am very frank to admit to counsel that after a very\nexhaustive review of the entire transcript in this case, and of the exhibits\nthat were offered and received in evidence, that I might not have come to the\nsame conclusion as the jury came to were I trying this case without a\njury,\"^[2] explicitly noting that he might not himself have convicted in a\nbench trial.\n\nIn 1948, the San Diego Electric Railway was sold to Western Transit Company,\nowned by J. L. Haugh, for $5.5 million.^[49] Haugh was also president of the\nKey System, and later was involved in Metropolitan Coach Line's purchase of\nthe passenger operations of the Pacific Electric Railway. The last San Diego\nstreetcars were converted to buses by 1949.^[50] Haugh sold the bus-based San\nDiego system to the city in 1966.^[51]\n\nThe Baltimore Streetcar system operated by the Baltimore Transit Company was\npurchased by NCL in 1948 and started converting the system to buses. Overall\nBaltimore Transit ridership then plummeted by double digits in each of the\nfollowing three years.^[52] The Pacific Electric Railway's struggling\npassenger operations were purchased by Metropolitan Coach Lines in 1953 and\nwere taken into public ownership in 1958 after which the last routes were\nconverted to bus operation.^[citation needed]^[53]\n\n### Urban Mass Transportation Act and 1974 Antitrust hearings[edit]\n\nThe Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (UMTA) created the Urban Mass\nTransit Administration with a remit to \"conserve and enhance values in\nexisting urban areas\" noting that \"our national welfare therefore requires the\nprovision of good urban transportation, with the properly balanced use of\nprivate vehicles and modern mass transport to help shape as well as serve\nurban growth\". Funding for transit was increased with the Urban Mass\nTransportation Act of 1970 and further extended by the National Mass\nTransportation Assistance Act (1974) which allowed funds to support transit\noperating costs as well as capital construction costs.^[citation needed]\n\nIn 1970, Harvard Law student Robert Eldridge Hicks began working on the Ralph\nNader Study Group Report on Land Use in California, alleging a wider\nconspiracy to dismantle U.S. streetcar systems, first published in Politics of\nLand: Ralph Nader's Study Group Report on Land Use in California.^[54]^[full\ncitation needed]\n\nDuring 1973, Bradford Snell, an attorney with Pillsbury, Madison and\nSutro^[55] and formerly, for a brief time, a scholar with the Brookings\nInstitution, prepared a controversial and disputed paper titled \"American\nground transport: a proposal for restructuring the automobile, truck, bus, and\nrail industries.\"^[56] The paper, which was funded by the Stern Fund, was\nlater described as the centerpiece of the hearings.^[57] In it, Snell said\nthat General Motors was \"a sovereign economic state\" and said that the company\nplayed a major role in the displacement of rail and bus transportation by\nbuses and trucks.^[58]\n\nThis paper was distributed in Senate binding together with an accompanying\nstatement in February 1974, implying that the contents were the considered\nviews of the Senate.^[59] The chair of the committee later apologized for this\nerror.^[60] Adding to the confusion, Snell had already joined the Senate\nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly as a staff\nmember.^[61]\n\nAt the hearings in April 1974, San Francisco mayor and antitrust attorney\nJoseph Alioto testified that \"General Motors and the automobile industry\ngenerally exhibit a kind of monopoly evil\", adding that GM \"has carried on a\ndeliberate concerted action with the oil companies and tire companies...for\nthe purpose of destroying a vital form of competition; namely, electric rapid\ntransit\". Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley also testified, saying that GM,\nthrough its subsidiaries (namely PCL), \"scrapped the Pacific Electric and Los\nAngeles streetcar systems leaving the electric train system totally\ndestroyed\".^[62] Neither mayor, nor Snell himself, pointed out that the two\ncities were major parties to a lawsuit against GM which Snell himself had been\n\"instrumental in bringing\";^[63] all had a direct or indirect financial\ninterest. (The lawsuit was eventually dropped, the plaintiffs conceding they\nhad no chance of winning.)^[citation needed]\n\nHowever, George Hilton, a professor of economics at UCLA and noted transit\nscholar^[64]^[full citation needed] rejected Snell's view, stating, \"I would\nargue that these [Snell's] interpretations are not correct, and, further, that\nthey couldn't possibly be correct, because major conversions in society of\nthis character\u2014from rail to free wheel urban transportation, and from steam to\ndiesel railroad propulsion\u2014are the sort of conversions which could come about\nonly as a result of public preferences, technological change, the relative\nabundance of natural resources, and other impersonal phenomena or influence,\nrather than the machinations of a monopolist.\"^[65]^[full citation\nneeded]^[66]\n\nGM published a rebuttal the same year titled \"The Truth About American Ground\nTransport\". The Senate subcommittee printed GM's work in tandem with Snell's\nas an appendix to the hearings transcript. GM explicitly did not address the\nspecific allegations that were sub judice.^[63]^[67]\n\n### Role in decline of the streetcars[edit]\n\nQuinby and Snell held that the destruction of streetcar systems was integral\nto a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency.\nMost transit scholars disagree, suggesting that transit system changes were\nbrought about by other factors; economic, social, and political factors such\nas unrealistic capitalization, fixed fares during inflation, changes in paving\nand automotive technology, the Great Depression, antitrust action, the Public\nUtility Holding Company Act of 1935, labor unrest, market forces including\ndeclining industries' difficulty in attracting capital, rapidly increasing\ntraffic congestion, the Good Roads Movement, urban sprawl, tax policies\nfavoring private vehicle ownership, taxation of fixed infrastructure,\nfranchise repair costs for co-located property, wide diffusion of driving\nskills, automatic transmission buses, and general enthusiasm for the\nautomobile.^[b]\n\nThe accuracy of significant elements of Snell's 1974 testimony was challenged\nin an article published in Transportation Quarterly in 1997 by Cliff\nSlater.^[55] A significant rebuttal to Slater's article was published about\none year later in the 1998 Transportation Quarterly finding that, without GM\nand other companies' efforts, the streetcar would not \"have been driven to the\nverge of extinction by 1968\".^[68]\n\nRecent journalistic analysis question the idea that GM had a significant\nimpact on the decline of streetcars, suggesting rather that they were setting\nthemselves up to take advantage of the decline as it occurred. Guy Span\nsuggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic conspiracy theory\nthinking, bordering on paranoid delusions^[69] stating,\n\n> Clearly, GM waged a war on electric traction. It was indeed an all out\n> assault, but by no means the single reason for the failure of rapid transit.\n> Also, it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government\n> contributed significantly to the elimination of electric traction.\"^[70]\n\nIn 2010, CBS's Mark Henricks reported:^[71]\n\n> There is no question that a GM-controlled entity called National City Lines\n> did buy a number of municipal trolley car systems. And it's beyond doubt\n> that, before too many years went by, those street car operations were closed\n> down. It's also true that GM was convicted in a post-war trial of conspiring\n> to monopolize the market for transportation equipment and supplies sold to\n> local bus companies. What's not true is that the explanation for these\n> events is a nefarious plot to trade private corporate profits for viable\n> public transportation.\n\n## Other factors[edit]\n\nOther factors have been cited as reasons for the general decline of streetcars\nand public transport in the United States. Robert Post notes that the ultimate\nreach of GM's alleged conspiracy extended to only about 10% of American\ntransit systems.^[72] Guy Span said that actions and inaction by government\nwas one of many contributing factors in the elimination of electric\ntraction.^[70] Cliff Slater suggested that the regulatory framework in the US\nactually protected the electric streetcars for longer than would have been the\ncase if there was less regulation.^[73]\n\nSome regulations and regulatory changes have been linked directly to the\ndecline of the streetcars:\n\n  * Difficult labor relations and tight regulation of fares, routes, and schedules took their toll on city streetcar systems.^[74]\n  * The streetcars' contracts in many cities required them to keep the pavement on the roads surrounding the tracks in good shape. Such conditions, previously agreed to in exchange for the explicit right to operate as a monopoly in that city, became an expensive burden.^[75]\n  * The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 prohibited regulated electric utilities from operating unregulated businesses, which included most streetcar lines. The act also placed restrictions on services operating across state lines. Many holding companies operated both streetcars and electric utilities across several states; those that owned both types of businesses were forced to sell off one.^[76] Declining streetcar business was often somewhat less valuable than the growing consumer electric business, resulting in many streetcar systems being put up for sale.^[77] The independent lines, no longer associated with an electric utility holding company, had to purchase electricity at full price from their former parents, further shaving their already thin margins.^[78] The Great Depression then left many streetcar operators short of funds for maintenance and capital improvements.^[79]\n  * In New York City, and other North American cities, the presence of restrictive legal agreements such as the Dual Contracts, signed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation of the New York City Subway, restricted the ability of private mass transit operators to increase fares at a time of high inflation, allowed the city to take over them, or to operate competing subsidized transit.^[80]\n\nDifferent funding models have also been highlighted:\n\n  * Streetcar lines were built using funds from private investors and were required to pay numerous taxes and dividends. By contrast, new roads were constructed and maintained by the government from tax income.^[81]^[82]\n  * By 1916, street railroads nationwide were wearing out their equipment faster than they were replacing it. While operating expenses were generally recovered, money for long-term investment was generally diverted elsewhere.^[citation needed]\n  * The U.S. government responded to the Great Depression with massive subsidies for road construction.^[81]\n  * Later construction of the Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 which approved the expenditure of $25 billion of public money for the creation of a new 41,000 miles (66,000 km) interstate road network.^[82] Streetcar operators were occasionally required to pay for the reinstatement of their lines following the construction of the freeways.^[83]^[failed verification]\n  * Federal fuel taxes, introduced in 1956, were paid into a new Highway Trust Fund which could only fund highway construction (until 1983 when some 10% was diverted into a new Mass Transit Account).^[74]\n\nOther issues which made it harder to operate viable streetcar services\ninclude:\n\n  * Suburbanization and urban sprawl, exacerbated in the US by white flight,^[52] created low-density land use patterns which are not easily served by streetcars, or indeed by any public transport, to this day.^[84]^[85]\n  * Increased traffic congestion often reduced service speeds and thereby increased their operational costs and made the services less attractive to the remaining users.^[86]^[87]^[88]\n  * More recently it has been suggested that the provision of free parking facilities at destinations and in the center of cities loads all users with the cost of facilities enjoyed only by motorists, creating additional traffic congestion and significantly affects the viability of other transport modes.^[89]\n\n## Counterarguments[edit]\n\nSome of the specific allegations which have been argued over the years\ninclude:\n\n  * According to Snell's testimony, the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (NH) in New York and Connecticut was profitable until it was acquired and converted to diesel trains.^[90] The New Haven's main line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, remained electrified, and continues as such under Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. In reality, the line was in financial difficulty for years and filed for bankruptcy in 1935.^[91]\n  * \"GM killed the New York street cars\":^[90] In reality, the New York Railways Company entered receivership in 1919,^[92] six years before it was bought by the New York Railways Corporation.^[93]\n  * \"GM Killed the Red cars in Los Angeles\":^[90] Pacific Electric Railway (which operated the \"red cars\") was hemorrhaging routes as traffic congestion worsened with growing car ownership levels after the end of World War II.^[94]^[95]\n  * The Salt Lake City system is mentioned in the 1949 court papers. However, the city's system was purchased by National City Lines in 1944 when all but one route had already been withdrawn, and the withdrawal of this last line had been approved three years earlier.^[citation needed]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Transport portal\n  * Companies portal\n  * United States portal\n\n  * Federal Aid Road Act of 1916\n  * Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)\n  * Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956\n  * Nader v.
