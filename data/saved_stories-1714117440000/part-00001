Wartime communication\nvia memes has been a successful strategy used not only by independent accounts\nsuch as @uamemesforces, but also\u2014for the first time in a full-scale interstate\nwar\u2014by official Ukrainian government accounts such as @Ukraine and @DefenceU.\nWe study this prominent example of memetic warfare through the lens of its\nnarratives, and find them to be a key component of success: tweets with a\n\u2018victim\u2019 narrative garner twice as many retweets. However, malevolent\nnarratives focusing on the enemy resonate more than those about heroism or\nvictims with countries providing more assistance to Ukraine. Our findings\npresent a nuanced examination of Ukraine\u2019s influence operations and of the\nworldwide response to it, thus contributing new insights into the evolution of\nsocio-technical systems in times of war.\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia began a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office has confirmed the death of 9083\ncivilians up to 18 June 2023.[1] However, their report highlights that the\nactual figures are believed to be considerably higher, and most estimates\nsuggest more than 300 000 total deaths.\n\nIn the midst of this immense tragedy, the two governments at war\u2014Russia and\nUkraine\u2014are also waging an information war on many fronts. Due to the\nprevalence of the Internet as a primary information source for Ukrainians,[2]\nthe war has been described as the first social-media war,[3]\n\nechoing the reputation of the Vietnam war as the \u201cfirst television war\u201d due to\nthe role this medium had in informing the public about the conflict.\n\nBoth governments and common people have been using social media to propagate\ntheir views on the conflict and affect global public opinion. A vivid example\nis @Ukraine, the official account of the Ukrainian government on Twitter.[4]\nThis account was started in 2016 by Yarema Dukh while working as a press\nofficer in the Ukrainian presidential office. One of the memes produced by\nthis account, depicting \u201cliving next to Russia\u201d as the worst possible\nheadache,[5] has been shared more than 600 000 times and has reached 55\nmillion views. According to the author, the goal of this meme was \u201cto explain\nto some large and distant target audiences that Russia is the problem here,\nnot Ukraine, the West, the U.S., NATO, aliens or anyone else\u201d.[6] This account\nhas posted a variety of content and has now become one of the most visible\nexamples of memetic warfare from a warring government.\n\nAn early definition of memetic warfare was given by the NATO Strategic\nCommunications Centre of Excellence in Latvia in a document titled \u201cIt\u2019s time\nto embrace memetic warfare\u201d [25]. The document defines it as \u201cthe competition\nover narrative, ideas, and social control in a social-media battlefield\u201d and\nis viewed as \u201cthe \u2019digital native\u2019s version of psychological warfare, more\ncommonly known as propaganda\u201d. The authors argue that it needs to be brought\ninto mainstream military thinking by investing in its development. While\npropaganda has long been a central component of war, memetic warfare\nintroduces a new key aspect: its reach is intrinsically tied to how much its\nown audience is willing to spread it. Governments involved in psychological\nwarfare used to rely purely on one-way communication media such as posters and\nradio. However, the two-way nature of social media implies that they have to\nconvince their own audience to help spread their message to reach wider\naudiences. This characteristic creates a particular amalgam of social-media\nbottom-up dynamics with the top-down approach typical of military objectives\nand narratives. Different goals then might require spreading different types\nof content, which in turn might have varying degrees of success with specific\naudiences.\n\nDespite the importance of this matter, so far little research effort has been\ndedicated to the quantitative analysis of which aspects make memetic warfare\nmore successful, which audience it is able to reach, and what are its\nconsequences. These questions are of primary interest not only for the\ninvolved parties, but also for the global public opinion. In order to prepare,\nevaluate, and react appropriately, we need to better understand these novel\ntechniques of propaganda, which are likely to become increasingly common in\nthe future. Our analysis focuses on these research questions:\n\nRQ1 What are the main characteristics of memes shared by popular Ukrainian\nTwitter accounts?\n\nRQ2 Which attributes of a wartime meme are good predictors of its virality?\n\nRQ3 What is the geographic resonance of each narrative, and how does it relate\nto each country\u2019s actions toward the conflict?\n\nWe examine the content of the memes in terms of the actors involved, their\nemotional appeal, and the narratives used. Based on previous literature [18],\nwe identify four roles within a narrative, depending on the moral quality of\nthe actors in the narrative and on their perceived power. In our context,\nthese roles often represent the benevolent moral quality of the author\u2019s side\nor the malevolent one of the enemy. The narratives we identify are a powerful\npredictor of the virality of a meme. Content with a victim narrative\u2014a\nbenevolent, weak actor\u2014has a 109% higher reach w.r.t. content with no\nnarrative, while a villain narrative\u2014depicting the enemy as malevolent and\nstrong\u2014increases reach by 32%. Finally, since one of the goals of these\naccounts is to influence global public opinion, we look at the success of the\ncontent geographically. Memetic warfare reach reflects important aspects of\nthe offline world: the retweets per inhabitant in a given country correlate\nhighly (\u03c1 = 0.787) with the assistance given by that country to Ukraine. In\naddition, different narratives resonate differently with different countries.\nFor instance, villain narratives resonate more than victim narratives in\nEuropean countries bordering Russia. In turn, these different framings of the\nconflict are also reflected in the material assistance given by these\ncountries. The success of malevolent narratives positively correlates with the\nshare of GDP devoted to assisting Ukraine (\u03c1 = 0.601, \u03c1 = 0.566).\n\nThe present study has important implications for our understanding of the\ninteraction between communication technologies and their use by governments\nand non-governmental actors during a conflict. We illustrate how social media\nmay factor into a country\u2019s strategic messaging during war, and how such\nmessaging is related to the attention and aid afforded to the country. As\ncyber-influence campaigns become more common and sophisticated, we encourage\nthe research community to apply a multi-factorial view of the relevant\ncontent, including visual and narrative aspects, to understand its resonance\naround the world.\n\n[1] https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/06/ukraine-civilian-casualty-\nupdate-19-june-2023\n\n[2] https://www.unian.info/society/media-space-internet-bypasses-tv-as-main-\nnews-source-for ukrainians-11330729.html\n\n[3] https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2022/03/01/is-russias-invasion-of-\nukraine-the-first social-media-war\n\n[4] Twitter is currently being rebranded to \u201cX\u201d.
