It was a $27 upgrade,\nequivalent to about $190 today. Research showed they reduced traffic\nfatalities by nearly 70%.\n\nBut only 2% of customers opted for the upgrade. Ninety-eight percent of buyers\npreferred to remain at the mercy of inertia.\n\nThings eventually changed, but it took decades. Seatbelt usage was still under\n15% in the early 1980s. It didn\u2019t exceed 80% until the early 2000s \u2013 almost\nhalf a century after Ford offered them in all cars.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to underestimate how social norms stall change, even when the change\nis an obvious improvement. One of the strongest forces in the world is the\nurge to keep doing things as you\u2019ve always done them, because people don\u2019t\nlike to be told they\u2019ve been doing things wrong. Change eventually comes, but\nagonizingly slower than you might assume.\n\nDunkirk was a miracle. More than 330,000 Allied soldiers, pinned down by Nazi\nattacks, were successfully evacuated from the beaches of France back to\nEngland, ferried by hundreds of small civilian boats.\n\nLondon broke out in celebration when the mission was completed. Few were more\nrelieved than Winston Churchill, who feared the imminent destruction of his\narmy.\n\nBut Edmund Ironside, commander of British Home Forces, pointed out that if the\nAllies could quickly ferry a third of a million troops from France to England\nwhile avoiding aerial attack, the Germans probably could, too. Churchill had\nbeen holding onto hope that Germany couldn\u2019t cross the Channel with an\ninvasion force; such a daring mission seemed impossible. But then his own army\nproved it was quite possible. Dunkirk was both a success and a foreboding.\n\nYour competitors can probably innovate and execute as well as you can. So\nevery time you uncover a new talent you\u2019re proud of, temper your thrill with\nthe acceptance that other people who want to win as badly as you probably\naren\u2019t far behind.\n\nNotorious BIG once casually mentioned that he began selling crack in fourth\ngrade. He explained:\n\n> They [teachers] was always like, \u201cTake the talent that you have and think of\n> something that you can do in the future with it.\u201d\n>\n> And I was like, \u201cWell, I like to draw.\u201d So what could I do with drawing?\n> What am I gonna be, an art dealer? I\u2019m not gonna be that type. I was\n> thinking maybe I can do big billboards and shit. Like commercial art.\n>\n> And then after that I got introduced to crack. Haha, now I\u2019m thinking,\n> commercial art?! Haha. I\u2019m out here for 20 minutes and I can make some real,\n> real money, man.\n\nIncentives drive everything, and most of us underestimate what we\u2019d be willing\nto do if the incentives were right.\n\nWhen Barack Obama discussed running for president in 2005, his friend George\nHaywood \u2013 an accomplished investor \u2013 gave him a warning: the housing market\nwas about to collapse, and would take the economy down with it.\n\nGeorge told Obama how mortgage-backed securities worked, how they were being\nrated all wrong, how much risk was piling up, and how inevitable its collapse\nwas. And it wasn\u2019t just talk: George was short the mortgage market.\n\nHome prices kept rising for two years. By 2007, when cracks began showing,\nObama checked in with George. Surely his bet was now paying off?\n\nObama wrote in his memoir:\n\n> George told me that he had been forced to abandon his short position after\n> taking heavy losses.\n>\n> \u201cI just don\u2019t have enough cash to stay with the bet,\u201d he said calmly enough,\n> adding, \u201cApparently I\u2019ve underestimated how willing people are to maintain a\n> charade.\u201d\n\nIrrational trends rarely follow rational timelines. Unsustainable things can\nlast longer than you think.\n\nWhen the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north\nlaughed at their good fortune. With the English crippled by disease, now was a\nperfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.\n\nThe Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle.\nWhich, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.\n\n\u201cBefore they could move, the savage mortality fell upon them too, scattering\nsome in death and the rest in panic,\u201d historian Barbara Tuchman writes in her\nbook A Distant Mirror.\n\nThere\u2019s a powerful urge to think risk is something that happens to other\npeople. Other people get unlucky, other people make dumb decisions, other\npeople get swayed by the seduction of greed and fear. But you? Me? No, never\nus. False confidence makes the eventual reality all the more shocking.\n\nSome are more susceptible to risk than others, but no one is exempt from being\nhumbled.\n\nDr. Dan Goodman once performed surgery on a middle-aged woman whose cataract\nhad left her blind since childhood. The cataract was removed, leaving the\nwoman with near-perfect vision. A miraculous success.\n\nThe patient returned for a checkup a few weeks later. The book Crashing\nThrough writes:\n\n> Her reaction startled Goodman. She had been happy and content as a blind\n> person. Now sighted, she became anxious and depressed. She told him that she\n> had spent her adult life on welfare and had never worked, married, or\n> ventured far from home \u2013 a small existence to which she had become\n> comfortably accustomed. Now, however, government officials told her that she\n> no longer qualified for disability, and they expected her to get a job.\n> Society wanted her to function normally. It was, she told Goldman, too much\n> to handle.\n\nEvery goal you dream about has a downside that\u2019s easy to overlook.\n\nHistorian John Meecham writes:\n\n> When we condemn [the past] for slavery, or for Native American removal, or\n> for denying women their full role in the life of the nation, we ought to\n> pause and think: What injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one\n> day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us?\n\nThis applies to so many things.\n\nWhat is the modern version of cigarettes, which were doctor-recommended just a\nfew generations ago? We didn\u2019t know dinosaurs existed 200 years ago, which\nmakes you wonder what else is out there that we\u2019re oblivious to today. What\ncompany is the modern Enron, so obviously a fraud? What do most people \u2013 not a\nfew wackos, but most of us \u2013 believe that will look something between\nhilarious and disgraceful 100 years from now?\n\nA lot of history is just gawking at how wrong, how blind, people can be.\nDisastrously wrong, embarrassingly blind. Millions of people, all at the same\ntime. When you then realize that today will be considered history in a few\ngenerations ... oh dear. It\u2019s unpleasant. But also fascinating.\n\nApollo 11 was the first time in history humans visited another celestial body.\n\nYou\u2019d think that would be an overwhelming experience \u2013 literally the coolest\nthing any human had ever done. But as the spacecraft hovered over the moon,\nMichael Collins turned to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and said:\n\n> It\u2019s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn\u2019t seem weird at all to me to\n> look out there and see the moon going by, you know?\n\nThree months later, after Al Bean walked on the moon during Apollo 12, he\nturned to astronaut Pete Conrad and said \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the song: Is that\nall there is?\u201d Conrad was relieved, because he secretly felt the same,\ndescribing his moonwalk as spectacular but not momentous.\n\nMost mental upside comes from the thrill of anticipation \u2013 actual experiences\ntend to fall flat, and your mind quickly moves on to anticipating the next\nevent. That\u2019s how dopamine works.\n\nIf walking on the moon left astronauts underwhelmed, what does it say about\nour own earthly goals and expectations?\n\nJohn Nash is one of the smartest mathematicians to ever live, winning the\nNobel Prize. He was also schizophrenic, and spent most of his life convinced\nthat aliens were sending him coded messages.\n\nIn her book A Beautiful Mind, Silvia Nasar recounts a conversation between\nNash and Harvard professor George Mackey:\n\n> \u201cHow could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof,\n> how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How\n> could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to\n> save the world?\u201d Mackey asked.\n>\n> \u201cBecause,\u201d Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, \u201cthe\n> ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my\n> mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.\u201d\n\nThis is a good example of a theory I have about very talented people: No one\nshould be shocked when people who think about the world in unique ways you\nlike also think about the world in unique ways you don\u2019t like. Unique minds\nhave to be accepted as a full package.\n\nMore:\n\n  * The Psychology of Money\n\n  * Five Lessons From History\n\n  * Death, Taxes and a Few Other Things\n\nSHARE\n\n  * Copy Link\n\n### Sign up for more Collab Fund content\n\n## More from the blog...\n\n### How I Think About Debt\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Apr 30, 2024\n\nJapan has 140 businesses that are at least 500 years old.\n\n### Lucky vs. Repeatable\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Apr 7, 2024\n\nLuck plays such a big role in the world.\n\n### Smart Words From Smart People\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Mar 24, 2024\n\nA few smart things I\u2019ve read recently...\n\n# Collab Fund\n\nCollaborative is a leading source of capital for big ideas pushing the world\nforward.\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSign up for updates \u2197\n\n## Twitter\n\nFollow @collabfund \u2197\n\n## RSS\n\nSubscribe to the blog \u2197\n\nCollaborative Fund Management LLC, Collaborative Holdings Management LP and\nCollab+Currency Management, LLC are distinct investment advisory entities, are\nnot a unitary enterprise and operate independently of one another.
