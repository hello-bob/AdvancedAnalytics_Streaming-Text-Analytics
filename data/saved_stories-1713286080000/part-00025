(Though it\u2019s not exclusive to the right, and there are signs\nthat its advantage may be starting to fray.)\n\nNamed for 18th-century Vice President Elbridge Gerry, to \u201cgerrymander\u201d is to\nbureaucratically distort the geographic boundaries of a voting district,\ncutting across lines of population concentrations so that, for instance,\nRepublican voters in that district will make up a majority that was not\npresent in the previous boundary overlay. In districts where one might expect\nrectangles, instead, thanks to such manipulation, boundary geometries can be\nwarped to farcical extremes. (Gerry\u2019s meddling with a Boston district was said\nto produce a map the shape of a salamander, hence the portmanteau word \u2014 a\nterm as unwieldy and strange as the often-preposterous districts to which it\nrefers.) The abuse of power that gerrymandering represents has been an ongoing\nconcern, particularly as Republicans have become increasingly brazen about\nwheeling out the patently self-serving strategy during each once-a-decade\nredistricting cycle. The consequences have been far-ranging for U.S. democracy\n(and the lack thereof).\n\nThe United States, though, is home to injustices that extend far beyond this\nelection-rigging. The bipartisan project of mass incarceration has swept up\nenormous swaths of the population, disproportionately people of color \u2014 with\nthe result that the country now exceeds all other nations in total prisoner\nnumbers. Until recently, that was true both of the raw number and the per-\ncapita rate. (The latter has apparently fluctuated since a 2019-2020, partly\nCOVID-related drop; the total-number first-place status remains in place.)\n\nPrison gerrymandering is a distinct issue that lies at the intersection of\nthese and other processes. It specifically refers to the lopsided voting-bloc\ndistortions that can occur when individuals are counted as residents of the\ndistrict that harbors the prison in which they are currently incarcerated,\nrather than their original home locality. In the current model, districts that\ncontain prisons receive an undue boost in population, meaning that the vote of\nevery free citizen in the district is effectively granted an outsized\nweighting. By extension, other territories, especially those with populations\ndiminished by their residents\u2019 mass incarceration in those very same prisons,\nnow find that their democratic participation counts, comparatively, even less.\n\n## Undoing the Miscount\n\nThe nonpartisan nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative (PPI) is the most prominent\norganization engaged in directly combating prison gerrymandering. Since 2001,\nthe PPI has led a nationwide campaign to put an end to the practice, alongside\nother significant work combating the socially catastrophic injustices of mass\nincarceration.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nPrisons & Policing\n\n## The Right to Vote Should Be Available to Everyone \u2014 Including Prisoners\nLike Me\n\nPrisoners\u2019 inability to vote means we can\u2019t vote for fair-minded judges who\nwill protect our rights in civil court.\n\nBy\n\n    Joseph R. Dole ,\n    Truthout\n\nOctober 24, 2021\n\nTruthout\n\n\u201cPrison gerrymandering is a problem created because the Census Bureau counts\nincarcerated people in the wrong place. It counts them as residents of a\nprison cell, rather than their home communities,\u201d PPI Communications Director\nMike Wessler told Truthout. Counting prisoners as a prison district\u2019s home\nresidents in this way, first and foremost, deprives prisoners themselves of\nthe adequate democratic representation they are due.\n\n\u201c[T]hey don\u2019t have social ties to the prison community, they\u2019re not likely to\nstay there when they\u2019re released, they\u2019re not likely to be in that prison for\nmore than a couple years at a time, and they don\u2019t really consider themselves\nmembers of that community,\u201d Wessler said. \u201cThey\u2019re not reaching out to\nlawmakers there to make their voice heard. The places that they feel connected\nto are the places they\u2019re most likely to return to after they leave, which is\ntheir home communities: where they came from.\u201d\n\nThis is a weighty issue of democratic rights. As the Campaign Legal Center\npoints out, while almost all those with felony convictions are ineligible to\nvote (a major example of racially biased disenfranchisement in its own right),\ntwo-thirds of those behind bars in the U.S. at any given time are only in jail\nawaiting trial or a plea bargain. (Pre-trial detention being yet another\naspect of the justice system in which injustice is, for the record, also\nrife.) They have not been convicted of any crime, and should retain their\nconstitutional voting rights. And even if they are convicted, in theory, those\nfound guilty of misdemeanors are not de jure stripped of their voting rights.\nBut in practice, prisons make it inordinately difficult for anyone currently\nincarcerated to vote.\n\nMoreover, any prisoner, even those totally deprived of the right to vote, as\nWessler points out, should still be able to petition their local lawmakers for\ncauses and otherwise participate in local democracy. \u201cThe people who are in\nprison \u2014 they have a right to lobby their lawmakers. But there\u2019s a fundamental\ntension between the people who are incarcerated, wanting change, and the\npeople who on paper represent them. When people in prison want prison phone\nrates to be addressed, or prison conditions to be addressed, or they want the\nprobation and parole system to be improved, they\u2019re not reaching out to the\nlawmaker who represents the rural prison. They\u2019re reaching out to the\npoliticians in their home community,\u201d he continued.\n\nThose local politicians are then put in a difficult position: many wish to\ncontinue advocating for their constituents. Yet constituents who are\nsequestered elsewhere, are unable to vote for supportive representatives or\naid their campaigns. These representatives end up devoting resources to\nadvocating for incarcerated people whom \u201cthey have strong ties to, but on\npaper, they don\u2019t answer to. But they\u2019re doing [the work of advocating for\nthem] anyways. It creates additional burdens on those communities.\u201d By\nbureaucratically confining them as constituents of the prison\u2019s district,\nprisoners are denied effective democratic representation of all kinds. \u201cVoting\nis an important way you interact with your government. But it\u2019s not the only\nway,\u201d Wessler said.\n\n## Disenfranchisement on Vast Scales\n\nFrom the outset, the U.S. prison system already functions as an engine for the\ndisenfranchisement, control and forced-labor exploitation of hundreds of\nthousands of marginalized people. Indeed, mass incarceration has replicated\nand reinstated many of the social functions of Jim Crow laws, and still\nexhibits aspects of slavery. It has merely been camouflaged in the language of\ncrime-fighting and the drug war. In other words, the imprisoned were already\non unequal footing, to put it lightly. Prison gerrymandering, while merely\nsymptomatic of broader forces, both intentional and emergent, represents\nanother barrier to the already beleaguered.\n\nWessler also pointed to some of the most flagrant examples of prison\ngerrymandering: the most infamous and starkly illustrative being that of\nAnamosa, Iowa, where a prison\u2019s location lent just a few residents of one ward\nwildly outsized power. This led to one Danny R. Young\u2019s election to the city\ncouncil with \u201ca total of two votes, both write-ins, from his wife and a\nneighbor,\u201d reported The New York Times in 2008. Asked about the prisoners who\nmake up practically the entire ward population, granting the disproportionate\npower that got him elected, Young said: \u201cDo I consider them my constituents?\nThey don\u2019t vote, so, I guess, not really.\u201d\n\nAs Wessler summarized the issue, which so farcically arose in Anamosa but is\npresent in less blatant forms elsewhere, \u201cWhen local governments use census\ndata for redistricting purposes, they inadvertently give additional political\nclout to communities that contain prisons, at the expense of everyone else.\u201d\n\nPrison gerrymandering not only unduly empowers certain citizens within a\nprison district. The game is zero-sum: it also dilutes the voting power of\nother districts, in a number of ways. As Wessler put it, \u201c[A] handful of\ncommunities that contain large prisons ... are benefiting at the expense of\nevery other community around the state. [Those negatively affected include]\nlarge urban areas, that lend a lot of their population by numbers to prisons,\nand it also includes smaller rural areas that have higher incarceration rates\nbut lower population totals.\u201d\n\nMass incarceration, in other words, has drained the populations from certain\nhighly policed areas and concentrated them in disparate counties. Not only is\nthe voting power of the areas home to prisons increased \u2014 it\u2019s simultaneously\nbled from the places where high arrest rates and the drug war have depleted\nthe voter rolls. Across a given state, because prisons are often built in\nrural areas, it\u2019s often the case that the underpopulated, outweighed districts\nare urban, and, as a correlate, are home to more people of color.\n\nOf course, people of color already face disenfranchisement in innumerable\nways. The poll taxes and \u201cliteracy\u201d tests of Reconstruction have given way to,\nfirst of all, gerrymandering of the normal sort \u2014 but also rolls-purging, ID\nrequirements, and other tacitly racist voter suppression. Indeed, the right is\nengaged in a massive project of disenfranchisement aimed at eroding the gains\nof the civil rights movement and ensuring Republican victories \u2014 securing,\nalong with those victories, by both demographic and design, the persistence of\nwhite supremacy.\n\nBut if prison gerrymandering is part of that process, it\u2019s more akin to a\nsecondary ramification, an unintended consequence at the intersection of\ndisenfranchisement, social realities and a fluke of Census Bureau statistical\ncollection. As the PPI sees it, the primary problem raised by prison\ngerrymandering is one of constitutionality: in particular, the way that its\ndistortive effects can patently violate equal representation, i.e., \u201cone\nperson, one vote.\u201d Famously, the postbellum Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal\nprotection clause determines that all must be considered equal in the eyes of\nthe law.\n\nDuring the civil rights movement, it was this constitutional language that\nserved as the basis for the landmark 1964 Reynolds v. Sims Supreme Court\ndecision under Chief Justice Earl Warren, which found that legislative\nrepresentation must be allotted by votes from districts of equivalent size,\nwithin a small margin of error. It was established that the U.S. Census Bureau\nwould furnish the data that underlies the districting decisions.\n\nEver since then, similar incremental advances for democracy and racial justice\nhave been a thorn in the side of reactionaries and racists both covert and\novert. Their effort to diminish minority voting and the gains of the civil\nrights movement has made leaps and bounds in recent years, all while the\nright, with utmost cynicism, holds up a puppet caricature of Martin Luther\nKing Jr.\n\n## Bipartisan Solutions?\n\nWhen it comes to the specifics of prison gerrymandering, however, the problems\nof the policy are not necessarily a clear matter of self-dealing. It is more\nof an artifact of the system than a consciously effected strategy. \u201cI think\nprison gerrymandering really defies a lot of the broader political\nexpectations that people have about how this works. We\u2019ve seen pretty\nconsiderable bipartisan support for addressing prison gerrymandering,\u201d Wessler\nnoted.\n\nHe continued: \u201cJust last year, [a bipartisan redistricting commission in\nMontana] unanimously passed new legislative maps that ended prison\ngerrymandering in the state.\u201d A Republican-supermajority legislature then\nnearly unanimously passed a bill to end it in the state. The signature of a\nRepublican governor then put prison gerrymandering, at least in Montana, to a\npermanent end.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t politicians who are well aware of how the\npractice is advantageous to their interests. Asked about this possibility,\nWessler responded, \u201cI think there\u2019s a little bit of [intentionality] behind\nit. Certainly, some of the folks who have opposed ending prison gerrymandering\nare often the people that benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he went on, \u201cI also think there\u2019s examples where the opposite was\ntrue. In Maryland, one of the key sponsors of a bill to end prison\ngerrymandering represented the prison [district]. She knew that it was just\nnot the right way to count people. ... We\u2019ve heard similar things from\nlegislators in other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nBecause the PPI\u2019s anti-prison-gerrymandering campaign relies on the strategy\nof encouraging local and state legislatures with both blue and red majorities\nto assist in undoing the imbalance, it\u2019s to the campaign\u2019s benefit that it\nremains nonpartisan, in order to find as many allies among lawmakers as\npossible.\n\n## Remediation Efforts\n\nInstead, the PPI\u2019s focus is, again, on the Census Bureau, as the most powerful\nand central determinant of the policy. But prison gerrymandering can also be\naddressed at the state-legislative level. The PPI, in collaboration with the\nState Innovation Exchange (SiX) has released a messaging and policy design\nguide to assist state legislatures in redressing efforts. Their other efforts\nlargely consist of lobbying, petitioning and releasing reports, findings and\npublic information, all in service of their place of leadership at the prow of\na national movement.\n\nIn part thanks to the PPI\u2019s work, there has been real momentum attained on\nthese fronts. As the guide notes, there are now outright prohibitions on\nprison gerrymandering in seven states: \u201cCalifornia (2011), Delaware (2010),\nMaryland (2010), Nevada (2019), New Jersey (2020), New York (2010) and\nWashington (2019).\u201d The guide continues, noting that, \u201cColorado, Michigan,\nTennessee, and Virginia have addressed prison gerrymandering at the local\nlevel, either by barring or discouraging county and local governments from\ncounting prison populations when drawing local districts (e.g., for town or\nschool board elections).\u201d\n\nAnother key point, says Wessler, addresses one of the most cited objections:\nchanging the way that prisoners are tracked by the census will not affect the\napportionment of funding. Funding distribution policies are calculated based\non different data, often more fine-grained and able to account for prison\npopulation discrepancies. Per a PPI fact sheet: while funding disbursement\ndoes \u201crely on population totals, it is just one of many components taken into\nconsideration. ... [P]overty measures play an important role in funding\nallocation, but federal poverty data does not include incarcerated people.\u201d\nThis is only one aspect of the complex and multidimensional earmarking\nformulas in use.\n\nJust as the PPI website touts, Wessler reiterates that there has indeed been\nsignificant progress, and agrees that there is reason to be hopeful about\nhalting prison gerrymandering\u2019s ill effects, especially from the top down: by\nchanging Census Bureau policy for the 2030 census. \u201cAs of today, there are\nover 200 local governments, city and county governments, that have tackled\nthis issue and are working to correct the census data to count people in their\nhome communities. All told, about 50 percent of the country now lives in a\nplace that has ended prison gerrymandering or has taken some other action on\nit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think, as we look toward the 2030 census, there\u2019s a strong argument for\nthe Census Bureau to finally change how it counts incarcerated people. Stop\nputting the onus on city, county and state governments to correct the Census\nBureau\u2019s mistake,\u201d Wessler concluded.\n\nPrison gerrymandering represents something rare among the extreme,\ninterlocking complexities of modernity: a single hinge point, via which a\ncomparatively simple change can exert outsize positive impact. Its reversal\nwould be a welcome addition, at least, to the project of reinforcing what\nremains of democratic rights.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
