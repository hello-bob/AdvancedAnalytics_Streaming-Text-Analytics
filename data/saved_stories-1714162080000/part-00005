Baltimore County police\nalso consulted with another analyst and experts at the FBI. Their conclusion\nwas that the recording was suspicious and unlikely to be authentic.\n\nFor just a few dollars, anyone can harness artificial intelligence to make\naudio and visual deepfakes. Stakes are high, but deepfake detection software\ndoesn't always get it right.\n\n### Untangling Disinformation\n\n### Using AI to detect AI-generated deepfakes can work for audio \u2014 but not\nalways\n\nThis Baltimore-area case is not a canary in the coal mine. \"I think the canary\nhas been dead for quite awhile,\" Farid said.\n\n\"What's so particularly poignant here is that this is a Baltimore school\nprincipal. This is not Taylor Swift. It's not Joe Biden. It's not Elon Musk.\nIt's just some guy trying to get through his day,\" he said. \"It shows you the\nvulnerability. How anybody can create this stuff and they can weaponize it\nagainst anybody.\"\n\n### Darien allegedly sought to retaliate against his boss\n\nDarien's alleged scheme began in January in an attempt to retaliate against\nEiswert, investigators wrote in the charging documents provided to NPR. The\ntwo men were at odds with each other over Darien's \"work performance\nchallenges,\" police wrote.\n\nEiswert launched an investigation into Darien in December 2023 over the\npotential mishandling of $1,916 in school funds. The money was paid to a\nperson hired as an assistant girl's soccer coach, but the person never did the\njob, according to police.\n\nFurther, Eiswert had reprimanded Darien for firing a coach without his\napproval.\n\nEiswert had told Darien that his contract was possibly \"not being renewed next\nsemester,\" according to the arrest warrant.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nThe Baltimore County police launched their investigation into the alleged AI-\ngenerated recording of Principal Eiswert in January. Julio Cortez/AP hide\ncaption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nJulio Cortez/AP\n\nThe Baltimore County police launched their investigation into the alleged AI-\ngenerated recording of Principal Eiswert in January.\n\nJulio Cortez/AP\n\nOn Jan. 17, detectives found out about the voice recording purporting to be of\nEiswert that was spreading on social media. The recording, which can still be\nfound online, allegedly caught Eiswert saying disparaging comments.\n\n\"The audio clip, the catalyst of this investigation, had profound\nrepercussions,\" the charging documents read. \"It not only led to Eiswert's\ntemporary removal from the school but also triggered a wave of hate-filled\nmessages on social media and numerous calls to the school. The recording also\ncaused significant disruptions for the PHS staff and students.\"\n\nThe school was inundated with threatening messages and Billy Burke, head of\nthe union that represents Eiswert, said the principal's family was being\nharassed and threatened, according to reporting from the Baltimore Banner.\n\nEiswert told police from the start of the investigation that he believed the\nrecording was fake.\n\nDarien was taken into custody Thursday morning at Baltimore/Washington\nInternational Thurgood Marshall Airport after attempting to board a flight to\nHouston, Chief McCullough said.\n\nSecurity stopped Darien over a gun he packed in his bags and when officers ran\nhis name in a search they found he had a warrant out for his arrest,\nMcCullough said.\n\nDarien was released on a $5,000 unsecured bond. His trial date is scheduled\nfor June 11.\n\n### 'Where are our regulators?'\n\nAfter following this story, Farid is left with the question: \"What is going to\nbe the consequence of this?\"\n\nHe's been studying digital manipulation for more than 20 years and the\nproblems have only gotten \"much bigger and the consequences more severe.\"\n\nEiswert has been on leave since the audio recordings went public. Pikesville\nHigh School has been run by district staff since Eiswert left and the plan\nremains to keep those temporary administrators on the job through the end of\nthe school year, said Myriam Rogers, the superintendent of Baltimore County\nPublic Schools.\n\nAs for Darien, Rogers said, \"We are taking appropriate action regarding the\narrested employee's conduct up to and including a recommendation for\ntermination.\"\n\nBaltimore County Executive John Olszewski said during Thursday's press\nconference that this case highlights the need \"to make some adaptions to bring\nthe law up to date with the technology that was being used.\"\n\nFarid said there remains, generally, a lackluster response from regulators\nreluctant to put checks and balances on tech companies that develop these\ntools or to establish laws that properly punish wrongdoers and protect people.\n\n\"I don't understand at what point we're going to wake up as a country and say,\nlike, why are we allowing this? Where are our regulators?\"\n\n### Untangling Disinformation\n\n### It takes a few dollars and 8 minutes to create a deepfake.
