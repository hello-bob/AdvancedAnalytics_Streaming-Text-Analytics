About the time Reagan retired, he made his\nbiggest move to outmaneuver a Taiwanese competitor and it blew up in his face.\nHe faced utter ruin.\n\nThings go wrong in bunches. He was going through a bitter divorce. His board\nof directors was split between his wife\u2019s brother and sister and his own\nselected in house people. The board meetings were usually tense standoffs\nwhere Ben just managed to keep control since he had four of the seven board\nmembers on his side. He had broken his leg in a skiing accident and was\nhobbling along on crutches. And he had just discovered that his best witness\nwas not only leaving the company, but was going to work for the very Taiwanese\nhe was fighting and would undoubtedly be a hostile witness. We stood a very\ngood chance of losing the case.\n\nHe sat across the desk from me in a very rumpled state. In the best of times\nBen looked pretty disheveled. He was a big man, not fat but big, and suits on\nhim always looked like he had slept in them the night before. He always needed\na shave by three in the afternoon, had a habit of playing with a pen in one\nhand while making points with the other, and was brilliant.\n\nNot just smart, but brilliant. He could look over the figures for a market and\nwithin half an hour come up with a concept for entry into the market that\nwould never occur to an MBA. What impressed me even more, when he saw he made\na mistake, which was not often, he was ruthless, freely admitting his error,\nruefully telling himself he was an idiot, and then would fix the mess. Unlike\nmost business people, he did not have his ego in appearing right-his ego was\nin winning the battle. He put it well:\u201dIt\u2019s not about being always right. It\u2019s\nabout fixing it fast when you were wrong. That\u2019s how you succeed.\u201d\n\nThat March morning he was going to have to use all of his brilliance since I\nwas telling him about the declaration his ex manager, who I will call Al, just\nwrote for our opponents. Al not only stated that the Taiwanese theft of our\ntrade secrets did not harm us since we no longer used that technique-he said\nthat he was unsure the theft had even occurred. He might have just mislaid the\nspecifications and technique folder in a cab during a business trip to Taipei.\n\nPreviously, he had sworn that the specifications were taken from his briefcase\nwhile he was having a solitary dinner in a restaurant in which our competitors\nwere also having a business dinner. The competitors had mysteriously come up\nwith our unique technique four months later after unsuccessfully trying to\nduplicate it for five years. The documents were never found and the only thing\nmissing from the briefcase were the specifications and techniques. He had been\nplanning to meet with a new manufacturer that evening and was shocked to see\nthe competitors at the next table. When he returned from the bathroom after\nfoolishly leaving the briefcase there, he noticed it had moved a bit but never\nexamined the contents until later that evening.\n\nBen was besides himself at first, telling Al he was an idiot and even wondered\nto me if Al was in their pay. But as usual, Ben did not waste time with\nregrets. He poured his energy into improving the technique and our competitors\nultimately gained next to nothing. Ben was not done. He saw this as an\nopportunity to cost his competitors in court and to, \u201cteach them a lesson that\nwhat works over there doesn\u2019t work here.\u201d He also know that they probably had\nno litigation budget, were unused to American litigation, and having them\nspend a few hundred thousand in an American court rather than the market place\nstruck him as a great idea.\n\nIt seemed to be working. Our opponents made the mistake of hiring the largest\nfirm they could find, thus had a litigation cost three times that of our\nclient. That firm was a billing machine and while it cost our client more to\nrespond to their many, many litigation maneuvers, each such maneuver cost the\nTaiwanese three times what it cost us and did little harm to our case. Unused\nto attorneys and litigation, our opponents must have been sweating blood.\n\nAnd the case was going well. The circumstantial evidence just kept getting\nbetter. They had no technical history in their laboratory of developing the\nright technique, no lab notes, no experimental data at all. Their scientist\nevaded answering how he had suddenly come up with the right concept. While all\nthe men at the dinner denied touching the briefcase, and no waiter would get\ninvolved, their testimony as to details was contradictory and suspicious. We\nhad a pretty good case, had just hired an engineer expert who could testify as\nto reverse engineering, and then our case exploded.\n\nAl quit, took a job with the Taiwanese and submitted a declaration with the\ncourt that was a killer. Ben listened to me read the declaration, his fingers\ndrumming on the crutch that was across his lap as he sat in the big leather\nclient chair on the other side of my desk. After I finished, he blinked once\nbut said nothing for a moment. Then, \u201cOur case dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot dead. But in the Emergency Room and bleeding badly.\u201d\n\nHe blinked again. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think they stole anything. I think he\ngave it to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. More likely they just figured hiring him at an outrageous\ncost was cheaper than paying American lawyers.\u201d\n\nHe grunted what might have been a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re right. Until he stabs them\nin the back in a few years.\u201d He stared out my window and mulled it over. \u201cSo,\nlet\u2019s presume we lose. What do we face?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did not cross complain against you. There is no attorneys fees clause\nsince there was no contract between you and them. So, even if they win, all\nthey get are out of pocket costs for deposition reporters, filing fees, that\nsort of thing. Expert fees. Those will be high. Figure a hundred thousand risk\nthere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, we get no recovery. We pay your fees and our costs and will\nlose.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably. We have a chance...but a small chance now.\u201d\n\nHe brightened a moment. \u201cOf course, they pay their own attorney fees even if\nthey win, still get nothing, and you say their attorneys are incredibly\nexpensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect the fees they have already spent exceed five hundred thousand\ndollars. If it goes to trial, you can almost double that.\u201d\n\nHe smiled then and thought it out, hands still drumming on the crutch. I\npopped his bubble a bit.\n\n\u201cIf they win, they could later bring litigation against you for trade libel or\nsome such thing. Unfair business practices. That could be expensive down the\nroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould they win?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely. You relied on Al and we have his depositions in our favor from\nbefore. I don\u2019t see a chance of them proving bad faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can show he changed his testimony.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue. But we also have the burden of proof and he was a key witness for us.\nWithout him testifying that they moved his briefcase, our case is weak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can show he once said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will say you talked him into that. Had to so he could keep his job. That\nsort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will admit lying, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue. No one will believe anything he says. But the problem is that we needed\nhis testimony to prove our case.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe nodded, still thinking hard. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t sue us. Not after what they\npaid for attorneys. They\u2019ll never want to be in an American court again.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we lose but we win in some ways. They spent more than us. We disrupted\nthem coming into the market. And we got rid of a man I don\u2019t trust. Good luck\nto them in hiring him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably be ideal for them. Same ethics.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn right. Now, here\u2019s the real problem. The Board of Directors is not going\nto think like I\u2019m thinking. They\u2019re going to see me spending two hundred\nthousand in fees and either losing the case or dismissing it, losing our\nengineer to the competitor, and looking like fools in the market place. Some\nof the Board already doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. At least some of the Board. Any chance of settling with your wife in\nthe immediate future? Getting your board back? I wish you had created a buy\nand sell agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about it. Lord, I need it now. Another stupid mistake. I\u2019m full of\nthem.\u201c He sighed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s going to be a long fight. She knows she can jerk\nme around by having her family on the board, figures it will improve her\nbargaining position. My divorce lawyer says a year or two until that changes.\u201d\n\nWe both sat there looking thoughtful. I was the first to talk. \u201cIs this\nlitigation result enough to threaten your role in the company?\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cNot if the stock wasn\u2019t community property. But it is. So I can\nonly vote half my stock. If the board baulks, and there is a new election of\nmembers of the Board, unclear if I keep control.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she was stupid enough to replace you, she\u2019d kill the company. That won\u2019t\nhelp her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she might see this case as so bad that her brother should take over.\u201d\nHe winced at the thought. \u201cI still control half the stock. But so we\ndeadlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad. If you deadlock, the court appoints a Receiver. That, alone, will kill\nyour company. The Receiver will be mediocre at running your business. Will\ntake no chances. And will be expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. So, if it comes down to a fight, to save the company, we will both put\nsomeone else in charge. And I am out of a job. Maybe.\u201d\n\nWe thought it out some more. He was getting upset enough to have to pace but\nwith crutches his pacing was merely trying to walk back and forth across the\noffice from me on his crutches. He soon realized how ridiculous it was. He\nfinally sat down again.\n\n\u201cThis is nuts. I\u2019m trying to run a company and make good decisions and have\npeople with a different agenda looking over my shoulder. And she knows if she\nmakes me really uncomfortable, I will be more inclined to pay her a premium\nfor her stock. Can\u2019t believe I let this happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in love. You didn\u2019t want a prenuptial agreement. You took our draft\nof a buy and sell and never signed it. Happens all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no room for love in business,\u201d he laughed bitterly. \u201cOK, you don\u2019t\nsettle. You keep fighting. How long until trial?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix months. Maybe nine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I got six months to get the Board in line, then. What can you do to\nsave the case?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe nullify Al by his change in testimony. That\u2019s easy. And the entire case\nbecomes circumstantial evidence. Why did they suddenly develop the formula?\nWhere else could they have obtained it but from Al? And, in effect, Al becomes\nour target. We say he either sold it or lost it and now has been bought by\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will crucify him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet. We may not win, what with having the burden of proof, but he will\nhave his reputation dragged through the mud. We have no choice now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me. He deserves it.\u201d He thought some more, fingers drumming.\nHis beeper rang..this was before cell phones...but he ignored it, staring out\nthe window.\n\n\u201cI could settle this tomorrow and move on, if I didn\u2019t have my ex in the\ncompany. Instead, I\u2019m going to spend another hundred thousand, maybe more, pay\nthem another hundred thousand in costs and probably lose. Sure it will cost\nthem more...but I have no real freedom of action anymore.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, then. \u201cI started a business to be in charge of my own life.\nNow I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t stand that.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take care of business when you could. A prenuptial and\na buy and sell and it would be unpleasant but you\u2019d still be free to run your\nbusiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. Now I pay the price. Understood.\u201d I saw that expression come over\nhis face that he had when he made up his mind. \u201cOK, keep fighting. I see if I\ncan make the Board slowly see to reason. If you get some great evidence, we\nkeep going. If not, we settle as soon as I can get the Board clearly on my\nside. \u201c He stood up on his crutches. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nI stood up to open the office door for him. \u201cYou got it. If nothing else it\nwill be fun to cross examine Al. He is in for a very unpleasant day or two.\u201d\n\nBen grinned then. \u201cI can see that.\u201d And hobbled out.\n\nOur deposition of Al was great fun for me. It lasted over three days, though\nby the second day it was clear that he admitted perjury either in originally\ntestifying for us or, now, testifying for the others. His various excuses of\nmemory changing sounded as stilted as the desperate objections of his\ndefending counsel, who I will call Bill. Bill was a good lawyer, an honest\nlawyer, had never done criminal law, which I had, and thus had no idea how to\ndefend a witness that was clearly lying. Indeed, I could tell he could hardly\nstand being in the room with him. Typical testimony:\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cSo, your recollection of the events altered only recently, is\nthat correct?\u201d\n\nWitness: \u201cAbout...maybe six months ago...but I really knew what happened all\nalong and I was just trying to keep my job.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cYou committed perjury to save your job? That\u2019s your testimony?\u201d\n\nCounsel: \u201cI object to that, Mr. Stimmel. You are putting words in his mouth.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cCounsel, he is apparently accusing my client and perhaps this\noffice of condoning perjury. Of using perjured testimony. We take such charges\nseriously. You may face the same claims in reverse in a few more months.\u201d\n\nCounsel: \u201cWe would never use perjury. I resent that.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cAre you accusing our office of condoning perjury, then?\u201d\n\nCounsel: \u201cOf course not, I did not infer anything of the sort. The witness\njust testified that he forgot the details of the event in question.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cMy recollection is that he testified he lied to keep his job.\nThat means we condoned perjury, according to the witness, and he has admitted\ncommitting a crime.\u201d\n\nWitness: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant my job mattered and my memory got\nconfused. I didn\u2019t commit perjury.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cSo, no one asked you to commit perjury?\u201d\n\nWitness: \u201cNo, of course not. I was just confused and worried about losing my\njob. I mean, losing the plans in a cab. I was worried.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cSo you lied to cover up?\u201d\n\nWitness: \u201cWell, you could call it that.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cBut you aren\u2019t lying now, then?\u201d\n\nWitness: \u201cNo. Not now.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cYou\u2019re sure of that?\u201d\n\nCounsel: \u201cObjection. Asked and answered. Also harassing the witness.\u201d\n\nLee Stimmel: \u201cWithdrawn. But perhaps the witness will tell us why we should\nbelieve him now when he committed perjury before.\u201d\n\nCounsel: \u201cObjection and I instruct my client not to answer. Argumentative.\u201d\n\nAnd so on...\n\nProving our own case was another matter. First, we had almost no damages since\nBen had designed around the stolen product thus they never cut into our own\nsales. Second, circumstantial evidence is well and good but we had no direct\nevidence of theft and our burden of proof required us to prove our case by a\npreponderance of the evidence. If the jury was unsure who was right-we lose.\n\nI knew that Ben was having increasingly bitter fights within his Board of\nDirectors. His ex-wife was directing her brother and sister to question almost\neverything he did, including the case, and the endless bickering led to the\nresignation of one of the directors previously on his side.\n\nThe replacement of that director was key to control of the company, the stock\nwas split and it was only a matter of time until a Receiver would be\nappointed. Sure enough, after a month of not being able to agree on the new\ndirector, the ex-wife\u2019s lawyer went to court and after an expensive hearing,\nthe court appointed a retired business man as the Receiver to be on the Board\nand act as tie breaker until the matter was resolved. At the cost of one\nhundred thousand a year.\n\nPerhaps three months before trial I received the call from the Receiver asking\nto be briefed on the matter. As the deciding vote on the divided Board, he was\ncritical to the future of the case, of course, but our firm represented\nmanagement, not the Board, so I needed Ben\u2019s approval before I could brief the\nBoard.\n\nBen sounded depressed on the phone. \u201cWon\u2019t matter what you say to him. He\u2019s\ngoing to tell you to pull the plug.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe case is not dead. We\u2019ve developed some pretty good evidence in the last\nfew months. Remember, we got some dynamite testimony from one of their\nsuppliers who was given a piece of paper for manufacturing purposes that may\nhave had your logo,.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me. But he doesn\u2019t have the paper any longer...just kinda remembers\nthe logo.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but that\u2019s still good stuff. I think we have a good chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you say so, I believe you. But it won\u2019t matter. No matter what you\ntell him the case is over and, most probably, so am I. They\u2019ll fire me next\nquarter.\u201d\n\nThis was the first I had heard of how desperate the situation was for Ben. It\nseems one of his other big gambles...launching a new product in the\nMidwest...had not borne fruit. Sales were mixed, overall sales down, and the\nReceiver was siding with his ex in-laws almost all the time now. \u201cAnd your\ndivorce? Still stalled?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet. Why hurry when they effectively are going to grab control of the\ncompany, fire me, figure the Receiver is cheaper than my salary, and punish me\nfor all the wrong I did poor old Eleanor.\u201d\n\nI had never heard him sound so bitter. \u201cSo, I\u2019m to settle?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do it now. No telling what those bums will instruct you to do once I\u2019m\ngone. They already blame me for blowing the company, might as well blame me\nfor this.\u201d\n\nIt took three weeks but the Taiwanese were delighted to settle with each side\nwalking away with no damages and each paying their own costs and attorneys\nfees. The testimony of their supplier and the fact that Al now worked for them\nand was clearly a liar made them very nervous about what an American jury\nwould do.\n\nAs I walked away from Court having entered the settlement in the record,\nopposing counsel came over to me to shake hands. He shrugged. \u201cNot our\ngreatest case, right, Lee? I had a witness who would lie about his mother\u2019s\nname and you had a CEO who has about a week left on the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard the news, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire industry knows it. Guess your guy didn\u2019t figure on what happens\nwhen stock is divided and a divorce comes along. Didn\u2019t you tell him to do a\nbuy and sell agreement?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s privileged. But, let\u2019s just say the lesson is clearly learned\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. And I guess my clients know not to hire liars and cheats and expect a\ngood result.\u201d\n\nWe shook hands and a trial I would have enjoyed never happened.\n\nBen was divorced about six months later, bought his wife out for an inflated\nsum, and went about rebuilding his company. But he was not the same man. He\nhad lost forty pounds during the crisis and at first I thought it was about\ngetting in fighting trim. Turned out it was cancer. Three years later he was\ndead, the company bought by the very same Taiwanese we had fought.I am\nconvinced the cancer was brought on by the years of stress.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nOne good thing. They fired Al within two weeks of settlement of the case.\nNever did learn what happened to him. Don\u2019t much care.\n\nAnd I have a good story to tell people who wonder why a company should spend\nthe time creating an effective buy and sell agreement.\n\nArticle Categories\n\nLessons from the Combat Zone - Lawyer's Stories with a Moral\n\nWar Stories\n\n## Share this article!\n\nEmailGmailYahoo MailCopy LinkShare\n\n### Related Articles\n\n##### Corporate Buy and Sell Agreements: What They Are and How to Use Them\n\n##### Corporate Struggles: Who Has What Power When Push Comes To Shove?\n\n##### Firing Officers of a California Corporation: How To Do It\n\n#### Find Articles in our Online Library\n\nFind helpful legal articles & summaries on key areas of the law!\n\n## Start resolving your legal matters - contact us today!\n\nFounded in 1939, our law firm combines the ability to represent clients in\ndomestic or international matters with the personal interaction with clients\nthat is traditional to a long established law firm.\n\nRead more about our firm\n\n\u00a9 2024, Stimmel, Stimmel & Roeser, All rights reserved | Terms of Use | Site by Bay Design\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
