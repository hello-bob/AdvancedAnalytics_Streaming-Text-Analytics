They cover Germany, Romania, Netherlands, UK and\nUS as well and have about 4,000 jobs in total.\n\nI found out about them because of their marketing strategy on Linkedin. Janusz\nused to be a software engineer, and so they often post memes on the harsh\nreality of working in tech.\n\nWhat I really liked about them is they only allow job ads that list the\nsalary.\n\nJobs can be filtered by location, job type, company type, experience and\nlanguage, including a few exotic languages and frameworks.\n\n## Juniordeveloper.careers\n\nJuniordeveloper.careers is a job board created by Ishaq Amin to help junior\ncandidates find jobs, amid the shortage of such roles in the UK.\n\nIt\u2019s great someone is helping young people get their first tech job and spread\nawareness that if you don\u2019t hire juniors, you will have an hard time finding\nseniors.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty new and has only a few UK roles, though junior roles have become\nincredibly rare in the last couple of years.\n\nIshaq is also active on Linkedin and posts tips on how to get into tech.\n\n## Remoteok\n\nRemoteok is a community-driven job board that has only remote jobs.\n\nMade by Pieter Levels, founder of Nomad List, it was made to help digital\nnomads find remote jobs. It was one of the first remote-only job boards.\n\nApparently it has some 45,000 jobs, and you have to signup to read the\ndescription and apply.\n\nThe jobs can be filtered by location, salary, benefits and category. The\ncategories are limited to function and mainstream programming language, so no\nsearching for Elixir or Nim.\n\n## Levels.fyi\n\nLevels.fyi provides job comparison, resume review and other job seeker\nservices.\n\nThey have 70,000 tech jobs spread across the world. From what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s\nmostly engineering jobs, including contract and remote roles. The jobs are\npublic, as is the application link.\n\nThey also publish salary data by location, company and role and have a\ncommunity forum with recent job market updates.\n\n## Trueup\n\nTrueup Trueup is one of my favourites sites related to the job market.\n\nIt\u2019s actually an aggregator with 215,000 tech jobs, more than any other in\nthis list. Rather than just listing the job description, they also provide\ninformation on the ATS the company uses and whether the company had layoffs.\n\nThey don\u2019t list contract roles, or at least there\u2019s no filter for it. You have\nto register to see all jobs or to apply.\n\nLike Levels, they too publish job market data. I\u2019ve used their weekly openings\nreport and layoffs report in other articles.\n\nI\u2019ve found their data to be accurate by comparing it with other sources, so it\nhas become my go-to site for job market insights.\n\n## F6s\n\nF6s is a startup community. They have a hidden, but public, job board with\nsome 10,000 jobs.\n\nThe jobs are worldwide and include roles from internship to co-founder in\ntech, marketing and sales.\n\nThe jobs are nothing exceptional, but there are few notable ones, especially\nfor those who are looking for co-founder jobs and other early startup roles.\n\n## Remoteleaf\n\nRemoteleaf is not a job board, rather a remote job subscription service.\n\nBasically they send a weekly email with a list of jobs matching each user\u2019s\npreferences.\n\nThe preferences include geographical region, programming languages such as\nRuby, Python and PHP. There are categories as well, like full-stack, front-end\nand devops.\n\nI have used it in the past when I was looking for Python roles. They always\nhad a 2-3 interesting jobs that I missed and I was thorough in my search.\n\n## More on tech recruitment\n\n  * ### Why everyone is looking for fullstack engineers\n\nPublished 16 January 2024\n\ntech recruitment\n\nThe request for fullstack engineers has become predominant in the last couple\nof years.\n\n  * ### How can a recruiter evaluate software engineers?\n\nUpdated 22 April 2024\n\ntech recruitment\n\nEvaluating software engineers can be confusing without programming experience.\nLet me a, software engineer, guide you.\n\n  * Blog\n  * Guides\n  * API documentation\n\n  * Support\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms and conditions\n\n  * Linkedin\n  * \u00a9 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
