Our affiliations are for the most part\nvoluntary. If someone sees their org do something bad or \u201cproblematic\u201d and\nchooses to remain affiliated, it stands to reason that they support the bad\nthing. One assumes that if they disagreed with the thing, they would\ndisaffiliate. Or perhaps they disagree with the bad thing but are willing to\ntolerate it in order to continue receiving the benefits of affiliation,\nselfishly putting their own interests above moral requirements.\n\nThanks for reading Tom Thought!

Loyalty, after all, was generally seen to be a virtue. You\nmight have a problem with some of the beliefs and stances of your church, your\npolitical party, etc, but you'd stand by them because that's what you do.\n\nThis sense of loyalty has eroded significantly. It isn't perceived to be an\nhonorable thing to stand by a bad person or organization out of a sense of\nduty. Instead, it's perceived as weak and cowardly to stand by while bad\nthings happen.\n\nI think this creates the conditions for a phenomenon I've started calling\n\u201cmoral drain.\u201d Moral drain is a self-reinforcing cycle. It starts when an\norganization does something wrong. This will cause the most morally upright /\nmorally sensitive people to disaffiliate, reducing the overall moral character\nof the org. This will lead to further bad things happening, causing more folks\nto disaffiliate. The logical outcome is the org ends up run entirely by the\nworst people possible.\n\nSince most power in society is mediated by various organizations and\ninstitutions, this dynamic essentially guarantees that the worst people in the\nworld monopolize access to power.\n\nIt seems to me like there are only two ways to prevent moral drain.\n\n  1. Make sure organizations always just do the right thing at all times so good people never feel like they have to distance themselves.\n\n  2. Encourage people of good character to stay in organizations even when they do bad things.\n\nOf these options, 2 seems more realistic to me.\n\nDoes this mean we should never pressure people to leave evil organizations? I\ndon't think so. But we should see this as a balancing concern. We should know\nthat we need to tolerate a certain amount of bad behavior from an organization\nwithout condemning the good people who continue in their affiliation.\n\nA lot also depends on the importance and power of the organization in\nquestion. The more power the organization wields, the more cautious we ought\nto be about simply ceding that power to evil folks.\n\nWe can also be strategic in how we think about these things. A coordinated\neffort to punish really terrible behavior with swift collapse might be quite\neffective. But it doesn't follow that an endless low-effort boycott will\nachieve similar effects. But we ought to actually think about what we're\ntrying to achieve with the incentives we create rather than blindly applying\nthe same approach in every situation.\n\nThanks for reading Tom Thought!
