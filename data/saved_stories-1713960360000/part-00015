The probe was shelved last year over \"the complete\nlack of legal cooperation\" from Israel.\n\nAfter receiving new information from French judicial authorities, Judge Jose\nLuis Calama decided to reopen Spain's investigation.\n\n## What is the Pegasus software?\n\nPegasus is a software that can be used on mobile phones to extract data or\nactivate a camera or microphone to spy on owners.\n\nDeveloped by Israel's NSO company, the spyware requires a government license\nfor export because it is considered a weapon.\n\nNSO insists that it is only made available to governments to fight terrorism\nand other security threats.\n\nPegasus has been used to target more than 1,000 people across 50 countries,\nincluding activists and journalists, according to security researchers and a\n2021 global media investigation.\n\n## Spanish politicians targeted\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Defense Minister Margarita Robles, Interior\nMinister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and Agriculture Minister Luis Planas were\namong those allegedly targeted in Spain.\n\n## Pegasus: the invisible spy\n\n01:46\n\nThe revelations caused a political crisis in the country that led to the\nresignation of its spy chief.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and several of his ministers were also\ntargeted.\n\n## Spain and France investigators to work together\n\nThe Spanish court said Tuesday, \"comparing the technical elements gathered in\nthe French investigation\" with the one in Spain \"may enable the investigation\nto progress... to trace the origin of the piracy.\"\n\nThe investigation is trying to discover who is responsible for the snooping.\nHowever, no one has been accused yet.\n\nThe judge ordered expert analysis to determine the authorship of the cyber\nattacks by cross-examining the technical elements collected in the French and\nSpanish investigations.\n\n\"All of this will allow for joint and coordinated action by the French and\nSpanish judicial authorities in order to determine the authorship of the\ninfestation carried out through the Pegasus spy programme in both France and\nSpain,\" the judge said.\n\nkm/lo (Reuters, AP)\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip next section Explore more\n\n## Explore more\n\n### EU Watergate?
