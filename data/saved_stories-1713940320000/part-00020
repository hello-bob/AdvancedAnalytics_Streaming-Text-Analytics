AI in libraries has been a\ntrending subject of interest for some time, as within the library there are\nnumerous departments that serve a role in collectively contributing to the\nlibrary\u2019s mission. Consequently, it is imperative to consider AI\u2019s influence\non the digital preservation of historic documents. This paper delves into the\nhistorical evolution of preservation methods driven by technological\nadvancements as, throughout history, libraries, archives, and museums have\ngrappled with the challenge of preserving historical collections, while many\nof the traditional preservation methods are costly and involve a lot of manual\n(human) effort. AI being the catalyst for transformation could change this\nreality and perhaps redefine the process of preservation; thus, this paper\nexplores the emerging trend of incorporating AI technology into preservation\npractices and provides predictions regarding the transformative role of\nArtificial Intelligence in preservation for the future. With that in mind,\nthis paper addresses the following questions: could AI be what changes or\ncreates a paradigm shift in how preservation is done?; and could it be the\nthing that will change the way history is safeguarded?\n\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI); libraries; digital preservation;\nhistorical collections; technological advancements\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe significance of delving into the intersection of Artificial Intelligence\nand the digital preservation of historical records lies in its dual\nimportance: safeguarding cultural heritage and recognizing the evolving\nlandscape of archives/preservation departments. It underscores the necessity\nfor these institutions to adapt and leverage emerging technologies to fulfill\ntheir crucial roles in preserving the past for the benefit of the present and\nfuture generations.\n\nHow exactly would AI make preserving documents digitally easier? Well,\nconsider the binary system or the binary code \u2013 the famous 1s and 0s. Digital\nobjects, 1s and 0s, are what underlie most computer systems \u2013 they are the\ninformation \u201cbits.\u201d These components, or \u201cbits,\u201d serve as the building blocks\nfor conveying various forms of information, encompassing text, numbers, audio,\nimages, and more. It is a language and this language handles the storage,\nprocessing, and transmission of digital information; in this way, it is an\n\u201cimportant element in modern technology, being employed as a means of\ncalculation in digital computers and as a means of controlling a considerable\nvariety of machine tools\u201d (Heath 1972, 6). Binary code can look like a\nstructure that stores data in a hierarchical manner (AI for Anyone n.d.), and\nAI makes this data easier to search and retrieve, as well as to update and\ndelete (AI for Anyone n.d.). So, why does this matter when it comes to\npreserving historical records?\n\nEssentially, it has been established that AI makes the digitization process\nmore efficient because it makes processes quicker and easier. But why does it\nneed to be quicker and easier, when it has been such a human-manual process\nfor years? Consider The National Library of Norway, who have been entrusted\nwith the monumental task of digitizing all printed materials published in\nNorway since 2006 (Takle 2009, 2). This mission is undeniably enormous, to say\nthe least. So, how can AI contribute to making this task more manageable? AI\npossesses the capability to analyze concepts and apply them effectively, which\nis good for metadata processes in creation of preservation: \u201cmorphological\nanalysis, part-of-speech tagging named entity recognition, word sense\ndisambiguation, machine learning, text processing and e\u2212governance services,\netc.\u201d (Das et al. 2022, 93). These automated various tasks could help preserve\nhistorical materials, by simplifying and expediting the digitation process.\nThis, in turn, could help ensure the longevity of these collections and\nprevent them from physical damage (because they would be digitized).\nTherefore, technology not only aids in the restoration of lost heritage but\nalso holds the potential to recreate it in remarkable ways (Das et al. 2022,\n95). With this in mind, the approach behind this paper is to explore the\nsynergy of Artificial Intelligence and archival research, examining how these\ntwo domains interact.\n\nPreservation came about as a result of wanting to help keep materials that\nwere deteriorating, for example, the Brittle Book Problem in the 1950s and the\n1960s (NEDCC n.d.). However, a lot of preservation is deciding what to\npreserve: \u201cto assess the subjects\u2019 strengths and weaknesses of any particular\nlibrary\u2019s collection\u201d (NEDCC n.d.). Utilizing AI assistance in making such\ndecisions, while acknowledging the necessity of streamlining, can aid in\nretaining materials, specifically, the decision of which materials to preserve\n\u2013 the materials that might otherwise be solely dismissed based on the library\nor museum\u2019s physical storage space.\n\nUsing Artificial Intelligence for preservation and digitization is not a\nfuturistic concept. Often, people react defensively or skeptically when they\nhear terms like Artificial Intelligence or machine learning. They may\nassociate these technologies with dystopian visions from movies like iRobot.\nHowever, the aim of this paper is to inspire and promote the use of AI for\npreservation and digitization.\n\nThe purpose of embracing the usage of Artificial Intelligence in archives and\npreservation is not to advocate for the complete human replacement in the\npreservation process, but rather to advocate for utilizing these tools to\nassist the professional by improving performance on certain tasks and allowing\nthe professional to allocate more of their valuable time to tasks that cannot\nbe effectively performed by existing technology. Most of the issues revolving\naround preservation have to do with cost-effectiveness and proper staffing,\nand AI can improve cost-effectiveness and reduce strain. In other words, it\ncould mean more time with the documents and less time with the system.\n\n## 2 Literature Review\n\nThe significance of AI in historic preservation becomes evident when\nreflecting on historical catastrophes, such as the 1966 flood in Florence.\nThis event marked a turning point for preservation and conservation efforts,\nprompting global attention and collective action to salvage cultural artifacts\n(Gerbracht and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg 2020, 200). AI extends the concept of\nsalvaging beyond physical preservation, offering the potential to create\ndigital duplicates enriched with various elements from the original, such as\nwritten text, seals, symbols, and features specific to the first copy or make\nof an item.\n\nRecent advancements in technology, specifically within digitizing, have\nsignificantly eased the challenging task of preserving cultural heritage. As\nGoudaroli, Sexton, and Sheridan (2019, n.p.) state, \u201cthe arrival of new\ninformation and communication technologies radically alters the ways in which\npeople create, access, and engage with information and archival records.\u201d\nTechnology has continued to advance over the past few decades at an\nunprecedented rate; innovations available today would have been unheard of\nonly a short time ago. Artificial Intelligence (AI), as the future architect,\nhas now emerged as a pivotal force in safeguarding our unique cultural legacy\nfor generations to come (Ibaraki 2019). Recognizing the potential of AI in\ndigital preservation prompts an exploration of its relevance in historic\npreservation. While Ibaraki\u2019s article dates back to 2019, the past year has\nwitnessed a remarkable surge in the integration of AI into our daily lives;\nnotable examples include the widespread adoption of technologies such as\nChatGPT, face ID for phones, digital voice assistants, and smart home devices.\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the integration of AI into various domains,\nsuch as preservation, is expanding.\n\nOne intriguing application of AI in digital preservation involves the use of a\nclassical model for handwriting recognition referred to as a \u201cCRNN\n(Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) with image line-level data\u201d (Ferro et\nal. 2023 560). This innovative approach employs image extraction capabilities\ncoupled with sequence modeling, and the model not only recognizes handwriting\nbut also captures crucial features and context within the input data (Ferro et\nal. 2023). Consequently, it transforms handwritten content into a more\nreadable format, facilitating easier comprehension and conversion through a\nsearchable and accessible form. Imagine the world of opportunity that opens\nwhen old, even ancient text is able to be scanned, processed, and searched \u2013\nquickly \u2013 as one would do with a regular research inquiry.\n\nAdditionally, take, for instance, the preservation efforts for the Great Wall\nof China \u2013 a formidable undertaking for architects and historians.\nConstruction began, on the wall, in c. 220 B.C. and the wall stretches around\n20,000 km long (UNESCO 2018), with some sections of the wall inaccessible,\nmaking manual examinations laborious (Ibaraki 2019). To address this, Intel\ncollaborated with the China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation,\nemploying cutting-edge drone technology, with thousands of photos collected\nand analyzed using AI to identify precise areas requiring restoration (Ibaraki\n2019). Alyson Griffin, Intel\u2019s Vice President of global brand and thought\nleadership marketing, emphasizes that this approach enables quicker, more\nefficient, and cost-effective restoration by providing accurate information\n(Ibaraki 2019). The technology powering the drone, the AI, stands as a\ntestament to the remarkable manifestations of cutting-edge technology at work\nin terms of aiding in preservation processes.\n\nIt would also be remiss not to acknowledge the transformative impact of\ndigital preservation on storage paradigms, even before the era of AI and now\nwith AI and its ongoing influence. Colavizza et al. (2021, 2, 4) emphasize\nthat this evolution commenced well before the advent of big data, as archives\nquantified their extensive collections in physical terms, spanning kilometers\nof files and folders, with the choice of storage medium inherently linked to\nsize considerations, with physical collections dictating the allocation of\ntangible space. In contrast, the integration of digitization has introduced\nnew considerations for digital collections, such as cloud storage and gigabyte\ncapacity. The global emphasis on extensive digitization efforts has\ntransformed substantial portions of archives into digital data, presenting a\npotential area where AI could offer assistance in the future. Consequently,\nthis shift has posed fresh challenges for archivists dealing with historical\nmaterials; Aangenendt (2022, 5) notes that archivists are now tasked with\nfinding innovative methods to collect and preserve the diverse array of born-\ndigital media formats and content types that encapsulate contemporary\ninformation about society and public life.\n\nInterestingly, amidst this landscape, major institutions are increasingly\nturning to AI for the management of older materials rather than focusing\nsolely on born-digital media.\n\nAangendent (2022) study, which involved interviews with professionals in the\nSwedish archival sector, revealed a noteworthy trend in this regard. The study\nfound that the Swedish National Archives, the Stockholm City Archive, the\nPopular Movements\u2019 Archive in Uppsala, and the Centre for Business History are\npresently not actively exploring AI for born-digital archival material.\nInstead, there is a predominant focus on prioritizing the digitization and\naccessibility of older analogue materials (Aangendent 2022, 35).\n\nMore recent work by Marchello et al. (2023) delved into the use of AI-driven\nrobotics for cultural heritage digital preservation. The concept revolves\naround creating digital twins \u2013 3D copies or scans \u2013 of cultural heritage\nentities. This approach not only enhances accessibility to a broader audience\nbut also introduces the concept of self-maintenance. Digital twins can\nfacilitate predictive maintenance of physical assets by continuously\nmonitoring data from sensors, thus preventing costly downtime and repairs\n(Marchello et al. 2023, 995\u2013996).\n\nDrawing insights from Ibaraki\u2019s work in 2019 and the more recent findings by\n(Marchello et al.2023), it becomes evident that AI-driven tools are\nrevolutionizing the preservation of historical artifacts. Yet, this marks only\nthe beginning. Another dimension of historical preservation involves data that\ngoes beyond models or robotics; instead, it entails the assignment of data to\nobjects, items, pictures, etc., aiding preservationists in classifying their\ncollections \u2013 also known as assigning metadata: \u201cAI can support metadata\ncreation for images by generating descriptions, titles, and keywords for\ndigital collections in libraries\u201d (Reiche 2023, n.p.). This offers a potential\nreduction in time and resource requirements for hands-on tasks, as,\ntraditionally, assigning metadata to preserved content has been a time-\nconsuming process. This not only enhances efficiency in the preservation\nworkflow, but also allows preservationists to channel their efforts toward\ntheir other duties.\n\nCushing and Osti (2022) conducted a comprehensive study exploring the\nperspectives of international archives and digital preservation professionals\non the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on digital archive expertise and\nits likely future applications. The findings revealed a widespread expectation\namong participants that AI would play a central role in archival work. As\nemphasized in PD203, participants expressed the belief that AI would become an\nintegral tool for librarians, information professionals, and archivists across\nvarious roles (Cushing and Osti 2022, 19).\n\nHowever, the authors also highlighted some concerns raised by participants,\nincluding the potential for AI to introduce additional tasks and the need to\ncarefully review AI-generated data before granting access to patrons, while\nquestions also arose about how to seamlessly integrate AI into existing\nworkloads (Cushing and Osti 2022, 19). Notably, the authors did not delve into\nspecific benefits resulting from the implementation of AI in day-to-day\npractices but did acknowledge the perceived value of AI technology in\nenhancing archival processes.\n\nAdditionally, the study by Cushing and Osti (2022, n.p.) highlighted a\nprevailing theme of \u201coptimism\u201d among participants concerning the role of AI in\nthe digitization of archives.\n\nThus, it is understood that AI can take many different forms and impact\nvarious aspects of digitizing historical archives. As the European Parliament\n(2023, 1) eloquently noted in the summary of their briefing, \u201cthe results [of\nAI] are both promising and surprising: reconstructing a piece of art,\ncompleting an unfinished composition of a great musician, identifying the\nauthor of an ancient text, or providing architectural details for a potential\nreconstruction of the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral would have seemed like\nscience fiction just a few years ago.\u201d\n\n## 3 Discussion\n\nThe principle underlying digital preservation aligns with the preservation of\naccess to digital heritage, ensuring its ongoing accessibility to the public\n(UNESCO 2003, para. 4). The main purpose for digitization in the realm of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is apparent \u2013 the facilitation of ease and\nincreased accessibility. However, the discussion also opens avenues for\nexploring the inherent complexities in preserving digital artifacts,\nemphasizing the trade-offs between the value of originals and the imperative\nof prioritizing access.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that duplicates, models, or copies of original\nitems may never attain the exact same value or reverence as some historical\nartifacts. Nevertheless, the emphasis should shift towards prioritizing access\nto these items, as deterioration of originals is at times unavoidable.\nConsider the dilemma of entirely losing an item versus having access to an\nalmost identical twin \u2013 which holds greater significance? This prompts a\nreconsideration of the traditional notions of preservation, urging a paradigm\nshift towards prioritizing accessibility over losing something completely.\n\nThe barriers to achieving seamless digital preservation are numerous, with\ntechnological obsolescence standing out as a prominent challenge. The rapid\npace of technological evolution introduces a formidable barrier, questioning\nthe sustainability of preservation efforts, and a comprehensive solution to\ncoping with ever-evolving technologies remains elusive. The fundamental\nquestion surfaces: how do we determine what to preserve when faced with\nconstant advancements?\n\nPreservationists grapple with this question extensively, recognizing the\nsubjective nature of significance. What holds importance for one individual,\nbased on personal experiences, nostalgia, or cultural relevance, may not carry\nthe same weight for another. However, the introduction of AI into the\npreservation landscape introduces a potential avenue for overcoming this\nbarrier, as AI\u2019s ability to optimize storage, discern patterns, and facilitate\ndecision-making could potentially alleviate the burden of subjective choices.\nCould AI play a role in preserving more, while necessitating fewer decisions\non what to discard?\n\nAs Fisher (2017) notes, \u201canother set of barriers to digital preservation, and\nperhaps the most frequently discussed, relates to resource limitations.\u201d\nResource constraints further compound the challenges associated with digital\npreservation, necessitating a judicious approach to allocation. Integrating AI\ncould potentially address resource limitations by streamlining processes.\n\nDespite the existing barriers at both the individual and broader professional\nlevels, opportunities tend to prevail, often overshadowing these challenges.\nAs previously outlined \u2013 resource limitations, the dilemma of what to retain,\nduplicative value, and the quick pace of advancements, among others \u2013 these\nbarriers also harbor a positive side. As articulated by Das, Maringati, and\nDash (2022, 1), \u201cTechnology not only helps to restore the lost heritage but\nalso does wonders in recreating it.\u201d\n\nThe clear objective is to leverage AI for improving accessibility to cultural\nheritage that may be at risk of loss, a concern shared by numerous\npreservationists. Barlindhaug (2022, 12) underscores this goal in reference to\nthe use of AI to archive a multitude of documents in Norway\u2019s National\nLibrary, expressing the aspiration that it will provide future generations\nwith an unbiased collection of historical material that is readily available\nfor further research.\n\n## 4 Recommendation\n\nAfter reviewing the research, individuals involved in preservation, archiving,\nor digitization should undertake their own investigations to understand how\nthis emerging technology could enhance their work. The findings strongly\nindicate that Artificial Intelligence can play a significant role in\npreserving historical materials. However, its relevance to specific\nassignments ultimately depends on the preferences of the individuals utilizing\nit.\n\nWhen contemplating the possible incorporation of AI into preservation and\narchiving procedures, it is crucial to carefully assess the ethical\nimplications. AI, a frequently debated subject, carries both advantageous and\ndetrimental consequences, particularly concerning issues such as bias and\nprivacy (Lund and Wang 2023), and it is imperative for archivists to be\nmindful of these potential challenges when deciding on the application of AI\nin their processes. Further research into the critical topic of AI in the\npreservation of materials is warranted as, presently, very little literature\nexists on this topic. Archival researchers should leverage their expertise to\ninvestigate these issues and create a body of literature needed to support\npractitioners in decision-making surrounding AI for preservation purposes.\n\nA suggested initial move in incorporating AI into the preservation process\ncould be to task it with assigning metadata at a smaller scale, such as year,\nrelative condition, type, and so on. This approach would allow professionals\nin the field to acclimate to the workings of this technology, experiencing its\nbenefits and assistance in a reversible, less permanent manner.\n\n## 5 Conclusions\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence technologies into the archival and\npreservation process presents both challenges and opportunities. This paper\nhas highlighted a clear desire within the profession for AI assistance, with\nprofessionals expressing optimism about its potential benefits. On the flip\nside, as is customary with any emerging technology, there is a sense of\nanticipation regarding how it will unfold and the potential influence it might\nhave on the established processes within the field.\n\nMany individuals, particularly those employed in the work of history and\npreservation, possess a natural curiosity about new technologies. This\ninherent inquisitiveness should be extended to embrace AI, recognizing it not\nas a barrier but as a significant opportunity to improve the quality and\nefficiency of archival work. While it is widely acknowledged that challenges\nexist in the realm of AI, especially during these early phases of development\nin generative Artificial Intelligence technology, it also holds the potential\nto serve as a valuable aid in safeguarding history and supporting the efforts\nof preservationists and archivists alike.\n\nCorresponding author: Zo\u00eb (Abbie) Teel, College of Information-Student,\nUniversity of North Texas, 3940 N Elm St, 76203-1277 Denton, TX, USA, E-mail:\nabigailteel@gmail.com\n\n## References\n\nAI for Anyone. n.d.
