Please note that I do\nnot assume that I'm always (or perfectly) right -- I might be wrong! Or simply\nforget to take some painful side effect or showstopping complication into\naccount. But I bias to action and believe its better to try than not. To\niterate and learn from our mistakes, as we go.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn my lifetime so far I've seen *massive* advances in some domains (like in\ncomputing) but only slight to modest improvements in other ones (eg. cars, or\nfood safety). Effectively none at all in some (eg. public restrooms.) And a\nfew areas matters seem to have gotten noticeably & significantly worse by now\ncompared to when I was a kid. (eg. major party patriotism & the stability of\ndemocracy itself in the US; balance of privacy vs surveillance; allowed\nflavors of discrimination & truly equal rights.)\n\nThis massive imbalance across domains boggles my mind! Because I assumed we'd\nsee big strides in ALL areas of life. I believe I know why some areas are\nmoving more slowly, whereas some areas are held back (by apparent intent) by\nvested interests with selfish or parasitic motives. Think \"institutional\ncapture\" or metaphorical rent-seekers.\n\nDespite the exact reason or excuse we should still try! We should keep our\ndreams for a better world alive. And try to get as *many* ideas implemented\nand adopted, at scale, as we can. Wherever \"they\" allow us (where the specific\n\"they\" in question varies by domain, in terms of the vested interests who\ndominate it or effectively wield a veto.)\n\nI picked the name Utopian because I feel it most closely fits my goals and\ninterests and mindset. I didn't want to say Democrat or Republican, or say I\nwas a conservative, libertarian, liberal, progressive or socialist. Because\nthey all have specific political assumptions each. They each have baggage.\nGood and bad, whether fairly ascribed or not. I'd prefer to avoid getting put\ninto a bucket that causes someone to make the wrong assumptions about my aims.\n\nThe unifying theme (from my persective anyway) is to try, earnestly, to take\nsteps towards a kind of real-world everyday utopia. Reached pragmatically, by\nany means necessary. And for the specific advancements I have already in my\nlist of ideas I know they dont all fit neatly into a so-called leftwing or\nrightwing or even a centrist agenda. They are all over the traditional\nspectrum.\n\nA short list of ways to improve the world (at least my country, the US):\n\n* President requirements become more strict: to better filter out obvious/likely traitors, proven serial liars or the dangerously insane\n\n* parent licensing\n\n* ban minors in restaurants (so all their loud craziness, stress, mess & disruption go away, and all adults present can better eat, communicate & relax in peace)\n\n* ban backyard/outdoor-based dogs in home neighborhoods\n\n* public restrooms with better ergonomic standards (I have a private list I maintain elsewhere titled RestroomsDoneRight, with dozens of obvious (and cheap to implement) best practices & design rules which 99% of US locations (that the author has experienced directly, anyway) seem oddly ignorant or apathetic about)\n\n* UBI (universal basic income)\n\n* massively more simple, fair & automated taxes (I have a specific design proposal written elsewhere titled TaxZen; gigantic improvememts are possible and the math will still work out!)\n\n* meritocratic elections: idea is not ALL voters/votes should count equally; rather some should have greater weight than others, based on relevant and objective merits & uniform rules/standards\n\n### Subscribe to Synystron Synlogica\n\nLaunched 10 months ago\n\non programming, software engineering, performance & scalability, climate,\ndemocracy, Utopianism, sci-fi and comedy...\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I'm A Utopian\n\nsynystron.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nRIP Bram Moolenaar\n\nRIP Bram Moolenaar (I just heard about it.
