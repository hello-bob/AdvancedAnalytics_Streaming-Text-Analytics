Isabel Kua/Reuters\n\nBlog Post by Joshua Kurlantzick\n\nApril 25, 2024 3:27 pm (EST)\n\nAfter some twenty years in office, Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien\nLoong, has announced his intention to step down, paving the way for Finance\nMinister and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong to be the next prime minister\nstarting on May 15 and to lead the long-ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP)\ninto the next general election.\n\nWong comes into the office with numerous strengths. The PAP has prepped him\nfor two years as the centerpiece of what it calls the \u201c4G\u201d or fourth\ngeneration of party leaders, and thus of Singapore. Despite a growing\nopposition presence in parliament, the PAP will almost surely triumph in the\nnext election. Wong is a more natural politician than some of the other\ncandidates who were in the running to replace Lee Hsien Loong. For example, he\nshowed his leadership skills during COVID-19, as Lee noted in a Facebook post\nannouncing the shift and Wong\u2019s elevation. Wong also has held a diversity of\npositions and jobs, unlike some PAP members, giving him potentially greater\ninsight into more sectors of Singaporean society and also the many domestic\nand regional issues the city-state now faces.\n\nMore on:\n\nSingapore\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nChina\n\nWhile Lee did not exactly take office at a calm time\u2014the war on terror was in\nfull form, and Singapore was both a terrorism target for Southeast Asia-based\nmilitants and also enlisted as a partner in the global battle by the United\nStates\u2014Wong takes office with the city-state confronting a broader range of\nchallenges. At home, the PAP, though still the dominant force, now faces a\nmore organized political opposition that can no longer be easily marginalized\nas a small group unrepresentative of Singaporean society. The opposition may\nboost its seat count in the next election, giving it more leeway in parliament\nto monitor and criticize the PAP.\n\n###\n\nAsia Unbound\n\n#### CFR fellows and other experts assess the latest issues emerging in Asia\ntoday. 1-3 times weekly.\n\nView all newsletters >\n\n### Eyes on Asia\n\n#### Insights and analysis from CFR fellows on the latest developments across\nAsia.

Iswaran. He has been\nindicted on thirty-five charges (and counting) related to bribery and\ncorruption, with the prosecution charging that he took a range of gifts from a\nMalaysian tycoon and developer, as well as from another contractor. His\nindictment comes on the heels of other problems in the PAP, which the\nopposition will surely highlight in the run-up to the next general election.\nThese include a mini-scandal from last year in which two PAP members of\nparliament resigned because they were having an affair, and, as Al Jazeera\nnotes, around the same time, \u201ctwo senior government ministers were publicly\nscrutinized for their rental of state-owned colonial-era bungalows. An\ninvestigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, but prompted some to question\nhow the ministers could rent the properties, given that contracts are awarded\nthrough a bidding process.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore, always trying to hedge between its economic relationship\nwith China and its desire to maintain a close security partnership with the\nUnited States, is finding this balance even more challenging to strike than it\nwas in the early days of Lee\u2019s time as prime minister. China is far more\ndominant economically in the region than it was in the past. As Xi Jinping has\ncracked down on private enterprise, significant numbers of mainland Chinese\nentrepreneurs, business leaders, and other wealthy citizens have decamped for\nSingapore, where the population is majority Chinese, the environment is far\nmore open to private enterprise, and the city-state has a history of no\ntaxation on capital gains and a wealth of private banking services catering to\nthe super-elite. While this massive infusion of wealth has bolstered the city-\nstate\u2019s economy in some ways, the government seems unsure how to handle the\ninflux and its possible impact on property and rental prices, overall\ninflation, and domestic Singaporean entrepreneurship. The government also has\nconcerns about how some of this Chinese wealth was earned: last year, it\narrested and charged several Chinese nationals with money laundering and\nrelated crimes. The Singaporean government is also coming to terms with the\nfact that its historically minimal social welfare net needs to be modernized\nand expanded, an approach Wong will likely continue in Lee\u2019s wake.\n\nChina is now far more aggressive in regional waters and far more ambitious\nmilitarily than when Lee assumed office in 2004. Other than the Philippines,\nwhich under Ferdinand Marcos Jr. seems to be clearly siding with the United\nStates on security issues despite China\u2019s economic might, all the other\nSoutheast Asian states (save tiny Laos, Cambodia, and war-torn Myanmar) are\nstill trying to hedge between the region\u2019s great powers.\n\nBut it is getting tougher, even for a country with the wealth, significant\ndiplomatic influence, and skilled diplomatic corps that Singapore possesses,\nto hedge between the two powers. China is playing a larger role, or at least\nattempting to play a larger role, in the domestic politics of every state in\nSoutheast Asia, and Singapore is no exception. Growing worries about Chinese\ninfluence within Singapore\u2019s domestic politics are common among senior\nSingaporean officials, and parliament has passed a tough foreign interference\nlaw. Yet the population overall seems far less concerned about this kind of\nChinese influence than officials, especially those in the intelligence and\ndefense realms. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which resonates among\nSingapore\u2019s sizable Muslim minority, hurts the United States\u2019 image in the\ncity-state. Further, Washington\u2019s inability through multiple administrations\nto play any significant role in East Asia\u2019s growing trade integration has also\nimpacted perceptions of the United States.\n\nMore on:\n\nSingapore\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nChina\n\nThe PAP, including Wong, cannot help but notice that there is a growing divide\nbetween Singaporean elites, who seem most concerned about the prospect of a\nregion dominated by China, and the populace, which seems relatively unbothered\nby this scenario.\n\nWong will have to navigate all these challenges in just a few weeks while also\npreparing the PAP for a contested general election and reassuring the public,\nwhich has mostly been led by members of the Lee family, that he is ready on\nall these fronts.\n\nCreative Commons: Some rights reserved.\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-\nNoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\n\nView License Detail\n\n### Explore More\n\n## Numbers of Visitors to China Rises From Pandemic-Era Lows\n\n## China's Retrograde Rural Land Policies\n\n## The China-North Korea Relationship\n\n  * About\n  * Member Programs\n  * Contact\n  * Support\n  * For Media\n  * Newsletters\n  * Membership\n  * Careers\n\n\u00a92024 Council on Foreign Relations.
