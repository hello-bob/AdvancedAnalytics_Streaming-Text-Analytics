Dolby Vision is\nan alternative to the likes of the HDR10+ format.\n\nDolby Vision is proprietary but there's been ongoing open-source work such as\nfrom VideoLAN's libplacebo library, the x265 encoder, MPV, and more. There's\nbeen a recent flurry of FFmpeg commits for working on Dolby Vision coding\nsupport.\n\nGoing back to last month in FFmpeg Git was adding Dolby Vision \"dovi\"\nextension blocks and other prep work. Now committed to FFmpeg Git this week is\nDolby Vision coding for FFmpeg with libx265, libaomenc for AV1, and libsvtav1\nfor Intel's SVT-AV1 speedy AV1 encoder.\n\nSo for those interested in Dolby Vision coding support with the widely-used\nFFmpeg software, see the latest FFmpeg Git. This is some nice feature work to\nlook past the recent feature-packed FFmpeg 7.0 release.\n\n1 Comment\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nAudacity 3.5 Brings Cloud Project Saving, Improved BSD Support\n\nMPV 0.38 Media Player Released With New Options & Fixes\n\nRNNoise 0.2 Released With AVX2 Optimizations For Neural Network Noise\nSuppression\n\nFFmpeg 7.0 Released With Native VVC Decoding & Multi-Threaded CLI\n\nFlowblade 2.14 Video Editor Released, GTK4 Port Hopefully Ready Next Year\n\nIntel VA-API 2.21 Library Adds Intel Xe Kernel Driver Support, AV1 & Windows\nFixes\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
