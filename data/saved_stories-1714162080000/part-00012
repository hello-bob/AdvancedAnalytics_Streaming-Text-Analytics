The Food and Drug Administration has been\nteeing up clinical trials for MDMA and magic mushrooms. Lawmakers from both\nparties have endorsed \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies to combat the opioid crisis.\nCompared to the zero-tolerance policies of the recent past, this emerging\napproach to drug control is less focused on criminal punishment and more\nattentive to the costs and benefits of different substances and interventions.\n\nAlthough few recall it now, the same basic approach almost won out a half-\ncentury ago\u2014in the courts. Litigants brought hundreds of constitutional\nchallenges to punitive drug laws during the 1960s and 1970s. And they secured\npathbreaking rulings from federal and state judges who deemed the laws\narbitrary, authoritarian, and cruel.\n\nAlmost all of those rulings were narrowed or overturned by the 1980s, paving\nthe way for the escalation of drug penalties and militarization of drug\nenforcement under President Reagan and his successors. But this overlooked\nchapter in our constitutional history is worth revisiting. It shows how\nconstitutional law could have denied the worst excesses of the war on drugs,\ninstead of becoming ever more defined by them, and offers clues about how to\nresist draconian drug policies today.\n\n* * *\n\nThe 1960\u201370s turn toward the Constitution to fight punitive drug laws was in\nmany ways a return. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, opponents of\nsuch laws challenged them in court on grounds of government overreach. Even\nthough they increasingly approved restrictions on the manufacture and sale of\nintoxicants, the authorities \u201cwere unanimous in maintaining that\nconstitutional provisions protected possession,\u201d as one scholar observed in\n1919. \u201c[T]he inalienable rights possessed by the citizens ... of seeking and\npursuing their safety and happiness ... would be but an empty sound,\u201d the\nKentucky Court of Appeals explained ten years earlier, \u201cif the Legislature\ncould prohibit the citizen the right of owning or drinking liquor.\u201d\n\nThis legal framework fell apart in the 1910s, never to return, after a wave of\nprohibitory laws swept the nation and courts embraced a broader view of the\ngovernment\u2019s regulatory powers. By the mid-twentieth century, state and\nfederal lawmakers had constitutional carte blanche to penalize drug possession\nand consumption as well as production and distribution. They did so with\nmounting severity into the 1960s.\n\nOver the course of that decade, however, a variety of developments put the\nquestion of drug rights back into play. Surging use of illicit drugs by\nVietnam veterans, students, and college-educated professionals created new\nconstituencies for reform. Government bodies issued report after report urging\nrelaxation of the drug laws, especially the marijuana laws, as did\nestablishment groups ranging from the American Bar Association and the\nAmerican Medical Association to the Consumers Union and the National Council\nof Churches.\n\nThe National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, for instance, concluded\nin 1972 that intermittent use of marijuana \u201ccarries minimal risk to the public\nhealth\u201d and recommended decriminalization. The Nixon administration\u2019s health\ndepartment sponsored a study\u2014blocked from publication but leaked to\njournalists\u2014that found young people\u2019s use of psychedelics can be \u201chighly\nmoral, productive, and personally fulfilling.\u201d The Ford administration put out\na white paper urging that drug policy be refocused on substances such as\nheroin that have \u201cthe highest costs to both society and the user.\u201d\n\nReform-minded lawyers saw an opportunity. Building on the Warren Court\u2019s civil\nliberties decisions, they began to argue that specific drug bans may violate\nthe Constitution even if the government has expansive authority to regulate\ndrugs in general. And many judges responded with newfound sympathy. The\ndefendant in a low-level drug case, two Michigan justices warned in an opinion\nthat drew national headlines, \u201ccould have been any mother\u2019s son or daughter.\u201d\n\nSome judges in the 1970s held that classifying marijuana as a narcotic, or\ntogether with narcotics, is so illogical as to violate the Constitution\u2019s\nEqual Protection Clause. That clause, the Supreme Court had instructed,\nrequires criminal classifications to be at least minimally reasonable. Drawing\non the latest medical research, these judges determined that lumping marijuana\nwith the most dangerous substances fails even this minimal requirement while,\nin the words of the Connecticut Superior Court, \u201cundermin[ing] a fundamental\nrespect for the law\u201d and imposing \u201cstaggering\u201d social costs. Had this line of\nrulings prevailed, marijuana would have been removed from the most restrictive\ndrug schedules\u2014fifty years before President Biden\u2019s plea to the D.E.A. to do\njust that.\n\nSome judges in the 1970s argued that criminal bans on \u201csoft drugs\u201d violate the\nright to privacy implicit in the Due Process Clause. In light of the Court\u2019s\nrecent privacy decisions involving contraception and abortion, retired Justice\nTom Clark opined in 1972 that his former colleagues \u201cmight find it difficult\nto uphold a prosecution for possession\u201d of marijuana. The Alaska Supreme Court\nrefused to uphold such a prosecution three years later, in a ruling that is\nstill seen by international lawyers as \u201c[t]he early land mark case on\ndecriminalization for constitutional reasons.\u201d Had the constitutional case for\nmarijuana decriminalization prevailed, millions of Americans\u2014including\ndisproportionate numbers of Black and Brown Americans\u2014would have been spared\nharassment, humiliation, and arrest at the hands of police officers looking\n(or claiming to look) for pot.\n\nSome judges in the 1970s struck down criminal penalties for drug offenses as\n\u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d in contravention of the Eighth Amendment.\nAfter the Supreme Court held in 1962 that it is impermissibly cruel to punish\npeople for the status of being an addict, a series of lower courts reasoned\nthat it must likewise be cruel to punish them for procuring or consuming a\ndrug to which they\u2019re addicted. Other courts threw out long prison sentences\nfor nonviolent, nontrafficking offenses as needlessly excessive. Had these\ndecisions taken hold, harm reduction principles would have become part of our\nsupreme law and helped check the explosion of the prison population.\n\nFinally, some judges in the 1970s ruled that drug bans infringe the \u201cfree\nexercise\u201d of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment when the drugs at\nissue serve a sacramental function. These rulings relied on a 1964 decision by\nthe California Supreme Court, which protected the Native American Church\u2019s\nceremonial use of peyote. Although that decision was widely followed, judges\nwere wary of extending it to other sects or substances. Had the effort to\nextend such religious exemptions succeeded, many more adults would have had\nlegal access to the \u201cclassical psychedelics\u201d that are now entering therapeutic\npractice.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the drug war was in full swing and these constitutional\narguments had faded into obscurity. They were well within the mainstream of\nconstitutional thought in the 1970s, however. Even among the judges who\nrejected these arguments, a striking share not only acknowledged their force\nbut also expressed open skepticism of the drug laws they upheld.\n\nIn defense of their decisions, these judges cited the value of judicial\nrestraint and warned of the legal chaos that could result if they recognized\ntoo many claims of personal liberty or constitutionalized hard calls about the\ndangerousness of various substances. They had a point, even if they tended to\noverstate it. The pro-regulatory model of judicial review that liberals had\nchampioned ever since the New Deal, which demanded only a \u201crational basis\u201d to\njustify most government measures, had not been designed to address policy\nfailure. Many judges didn\u2019t know what to do with a set of criminal justice and\npublic health policies that were themselves alleged to be criminogenic and a\nthreat to public health.\n\nConstitutional rights review had been designed, instead, to respond to claims\nof mistreatment brought by \u201cdiscrete and insular minorities,\u201d who share a\nreasonably cohesive social identity. The late-twentieth-century campaigns for\ngay rights and gun rights fit this bill. Illicit drug users, by contrast, were\nnot so much a discrete and insular minority as an anonymous and diffuse\nplurality of the population: dispersed throughout all segments of society,\npoorly organized, largely in the closet. No deep sense of solidarity, no\nidentitarian glue, knit together drug users, attorneys, and activists in a\ncoalition capable of applying sustained constitutional pressure. When the\ncourt victories dried up, the drug-rights movement collapsed.\n\n* * *\n\nToday\u2019s drug reformers thus find themselves in a strange situation. There is\nbipartisan consensus, on the one hand, that draconian drug laws have been a\ntravesty and, on the other, that the Constitution has nothing to say about\nthem\u2014even as high courts abroad have been leading the charge for drug\nliberalization. \u201cConstitutional courts are increasingly ruling that the\ndecision to use narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances falls within the\nscope of the moral autonomy of adults,\u201d the Inter-American Juridical Committee\nof the Organization of American States noted in 2014. In democracies as\ndiverse as Argentina, Canada, Georgia, and South Africa, constitutional\nprotections for personal drug use are taking off. In the United States, the\nvery idea of drug rights strikes most lawyers as outlandish.\n\nHistory suggests that constitutional advocacy could still do important work,\nnotwithstanding the progress that has been made. One role is to guard against\nfuture backsliding. American drug policy has been characterized by cycles of\nracialized moral panic and reactionary legislation, punctuated by periods of\nliberalization. Now that the country finds itself in another moment when\nhumane, evidence-based drug reform is on the table, proponents would do well\nto entrench as much of it in constitutional law as they can before the next\npanic arrives.\n\nBeyond trying to lock in policy gains, constitutional advocates could harness\nrecent scholarship to attack the harshest laws still on the books. They might,\nfor instance, draw on research into the framers\u2019 surprisingly expansive\nunderstanding of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d when they wrote the Eighth\nAmendment in 1791, or on a burgeoning interdisciplinary literature that\ndepicts psychedelic drug bans as impediments to \u201ccognitive liberty.\u201d State\ncourts may be especially receptive to the constitutional claims that have\ncarried the day in other countries, about how the private burdens imposed by\ncertain drug laws are grossly disproportionate to their public benefits.\n\nJudicial decisions can\u2019t solve deep-seated social problems like opioid\noverdose. But they can at least serve as a brake on overincarceration and\nforce lawmakers to acknowledge when their drug policies do more harm than\ngood.\n\nImportantly, constitutional arguments can also be addressed to audiences other\nthan courts. Many of the institutional considerations that have made judges\nreticent to wade into drug debates don\u2019t apply to the other branches.\nLegislators and administrators have an independent duty to respect the rights\nof drug users and to reject policies that, as President Carter once put it,\nare \u201cmore damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself.\u201d In its\nongoing review of marijuana\u2019s scheduling under federal law, the D.E.A. should\nbe forced to reckon not only with the scientific findings on medical marijuana\nbut also with the myriad constitutional concerns raised by the government\u2019s\nexisting approach.\n\nOur disastrous experience with the war on drugs invites us to recover a sense\nof constitutional possibility. The most effective constitutional arguments\nagainst ineffective, punitive drug laws have varied widely across eras, and\nthey may vary again. The one constant is that such laws have always been in\ndeep tension with some of our nation\u2019s deepest normative commitments.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * Coco Gauff Is Playing for Herself Now\n  * Scenes From Pro-Palestinian Encampments Across U.S. Universities\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
