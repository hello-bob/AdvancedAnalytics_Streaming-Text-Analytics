All of this makes queer couples more vulnerable to climate hazards,\nShaw said.\n\nThe authors found that San Francisco County, behind the District of Columbia,\nhas the second-highest proportion of same-sex couples in the country and a\nrelatively high risk of national hazards complicating life.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco ranks among the highest in terms of its risk exposure to the\neffects of climate change,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe experience of folks living in\nparts of the city that are more prone to flooding and these sorts of natural\ndisasters is borne out in the data as well.\u201d\n\nSponsored\n\nKnowing that LGBTQ people often live in concentrated urban areas like San\nFrancisco is essential because Bay Area climate scientists recently found that\nhuman-caused climate change will cause atmospheric rivers to become 37% wetter\nby the end of the century. These storms can cause significant flooding, and\nKQED reporting from 2023 found that San Francisco\u2019s infrastructure isn\u2019t\nprepared for future storms.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve 2002, parts of San Francisco\u2019s Leather & LGBTQ Cultural\nDistrict flooded during an atmospheric river that swamped the region. The\nnearest grocery store to the area, Rainbow Grocery, also flooded.\n\n## \u2018Our findings probably understate the true impact\u2019\n\nThe researchers relied on a mix of U.S. Census data and climate risk\nassessment data from NASA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nShaw said his team considered same-sex couples because the U.S. Census gathers\ninformation on cohabitating same-sex households but does not broadly collect\nsexual orientation or gender data.\n\nA sandy path leads from Ocean Beach to the Great Highway and the Sunset\nDistrict in San Francisco on Feb. 14, 2024. (Beth LaBerge/KQED)\n\n\u201cThis study helps to shine a light on what is likely a much larger and more\ncomplicated picture,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings probably understate the true\nimpact that climate change is having on LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\nThe new research moves the needle in helping the nation understand who is at\nrisk of climate disasters, UC Irvine sociology professor Michael M\u00e9ndez said.\nHe previously studied how queer communities are often left out of disaster\nplanning.\n\n\u201cThe needle is moving slowly,\u201d M\u00e9ndez said. \u201cThese disasters are not happening\nin isolation. If an individual is feeling discrimination, or a lack of safety\nin their home and a disaster happens, they can feel even more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nBut what M\u00e9ndez said the study doesn\u2019t reveal is who the same-sex couples are\nin terms of race, income and their positions in society.\n\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve gone a little further in terms of highlighting that, just because\nyou\u2019re LGBTQ and you\u2019re in a geographic area that has a higher propensity for\nclimate risks, does not necessarily make you socially vulnerable,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February, Sen. Steve Padilla (D-San Diego) announced SB 990, which would\nestablish best practices for state and local governments when addressing the\nneeds of the LGBTQ community after a disaster.\n\n\u201cThe values we have fought so hard to uphold cannot disappear at the first\nsight of trouble,\u201d Padilla said in a press release.\n\n## Solutions are possible\n\nThe study authors recommend that policymakers, cities and providers ensure\nthat disaster relief is accessible and given without discrimination based on\nsexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.\n\nBay Area Carbon Emissions Steadily Fall as Region Embraces EVs\n\nSolutions could include safe shelters, access to medication and financial aid\nfor displaced LGBTQ people.\n\nBecause the study found that LGBTQ people often live in areas with poor\ninfrastructure and lack resources to respond to climate change, the\nresearchers suggest cities expand green spaces and enhance structural\nresilience.\n\n\u201cPolicies should focus on mitigating discriminatory housing and urban\ndevelopment practices, making shelters safe spaces for LGBTQ people, and\nensuring that relief aid reaches displaced LGBTQ individuals,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nResearchers also suggest that state and federal surveys, like the U.S. Census,\nneed to include \u201cmeasures of sexual orientation and gender identity to\nincrease the scope and granularity of information available on LGBTQ people,\nincluding assessments of climate risk.\u201d\n\nlower waypoint\n\nGet the best of KQED\u2019s science coverage in your inbox weekly.\n\nTo learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy\npolicy.\n\n## Signed up.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KQED Inc.
