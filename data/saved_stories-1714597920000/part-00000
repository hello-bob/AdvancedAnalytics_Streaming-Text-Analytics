(Image credit: EPSC/NAO\u2013CAS/DSS/ESO)\n\nA joint Chinese and European X-ray telescope mission called Einstein Probe is\nsuccessfully viewing the universe in widescreen, with a telescope design that\nmimics the eyes of lobsters.\n\nEinstein Probe, which launched on Jan. 9 aboard a Chinese Long March rocket,\nis currently undergoing testing and calibration of its instruments as it\norbits the Earth at an altitude of 600 kilometers (373 miles). Its first\nobservations were revealed at a symposium in Beijing.\n\nThe problem with X-rays is that they are so high in energy that they are\ndifficult to capture with a standard detector. Lenses don't work because\nX-rays are too powerful to be easily refracted, and an X-ray striking a mirror\nface-on will simply pass through said mirror. Rather, X-ray detection is only\npossible when these rays strike a reflective surface at a shallow angle. From\nthere, the rays can be directed towards an X-ray-specific detector. However,\nthis mechanism poses a bit of a problem. It means an X-ray telescope can\nusually only detect X-rays along a narrow field of view; outside of that field\nof view, X-rays would strike at too great an angle.\n\nAs it turns out, lobsters are the solution \u2014 lobster vision, that is. What's\nmore, scientists cottoned onto this basic idea back in the late 1970s, but it\nhas taken decades to successfully adapt that idea for use on X-ray telescopes\nin space.\n\nRelated: The Chandra X-ray spacecraft may soon go dark, threatening a great\ndeal of astronomy\n\nHuman eyes operate on the principle of refraction via a lens, aka the cornea.\nLobsters, on the other hand, utilize reflection. Their eyes are a composite of\ntiny tubes arranged as parallel square pores on the surface of their eyes,\nwith each tube pointing in a different direction. Light enters the tubes and\nis reflected down to the retina. Whereas human vision spans a field of about\n120 degrees, lobsters have panoramic, 180-degree eyesight.\n\nLobster-eye X-ray vision has previously been deployed on missions that study\nthe solar wind, on interplanetary missions, and on a technology demonstrator\nmission called LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy) in 2022. Einstein\nProbe, however, is the first to employ lobster-eye optics in a space\ntelescope. Its Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) borrows from the design of a\nlobster's eye, with hundreds of thousands of tubes arranged in 12 modules that\nare positioned such that the WXT can take in a field of view encompassing more\nthan 3,600 square degrees, equal to one-eleventh of the sky, in a single shot.\nIn just three orbits, WXT can image the entire sky in X-rays.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nOn the left are microscope images of a lobster\u2019s eye, with thousands of tiny\nsquare pores linked to tubes that direct light to the lobster\u2019s retina via\nreflection.

Camp)\n\nWXT is looking for things that go bump in the night: so-called X-ray\ntransients, which are often random or one-off events like a star flaring or a\ndormant black hole suddenly lighting up with activity when swallowing a small\nparcel of matter. It also includes phenomena like exploding stars and merging\nneutron stars that are the source of gravitational waves reverberating\nthroughout the cosmos. This wide field of view should therefore allow WXT to\nvastly increase our knowledge of these transients.\n\nTo complement WXT's panoramic view, Einstein Probe also carries on board a\nsecond telescope, known as the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT), which is a\nmore traditional X-ray detector with a narrower field of view. FXT offers more\ndetailed, close-up observations of any transients discovered by WXT.\n\nEven though it is still in the testing phase, WXT in particular is already\nproving its purpose. The Beijing symposium revealed that WXT found its first\nX-ray transient on Feb. 19, an event associated with a long gamma-ray burst\nproduced by the destruction of a massive star. Since then, WXT has discovered\nanother 141 transients including 127 stars unleashing X-ray flares.\n\nThe globular cluster Omega Centauri, imaged by Einstein Probe\u2019s Follow-up\nX-ray Telescope.

(Image credit: Chinese Academy of\nSciences)\n\n\"It is astounding that even though the instruments were not yet full\ncalibrated, we could already perform a time-critical follow-up observation\nusing the FXT instrument of a fast X-ray transient first spotted by WXT,\"\nadded Erik Kuulkers, who is the European Space Agency's Project Scientist for\nEinstein Probe. \"It shows what Einstein Probe will be capable of during its\nsurvey.\"\n\nThat survey will initially last three years, and is set to get underway this\nJune once testing is officially complete. The data released at the recent\nsymposium is a preview of just what we can expect.\n\nThe supernova remnant Puppis A, imaged by Einstein Probe's Follow-up X-ray\nTelescope.
