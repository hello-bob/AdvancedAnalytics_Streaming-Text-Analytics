People on the\nstreets called him the Handcuff Man\u2014but the police knew his real name.\n\nBy Hallie Lieberman\n\n###### The Atavist Magazine, No. 149\n\nHallie Lieberman is a sex historian and journalist. She is the author of Buzz:\nA Stimulating History of the Sex Toy, and currently at work on a book about\ngigolos. Her writing has appeared in BuzzFeed News, The New York Times, The\nWashington Post, Vice, and other publications. Her first story for The Atavist\nMagazine, \u201cThe Trigger Effect\u201d (issue no. 82), was a finalist for the 2019\nDart Award for Excellence in Coverage of Trauma.\n\nEditor: Seyward Darby Art Director: Ed Johnson Copy Editor: Sean Cooper Fact\nChecker: Kyla Jones\n\nPublished in March 2024.\n\n\u201cStay away from him.\u201d\n\nIn May 1991, Michael Jordan visited Atlanta, Georgia, to revel in the city\u2019s\nsocial scene. Jordan, who was 21 and lived in Florida, came on vacation and\nended up in a neighborhood called Midtown. If the Deep South had a gay mecca,\nMidtown was it. The bars there were legendary; among the busiest were the\nPhoenix, a brick-walled dive, and the Gallus, a sprawling three-floor property\ntransformed from a private home into a piano bar, restaurant, and hustler\nhaunt. Piedmont Park, situated in Midtown\u2019s northeast, was a popular cruising\nspot, thanks to the privacy offered by its dense vegetation. Cars lined up in\ndroves there, bearing license plates from as far away as California and\nMichigan. Local residents complained about the traffic, and arborists put up\nfences to \u201cprotect\u201d the trees. A cop once told a reporter that the park was\n\u201cso busy\u201d with gay men, \u201cyou\u2019d think they were having a drive-in movie.\u201d\n\nNote: This story contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence.\n\nBut Midtown\u2019s freedoms and pleasures had limits. Sodomy was illegal in\nGeorgia, and cops routinely detained gay men, sometimes by going undercover\nand posing as hustlers. \u201cOne of the television stations would scroll the names\nof all the people who had been arrested for soliciting sodomy,\u201d recalled Cliff\nBostock, a longtime journalist in Atlanta. The HIV/AIDS crisis was approaching\nits zenith, and testing positive was a near certain death sentence that some\nAmericans, especially in the South, believed gay men deserved. Prominent\nAtlanta preacher Charles Stanley had made national headlines in 1986 when he\ndeclared that the epidemic was a way of \u201cGod indicating his displeasure\u201d with\nhomosexuality.\n\nOn the evening of May 12, his first day in the city, Jordan was milling around\nMidtown when he was approached by a man in a white Lincoln Town Car who asked\nif he wanted to make some money. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d Jordan replied. The\nman said he was conducting a study and would pay Jordan $50 to drink vodka.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to watch as you become more and more inebriated, and I\u2019ll take\nnotes,\u201d the man said. Jordan jumped at the chance to earn some easy cash and\nagreed to meet the man at the corner of Fifth and Juniper Streets.\n\nJordan was already there when the man arrived. The man motioned for Jordan to\nget into his car, handed him a fifth of vodka, and told him to drink it fast.\nJordan downed about half the bottle, at which point the man left the car for a\nfew minutes to get something to mix the alcohol with. When he came back, the\nman asked Jordan to get hard because he wanted to see him masturbate. Jordan\nsaid he was too drunk to get hard quickly. Then he drank more and blacked out.\n\nEarly the next morning, a man named David Atkins found someone curled up in\nthe fetal position on the ground of the parking lot behind the Ponce de Leon\nHotel, where Atkins worked as a clerk. \u201cAt first I thought he was 30 to 35 and\nvery dirty. I nudged him with my foot, told him to wake up,\u201d Atkins told\nSouthern Voice, a gay newspaper in Atlanta. \u201cThen I realized it was blisters\nall over his body and he was just a kid.\u201d\n\nThe person on the ground was Jordan. He was naked, and his genitals had been\nwrapped in a rubber band and set on fire. Burns extended to his buttocks and\nlegs, and his nose and mouth were filled with blood.\n\nAtkins called 911, and Jordan was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital,\nwhere he would remain for a month. When the police were slow to respond to the\nscene, Atkins reached out to Cathy Woolard, a gay-rights advocate working with\nGeorgia\u2019s chapter of the ACLU. Woolard sprang into action and contacted the\npolice investigator assigned to the case. In her words, she got \u201cnothing but\nrunaround.\u201d Because of the victim\u2019s profile, the police had designated the\nattack a bias crime. For the same reason, Woolard sensed, they weren\u2019t taking\nthe incident seriously.\n\nWoolard urged law enforcement to talk to a potential witness: Bill Adamson, a\nbartender at the Phoenix. Adamson said that Jordan had come into the bar\nbefore going to Fifth and Juniper and had described his conversation with the\nstranger in the Town Car. Adamson issued a warning: \u201cStay away from him. He\u2019s\ndangerous.\u201d\n\nAdamson didn\u2019t know the driver\u2019s name, only that people around Midtown called\nhim the Handcuff Man. He was a serial predator who approached gay men, offered\nto pay them to drink liquor, then beat or burned them and left them for dead.\nSometimes he handcuffed his victims to poles\u2014hence his sinister nickname.\n\nThere were men who said they\u2019d narrowly escaped the Handcuff Man, and rumors\nthat some of his victims hadn\u2019t survived. But there were also people who\nthought that he was nothing more than an urban legend. Jordan\u2019s assault would\nbring the truth to light: Not only did the Handcuff Man exist, but there were\npeople in Atlanta who knew his name, including members of the police force. He\nhadn\u2019t been caught because, it seemed, no one was trying in earnest to catch\nhim.\n\nThat was about to change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sue you.\u201d\n\nNo one could be certain when the Handcuff Man had staged his first attack.\nAdamson claimed that he\u2019d been terrorizing Midtown since the late 1960s, that\nhe drove a white Lincoln, was about five foot ten, and had black hair and\nglasses. A sex worker said that the Handcuff Man had picked him up in Piedmont\nPark in 1977, asked him to take shots of liquor, then assaulted him. The\nvictim managed to flee with a stab wound to the shoulder, and later saw the\nman again at the park eyeing other male hustlers. He didn\u2019t report the crime\nbecause he was afraid of being outed to loved ones.\n\nIn 1984, Susan Faludi, then a twentysomething reporter a few years out from\nbecoming a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author, wrote a front-page story about gay\nhustlers for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She asked her sources about the\ndangers of their lifestyle and learned that \u201cthe greatest fear on the street\nright now is invoked by the specter of \u2018The Handcuff Man,\u2019 a man who\nreportedly picks up hustlers, offers them a pint of vodka spiked with sleeping\npills and then handcuffs and beats them.\u201d\n\nThe following year, in April 1985, a thin man rolled down his car window on\nPonce de Leon Avenue and asked Max Shrader if he wanted to make some money.\nShrader, 21, had been hustling since he was 13, turning tricks for out and\ncloseted men alike, including a married Baptist preacher. He knew that what he\ndid was dangerous; someone had pulled a gun on him, and a female sex worker\nwho was his friend had been killed. \u201cThey found her head in one dumpster, her\narms in another,\u201d Shrader said. \u201cShe was a nice person.\u201d Shrader knew about\nthe Handcuff Man, who had attacked another of his friends. But the man in the\ncar on Ponce, as the thoroughfare is commonly known, didn\u2019t come off like a\npredator. He wore glasses and a pressed shirt; he seemed normal.\n\nThe man asked Shrader to drink some alcohol with him, and Shrader obliged. But\nafter a little while he started to feel funny. Had the man slipped him\nsomething? Shrader collapsed to the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me!\u201d he begged, as the\nman pulled him into his car.\n\nThe man drove to a wooded area, parked, and dragged an intoxicated Shrader\ninto a patch of kudzu. He then poured a liquid onto Shrader\u2019s groin and lit a\nmatch, illuminating his face in a ghoulish way Shrader would never forget.\nWhen the man dropped the match, Shrader caught fire.\n\nShrader lay in the woods for hours, drifting in and out of consciousness. He\ncried out for help when he had the energy. Around 9:30 p.m., a man who\nhappened to be a nurse was driving home with his girlfriend when he spotted a\nnaked figure on the side of the road. The nurse stopped, saw Shrader\u2019s\ncondition, and rushed home to call the police and to get some blankets to wrap\nShrader in. \u201cI guess God sent him,\u201d Shrader said.\n\nShrader was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, the same place Michael Jordan\nwould go six years later. He stayed there six weeks, during which the police\ncame to see him once. They left a business card and said to call if he wanted\nto talk. He misplaced the card and never heard from the cops again.\n\nShrader wasn\u2019t surprised. Atlanta cops seemed more interested in harassing and\narresting gay men than in protecting them. Sometimes they wrote down the\nnumbers on license plates in Piedmont Park and blackmailed drivers terrified\nof having their sexual orientation exposed\u2014it could cost them their families,\ntheir jobs, possibly their lives. Incidents of gay bashing often went\nunsolved, if they were investigated at all. Etcetera, a gay and lesbian\nmagazine in Atlanta, reported that between 1984 and 1986, at least 18 gay men\ndied at the hands of unidentified perpetrators. The publication noted with\nfrustration that police had \u201clittle understanding\u201d of homophobic crimes. The\nAtlanta Gay Center began offering sensitivity training for cops, but feedback\nwas mixed. \u201cI think what you told us will be helpful in the longrun and should\nbe expressed more often in police work,\u201d one participant wrote in an\nevaluation of the training, \u201cbut I still think gays are disgusting and a\ndisgrace to our country.\u201d George Napper, Atlanta\u2019s public safety commissioner,\nrefused to make a statement condemning crimes against the gay community\nbecause it might be construed as favoritism.\n\nAfter healing for two years, Shrader went back to hustling, scars and all.\nHe\u2019d grown up poor, and selling sex was one of the only ways he\u2019d ever made\nmoney. At least now he knew what the Handcuff Man looked like and could steer\nclear of him.\n\nJ.D. Kirkland suspected that he\u2019d seen the Handcuff Man\u2019s face, too. Kirkland,\nan Atlanta cop, worked security a few nights a week at the Gallus. According\nto Don Hunnewell, one of the owners of the Gallus, Kirkland was a combination\nof Dirty Harry and the sheriff from Gunsmoke\u2014a \u201ckick-ass, cowboy type of tough\ncop.\u201d In his free time, he trained horses on a large piece of property outside\nthe city and worked on a novel about a time-traveling cop. Kirkland was\nmarried with kids; he wasn\u2019t gay, but he was compassionate toward the Gallus\u2019s\nclientele. \u201cHe really cared,\u201d Hunnewell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was judgmental\nat all on what they were doing.\u201d (Kirkland died in 1996.)\n\nPatrons had told Kirkland about the Handcuff Man, including what he looked\nlike, and on November 4, 1983, a man came into the Gallus who matched the\ndescription. Kirkland wrote a trespass notice, then snapped a polaroid of the\nman. The Gallus had a \u201cbarred book\u201d filled with photos of people who weren\u2019t\nallowed on the premises; bartenders were supposed to check it at the start of\ntheir shifts so they could eject any banned patrons. Kirkland put the man\u2019s\nphoto in the book.\n\nBefore kicking him out for good, Kirkland asked for his name. The man said he\nwas Robert Lee Bennett Jr. \u201cI\u2019m an attorney,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019m going to sue\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\nRobert Lee Bennett Jr. was indeed an attorney, like his father before him. He\nhad been adopted as a baby by Annabelle Maxwell Bennett and Robert Lee Bennett\nSr., of Towanda, Pennsylvania, a small town perched on the Susquehanna River.\nAnnabelle was a socialite and the daughter of a wealthy judge; in addition to\npracticing law, Robert Sr. was the president of a bank.\n\nRobert Sr. was originally from the South but moved to Towanda for his bride.\nThey lived with their son, their only child, in a Victorian mansion nicknamed\nNirvana. It had five bedrooms, a white marble fireplace, and a pool house; a\nSteinway grand piano, Tiffany sterling silver, and plush oriental rugs. The\nlocal paper chronicled the family\u2019s every move: vacations to Africa, charity\ndinners. They were the Kennedys of Towanda.\n\nEllie Harden Smith, who knew Bennett in high school, said that he was\ncharming, fashionable, and quirky. Most of his friends were girls, and he\nliked to cross-stitch and garden. He was devoted to his mother. As far as\nSmith knew, he was never bullied or mocked for his feminine tendencies.\nBennett sang in the glee club in high school, was active in the Boy Scouts,\nand worked at the student newspaper.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1965, he moved to Colorado to attend the\nUniversity of Denver. Smith visited him there, and he took her out to gay\nbars. \u201cI guess I sort of knew, but that was the first I realized that he was\nreally into that stuff,\u201d she said.\n\nBennett\u2019s first run-in with the law appears to have happened in 1971, when he\nwas arrested in Virginia for indecent exposure during a homosexual act. At the\ntime, he was pursuing a master\u2019s degree in political science. According to\nlegal documents, he was arrested two years later, this time in Atlanta, for\nassault with an automobile. A year on, soon after graduating from law school\nat Emory University, he was arrested again. It happened in Midtown, when he\nwas cruising near the Gallus. Bennett tried to pull a man into his car\u2014a man\nwho happened to be an undercover cop. Bennett was charged with kidnapping a\npolice officer, but he ended up pleading no contest to simple battery and\npaying a $75 fine.\n\nOnce he\u2019d finished his law degree, Bennett moved back to Towanda, where he\nlived a double life. By day he worked at a law firm and claimed to be looking\nfor a wife; in his free time, he paid poor local boys to take their clothes\noff and drink or have sex with him. Eventually, he quit the firm and bought a\nplant and flower business called the Tree Stump.\n\nOn April 16, 1976, Bennett met a young man at Leonard\u2019s, a beer garden in\nTowanda, and suggested that they go to a lake cottage his parents had bought\nhim as a gift. The men had sex in Bennett\u2019s car, then drove to the cottage.\nAccording to Francis Panuccio, a police captain quoted in a local newspaper,\n\u201csomething occurred that frightened\u201d the young man, who fled the cottage in\nBennett\u2019s car and drove it into an embankment. When police arrived at the\nscene, they arrested the young man, but Bennett deflected scrutiny thanks to\nRobert Sr. \u201cNobody wanted to press charges against him because of the\ninfluence of his father,\u201d a retired state police investigator later told the\npress. \u201cHis father was gold.\u201d\n\nStill, Robert Sr. feared that his son would keep getting into more trouble if\nhe remained in Towanda. Two months after the incident at the lake, Bennett\nmoved back to Atlanta. He was 29.\n\nBennett was hired by a law firm, which is where he met Sandra Powell, 34, a\nsecretary and bookkeeper. She was small and demure, a junior-college graduate\nwho wore her dark hair in bangs. They started dating, and Bennett told Powell\nthat he was impotent. She said it didn\u2019t bother her; they talked about\nadopting a child. In 1978, on a trip to the lake cottage in Towanda, Bennett\nproposed and Powell said yes. They were married at Rock Springs Presbyterian\nChurch in Atlanta. Powell wore an ivory gown decorated with pearls and lace,\nand carried a bouquet of burgundy roses. Bennett wore a tuxedo with a white\nbow tie. They honeymooned in South America.\n\nHis hometown friends were surprised that Bennett got married. Irma Henson, who\nhad known him since his early twenties, said that he likely did it for his\nparents, especially his mother, with whom he was still close. \u201cHe probably\ngathered from his mother that who he was wasn\u2019t fitting her picture of who he\nshould be,\u201d Henson said.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Bennett quit the law firm. He worked for a while\nbehind the jewelry counter at Davison\u2019s department store, but mostly he lived\noff dividends from stocks his father had gifted him. \u201cHe would just hang\naround the house all day, and he would be in his robe when I got home,\u201d Powell\nlater said in court. She was unhappy, but \u201ckept it inside.\u201d\n\nThen one day in the fall of 1982, Powell was getting off the bus she rode home\nfrom work when she saw police placing her husband in handcuffs. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nshe asked. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, James Lee Johnson, 24, had been found shot to death\nwith a .25-caliber pistol in the middle of the street close to his apartment.\nHis wallet was missing. Police learned that Johnson may have been a sex\nworker, and that he\u2019d last been seen with a man who looked like Bennett.\nAccording to friends, Johnson was in a relationship with a man named Robert\nwhom he\u2019d met at the jewelry store where Bennett once worked. A few weeks\nbefore his death, Johnson had expressed fear of this man, telling friends,\n\u201cRobert\u2019s gonna get me.\u201d When investigators examined the contents of Johnson\u2019s\nstomach during his autopsy, they found roast beef and potatoes. They searched\nBennett\u2019s home and, discovering those items in his refrigerator, arrested him\nfor murder.\n\nBennett was released on a $25,000 bond and was never tried, because the\nprosecution\u2019s case was entirely circumstantial. His arrest marked the end of\nhis marriage\u2014Powell soon filed for divorce\u2014but not of his comfortable\nlifestyle. When he wasn\u2019t in Atlanta, Bennett spent time in Clearwater,\nFlorida, where his mother, widowed in the mid-1980s, kept a home. He\nvacationed in Nassau, Mexico, and China. He hosted lavish parties, and when he\nand his mother attended an annual lobster boil at a club in Towanda, an\notherwise casual affair, he made sure their table was set with linens,\nporcelain plates, and a silver candelabra.\n\nMeanwhile, in Midtown, the Handcuff Man\u2019s reputation was mounting. Max Shrader\nwas attacked in the spring of 1985. That August, a man named Charles Gallows\nwas assaulted and robbed. The following June, Anthony Charles Poppilia got in\nthe car of a man who offered to pay him $50 to drink vodka, then pushed\nPoppilia from the moving vehicle. The stories continued until May 1991, when\nMichael Jordan turned up maimed behind the Ponce de Leon Hotel. Midtown\ndenizens would later report that, in the hours leading up to Jordan\u2019s assault,\nthe Handcuff Man had approached at least one other man in the area.\n\n\u201cA sadistic Woody Allen lookalike.\u201d\n\nWhen word of Jordan\u2019s assault reached Richard Greer, he immediately thought of\nthe Handcuff Man. Greer, 32, worked the 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. cop beat at the\nJournal-Constitution. A few months prior, he\u2019d overheard a Midtown patrol\nofficer casually mention the Handcuff Man to some colleagues. Greer asked\naround and gleaned that a lot of cops thought the attacker might be\n\u201cfolklore.\u201d Jordan\u2019s assault seemed to be confirmation that he was not.\n\nGreer went to gay bars in Midtown to speak with employees and customers. He\nheard a rumor that the Handcuff Man had either removed the door handles inside\nhis car or covered them with duct tape to trap his victims. People were upset\nthat authorities seemed to be doing nothing to stop the violence. \u201cThe victims\nwere people that most people either wanted to ignore or didn\u2019t know existed,\u201d\nGreer said.\n\nGreer left his business card with patrons of the Gallus and told them to get\nin touch if they ever saw the person they believed to be the Handcuff Man. \u201cI\nstarted getting calls at one in the morning saying \u2018He just drove by\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s\non the corner of X street and X street,\u2019 \u201d Greer said. If he thought the\ninformation was reliable, Greer would jump in his car and drive to Midtown,\nbut by the time he arrived, the suspect was always long gone.\n\nThen Greer was given a name: Robert Bennett Jr. But the tip didn\u2019t come from a\nhustler or a bartender\u2014it came from a cop. Greer was surprised. In his\nexperience, it was unusual for a cop to be so candid. More importantly, if\npeople on the force believed that they knew who the Handcuff Man was, why\nhadn\u2019t Bennett been investigated and arrested?\n\nGreer spoke with Kirkland, the cop who moonlighted at the Gallus, and Kirkland\nsaid that he was never able to do anything about Bennett except ban him from\nthe bar back in 1983, because it was difficult to persuade survivors and\nwitnesses of the Handcuff Man\u2019s attacks to come forward. But if that were\ntrue, law enforcement bore at least some responsibility for people\u2019s\nreluctance: Victims of homophobic crimes in Atlanta feared that if they spoke\nto the police, they might be blackmailed or arrested, or simply not believed.\n\u201cThe police say if you don\u2019t report the crime, we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d\nBill Gripp, an activist with the Atlanta Gay Center, told Greer. \u201cWe say if we\ndon\u2019t have confidence in them, we won\u2019t report it.\u201d\n\nOn May 28, two weeks after Jordan was assaulted, Greer published a front-page\nstory about the Handcuff Man. \u201cGay prostitutes in fear of sadist,\u201d the\nheadline read. Greer wrote that the Handcuff Man may have attacked up to 100\nmen during his \u201creign of terror,\u201d and that gay Atlantans were \u201cangered\u201d that\nthe police were \u201cindifferent\u201d to his crimes. Greer quoted Kirkland, who said\nthat it was possible the Handcuff Man was responsible for several unsolved\nmurders.\n\nGreer characterized the Handcuff Man as \u201ca sadistic Woody Allen lookalike ...\nscrawny and peering with eyeglasses through his car window.\u201d He wrote that\nKirkland believed the predator was a \u201cDeKalb County professional.\u201d But Greer\ndidn\u2019t name Bennett. He couldn\u2019t. Doing so would have risked a defamation suit\nagainst the newspaper; Bennett hadn\u2019t been arrested or charged with a crime,\nand he was a wealthy lawyer with his own wealthy lawyer on call. To finger\nBennett, Greer needed to keep digging.\n\nGreer began combing through public records and police files. He read documents\npertaining to Bennett\u2019s prior arrests. He learned that Bennett had briefly\nbeen a suspect in one of Atlanta\u2019s most high-profile crime sprees: From 1979\nto 1981, a serial killer murdered 30 people in the city, most of whom were\nyoung boys. As pressure mounted to find the perpetrator, the FBI arrived to\nhelp. Based on various records, law enforcement came up with a list of 65\nsuspects. Bennet was among them, perhaps because of his previous arrests. He\nwas also a known fixture in Midtown, and the FBI thought that the killer might\nbe gay. Agents were assigned to surveil \u201chomosexual bars and areas frequented\nby male prostitutes,\u201d and to pursue the \u201cdevelopment of informants with\nknowledge of child prostitution,\u201d according to a February 1981 memo. Bennett\nwas eliminated as a suspect after three months. (In late 1981, a man named\nWayne Williams was arrested in connection with the slayings. He was convicted\nof two of the murders and is presumed to have committed the others.)\n\nGreer also found the transcripts from Bennett\u2019s contentious divorce\nproceedings in 1984. Astoundingly, the Handcuff Man was mentioned. Powell\u2019s\ncounsel called three male sex workers to the stand, all of whom testified that\nthey believed Bennett to be the Handcuff Man. Frank Sheridan, a local gay-\nrights advocate who liaised with the police, testified that he had been\n\u201cworking with the street prostitute community ... to build up information on\nthis gentleman regarding his sexual habits and picking up of young men from\nthe street.\u201d Powell herself claimed that her estranged husband was \u201cviolent\u201d\nand a homosexual.\n\nBennett denied being gay, then admitted that he was. However, he was adamant\nthat he wasn\u2019t the Handcuff Man. Attorney Guy Notte, who represented Bennett,\nchastised the authorities for not identifying the real threat. \u201cThe Handcuff\nMan is still down there somewhere,\u201d Notte said. \u201cCould you please tell me why\nthis man hasn\u2019t been caught?\u201d The court ended up ordering Bennett to pay\nPowell a divorce settlement of $40,000.\n\nOn May 29 and 30, 1991, Greer published two additional articles about the\nHandcuff Man. There were still concerns about naming Bennett, so Greer didn\u2019t.\nBy then Jordan had picked a photo of Bennett out of a lineup. Greer reported\nthat Jordan had identified his attacker, but that police hadn\u2019t issued a\nwarrant for the suspect\u2019s arrest. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will call him,\u201d the chief of\nthe sex-crimes unit told Greer.\n\nGreer grew increasingly worried that Bennett might attack another man soon;\nnaming him seemed like a matter of public safety. There was a heated debate in\nthe newsroom about what to do. One editor told Greer that he hoped never to be\nan uncharged suspect in Atlanta, lest his name show up in the paper. Another\neditor, Pam Fine, was on Greer\u2019s side. \u201cHeinous crimes were involved,\u201d Fine\nlater said, \u201cand we recognized that police had waited two decades to actively\npursue the case.\u201d\n\nOn May 31, Greer published an article naming Bennett as the man Jordan\nidentified as the last person he saw before losing consciousness during his\nattack. The piece indicated that the police still hadn\u2019t spoken to Bennett,\nmuch less detained him. \u201cI would certainly love to interview him,\u201d Bobby Ford,\na sex-crimes detective, told Greer. The article went on to state: \u201cFor 20\nyears, police officials and members of the gay community say, a man fitting\nMr. Bennett\u2019s description has been involved in cases of brutality against\nyoung white male prostitutes. The perpetrator of these crimes has come to be\nknown as the Handcuff Man.\u201d\n\nAfter the article was published, Greer reached Bennett on the phone at his\nlake cottage in Towanda, and Bennett denied being the Handcuff Man. \u201cNo\nattorney in his right mind is going to make a comment one way or the other on\nsomething the police are investigating,\u201d Bennett continued. \u201cYou know as well\nas I do that that is not an indication of guilt or innocence.\u201d In a separate\ninterview, attorney Guy Notte, who was still representing Bennett, said that\nhis client would be flying down to Atlanta the following week \u201cto defend every\nallegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally went nuts.\u201d\n\nAtlanta police didn\u2019t immediately issue a warrant for Bennett\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just more work that needs to be done to make this thing stick,\u201d\nDetective Ford told Greer. But the department did send out a dispatch to law\nenforcement agencies around the country describing the Handcuff Man\u2019s crimes.\nWhen the message arrived in Tampa, Bob Holland, a local police detective,\nrecognized similarities with a case his department had been investigating for\na few months.\n\nOn February 22, 1991, 35-year-old Gary Clapp was standing outside a Salvation\nArmy shelter, waiting for it to open. Clapp, who hung drywall for a living,\nwas broke and struggling to feed his family; he also had a severe alcohol\nproblem. When a white Town Car pulled up and the driver said that he was\nconducting a survey on how alcohol affected people\u2019s moods, Clapp hopped into\nthe vehicle. In between chugs of vodka from a plastic cup, Clapp asked the man\nhis name, but he wouldn\u2019t answer. Eventually, Clapp passed out.\n\nAround 10:30 p.m. that night, police officer Jimmy Caplinger was driving on\nthe frontage road along the mangrove-lined Courtney Campbell Causeway, which\nconnects Tampa and Clearwater, when he noticed what he thought was a bonfire.\nHe parked, got out, and saw a person engulfed in flames. It was Clapp.\nCaplinger grabbed an extinguisher from his car and put out the fire, then\ncalled for emergency services. When Clapp arrived at the hospital, his blood-\nalcohol level was \u201cso high they could not get a reading,\u201d according to a\npolice report. He had fourth-degree burns on nearly half his body and was\nsuffering from smoke inhalation.\n\nHolland went to the hospital to conduct an interview. He wrote in his report\nthat Clapp \u201cwas able to answer certain questions by either shaking his head or\nnodding his head.\u201d Holland discerned that someone had deliberately set Clapp\non fire.\n\nClapp\u2019s injuries were so severe that doctors had to amputate his legs. When he\nregained consciousness after surgery, he began thrashing around. \u201cI kept\npulling out all my IVs,\u201d Clapp told the Tampa Tribune. \u201cI literally went nuts\nand they had to tie me down in the hospital bed.\u201d\n\nHolland spoke to Clapp\u2019s ex-girlfriend, who said that she\u2019d broken up with him\nbecause of his alcoholism. She also said that Clapp had previously been in a\n\u201chomosexual relationship,\u201d but that it \u201cwas an isolated incident.\u201d There were\nonly a few possible clues at the scene of the crime, including a Riva vodka\nbottle and a container of lighter fluid. Nearby were bags containing\ndecapitated chickens and a headless goat. A dead body had recently turned up\njust 500 feet from where Clapp was found, which made police wonder if the two\ncrimes were connected.\n\nIn early March, Holland interviewed Clapp more extensively. Clapp said that\nthe man who\u2019d attacked him drove a Lincoln Town Car made sometime between 1977\nand 1984, with a brown leather interior. He worked with a sketch artist to\nproduce a picture of the suspect, who Clapp said was between 40 and 45 years\nold, stood a little under six feet tall, and weighed 160 to 170 pounds. Clapp\nalso described the man as having dark hair, a mustache, and glasses. The\nsketch was published in the Tampa Bay Times on April 9.\n\nTwo months later, when Holland saw the dispatch about the Handcuff Man, he\nquickly picked up the phone and called the Atlanta police. They sent him a\nphoto of Bennett, which Holland then showed to Clapp in a lineup. Clapp, who\nhad only recently been released from a hospital burn unit, identified Bennett\nas his attacker. Holland pointed out that in his photo Bennett was clean-\nshaven, and that Clapp had said his attacker had a mustache. Clapp said he was\ncertain that the man in the photo was the one who\u2019d set him on fire. \u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to forget someone that\u2019s done you wrong like that,\u201d he told a reporter.\n\nAuthorities in Tampa connected more dots. Bennett\u2019s mother\u2019s home in\nClearwater, a seventh-floor condo, wasn\u2019t far from the area where Clapp was\nfound. Bennett had been visiting her in February; in fact, a few days after\nClapp\u2019s assault, Bennett and his mother embarked on a Caribbean cruise\ntogether. Bennett also owned a Town Car, which he\u2019d recently driven up to\nTowanda.\n\nIt was enough to bring him in. On June 5, Tampa police issued a warrant for\nBennett\u2019s arrest. They alerted their counterparts in Atlanta, who were\nexpecting Bennett that very afternoon for questioning about the Handcuff Man\nattacks in Midtown. Just after 3 p.m., he was taken into custody based on the\nTampa warrant.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, a shaking Bennett proclaimed his innocence. \u201cI am here\nto tell the Atlanta police and the city of Atlanta I am not the Handcuff Man,\u201d\nhe said. He later complained that he wasn\u2019t served breakfast in jail, and that\nhe had to wait five hours to get a blanket, pillow, and cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIt struck a bell.\u201d\n\nIn Midtown, people were relieved that the Handcuff Man may have been caught,\nbut they were also frustrated that Bennett had only been charged with the\nattack on Clapp, not the crimes in Atlanta. District Attorney Lewis Slaton\nassured the public that his office was developing a case against Bennett, but\nalso noted that it would be deferring to Tampa authorities. \u201cSince Florida has\nasked for him, we\u2019re going to let them have him,\u201d Slaton said. \u201cThat case is\nobviously worse.\u201d But worse by what measure, and for whom? \u201cMy life will never\nbe the same,\u201d Jordan told Greer at the Journal-Constitution. Jordan was upset\nat the way police had handled his ordeal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until it was in the news\nthat they seemed to care,\u201d he said.\n\nBennett was extradited to Florida on June 11. He pleaded not guilty and was\nfreed on a $200,000 bond. His mother helped him get the money together by\nputting up her condo as collateral.\n\nBy then, other men had started coming forward to accuse Bennett of attacking\nthem. One of the men was Max Shrader. He\u2019d been sitting at home one day in May\nwhen his dad called and told him to turn on the news. \u201cThere\u2019s another guy who\njust got burnt the same way,\u201d his dad said. Shrader saw the report about\nJordan and called the police to say that he\u2019d suffered a similar attack six\nyears earlier. They asked him to come to the station, where he was shown a\nlineup of men\u2019s photos. \u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Shrader said, pointing at Bennett\u2019s\nface.\n\nOn June 21, an Atlanta grand jury indicted Bennett on two counts of aggravated\nassault and two counts of aggravated battery for the attacks on Jordan and\nShrader. Investigators noted that Bennett was suspected of committing similar\ncrimes going back two decades. Bennett again pleaded not guilty and was\nreleased on bond\u2014an additional $100,000.\n\nFor Dale Sisco and Chip Purcell, who were prosecuting Bennett in Florida, the\nAtlanta indictment was good news. Their case against Bennett was proving\ndelicate. Clapp had identified his attacker, but because he\u2019d been drunk when\nhe was set on fire, the defense would almost certainly argue that he was an\nunreliable witness. The defense would also likely argue that evidence found at\nthe scene\u2014the lighter fluid and vodka bottle\u2014wasn\u2019t necessarily connected to\nthe case. Locals called the area where Clapp was found \u201cthe redneck Riviera,\u201d\nbecause people liked to grill, drink, and party in the mangroves. \u201cThere was\nno videotape of him doing the act,\u201d Sisco said of Bennett. \u201cWe had no\nphotographs of him. There were still many circumstantial aspects of the proof\nthat were going to be challenging.\u201d The prosecutors didn\u2019t even have\nfingerprints connecting Bennett to Clapp\u2019s attack.\n\nSo Sisco and Purcell decided to rely on the Williams Rule, a legal precedent\nin Florida that allows prosecutors to present evidence from other cases or\nincidents that indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. They identified a\nhandful of recent instances in which men had endured injuries similar to\nClapp\u2019s, hoping to find other witnesses willing to testify against Bennett.\nFor instance, there was an unsolved case from 1989 in Detective Holland\u2019s\njurisdiction involving a man who was found unconscious outside a gay bar with\nhis genitals burned. But survivors were wary of telling their stories in\ncourt. \u201cWe talked to several guys who were not excited about coming to Tampa\nand testifying to what their sexual activities were,\u201d Purcell said.\n\nThe Atlanta indictments expanded the pool of potential witnesses. If the\nFlorida case went to trial, Jordan could testify under the Williams Rule. So\ncould Shrader. The same went for a hustler named Shane, who asked to be\nidentified by his first name in this story. Shane was the man in Atlanta who\nclaimed that the Handcuff Man had tried to pick him up in the hours just\nbefore Jordan was attacked.\n\nAt the time, Shane was in his mid-thirties; he had a wife and a kid he\nsupported with sex work. When a man in a white Lincoln pulled up one day and\nasked him to drink vodka for $50, Shane was suspicious. He told the driver\nthat if he wanted to drink, they could go to a bar, but the man insisted they\nimbibe in the car. Shane declined and went about his night. When he heard\nabout the attack on Jordan, \u201cit struck a bell,\u201d he said. Shane got in touch\nwith the police and later identified Bennett in a photo lineup as the man\nwho\u2019d tried to give him vodka. The experience shook him up. \u201cIt put a kibosh\non me for a while from hustling,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Sisco and Purcell built their case, a shocking news story seized headlines:\nIn July 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested in Milwaukee and confessed to\nmurdering more than a dozen gay men over the course of 13 years. Some\njournalists made the connection to the Handcuff Man\u2019s crimes. \u201cAs in the case\nof Jeffrey Dahmer,\u201d Mary T. Schmich wrote in the Chicago Tribune on August 3,\n\u201cBennett\u2019s arrest has raised questions about the speed and sensitivity with\nwhich police handle crimes involving homosexual activity.\u201d Schmich quoted\nCathy Woolard, the activist who months before had asked the Atlanta police to\ntake the threat of the Handcuff Man seriously. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t care\nthat much if gay people get killed,\u201d Woolard said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter\nthat much that someone is savagely burning male hustlers, because they\u2019re not\nthe cream of the crop.\u201d\n\nThe article ended with an update on Bennett\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cBennett, who was\nreleased on bond, is spending the summer with his 85-year-old mother in\nTowanda,\u201d Schmich wrote, \u201cwhere he reportedly indulges a passion for\ngardening.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nTo work alongside Guy Notte in the Tampa case, Bennett hired a defense\nattorney based in Florida. Rochelle Reback had spent the previous decade\nrepresenting all sorts of clients, but none quite like Bennett. \u201cUsually\npeople involved in crimes of violence don\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d Reback said\nin an interview for this story. Bennett was different. \u201cWe had an\ninvestigator. We had a jury-selection expert. We had a lot of resources that a\nlot of clients can\u2019t afford,\u201d Reback said.\n\nWhen Reback visited Bennett\u2019s mother in Clearwater, there were photos of\nBennett everywhere. Many of them were from his childhood, when his mother had\ndressed him to the nines. \u201cOne was like Little Lord Fauntleroy looking, with\nhis long, curly hair,\u201d Reback said. Between how his mother viewed him and his\nwealth, it was clear to Reback that Bennett had led a cosseted life. And now\nhe seemed sure that his privilege would protect him. \u201cHe really just felt like\nthis was just one more case that was going to go by the wayside and he would\nsuffer no ongoing consequences,\u201d Reback said.\n\nBennett\u2019s arrogance grated on her. \u201cHe was the most unpleasant client I ever\nhad,\u201d Reback said. When they clashed about strategy, Notte stepped in to\nsmooth things over. He had a long history of appeasing Bennett. \u201cNotte wanted\nto keep Bob happy because Bob was a wealthy client,\u201d Reback said. Together,\nNotte and Reback tried to find character witnesses willing to testify on\nBennett\u2019s behalf, but according to Reback they found none. (Notte did not\nrespond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn October 1991, Clapp was interviewed for a front-page story in the St.\nPetersburg Times. The picture accompanying the article showed him in his\ngovernment-funded concrete-block apartment, seated in a wheelchair and\ncradling a black kitten. \u201cThere\u2019s times I forget I don\u2019t have legs and I want\nto get up and go take a walk, you know?\u201d Clapp said. He told the reporter that\nhe couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Bennett. \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019d like to see the same\nthing happen to him that happened to me,\u201d Clapp said.\n\nWhen they spoke to the press, Bennett\u2019s legal team tried to use what Reback\ncalled the SODDI defense (\u201csome other dude did it\u201d). Notte told a reporter\nthat Clapp\u2019s assault \u201csmacks of the cult [of] Santeria,\u201d because decapitated\nanimals were found near the crime scene. As for the accusations against\nBennett in Atlanta, Notte called them \u201cstupid lies.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, however, it was becoming clear that Bennett was likely to\nlose in court. Sisco and Purcell had obtained a five-minute video, shot by the\nTampa fire department, that showed Clapp burning in the mangroves; his cries\nof pain were audible. The prosecution upgraded the attempted murder charge to\ninclude use of a deadly weapon, which meant that, if convicted, Bennett could\nget a life sentence. This wasn\u2019t an outside possibility: The judge assigned to\nthe case was known for tough rulings.\n\nBennett\u2019s lawyers persuaded him to take a deal. On February 13, 1992, he\nappeared in court in Florida to plead guilty; he planned to do the same in\nAtlanta several days later. At least three of his victims\u2014Clapp, Jordan, and\nShrader\u2014were in the courtroom. Shrader wanted to lunge at Bennett as soon as\nhe laid eyes on him. \u201cBut I knew if I hit him right there,\u201d Shrader said, \u201cI\u2019d\nget hell.\u201d\n\nBennett, who stood with his arms crossed, was sentenced to 17 years in prison\nfollowed by 13 years of probation. Under Florida law, he would be eligible for\nparole in five years. Clapp considered the sentence too light. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nhe\u2019ll ever feel sorry for anything he\u2019s done,\u201d he told the court. \u201cHe\u2019s a sick\npuppy.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s attorneys requested that he be allowed some time to make\narrangements for his aging mother\u2019s care. He was told to turn himself in on\nMarch 9. \u201cI trust you as a man and as a lawyer,\u201d the judge told Bennett. The\nprosecution was stunned by the three-week reprieve. \u201cThis is clearly one of\nthe most heinous crimes I\u2019ve ever prosecuted,\u201d Purcell told the St. Petersburg\nTimes.\n\nFrustration mounted further when it was announced that Bennett might get a\ndeal that would allow him to serve his sentences in the Florida and Georgia\ncases concurrently rather than back-to-back. The Journal-Constitution argued\nin an editorial that this would effectively mean \u201cno prison time\u201d for the\ncrimes he\u2019d committed in Atlanta. \u201cThe full force of the legal system should\nbe used to show that such acts will not be tolerated and to prevent them from\nhappening again,\u201d the editorial said. Had Bennett\u2019s victims \u201cbeen women or\nstraight men ... it is hard to believe the Florida sentence and the Fulton\nplea bargain would even be discussed.\u201d (Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County.)\n\nGay-rights advocates agreed with the paper. Larry Pellegrini of the ACLU\ncalled the deal \u201chorrendous.\u201d Jeff Graham of Atlanta\u2019s chapter of ACT UP told\na reporter, \u201cI think that clearly you\u2019ve got a prejudiced judicial system in\nAtlanta.\u201d\n\nOn February 24, Bennett appeared in an Atlanta courtroom for sentencing. It\nwas packed, with cameras everywhere. Shrader was nervous, and when he got\nnervous he smiled; a lawyer told him to stop smiling.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued against the plea deal. Jordan\u2019s attorney said\nthat her client \u201cwants this man to serve life.\u201d Shrader\u2019s lawyer said that\n\u201cthis child of affluence has developed into a sadistic sociopath\u201d for whom\n\u201cthe concurrent sentence is not adequate.\u201d\n\nWhen the judge asked if Bennett wished to say anything, he said no.\n\n\u201cDid you, in fact, pick up those two fellows?\u201d the judge then inquired,\nreferring to Jordan and Shrader.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading guilty to the charge, your honor, on the advice of my counsel,\u201d\nBennett said.\n\n\u201cI asked you, did you pick up those two fellows?\u201d\n\nNotte interjected. \u201cYour honor, he would rather not answer that question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to hear from him. You don\u2019t want to say so, say you don\u2019t want to say\nso,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bennett responded.\n\nUltimately, the judge ruled in favor of the plea deal. In addition to the\nconcurrent prison sentences, Bennett was banned from Fulton County for life,\ninstructed to see a psychiatrist, and ordered to pay restitution of more than\n$100,000 to his victims. When asked where the money would come from, Notte\nsaid that Bennett would use his mother\u2019s trust fund.\n\nGay activists who had come to see the sentencing shouted \u201cshame\u201d repeatedly at\nthe judge. In an article for Southern Voice, reporter K.C. Wildmoon wrote that\nthe court sent \u201ca message to the lesbian and gay community, to the hustler\ncommunity, that these things will happen. It says \u2018you don\u2019t count.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cA danger to society.\u201d\n\nThere are lingering questions in the story of the Handcuff Man. Chief among\nthem is how many victims there actually were, and whether any of them died\nfrom the attacks. But no further indictments were ever brought against\nBennett. \u201cWhat upsets me the most is how many Max Shraders there are that\nmaybe nobody even knows about,\u201d said Don Hunnewell, the Gallus\u2019s owner. \u201cMaybe\nnobody even knows they died.\u201d (The Gallus closed in 1993.)\n\nGreer, who now lives in Virginia, wonders what lessons were learned from the\nwhole affair\u2014by the police, the media, and the wider Atlanta community. \u201cThe\nHandcuff Man was the perpetrator, but in a sense we\u2019re all accomplices. I\u2019m\ncertain a dead hustler on the south side today would be all but ignored, while\na crime against a wealthy family in Buckhead would get a lot of ink and\ncameras,\u201d he said, referring to one of Atlanta\u2019s poshest neighborhoods.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of why Bennett committed his crimes, what motive he\nhad. Was it a combination of rage and self-loathing? Shrader thinks so. \u201cHe\nwas gay and he hated that,\u201d Shrader said. \u201cThen he decided that he\u2019d get rid\nof [who he considered] the lowest of the gays, the slime on the totem pole,\nwhich were gay hustlers, and unfortunately I just happened to be in his path.\u201d\nFor her part, Reback said that she gleaned from her conversations with Notte\nthat Bennett was \u201cdeeply repressed\u201d and couldn\u2019t \u201cfunction sexually in any\nway.\u201d (After his convictions, Bennett filed a court motion claiming that\nReback had provided ineffective counsel; it was dismissed.)\n\nAn old friend of Bennett\u2019s in Towanda, quoted in the local paper, placed some\nof the blame for Bennett\u2019s crimes on the people who\u2019d helped him evade the\nconsequences of his actions as a young man. \u201cHe should have had some help\nearlier in his life when he got into some of the minor scraps in\nPennsylvania,\u201d the friend said. \u201cIf some of that was not covered up, he might\nhave gotten some sort of help.\u201d\n\nThe Handcuff Man himself never offered any insight. Two days after the\ncontentious Atlanta hearing, the judge in Florida revoked the bond he\u2019d\nreleased Bennett on so that he could sort out his mother\u2019s care. After his\nsentencing, Bennett had been seen cruising a red convertible through an area\nof Tampa known to be popular with gay hustlers. The judge called him \u201ca danger\nto society.\u201d\n\nOnce in prison, Bennett was placed in solitary confinement at his own request.\nEventually, he was moved to the general population because, as Notte told a\nreporter, he was \u201cgoing buggy\u201d in isolation. His mother died in 1993. Bennett\nwould receive a $1.5 million inheritance upon his release from prison.\n\nBut that never happened: On April 1, 1998, just one year before he was\nsupposed to get out, Bennett had a stroke and died behind bars. \u201cHe got the\nlife sentence that he probably deserved,\u201d Reback said.\n\nThe bulk of Bennett\u2019s estate went to Towanda\u2019s historical society and to the\nBoy Scouts. He left $25,000 to the son of his friend Ellie Harden Smith and\n$15,000 to the local country club, with the condition \u201cthat this bequest be\nacknowledged and established as a memorial to my grandfather, the Honorable\nWilliam Maxwell, my mother, Annabelle Maxwell Bennett, and myself, Robert Lee\nBennett, Jr.\u201d He also requested the erection of a memorial to himself and his\nmother as a condition of a gift to the county library. There was no mention of\nhonoring his father.\n\nAs for his personal effects, namely his clothing and photographs, he issued an\nunusual directive: Bennett said he wanted them burned.\n\n## More from The Atavist Magazine\n\n### Watch It Burn\n\n### Mayday\n\n### Damages\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Atavist Magazine.
