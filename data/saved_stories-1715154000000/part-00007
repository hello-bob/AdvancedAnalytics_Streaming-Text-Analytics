It was produced at Xerox PARC by Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi and\ncolleagues in 1974.^[2]\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nBravo was a modal editor\u2014characters typed on the keyboard were usually\ncommands to Bravo, except when in \"insert\" or \"append\" mode, in which case\nthey were entered into the character buffer. Bravo made extensive use of the\nmouse for marking locations in the text, as well as selecting areas of the\ntext, but it was not used for command entry. (Being at the very dawn of\ngraphical user interface design, a non-command driven interface was judged too\nambitious and possibly even inefficient and cumbersome.)\n\nIn addition to a long list of commands for controlling the formatting of the\ntext (e.g. the ability to adjust left and right margins for sections of text,\nselect fonts, etc.) Bravo also supported use of multiple buffers (i.e. files),\nand also multiple windows.\n\nAlthough Bravo usually displayed the text with formatting (e.g. with\njustification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters), it did not\nnormally attempt to reproduce the way a page would look in hardcopy. This was\nbecause the Alto monitor provided a resolution of 72 pixels per inch, but the\nlaser printers used at PARC provided a resolution of 300 PPI. This meant that\nthe screen could at best only provide an approximation of the way the page\nwould look when printed. Instead, the normal display mode showed the text\nusing character sizes, etc., more suited to the capability of the display.\n\nThere was a special display mode which did attempt to show the text exactly as\nit would appear when printed, and the normal command set worked in that mode\nas well. However, because the screen image was necessarily an approximation,\none would occasionally find characters and words slightly off (a problem that\ncontinues to this day with word processing systems).\n\nThe 72 PPI pixel size closely approximated the 72.27 points per inch used in\nthe commercial printing industry, so that a pixel in Bravo would be the same\nsize as a typeface point.\n\nBravo was the base for Gypsy, a later document system on the Alto, the first\nwith a modern graphical user interface.\n\nBravo was followed by BravoX, which was developed in 1979^[3] under Simonyi's\nleadership at Xerox's Advanced Systems Development (ASD) group. BravoX was\n\"modeless\", as was Gypsy. While Bravo (and BravoX) were originally implemented\nin BCPL for the Xerox Alto, BravoX was later re-implemented in a language\ncalled \"Butte\" (\"a Butte is a small Mesa\", as Charles Simonyi used to say).\nAlto BCPL compiled into Data General Nova machine instructions, which were in\nturn interpreted by Alto microcode. Butte compiled into Butte-specific byte\ncodes, which were interpreted by special Alto microcode, similar to the Mesa\nbytecode interpreter.\n\n## EDIT command[edit]\n\nEarly versions of Bravo had a command interface designed such that a user\nattempting to enter the command \"EDIT\" in command-mode would instead\nirreversibly replace all text with a \"T\". The \"e\" was interpreted to select\neverything. The \"d\" would delete everything selected. The \"i\" would switch\nback to input-mode with the \"t\" appearing as the only text. Only one action\ncould be undone, so only the insertion of the t could be reversed.^[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Borenstein, Nathaniel S. (1991).
