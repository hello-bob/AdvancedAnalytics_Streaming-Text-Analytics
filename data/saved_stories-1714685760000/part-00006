Crushed by the lowly x86 chip that Sun magazine ads once lampooned\nas breakfast cereal toys. PowerPC? It was so stupidly hot in Apple\u2019s Macs (and\nnot very fast either), that it makes today\u2019s stupidly hot 14th-gen Intel CPUs\nlook like, well, an Apple M3 in power efficiency.\n\nAnd how embarrassing was it for Apple, which once compared Intel\u2019s x86 Pentium\nII to a snail in a famous ad touting the performance of the PowerPC G3, to\nhave to eat its words, dump PowerPC overboard, and climb aboard Intel\u2019s x86\nchips to save the Macintosh from extinction?\n\nThere\u2019s more on the hit list too: DEC Alpha? Maybe DEC Omega instead for being\nthe last in the line. Motorola 68000? MOS 6502 and a serial-killer\u2019s back yard\nfull of other designs? All put into shallow graves by the inferior, \u201cobsolete\u201d\nx86 architecture loser tech companies and their fans have pissed and moaned\nabout for decades.\n\nHell, x86 even managed to kill Intel\u2019s own attempt to kill x86 in its failed\nItanium IA-64 CPUs. Yes, even Intel couldn\u2019t defeat x86 and it invented the\nbloody things.\n\nThe truth is that today, x86 dominates sales in everything from laptops to\ndesktops, workstations, and supercomputers.\n\nSo, how the hell can I look forward to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite\nactually being a good CPU and experience?\n\n## Competition, that\u2019s why\n\nCompetition is good for everyone. In 2000, Transmeta\u2019s very efficient, very\noverhyped \u2014 and very, very slow \u2014 VLIW-based Crusoe CPU helped push Intel to\ndust off its abandoned Pentium III design to compete in power efficiency as\nthe Pentium M. Pentium M was the basis for the original Core CPU, which begat\nthe Core 2 and Core i7 and is largely credited with saving Intel\u2019s x86 lineup\nfrom the dead-end future of the dismal NetBurst / Pentium 4 and appropriately\nnamed \u201cPentium D\u201d (what, Pentium F wasn\u2019t available?). Yep, trash talk.\n\nIn fact, if it wasn\u2019t for AMD\u2019s innovations with x86-64 / AMD64 in 2003, the\nx86 world would likely be a very different one today perhaps not dominated by\nx86. And, by the way, AMD\u2019s 4nm Ryzen mobile CPUs are wonderfully efficient\nand fast chips that often get ignored by Qualcomm and Apple \u2014 and they\u2019re\nx86-based.\n\n## Wintel isn\u2019t really a thing\n\nAnd before you utter what you think is a gotcha: \u201cWintel\u201d (the portmanteau of\nWindows and Intel), I\u2019ll remind you that Microsoft Windows has supported over\nthe years many of those dead architectures including DEC Alpha, IA-64, MIPS,\nand PowerPC. And despite the dismal failure of Surface RT (Arm-based Nvidia\nTegra 3), Surface RT 2 (Arm-based Nvidia Tegra 4), and Surface Pro X (Arm-\nbased Qualcomm SQ1), Microsoft obviously has continued to support Arm and is\nclearly the force pushing so hard for the Snapdragon X Elite to succeed.\n\nMicrosoft, you see, hasn\u2019t favored x86 to the detriment of other\narchitectures, it\u2019s just that x86 has kicked so much ass for so damned long,\nthat the only ones left standing today worth supporting with Windows are x86\nand Arm (yes, RISC-V, we\u2019ll see you in a PC when you get a Windows port).\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t fear Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite \u2014 and in fact welcome it\ninto the fray, because it\u2019ll either win and improve your Windows experience,\nor it\u2019ll make x86 stronger and better, which will also benefit all of us.\n\nMay the best chip win.\n\n### Author: Gordon Mah Ung, Executive Editor\n\nOne of founding fathers of hardcore tech reporting, Gordon has been covering\nPCs and components since 1998.\n\n### Recent stories by Gordon Mah Ung:\n\n  * PC maker offers a potential fix for crashing Intel CPUs\n  * The Full Nerd ep 248: Ryzen 9 7950X3D and the state of PC gaming\n  * Three AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D misconceptions debunked\n\nPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and\nthe advice you need to get the job done.\n\n  * Policies\n\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookie Policy\n    * Copyright Notice\n    * European Privacy Settings\n    * Member Preferences\n    * Editorial independence\n    * Licensing & Eprints\n    * California: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n  * About\n\n    * About Us\n    * Advertise\n    * Ad Choice\n    * Contact Us\n    * Foundry Careers\n    * GamePro\n    * Smart Answers\n\n  * PCWorld Categories\n\n    * Business\n\nLaptop\n\nMobile\n\nPC Hardware\n\nDeals\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n    * Digital Magazine - Subscribe\n\nDigital Magazine - Info\n\nGift Subscription\n\nNewsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 IDG Communications, Inc.\n\nTop Of Page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
