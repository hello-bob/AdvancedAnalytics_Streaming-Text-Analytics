Known then by its codename\nWolverine, the project to build a pair of super-powered earbuds gained\nmomentum within the walls of Google's hallowed R&D lab and seemed like it\ncould \u2014 just maybe \u2014 be the rare idea that turns into a real product.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nA few months later, Wolverine's lead, Jason Rugolo, spun the project out of\nAlphabet and formed a startup named Iyo. Rugolo says the company plans to ship\nits first product by the end of this year.\n\nIyo has raised $21 million in funding so far from a handful of investors,\nincluding Alphabet, Lockheed Martin, and Horizons Ventures. Rugolo won't\ncomment on whether Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who BI reported was a big fan\nof the project, has invested any of his own money. He also wouldn't comment on\nthe terms of Alphabet's investment but says nobody from the company sits on\nIyo's board.\n\nThe company is building two projects in tandem. The flagship device is Iyo\nOne, which is made out of two earbuds, custom-fit to the user, that can\nenhance and manipulate sounds from the outside world while also letting the\nuser speak to AI \"agents\" (think about searching for information or doing\ntasks on the go). And, of course, they can play music. The second device is a\nhigh-end pair of headphones aimed at audio professionals.\n\nAI will play a big role here. Rugolo, a former program director in the US\ngovernment's ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy), joined\nGoogle X in late 2017, just after a group of Google researchers published the\nTransformers paper that has been the foundation of large language models built\nby OpenAI, Google, and others.\n\n\"We started poking a lot at those models and how effective they were at\nconversation,\" said Rugolo. Within X, employees are told to try and \"kill\"\nprojects by finding ways they may fail down the road. With Wolverine, many of\nthe original ideas survived, but some did not.\n\nOne original idea that survived, which Rugolo spent years trying to solve, is\nthe ability to manipulate and isolate noises in a user's environment. If\nyou're having a conversation in a noisy bar, you could ask Iyo to drown out\nannoying sounds (\"quiet the crying baby\") and turn up the volume of your\nfriend's voice. Rugolo says the first iteration of the device will ship with\nthis feature.\n\nThen there are the AI \"agents.\" Similar to the AI agents that other companies\nlike OpenAI and Google are now racing to build, these will perform specific\ntasks for the user, such as searching for information, running through your\ngrocery list when you're at the store, or acting like a personal DJ by\naccessing your music apps.\n\n## Don't call it a hearable\n\nThe \"hearables\" space is littered with startups that never made it. Iyo's\nproduct echoes the Here One earbuds built by Doppler Labs, a startup founded\nby Noah Kraft in 2013 (and shuttered in 2017). Rugolo told BI he hired Kraft\nfor a stint at Google X to work on what would become Iyo.\n\nRugolo doesn't like the word \"hearables,\" which he sees as a generation of\ndevices that offer audio with a few extra bells and whistles.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"They're almost just Bluetooth audio peripherals that have one or two\nadditional features to them,\" said Rugolo. \"We sort of came from a completely\ndifferent direction, which is about human-computer interface.\"\n\nIyo One Jason Rugolo\n\nNow, a stream of new gadgets is jumping on the AI hype and falling flat.\nHumane's AI Pin has been eviscerated in reviews, and the response to the\nRabbit R1, an AI-powered virtual assistant, has been lukewarm.\n\nThen there's the competition already in our ears: Apple's AirPods are a\nrunaway success that cost less than a third of the $599 starting price Iyo is\nasking for.\n\nRugolo knows all this and says Iyo is competing with high-end audio devices.\nSuccess for the first device will be selling \"tens of thousands of units,\"\nsaid Rugolo, \"not a hundred million.\"\n\nIyo also plans to allow third parties to design apps for its products. Rugolo\nsays he'd like to get big players like Spotify on board to build for it, and\nhe's open to working with Google and Amazon on bringing their AI assistants to\nit, too. That will first require users.\n\nRugolo is reluctant to say much about what will be available at launch and\nwhat will arrive further down the road. Some of that is due to a fear of\noverpromising (Rugolo cites the recent reception to the Humane AI Pin) and a\nhope that developers and companies may want to build apps for the device.\n\nShowing off the device at the TED conference last week, Rugolo said audio\ndevices could get people to spend less time on their phones. Unlike some AI\nhardware companies hitting the market, he made a point several times in our\nconversation to insist that Iyo isn't trying to kill the smartphone.\n\n\"You'll notice we're not trying to replace them,\" he says. \"We're trying to\naugment them.\"\n\n## \"We were the fastest-growing project at X\"\n\nIyo is trying to tackle several engineering challenges here, so why not stay\nat Google and keep building Iyo there?\n\n\"I think it was much healthier on the outside for a kind of hardware like\nthis, especially a new kind of AI hardware,\" says Rugolo, who told BI that\nWolverine gradually encountered an \"immune response\" within the company as\ndepartments working on similar projects became concerned about how Rugolo's\nteam was encroaching on their territory.\n\n\"We were the fastest-growing project at X,\" said Rugolo. \"All of a sudden we\nstart getting a lot of interest and intrigue from other areas.\"\n\nIyo isn't the first X project to fly from Alphabet's nest, and it probably\nwon't be the last. BI previously reported that leadership within X had\ndiscussed spinning more projects out of the parent company entirely, possibly\nwith Alphabet taking a stake, rather than trying to turn them into Google\ncompanies \u2014 or killing them entirely.\n\n\"I think that X is going to do more like this in the future,\" said Rugolo.\n\"They're thinking about novel ways to scale projects.\"\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: AI can help audio advertisers lower costs through use of synthetic\nvoices and automated copy writing, says SiriusXM's Lizzie Widhelm\n\nGoogle\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
