For this analysis, we surveyed 10,133 U.S. adults\nfrom Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.\n\nEveryone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American\nTrends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national,\nrandom sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults\nhave a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the\nU.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation,\neducation and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\n\nHere are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the\nsurvey methodology.\n\nMost Americans are wary of social media\u2019s role in politics and its overall\nimpact on the country, and these concerns are ticking up among Democrats,\naccording to a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults. Still,\nRepublicans stand out on several measures, with majorities believing major\ntechnology companies are biased toward liberals.\n\nOur survey asked Americans about three key areas: Social media\u2019s impact on politics and the country | Political censorship and bias in Big Tech| Government regulation of technology companies\n\n### Social media\u2019s impact on politics and the country\n\nSince 2020, more Americans \u2013 particularly Democrats \u2013 believe social media\ncompanies wield too much political power. Roughly eight-in-ten Americans (78%)\nsay these companies have too much power and influence in politics today,\naccording to a new Pew Research Center survey of 10,133 U.S. adults conducted\nFeb. 7-11, 2024. This is up from 72% in 2020.\n\nAnother 16% say these sites have the right amount of political influence,\nwhile only 4% think they don\u2019t have enough power.\n\nViews by party\n\nRepublicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party (84%) are\nmore likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners (74%) to think these\ncompanies have too much political power. And while Republicans\u2019 opinions have\nchanged little since 2020, this view has grown more common among Democrats\nover the past four years: 74% of Democrats believe social media companies have\ntoo much power and influence in politics, up from 63% in 2020.\n\n#### What impact does social media have on the country?\n\nAmericans are far more likely to say social media has a negative rather than\npositive impact on the country. Roughly two-thirds (64%) think social media\nhas a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in the country today.\n\nOnly 10% describe social media as having a mostly positive impact on the\ncountry. And about a quarter say these sites have neither a positive nor a\nnegative effect.\n\nThese overall figures are nearly identical to what the Center found in 2020.\nFor instance, the share of Americans who see social media\u2019s impact on the\ncountry as mostly negative has remained at 64%.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both political parties see social media\u2019s impact on the country\nnegatively, though Republicans remain more wary than Democrats (71% vs. 59%).\nThat said, a growing number of Democrats believe these platforms have a mostly\nbad impact on the country, rising to 59% in our current survey, up from 53% in\n2020.\n\nBy comparison, the share of Republicans who say social media negatively\naffects the way things are going in the country has dropped from 78% in 2020\nto 71% today.\n\n### Political censorship and bias in Big Tech\n\nAs social media has become a key way people share news and information, some\nlawmakers and commentators \u2013 especially conservatives \u2013 have expressed\nconcerns that these companies are politically biased and limit free speech.\n\nOur survey finds that most Americans think social media sites actively censor\npolitical viewpoints they disagree with. Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults\n(83%) say it\u2019s very or somewhat likely that these platforms intentionally\ncensor political viewpoints they find objectionable, up from 77% in 2022. Just\n17% in the current survey think this is not likely the case.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both parties believe political censorship is likely occurring on\nsocial media, but more Republicans hold this view. Fully 93% of Republicans\nsay it\u2019s likely that social media sites intentionally censor political\nviewpoints that they find objectionable, including 66% who say that this is\nvery likely happening.\n\nBy comparison, 74% of Democrats think this is likely occurring, with 25%\nsaying there\u2019s a strong possibility this is occurring.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 views have held steady since 2022. But the share of Democrats who\nthink it\u2019s likely that social media sites intentionally censor political\nviewpoints they object to is rising \u2013 74% say this today, up from 66% two\nyears ago.\n\n#### Do major technology companies have liberal or conservative biases?\n\nOverall, Americans are more likely to think Big Tech companies support the\nviews of liberals over conservatives than the other way around. More than\nfour-in-ten U.S. adults (44%) think major technology companies support the\nviews of liberals over conservatives. Far fewer \u2013 15% \u2013 say these companies\nsupport conservative views over liberal ones. Still, a notable share (37%)\nthinks this industry equally values conservative and liberal viewpoints.\n\nViews by party\n\nRepublicans widely believe that major tech companies have a pro-liberal bias.\nFully 71% of Republicans say major technology companies support the views of\nliberals over conservatives. Much smaller shares believe these companies\nsupport the views of liberals and conservatives equally (22%) or favor\nconservative beliefs over liberal ones (6%).\n\nBy contrast, the most commonly held view among Democrats is that technology\ncompanies support the views of conservatives and liberals equally, with 50%\nsaying this. Roughly a quarter of Democrats either say that these companies\nfavor the views of conservatives over liberals (25%) or liberals over\nconservatives (22%).\n\nWhile there\u2019s been little change in views since 2022, there are some\ndifferences when comparing today\u2019s views to those in 2018, when we first\nstarted asking these questions.\n\nOver the past six years, a rising share of Republicans say major tech\ncompanies favor liberal over conservative views (71% today vs. 64% in 2018),\nwhile more Democrats today than in the past think these companies support\nconservative views more than liberal ones (25% today vs. 16% in 2018).\n\n### Government regulation of technology companies\n\nAmid concerns over free speech, social media\u2019s impact on youth and AI\u2019s\nimpending foothold, lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the political\naisle have pushed for more government oversight of the tech industry.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long-running debate about what role the government should play\nin regulating Big Tech. We wanted to know where Americans stand, how views\nhave changed over time, and whether opinions vary by party.\n\nAmericans favor more rather than less regulation of Big Tech companies. When\nasked whether the government should regulate major technology companies more,\nless or at its current level, 51% believe these companies should be regulated\nmore than they are now. Far fewer \u2013 16% \u2013 feel they should be regulated less\nthan they are now.\n\nStill, 31% say their current level of regulation should stay the same.\n\nSupport for more government regulation of technology companies is identical to\nwhat it was in 2018. Support for more regulation has risen and fallen somewhat\nover the past six years, ranging from 44% in 2022 to 56% in 2021. The share of\nAmericans who think these companies should be regulated more than they are now\nis identical to what the Center found in 2018, when we first asked the\nquestion. At the same time, the share who say there should be less regulation\nhas increased from 9% in 2018 to 16% today.\n\nViews by party\n\nDemocrats are more supportive of increased government oversight of tech\ncompanies than are Republicans. Six-in-ten Democrats say the government should\nregulate major technology companies more than it is now, compared with 45% of\nRepublicans.\n\nThe partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans is similar to that in 2022.\nBut these differences have not always been large. For instance, similar shares\nof Republicans (48%) and Democrats (46%) favored more regulation of technology\ncompanies back in 2020.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\u2190 Prev Page\n\n2 3\n\nNext Page \u2192\n\n### Sign up for our weekly newsletter\n\nFresh data delivery Saturday mornings\n\nSign Up\n\n### Sign up for The Briefing\n\nWeekly updates on the world of news & information\n\nSign Up\n\nTopics\n\n  * Free Speech & Press\n  * Tech Companies\n  * Technology Policy Issues\n\nShare This Link:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * Threads\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n\nShare\n\n### Related\n\nreportFeb 1, 2024\n\n## From Businesses and Banks to Colleges and Churches: Americans\u2019 Views of\nU.S. Institutions\n\nreportOct 18, 2023\n\n## How Americans View Data Privacy\n\nshort readNov 17, 2022\n\n## Anti-corporate sentiment in U.S. is now widespread in both parties\n\nshort readOct 20, 2022\n\n## Key facts about Parler\n\nreportOct 6, 2022\n\n## The Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information\nEnvironment\n\n### Most Popular\n\n1\n\nIn Tight Presidential Race, Voters Are Broadly Critical of Both Biden and\nTrump\n\n2\n\nA growing share of Americans have little or no confidence in Netanyahu\n\n3\n\nWhat the data says about abortion in the U.S.\n\n4\n\nWhat Are Americans\u2019 Top Foreign Policy Priorities?\n\n5\n\nAmericans\u2019 Social Media Use\n\n## Report Materials\n\n  * Report PDF\n  * Topline\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n  * Americans\u2019 Views of Technology Companies\n\n    * Social media\u2019s impact on politics and the country\n    * Political censorship and bias in Big Tech\n    * Government regulation of technology companies\n\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n#### Research Topics\n\n  * Age & Generations\n  * Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n  * Economy & Work\n  * Family & Relationships\n  * Gender & LGBTQ\n  * Immigration & Migration\n  * International Affairs\n  * Internet & Technology\n  * Methodological Research\n  * News Habits & Media\n  * Non-U.S. Governments\n  * Other Topics\n  * Politics & Policy\n  * Race & Ethnicity\n  * Religion\n  * Science\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Email Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Tumblr\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that\ninforms the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.\nIt conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content\nanalysis and other empirical social science research.
