In 2023 India surpassed China as the most populous country.\nChina\u2019s population began shrinking in 2022, and the latest United Nations\nreport indicates that it could slip to 1.3 billion in 2050 and then plummet to\nonly 770 million in 2100.\n\nAs this news spreads, warnings of a looming crisis are growing louder. Perhaps\nmost concerning of these is that China will not have enough young people to\ngrow the economy or support older adults. But China\u2019s declining populace could\nbe a cause for opportunity rather than a crisis. China could arrive at a\nstable and sustainable population of around one billion in 2100. At this\nlevel, it is possible for the country to remain a global superpower and for\nits citizens to become even more prosperous, with its older adults well cared\nfor. And China\u2019s experience in making this transition could provide valuable\nlessons for many other countries that will have a declining population in the\ncoming decades.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has flipped its population policy twice since\nassuming power in 1949. Initially the policy was very pronatalist\u2014it promoted\nreproduction and a high national birth rate. Then in 1979 a strict one-child\npolicy was adopted alongside the economic reforms launched by former leader\nDeng Xiaoping that fueled China\u2019s extraordinary economic rise. In 2015,\nprompted by a sharply falling birth rate, a pronatalist policy was\nreintroduced that allowed two-child families, and a policy that allowed three-\nchild families was introduced in 2021.\n\nThe most recent policy statement came from Chinese president Xi Jinping in his\naddress to the 13th National Women\u2019s Congress in October 2023: \u201cWe should\nactively foster a new type of marriage and childbearing culture.\u201d Other\naddresses at the Congress reflected a shift away from gender equality, even to\nthe point of suggesting that women leave the labor force to have children.\nSuch pronatalist policies run against the sentiment among a large segment of\nChina\u2019s youth, however. And many people do not want to have one or more\nchildren.\n\nChina\u2019s population decline raises fundamental issues about childbearing,\ndependency ratios and \u201coptimum\u201d population size. Demographers have a way of\ndescribing a country\u2019s population in a graphic: the population pyramid. It\nshows the number of male and female members of a population at a point in\ntime, typically in five-year age groups, which is helpful for understanding\nsocietal issues.\n\nChina\u2019s population in 1980 was around 980 million. It was distributed in the\nclassic pyramid shape of a growing population: wider at the younger ages and\nnarrower at the older ages. (See the graphic below.) One quirk was that there\nwas a slightly smaller 20\u201324 age group than the 25\u201329 age group because of\ndisruption caused by the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. The 15\u201319\nand 10\u201314 age groups reflected a rebound. But the beginning of the 40-year\ntrend toward smaller age groups could be seen in the five-to-nine and zero-to-\nfour age groups. China\u2019s one-child policy reinforced this trend, but other\nfactors contributed, such as rapidly rising incomes, education, urbanization\nand better access to birth control.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data)\n\nBy 2020 these factors dramatically changed the shape of China\u2019s population\npyramid as its total population peaked at around 1.4 billion (below). The\n\u201cbulge\u201d of older people that is widely viewed as a future crisis can be\nclearly seen in the increased number of people aged 30\u201359.\n\nAn important factor is the dependency ratio, which compares the \u201cdependent\u201d\npopulation of youth (zero to 14 years of age) and older adults (aged 65 and\nolder) to the working population between the ages of 15 and 64. In 1980\nChina\u2019s ratio was 68 dependents for every 100 people of working age. In 2020\nit was a more favorable 44 per 100. The coming bulge of older adults, however,\nwill push the ratio up to a potentially socially destabilizing level\u2014as much\nas 89 per 100 around 2085, according to our calculation.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data)\n\nIt is useful to put these images into a broader historical and global context.\nAround 1900 the global population began growing exponentially. The increase\nwas driven primarily by falling death rates and reflected improvements in\nsanitation and public health. This trend produced a \u201cdemographic transition\u201d\nfrom the historic pattern of birth rates closely matching death rates that\nyielded a slowly growing human population over millennia.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Early Humans Sheltered in This Lava Tube 10,000 Years Ago\u2014And It\u2019s Still in Use Today\n\nGillian Dohrn & Nature magazine\n\n  * ### We Are Living in the Pyrocene, the Age of Fire that We Created\n\nStephen Pyne\n\n  * ### To Ancient Maya, Solar Eclipses Signified Clashing Gods\n\nKimberly H. Breuer & The Conversation US\n\n  * ### Ancient Egyptian Mummies Reveal What Diseases Plagued the Civilization\n\nSara Novak\n\nAround 2000 a global transition in the opposite direction became increasingly\nvisible: birth rates started to fall below death rates, which began setting\nthe stage for shrinking populations and rising dependency ratios. Almost all\nhigh-income and middle-income countries now face these prospects. Many of the\ncountries with a population growing faster than 1 percent per year are low-\nincome countries in Africa.\n\nThe population pyramids for India and Japan illustrate these trends. India\u2019s\npyramid (below) has the classic shape of a growing population. India has a\nfavorable dependency ratio of 47 and a median age of 27.9\u2014although smaller age\ngroups at the bottom of the pyramid signal the beginning of the country\u2019s\ntransition toward a smaller population. The trend is too weak, however, to\nprovide relief for India\u2019s very high level of youth unemployment, which is\nconsiderably greater than China\u2019s and has the potential to create social\nturmoil.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data)\n\nJapan\u2019s pyramid is distinctly top-heavy, with an unfavorable dependency ratio\nof 71 and a median age of 48.7, reflecting a strong demographic transition\nthat began 45 years ago. It is hard to avoid a sense of crisis. The U.N.\nforecast has Japan\u2019s population falling from 125 million in 2020 to 75 million\nin 2100.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data)\n\nA country\u2019s population is shaped primarily by its birth rate and death rate.\nIn today\u2019s world, with widely available means of family planning, the number\nof births in high-income countries is largely determined by the number of\nchildren people want to have. The number of deaths is determined by a complex\nset of biological, social and environmental factors. Migration is an important\nfactor in some countries.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) is the number of children an individual of\nchildbearing age will have, on average, in their lifetime. A TFR of 2.1 yields\na stable population over time. Population will rise in a country with a TFR\nabove 2.1 and fall with a TFR below 2.1. In 2020 Niger had the world\u2019s highest\nTFR, at 6.89. South Korea had the lowest, at 0.89.\n\nChina\u2019s TFR was 5.8 in 1970. Over the next 20 years it slid slowly and then\nrapidly toward the replacement level of 2.1. In the 1990s it dropped much\nfurther, and it reached a U.N. estimate of 1.18, one of the lowest in the\nworld, in 2022.\n\nFor any country a TFR this small is bad news. But people who see China\u2019s low\nrate as a crisis are misled by a common forecasting practice that often leads\nto unrealistic conclusions: they are extrapolating China\u2019s current rate\nindefinitely into the future. In particular, the U.N. World Population\nProspects report for 2022 used a roughly constant TFR of 1.18 to forecast that\nChina\u2019s population will fall to 770 million in 2100.\n\nThe pyramid that results from this forecast (below) is dramatically different\nfrom the one for 2020. The 770 million number comes from the U.N.\u2019s \u201cmedium\nscenario.\u201d The high scenario is 1.15 billion and the low scenario is a\nshocking 494 million.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data)\n\nBut the pyramid above is just a snapshot of what this will look like. As the\nyears advance, the bulge of older people in China\u2019s 2020 pyramid will move up\nand peak around 2050. And unless some medical breakthroughs prolong life\nexpectancy well beyond 100 years, the bulge will be gone by 2130.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nIn other words, China has 27 years (from 2023 to 2050) to adjust to the peak\nbulge of its older population and then another 80 years (from 2050 to 2130)\nduring which the bulge will shrink steadily until it has disappeared. This\nbulge should be manageable because it is a transition phenomenon playing out\nover decades and because it might not take radical policy reforms in the short\nterm to make life pleasant for people who have reached retirement age.\n\nIn 2019 the Chinese government released a \u201cNational Mid and Long-Term Plan for\nActively Responding to Population Aging.\u201d In the decades ahead, the most\nobvious policy adjustment would be to keep people in the workforce longer.\nMost men in China currently retire at age 60, whereas women in white-collar\njobs retire at age 55 and women in blue-collar jobs at age 50. The 2019 plan\nset the stage for the Chinese government\u2019s announcement in 2021 that it would\ngradually increase the legal retirement age.\n\nChina's aging population is already spurring rapid development in the\ncaregiving industry. In Shanghai, for example, an online platform has been\ncreated that connects families seeking caregiving assistance with available\ncaregivers. China might find useful ideas from other countries, too. The\npolitical pressures in Japan, Korea and Taiwan to address their bulge in the\nolder population is especially strong, and these countries may implement some\neffective policies and programs. A great deal of experimentation is underway\nin European countries, most of which have TFRs below replacement level. In the\nU.S., one response is the aging-in-place \u201cvillage movement,\u201d which is helping\nolder adults in urban communities to remain in their own home through\ncooperative support.\n\nToday the social environment for Chinese people of childbearing age is\nuncertain and confusing. Chinese women are caught between the patriarchal\ndemand that treats childbearing as normative and the authoritarian state\u2019s\npronatalist push, said Yun Zhou of the University of Michigan in a November\n2023 webinar.\n\nThe biggest drivers of China\u2019s falling TFR appear to be the generally rising\nliving standard and educational advancement of women. Most empirical evidence\naround the world shows that women with more education have fewer children.\nThis partly comes from marrying later. It is also caused by not wanting to\nlose income by leaving work to raise a child. One obvious policy adjustment\nwould be to greatly expand childcare facilities. Another would be to adopt\ngenerous maternity leave policies with continuing employment guaranteed.\n\nFuture trends worldwide are also unclear. Artificial intelligence and robotics\nwill be powerful drivers of change, for example. The policy challenges for all\ncountries with a shrinking population will be great, and they are likely to be\neven greater for countries with a growing population. Nigeria, for example, is\non track to double its population in the next 40 years from around 220 million\nto 440 million people, overtaking projections for the U.S. as the third most\npopulous country in the world.\n\nUnderlying everything the government of China is considering to slow its\npopulation decline\u2014and the reactions of commentators who see the decline as a\ncrisis\u2014is concern that a smaller population will make China economically\nweaker and diminish its influence in the world. This is where public opinion\nand policy debate may be the most misguided.\n\nIf the measure of economic progress in China is growth in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), then a shrinking population would be a contributing factor\nholding back GDP growth. But China\u2019s population is becoming better educated.\nThe country is also installing more industrial robots than any other nation.\nThere is no plausible reason to believe that China\u2019s economic productivity\nwill stop increasing. There is also no experience in the rest of the world\nthat validates the concern that a smaller population will undermine China\u2019s\nstatus as a global superpower.\n\nThe size of a country\u2019s population has never been a good measure of the well-\nbeing of its inhabitants, either. Economists have not yet adopted a widely\naccepted way of measuring well-being. But China now has the potential to\npioneer policies that stabilize a shrinking population, raise productivity and\nenhance well-being. These policies can inspire other countries in the same\nsituation while at the same time helping the world overcome the existential\nthreat of climate change.\n\nCuriously, the debate about population in China\u2014or the world\u2014is never cast in\nterms of an \u201coptimum population size.\u201d Debates on setting specific targets for\npopulation size or growth have become contentious because of concerns over\ncoercion. In addition, there is a prevailing perception in the Global South\nthat population stabilization efforts are strategies favored by the Global\nNorth so it maintains its hegemony.\n\nYet worldwide it seems clear that no population larger than the current eight\nbillion is sustainable at the current living standard of the global middle\nclass. It is even less sustainable at the standard of high-income countries.\nThe U.N. could contribute meaningfully to the climate-change debate by\nidentifying an approximate population size for the world in 2050 or 2100 that\nwould be more sustainable given resource and technology constraints.\n\nA robust concept of optimum population size is not static, however. It changes\nover time as technology advances, natural resources are extracted and\ncountries evolve socially. For example, there may be a time when a global\npopulation greater than eight billion will be sustainable if nuclear fusion\npower becomes feasible and vegetarian protein replaces meat-based protein in\ndiets. It should also be scientifically possible to identify a smaller global\npopulation that can be supported at a generally higher standard of living\nwithout aggravating global warming and reducing biodiversity.\n\nWe are not proposing an optimum population size for China. But here is one\nplausible scenario toward a smaller and more sustainable population, albeit\none that many demographers might deem overly optimistic. On this path, which\nwe have calculated, China\u2019s TFR stabilizes for the next 20 years and then\nstarts rising, approaching the 2.1 replacement level around the beginning of\nthe next century. That yields a total population around 1.2 billion,in\ncontrast to the U.N.\u2019s forecast of 770 million. Based on an alternative\ndemographic path we calculated, China\u2019s population pyramid in 2100 would look\nmuch less alarming (below). China could become even more influential globally\nif it follows this kind of path.\n\nShuyao Xiao; Source: 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. United\nNations, 2022 (data); Lex Rieffel and Xueqing (Zoey) Wang (additional\ncalculations)\n\nIn general, countries with a declining population need not make policy\nadjustments with great urgency. Changes can be adopted over several\ngenerations, with lots of experimentation. Indeed, with no fanfare, a lot of\nadjustments are already moving countries in the direction of smaller and more\nharmonious populaces.\n\nFor example, governments in many countries are reassessing mandatory\nretirement ages to encourage more years of employment. They are changing\npension schemes to make them fiscally sustainable for longer periods. They are\nmaking it easier for people to have children by making fertility treatments\nmore accessible, extending parental leave and expanding childcare facilities.\nPerhaps the most crucial policy reforms will be those that support a very\ndifferent work-life balance as artificial intelligence and robotics redefine\nemployment. Some radical solutions will inevitably emerge, possibly including\nthe implementation of a universal basic income for all adults.\n\nFundamentally, the decisions made by young and old people in countries with a\ndeclining population will determine how quickly and smoothly a country arrives\nat a stable and sustainable population. Policies will shape the path, but the\nbottom-up actions of the people will be the difference between countries that\nmake the transition peacefully and those that experience serious disorder.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nLex Rieffel is founder of the From the Bridge Foundation and a former U.S.\nTreasury Department economist and Brookings Institution scholar.\n\nMore by Lex Rieffel\n\nXueqing Wang is a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University\u2019s Office of\nPopulation Research, where she is researching population aging with a focus on\ndemographic change and social inequalities.\n\nMore by Xueqing Wang\n\n# Popular Stories\n\nAnimals April 25, 2024\n\n##\n\nWe Are in the Golden Age of Bird-Watching\n\nThere has never been a better time to be or become a birder\n\nKate Wong\n\nAstrophysics April 26, 2024\n\n##\n\nThe Threat of a Solar Superstorm Is Growing\u2014And We\u2019re Not Ready\n\nSomeday an unlucky outburst from our sun could strike Earth and fry most of\nour electronics\u2014and we\u2019ve already had some too-close-for-comfort near misses\n\nPhil Plait\n\nOpinion January 3, 2024\n\n##\n\nStop Asking If the Universe Is a Computer Simulation\n\nWe will never know if we live in a computer simulation; here is a more\ninteresting question\n\nSimon Duan\n\nOpinion April 29, 2024\n\n##\n\nThere Are Safer Ways to Bed-Share with a Baby\n\nFor some parents, bed-sharing is the only way their baby can sleep.
