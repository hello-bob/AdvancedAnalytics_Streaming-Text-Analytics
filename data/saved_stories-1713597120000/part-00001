He\nshowed a profit where there were losses. He used HeadSpin\u2019s cash to make risky\ntrades on tech stocks. And he created fake invoices to cover it all up.\n\nWhat was especially breathtaking was how easily Mr. Lachwani, now 48, pulled\nall that off.\n\nWhile HeadSpin had raised $117 million from top tech investors \u2014 including GV,\nthe venture capital arm of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet; and Iconiq Capital,\nwhich helps manage Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s billions \u2014 it had no chief financial\nofficer, had no human resources department and was never audited.\n\nMr. Lachwani used that lack of oversight to paint a rosier picture of\nHeadSpin\u2019s growth. Even though its main investors knew the start-up\u2019s\nfinancials were not accurate, according to Mr. Lachwani\u2019s lawyers, they chose\nto invest anyway, eventually propelling HeadSpin to a $1.1 billion valuation\nin 2020. When the investors pushed Mr. Lachwani to add a chief financial\nofficer and share more details about the company\u2019s finances, he simply brushed\nthem off.\n\nThese details emerged this month in filings in U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California after Mr. Lachwani had pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of fraud in April. He is set to be sentenced next month, with a maximum\npenalty of 20 years in prison for each count.\n\nThe absence of controls at HeadSpin is part of an increasingly noticeable\npattern at Silicon Valley start-ups that have run into trouble. Over the past\ndecade, investors in tech start-ups were so eager to back hot companies that\nmany often overlooked reckless behavior and gave up key controls like board\nseats, all in the service of fast growth and disruption. Then when founders\ntook the ethos of \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d too far, their investors were\noften unaware or helpless.\n\nFTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed last year, had a three-person\nboard with barely any influence over the company, tracked its finances on\nQuickBooks and used a small, little-known accounting firm. Theranos, the\nfailed blood-testing company, had no financial audits for six years. The\nfounders of those companies have been convicted of fraud.\n\nImage\n\nElizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, in 2022 after she was convicted of\nfraud.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nNow, amid a start-up shakeout, more frauds have started coming to light. The\nfounder of the college aid company Frank has been charged, the internet\nconnectivity start-up Cloudbrink has been sued, and the social media app IRL\nhas been investigated and sued. Last month, Mike Rothenberg, a Silicon Valley\ninvestor, was found guilty on 21 counts of fraud and money laundering. On\nMonday, Trevor Milton, founder of the electric vehicle company Nikola, was\nsentenced to four years in prison for lying about Nikola\u2019s technological\ncapabilities.\n\n\u201cGovernance got a bit loosey-goosey during the bubble,\u201d said Healy Jones, vice\npresident of financial strategy at Kruze Consulting, a provider of financial\nservices for start-ups. Lately, Mr. Jones said, he has noticed venture firms\ndoing more due diligence on potential investments, but \u201cthey probably\nshouldn\u2019t get a gold star for fulfilling their job description.\u201d\n\nThrough a lawyer, Mr. Lachwani declined to comment.\n\nRajeev Butani, who took over as HeadSpin\u2019s chief executive in 2020, said in a\nstatement that the company\u2019s board took immediate action after Mr. Lachwani\u2019s\nconduct was discovered that year and cooperated with the government\ninvestigation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to our customers who have supported us through the journey,\u201d\nMr. Butani added.\n\nMr. Lachwani started HeadSpin in 2015 in Palo Alto, Calif., after selling his\nprevious company, Appurify, to Google. Businesses use HeadSpin\u2019s technology to\ntest and monitor their apps across various geographies and devices. The start-\nup quickly attracted money from investors including SV Angel, Felicis and GV.\n\nThere were soon red flags. HeadSpin\u2019s financial statements often arrived\nmonths late, if at all, investors said in legal declarations. The company\u2019s\nfinancial department consisted of one external accountant who worked mostly\nfrom home using QuickBooks, a basic system designed for small businesses.\nHeadSpin had no human resources department or organizational chart and wasn\u2019t\naudited.\n\nAround 2015, Mr. Lachwani saw an opportunity to profit on HeadSpin\u2019s cash\nreserves. \u201cIt is extremely sad to see money reaping really low interest,\u201d he\nwrote in an email that year to Karim Faris, an investor at GV who sat on\nHeadSpin\u2019s board.\n\nMr. Faris advised Mr. Lachwani to keep the cash in \u201cvery conservative and\nliquid instruments.\u201d But over the next few years, Mr. Lachwani used HeadSpin\u2019s\ncash to buy stocks and options in tech companies including Snap, Roku and\nTesla, according to bank statements filed as part of the case. At one point,\nhe sent Mr. Faris a bank statement that showed the money was in cash and cash\nequivalents, according to Mr. Faris\u2019s declaration.\n\nA GV spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nBy 2017, Mr. Lachwani was overstating HeadSpin\u2019s revenue to investors by\nincluding income from customer contracts that had not been finalized and one\nthat had been canceled, he said in his plea agreement.\n\nHeadSpin\u2019s investors tried and failed to assert influence. Mr. Faris and\nNikesh Arora, HeadSpin\u2019s chairman, each provided a list of candidates for\nchief financial officer to hire, they said in declarations. Iconiq pushed Mr.\nLachwani to add more controls, according to claims made in a presentation\nincluded in a court filing.\n\nMr. Lachwani resisted Iconiq\u2019s demands, resulting in \u201ca rift between them\u201d\nthat led the founder to want to return Iconiq\u2019s investment, the presentation\nsaid. Mr. Lachwani never hired a chief financial officer.\n\nIconiq and Mr. Arora didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHeadSpin\u2019s accountant, Sana Okmyanskaya, said in a declaration that Mr.\nLachwani had directed her to add income from new contracts to the company\u2019s\nbooks. When she asked to see the contracts, he ignored her.\n\n\u201cHe seemed very busy and seemed often to work late into the night,\u201d she said\nin the declaration.\n\nMr. Lachwani sometimes sent Ms. Okmyanskaya invoices that he had altered to\ninclude money that was never invoiced, his lawyers said in a filing. Ms.\nOkmyanskaya, who did not respond to a request for comment, said in her\ndeclaration that he had also lied to her about the details of contracts to\nexplain inconsistencies.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Lachwani cashed out $2.5 million of his own shares in HeadSpin,\nselling them to an investor.\n\nInvestors poured more money into HeadSpin in 2020, valuing it at $1.1 billion.\nBy then, Stefanos Loukakos, a tech executive, had joined the company as a\nsenior vice president and discovered Mr. Lachwani\u2019s pattern of\nmisrepresentations.\n\nThat March, Mr. Loukakos shared his concerns with Mr. Arora in a 16-slide\npresentation, which was later filed in court. Mr. Lachwani had claimed\nHeadSpin had more than 20,000 devices on its network, for example, but Mr.\nLoukakos had found that the real number was closer to 2,000. When Mr. Loukakos\nasked an engineer about the discrepancy on Slack, the engineer responded, \u201clol\nask manish.\u201d\n\nMr. Loukakos\u2019s presentation also included text messages that showed Mr.\nLachwani cursing at employees and firing them abruptly, including one worker\nwho was in the middle of a video call with a client.\n\nHeadSpin\u2019s board launched an investigation. Mr. Lachwani stepped down in May\n2020 and agreed to return $1.9 million of the $2.5 million that he had cashed\nout. The company restructured its finances and returned money to investors\nthat wanted out.\n\nHeadSpin continues to operate. In March, it announced new funding of an\nundisclosed amount from Atlassian Ventures. An outside accountant placed the\ncompany\u2019s valuation at $302 million, more than 70 percent below its 2020\nvaluation.\n\nAhead of his sentencing next month, Mr. Lachwani\u2019s lawyers made the case for a\nlesser sentence. Despite Mr. Lachwani\u2019s misrepresentations, they said, none of\nHeadSpin\u2019s investors actually lost money.\n\n\u201cMr. Lachwani did not need to say false or misleading things in order to\ncreate a successful company,\u201d his lawyers wrote, \u201cbut he did.\u201d\n\nErin Griffith covers tech companies, start-ups and the culture of Silicon\nValley from San Francisco.
