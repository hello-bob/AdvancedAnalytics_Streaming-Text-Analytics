It's an opportunity to connect with potential customers and\nshowcase AWS's newest technologies, similar to its annual re:Invent cloud\nconference.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThe AWS marketing team has told employees they can re-purpose generative AI-\nrelated content found in last year's re:Invent conference to reach the 80%\nquota, the memo said.\n\n\"To better enable our customers to learn how we think about and approach Gen\nAI, marketing leadership is prioritizing the inclusion of Gen AI sessions and\ncustomer use cases at 2024 Global Summits,\" said the memo. \"Up to 80% of all\nGlobal Summit sessions will be sourced from 2023 re:Invent sessions tagged to\nGen AI.\"\n\nThe new directive shows how Amazon is going to extraordinary lengths to\npromote its AI prowess, at a time when interest in generative AI is\nskyrocketing. Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are considered to be ahead with\nmore popular AI products, while Amazon has been internally scrambling to\naddress any perception of falling behind.\n\nIn an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Patrick Neighorn confirmed the new\nguidance, adding that the change is largely driven by customer demand.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"AWS Summits are incredibly popular interactive learning conferences where we\noffer customers their choice of sessions on the topics they care most about,\nand today that's generative AI,\" he wrote. \"With the number of participants in\nAI sessions more than doubling at re:Invent, we've worked hard to ensure all\nour attendees have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with our\ngenerative AI offerings, like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, and Amazon SageMaker,\nin addition to hundreds of other AWS services.\"\n\n## 'Multi-billion dollar' business\n\nThis is all part of Amazon's recent effort to double down on AI. Earlier this\nweek, Amazon made its Q chatbot assistant broadly available.\n\nThe company also offers Bedrock, which gives developers access to multiple AI\nmodels. Amazon developed homegrown AI chips, too, called Trainium and\nInferentia, that compete with Nvidia's GPUs. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy previously\nsaid \"every single one\" of the company's teams is working on some kind of AI\nproject.\n\nSome of this is starting to pay off. On Tuesday, Jassy said Amazon is on pace\nto generate \"multi-billion\" dollars in revenue this year from its generative\nAI offerings. In Amazon's annual shareholder letter this year, Jassy said\ngenerative AI may be \"the largest technology transformation since the cloud\n(which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nGenerative AI has already been accounting for a larger share of Amazon's\npublic comments. Last year's AWS re:Invent conference was also mostly centered\naround AI. At the event, Amazon unveiled a number of new AI products,\nincluding the Amazon Q assistant and an updated AI training chip.\n\nIt's not just Amazon who's doing this. All of the major tech companies,\nincluding Microsoft, Google, and Meta, have upped the portion of their AI talk\nin public events. Among the 9,000 largest companies tracked by market research\nfirm AlphaSense, artificial intelligence was mentioned in 2,926 of their\ncorporate events, such earnings calls and industry conferences, in the first\nquarter of this year. Five years ago, only 952 events mentioned AI, AlphaSense\ndata shows.\n\nFor some Amazon employees, the heavy talk around AI has become a frustration,\nleading to what they call \"AI fatigue,\" as BI previously reported.\n\n\"All of the conversations from our leadership are around GenAI, all of the\nconferences are about GenAI, all of the trainings are about GenAI...it's too\nmuch,\" an AWS employee wrote in an internal Slack channel last year.\n\nThat trend is likely to continue. At future AWS events, employees will have a\nhard time convincing leadership to feature non-AI sessions, the internal memo\nsaid.\n\n\"Please keep this strategy in mind when submitting your session topic or\ncustomer speaker,\" the memo added. \"Remaining agenda slots will be extremely\nlimited.\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon?
