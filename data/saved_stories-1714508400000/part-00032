Valkey has developed the most industry interest as an open-\nsource alternative to Redis moving forward. Valkey was started by the Linux\nFoundation with backing from Amazon/AWS, Google, Oracle, and other large\norganizations.\n\nTwo weeks ago marked the first stable Valkey release and the project has\nattracted the biggest following so far since the Redis re-licensing.\n\nThere's a Fedora proposal started by Jonathan Wright with AlmaLinux to replace\nRedis with Valkey:\n\n> \"We will replace Redis with Valkey due to the recent licensing changes in\n> Redis, which have rendered it incompatible with Free and Open Source\n> Software (FOSS) principles. This shift in Redis's licensing can impact\n> Fedora's commitment to FOSS, potentially limiting users' freedom to modify\n> and redistribute the software under the same terms. Valkey, a fork of Redis,\n> emerges as a viable alternative because it retains a FOSS-compatible license\n> and has robust community and developmental support. Adopting Valkey allows\n> us to continue offering users a powerful in-memory data structure store\n> without compromising on licensing restrictions.\"\n\nThe plan for Fedora 41 would be to replace Redis with Valkey and those having\nRedis currently installed would see it switched over to Valkey in a\ntransparent manner using the \"valkey-compat\" compatibility package.\n\nThe Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee is evaluating the change but\ndiverted it for two weeks to allow time for that Valkey compatibility\npackaging work to be completed.\n\n2 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nFedora Miracle Spin Proposed For Fedora 41\n\nFedora Linux 40 Available For Download As A Wonderful Upgrade\n\nFedora Linux 40 Cleared For Release Next Week\n\nRPM 4.20 Approved For Fedora 41 To Advance Hands-Free Packaging\n\nFedora 41 Aims For More Reproducible Package Builds Thanks To A Rust Program\n\nFedora 41 Looks To \"-O3\" Optimizations For Its Python Build\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
