Additionally,\nthe FTC\u2019s authority to enact this rule, rather than Congress, is questionable.\n\nNevertheless, I don\u2019t think banning non-competes is without merit. The reason\nis not the standard Twitter-econ view that non-competes are bad for workers.\nIndeed, some non-competes, so-called \u201cgardening leave\u201d, pay the worker during\nthe non-compete period. Sounds pretty good! More generally, non-competes are\njust one item in the wage bargain like hours, health and pension benefits. As\na result, the FTC is quite wrong to think that banning non-competes will raise\nwages\u2013the most immediate effect will be to reduce wages. Indeed, more workers\nwill be willing to work at lower wages precisely to the extent that non-\ncompetes were a burden. Can\u2019t have it both ways. Instead of being bad for\nworkers, my skepticism about non-competes is that they are bad for industry.\n\nThe problem with non-competes is that every firm wants non-competes on the\nworkers it fires but no firm wants non-competes on the workers it hires.\nHowever, firms only control the terms on which they hire workers so it\u2019s\npossible for each firm acting in its self-interest to create a situation which\nis in the interests of none. Or, to put it differently, firms may approve of\nthe decision to ban non-competes because it\u2019s a package deal, firms can\u2019t\nrestrict their own former employees but they gain the ability to recruit\nfreely from competitors.\n\nMore generally, worker mobility often carries externalities. As I wrote\nearlier, ideas are in heads and if you don\u2019t move the heads, often the ideas\ndon\u2019t move either. The innovation that results from mobility is a public good.\nNon-competes are a type of intellectual property, call it intellect property.\nOnce again, firms want to lock up their intellectual property but they also\nwant to use ideas from other firms. Firms only control the former decision not\nthe latter so IP in general has a prisoner\u2019s dilemma issue which is one reason\nIP in the US is too strong (see the Tabarrok Curve) and non-competes are part\nof that package. Ultimately, if the innovation effects are important, wages\ncould rise but those effects would be for more or less all workers not\nspecifically for those with non-competes.\n\nGovernments aren\u2019t good at the fine details of optimizing IP so perhaps a\nheavy-handed approach is the best we can expect. Non-competes also aren\u2019t a\nhuge issue for most firms, even firms that use them, so given the above I am\nwilling to give the experiment a try.\n\n  * 33 Comments\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * print\n\n## Comments\n\n### abitoftruth\n\n2024-04-25 07:43:12\n\n35| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nIf the companies were all reasonable (for example always paying for the time\nperiod that was covering the non compete) there would have been no action\ntaken.\n\nI got an internship through my college when I was 20 and had to sign a non-\ncompete with the company. When I graduated there was a recession and the\ncompany had no positions available for me to apply to.\n\nThe next company (same industry, different products) required me to obtain a\nwaiver from the first company. They at first refused to give me one and\nclaimed it was FOREVER (this was before constraints from lawsuits). I went to\nmy college explaining that their partner companies were preventing me from\ngaining employment with the degree they had bestowed in an entire industry my\ninternship was for, FOREVER.\n\nWhile the company did end up writing a release due to the pressure from the\ncollege (except for the type of products I worked on and with a 2 year time\nlimit) it was ridiculous in the first place that my job prospects were\nliterally put at risk, the significant time I had to spend and the stress of\nnot knowing the outcome.\n\nI for one am glad to see it die the death it deserves.\n\nRespond\n\n### asdf\n\n2024-04-25 09:27:41\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nMy experience has been that employers try to force a non-compete on you after\nyou've been hired.

Employers won't\nlike the ban because, from a property rights perspective, workers now own the\nright and employers now must pay for it.

My first job was with a bank that put people through a training\nprogram that had a fixed cost, and if the employee left before a certain time\nperiod they were responsible for paying back a portion of that cost. Note this\ndidn't apply if it was a layoff.\n\nOverall that seems like a better system to me than post-employment non-\ncompetes so maybe we will see more of it now?

If the employer is\nso convinced that your residual knowledge must remain on the sidelines, then\nthe former employer pay the employee NOT work for anyone else until they (the\nformer employer) have deemed the former employer's knowledge stale.\n\nRespond\n\n### OldCurmudgeon\n\n2024-04-25 09:40:30\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nEven there, it probably should be limited in time.

The trouble is that you\ndon't know in advance if it is reasonable so at least banning them is a bright\nline.\n\nRespond\n\n### dan1111\n\n2024-04-25 07:41:28\n\n6| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nYour point about non-competes being part of worker's wage bargaining makes\nsense, but there are countervailing reasons why banning them could raise\nwages:\n\n1) This ruling frees a large number of workers who are currently locked in\nplace to hit the competitive job market. That seems likely to at least lead to\na short term boost in wages: new opportunities to move to a higher salary,\nplus more incentives to pay top workers to stay where they are.\n\n2) Workers' value doesn't remain static over time. Suppose a company hires 10\nworkers early in their careers. They are all locked in place with non-\ncompetes. One of those workers becomes a rock star, generating millions for\nthe company. The non-compete clause prevents that worker from fully\nrenegotiating their pay to reflect their new value, so eliminating the clauses\ncould raise the pay of these ten workers on average, even if they all started\nat a somewhat lower salary in the absence of the clauses.\n\n3) It's not a zero sum game. If non-competes are a net negative on innovation,\nas argued here, then eliminating them should spur new economic activity, and\nworkers should capture some of the value of that (the FTC--credit where it's\ndue, stopped clocks are occasionally right, etc., etc.,--seems to be making\nthat argument in its announcement).\n\nRespond\n\n### steve\n\n2024-04-25 09:03:27\n\n1| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nAlex and Tyler both seem to be claiming that non-competes increase wages as\ndogma based upon some rigid thinking. In some cases it might be true but there\nare obvious cases where it is not. If in a given area everyone has noncompetes\nif you want/need to work in that area you have to sign a non compete and you\naccept it as cost of working at that place, not that you are being paid extra.\nIt wont increase pay. What it will do is keep you from moving to another job\nin that area where you earn more money. It's also pretty obvious, I know\nseveral examples, where employers were pretty abusive of staff knowing they\ncouldn't leave and get another job without moving and that moving would\ninflict major costs.\n\nI would expect that if eliminated employers would instead sometimes have to\npay people more to keep them from leaving. Your number 2 above is an obvious\nexample but even if you have two competitors in an area and one is performing\nmuch better it wouldn't be unusual to offer more pay as a way to try to lure\npeople away from the less successful competitor. They wont be able to do that\nwith noncompetes.\n\nSo there are probably, surely, some idealized examples where for an individual\ncontract you do have to pay people more in order to get them to sign a\nnoncompete, but as they are commonly used it doesnt increase pay, it only\ndecreases mobility, locking in employees under conditions that may have\nchanged.\n\nSteve\n\nRespond\n\n### Eric chase\n\n2024-04-25 08:31:51\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nI work in radio.

They backed off immediately. Obviously not everyone is in a\nposition to do that. But I don't see any mention here yet about what I thought\nwas a major objection to this, namely that this agency doesn't have the power\nto make such a sweeping decree? It might be a hassle, and might be difficult\nto impossible, to do this legislatively state by state, but is the question of\nthe power of federal agencies to do things like this something we care about\nor not?

Of course it is hard to literally go inside someone\u2019s brain and\nsee what is in what compartment. The confidentiality compartment and the free\nhuman being compartment.\n\nIn California it is widely acknowledged that non competes are not enforceable\nand eve. Though the state is screwed up in many ways it seem to remain\nintellectually innovative without non competes. However when there is\nsubstantial \u201cconsideration \u201c, like millions of dollars when your company is\npurchased then non-competes are appropriate.

Access to trade secrets are the only legitimate justification\nbut non-competes are widely abused and applied to people who have little or no\ngenuinely valuable trade secrets. Most notoriously, some fast food restaurants\nmake their employees sign non-competes and Amazon made its warehouse workers\nsign one several years ago.\n\nMost of the time, it is just a naked abuse of workers who need a job more than\nthe employer needs each one of them individually. Other times, it is HR apathy\nand laziness because the new HR manager is using templates downloaded off the\ninternet or stole the templates (ironically) from a previous employer and\nthese templates had non-compete clauses in them.\n\nAs already mentioned here, the FTC rule does indeed allow an exception when\nthere is substantial consideration -- a $151,164 salary is enough -- and when\nthe job is a \"policy-making position\" so I don't know what your beef is.\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-25 09:14:08\n\n0| 2  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\n\"The FTC doesn\u2019t really know what it is doing\"\n\n+10\n\nIf the net outcome of any given FTC decision under Khan is positive, it's just\ndumb luck.

The rationale\n(or rationalization) for the ethics rule (prohibiting non-competes) is that\nclients choose lawyers, and it would interfere with the attorney-client\nrelationship to impose non-competes on lawyers. It's ironic that it's an\nethical rule. Why? I have seen very successful law firms implode when the\nlawyers stop billing their clients. Why would they do that? Duh. This has\nimportant implications for any professional practice. Doctors don't have such\na rule, and most employment agreements with doctors have broad non-compete\nprovisions (not in California), including both geographic restrictions and\nnon-solicitation (although as I indicated in my other comment, the trend is\nfor courts not to enforce geographic restrictions). Here's a fun fact: the\nconcentration in the medical industry, with hospitals employing doctors (more\nthan 50% of doctors are employed by hospitals) and the development of large\nsingle and multi-specialty group practices, non-competes have become even\nbroader (the geographic market territory of hospitals and large group\npractices is much larger than the small medical practice) and the bargaining\npower of the individual physician has been greatly reduced. In these parts,\nlarge is beautiful (monopolies sublime). That doesn't seem particularly\nlibertarian to me, but what do I know: I live in the real world.\n\nRespond\n\n### Ricardo\n\n2024-04-25 09:55:31\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nThe fact that non-competes apply to doctors but not lawyers is the ultimate\nspecial pleading. Of course people choose their doctors, too.
