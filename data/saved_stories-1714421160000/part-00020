The driver, who\nworks for a car delivery company, was driving a 2019 Tesla Model X when he\nsuddenly fell asleep at the wheel outside Link\u00f6ping, south of the capital\nStockholm.\n\nDespite its name, Tesla's Autopilot system does not make the car autonomous.\nThe driver has to remain alert and pay attention to the road and other road\nusers.\n\nAnother driver, who also owns a Tesla, was approaching the Model X which was\nbeing driven in the overtaking lane without overtaking anyone. The other Tesla\ndriver switched to the right-hand lane and tried to pass the Model X, when he\nnoticed that the driver was asleep.\n\nThe police arrived and attempted multiple times to wake the driver up, but he\ncontinued to sleep while the car \u201ddrove by itself.\u201d At last, the driver woke\nup and the Tesla suddenly turned to the right. The driver of the police car\nhad to swerve and brake in order not to crash.\n\nThe police first attempted to get the driver to turn off at an upcoming exit,\nbut when he continued to speep they had to wait until the next exit. After 25\nmiles, the Tesla finally came to a stop. The map is approximate. Map:\nOpenstreetmap\n\nAfter about 25 miles, the car came to a halt at a gas station.\n\n\u201dWhen we explained to the driver what had happened and what he had done, I\nrealized how dangerous this has been. I was shocked, angry and tired. My\nunderstanding was that he barely understood what had happened,\u201d one of the\npolice officers write in his incident report.\n\nThe man was charged and convicted of reckless driving. He said he hadn't slept\nthe night before and was stressed because he had to deliver the car for work.\nInitially, he claimed to have had one of his eyes open, but later admitted to\nbeing asleep.\n\n\u201dI'm extremely ashamed, it was because of exhaustion. I had a Tesla with\nAutopilot which made me very comfortable,\u201d he said during questioning.\n\nThe Autopilot system should only be used by an attentive driver, according to\nTesla. But in practice, the system can easily be fooled. Photo: \u00a9 Simon\nHamelius\n\nTesla states in the vehicle manual that the Autopilot system should only be\nused when the driver is paying attention to the road. The car also has a\nsteering wheel sensor, but that can easily be fooled. It's enough to apply\nlight pressure to the wheel every now and then, and the sensor can also be\nfooled by certain devices which can be attached to the steering wheel and\nwhich can be ordered online.\n\nExactly how the car could drive for at least 25 miles with a sleeping driver\nbehind the wheel is currently unclear. On the other hand, the outcome could\nhave been a lot worse if the car had a regular cruise control system or only\nadaptive cruise control without steering assistance.\n\nSome of our other articles in English:\n\n  * Physical buttons outperform touchscreens in new cars, test finds\n  * Tesla\u2019s high-beam assist feature surprised by Swedish moose\n  * Chinese EV is sending \u201clog data\u201d to Tencent-owned server\n\nWelcome to Vi Bil\u00e4gare\n\n  * Vi Bil\u00e4gare is Sweden's biggest car magazine, launched in 1930.\n  * We review new and used cars and are also performing world-exclusive tests of headlights and rust proofing.\n  * Vi Bil\u00e4gare also offers readers unique insights into car ownership with our long-term tests, where we each year purchase five new cars.\n  * We are completely independent and not associated with any carmaker.\n\n### \u00c4mnen i artikeln\n\n  * English\n  * Tesla\n  * Sj\u00e4lvk\u00f6rande bilar\n  * Trafiks\u00e4kerhet\n\nGenom att anm\u00e4la dig godk\u00e4nner du OK-f\u00f6rlagets personuppgiftspolicy.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
