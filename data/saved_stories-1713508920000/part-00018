To\nreceive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid\nsubscriber.\n\n#\n\nThe Essence and Formation of Crowds\n\nThere are certain characteristics by which we can analyze a crowd. They tell\nus a lot about the dynamics of a crowd and helps us to look at it as a life\nform in itself.\n\nThe interplay of different characteristics of a crowd can inform us about the\npossible futures it might have. As we go ahead we will try to simulate\nexisting postulates provided by Canetti in Crowds and Power.\n\nI also use the terms attributes and characteristics interchangeably here.\n\nIn this section we are going to look at the Essence and Formation of Crowds.\nThe book doesn\u2019t provide distinct subsections for these so I have taken the\nliberty to restructure some of these ideas for ease of consumption.\n\nAttributes of a Crowd and their Interplay effects\n\nAs we start moving beyond the individual, we start worrying about the dynamics\nof individuals which convey the attributes of these crowds.\n\nThe attributes of a crowd help us understand it\u2019s formation as a whole and\nwhat factors directly contribute to their creation, expansion and death.\n\nThe first attribute we will be discussing is the Openness of a crowd. Without\nopenness a crowd cannot come into existence. In it\u2019s lifetime a crowd has to\nbe open at some point for it to go from a bunch of people with a crazy idea\ninto a crowd or a community of individuals. We will discuss this attribute in\ndepth in Open and Closed Crowds.\n\n##\n\nOpen and Closed Crowds (Openness)\n\n> ... The natural crowd is the Open Crowd.\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power\n\nCrowds have a natural urge to grow. The growth or life of a crowd are both\ndependent on it\u2019s Openness. When a crowd forms for the first time, it\u2019s first\ninstinct is to grow even more before it moves on to the next stage in it\u2019s\nlife.\n\nGrowth is important for crowds to be successful but not always useful in the\ncrowd\u2019s lifetime. As a crowd\u2019s success is not all that dependent on it\u2019s\ngrowth but what is the crowd\u2019s original purpose and how the crowd progresses\nin it\u2019s life to achieve that purpose. The life of a crowd depends on it\u2019s\npurpose and growth becomes an important factor to achieve the crowd\u2019s goals,\nbut it\u2019s not the only thing that matters.\n\nNeedless growth can cause anomalies leading the crowds to fail. A loss of\npurpose. A failure for a crowd is failing to achieve what the crowd set out to\ndo.\n\nBut maybe it\u2019s about all the friends we made along the way. Just maybe.\n\nCrowds start with being open and then in the name of permanence embrace\nbarriers reducing openness. We shall discuss this after we understand how Open\nCrowds work.\n\n###\n\nOpen Crowds\n\n##### Understanding Openness and it\u2019s effects\n\n> ... the urge to grow is the first and supreme attribute of the crowd...\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power\n\nOpenness of a crowd is arguably the most important mechanical attribute of a\ncrowd. Without it, a crowd cannot exist. An Open Crowd is also arguably the\nmost impactful state of a crowd.\n\n##### Degree of Openness\n\nA crowd may go through transitional open or closed states based on the degree\nof it\u2019s openness. Below, we look at how a very open crowd might look like. It\ngrows quickly and keeps growing. The simulation restarts when the Max People\nallowed in the Circle threshold is reached.\n\n####\n\nSketch 2.1: High Degree Openness of a Crowd\n\n> In Canetti's framework, the openness of a crowd refers to its expansive,\n> unbounded nature, where the crowd grows and spreads, potentially without\n> limits.\n\n####\n\nSimulating Open Crowds\n\nWe try to simulate open crowds in the p5.js sketch above.\n\n##### Simulating a crowd\u2019s growth\n\nThe interactive simulation shown in the video above (Sketch 2.1: High Degree\nOpenness of a Crowd) adds people to a crowd dynamically based on the crowd\u2019s\nOpenness. The Openness in the above example is 0.7 which means the crowd has a\n70% acceptance rate. Better than most overrated colleges /s.\n\nThe simulation keeps adding stick figures based on the Openness here and\naddition continues till the maximum limit (Max People) is reached, after which\nthe simulation is reset. Max People is the maximum number of people that can\nbe added to this crowd.\n\n##### Movement Towards the Center\n\nEach stick figure moves towards the center of the canvas. This movement can be\nseen as a metaphor for the gravitational pull of the crowd's core, a common\nfeature in Open Crowds where individuals are drawn to the collective action or\nsentiment. In this case ideas can literally move people /j.\n\n###\n\nClosed Crowds\n\n##### Open vs. Closed Crowds\n\nAs an Open Crowd expands and loses sight of it\u2019s purpose, the crowd can\nstagnate and disperse.\n\n##### Transitioning from Open to Closed Crowds\n\nThe openness of a crowd can be restricted so that their long term growth and\npermanence is ensured. A Closed Crowd is one which limits expansion for the\nsake of permanence making the size of the crowd sometimes smaller initially or\nhave a stagnant growth in some part of it\u2019s life to ensure quality over\nquantity.\n\n##### Simulating Closed Crowds\n\nIn the below sketch we can see that the Openness of the crowd is very low\ncompared to the setting in the sketch above. Here it is 1% compared to the 70%\nopenness. Hence, we have made the crowd a lot more closed.\n\n####\n\nSketch 2.2: Low Openness / High Closeness of a Crowd\n\n####\n\nSimulating Slow growth of Closed Crowds\n\nClosed Crowds take a lot more to form due to it\u2019s reduced openness. That\nsounds redundant, yes. So was elementary abstract algebra /s/j in college.\nDon\u2019t @ me.\n\nThese crowds usually prioritize permanence over size. This takes them some\ntime to build. The time to build also adds to the lifetime of the crowd.\nMaking these crowds stay alive for longer as they slowly build themselves out.\n\nCloseness might not always be great and prolonged lack of openness might lead\nto stagnation of a crowd leading to dispersion.\n\n##\n\nDirection, Density and Equality\n\nDirection, Density and Equality are related to the movement of individuals in\nthe crowd. The direction of a crowd is dictated by the general direction of\nthe people in it. If a dense group of individuals are moving roughly in the\nsame direction or cross paths in some way or the other and are made to feel\nequal, we can call the small constellation of individuals as a crowd.\n\nMoving away from boring stick figures, we move into cool particles where each\nparticle represents an individual. In the sketch below we explore how these\nthree attributes contribute to formation of a crowd.\n\n####\n\nSketch 3: Direction, Density and Equality\n\nIn the above sketch, the particles start of with all different colors. Once\ncan see this simulation as how different individuals when the cross paths, or\nare going in the same direction with enough people can become part of the same\ncrowd. When individuals are part of the same crowd they are all equal.\n\n> This is absolute and indisputable and never questioned by the crowd itself.\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti on Equality in Crowds and Power\n\n####\n\nSimulating attributes of Direction, Density and Equality\n\n##### Direction and Equality\n\n> The direction, which is common to all it\u2019s members, strenthens the feeling\n> of equality...\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti on Direction in Crowds and Power\n\nIf two or more individuals cross paths are in the same vicinity, they form\nconstellations of sorts which can be called a crowd. Individuals who are part\nof a constellation but not have the same grey colors as the rest of the\nindividuals from the crowd can be considered as outcasts or anomalies in the\ncrowd.\n\n##### Density and Equality\n\n> It can never feel too dense. Nothing must stand between it\u2019s parts or divide\n> them...\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti on Density in Crowds and Power\n\nAs more people are added to the crowd using the slider in the simulation, we\ncan see that the crowd becomes more coherent with increased density. Density\nof a crowd directly makes people feel closer and makes them equals.\n\nDirection, Density and Equality work in tandem with each other to maintain a\nhealthy crowd. Reversals in any of these can push a crowd to it\u2019s dispersion.\n\n##\n\nRhythm of a Crowd\n\n> ...The crowd develops a rhythm, a pulse that, for Canetti, comes off like\n> some ancient dance, with pounding feet and chanting voices.^1\n>\n> ~ Seth Lerer on Crowds and Power\n\n####\n\nSketch 4: Two crowds moving in different rhythms\n\n##### The two crowds in question\n\nTwo crowds, each represented by a collection of particles of a distinct color,\nmove and interact according to a set rhythm in the above sketch. The two\ncrowds here are the 1. greenish yellow and the 2. violet crowds.\n\n####\n\nSimulating rhythm it\u2019s interplay with other attributes of a crowd\n\n##### Rhythm, Direction and Density\n\nWhen the two crowds above move in different rhythms we can see that they form\nand lose the same connections over and over again. The density of these\ndynamic groups also increase and decrease over time in the same way as we hang\nout with different groups at different times only to keep crossing paths\nbecause we live in the same society. The world is small and we all have\nnetwork effects on one another as long as we choose to be part of the network.\n\n##### Rhythm as an identity\n\nThe simulation exemplifies the attribute of the rhythm of the crowd by showing\nhow individual particles (representing people) move in a synchronized manner,\ncreating a collective rhythm. Crowds develop a pulse or rhythm, akin to an\nancient dance, which is a fundamental aspect of their identity and unity. Even\nwithout the colors on the crowd we should be able to distinguish which are the\ntwo different crowds based on the rhythms.\n\nThe simulation allows users to see how the rhythm of a crowd can emerge from\nthe individual movements of its members and how different crowds can interact\nand unify, reflecting Canetti's ideas on the rhythmic and unifying nature of\ncrowds.\n\n##\n\nInterplay Effects\n\nCurrently we are looking at two interplay effects of a crowd\u2019s attributes.\nFirst is slowness and the other is stagnation. It is important to understand\nhow crowds can reach these two stages in their life based on how different\nattributes of a crowd work together.\n\n###\n\nCauses of Slowness in a Crowd\n\n##### Slowness due to increased density\n\n> ...The feeling of relief is most striking where the density of the crowd is\n> greatest...\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti on Density in Crowds and Power\n\nAs a crowd becomes denser, the physical space each individual can occupy\nbecomes limited, thereby reducing their ability to move quickly. This high\ndensity creates a compact mass where movement is inherently slowed down as\nindividuals move in unison rather than independently. We can see in Sketch 3:\nDirection, Density and Equality that increasing the number of particles on the\nscreen causes slowness in the crowd. This is not because of there being too\nmany objects in p5.js to process but as a natural phenomena for a large\ncollection of anything to work together well, the internal processes which\nkeep systems alive need to slow down before they can get accustomed to the\nstructural changes and increase their speeds of their internal processes\nagain.\n\n##### Slowness due to a crowd\u2019s emotional state\n\n> Another attribute leading to slowness is the crowd's emotional state. Crowds\n> can enter a state of stagnation, where they are not actively moving towards\n> a goal but are instead absorbed in the experience of being part of the\n> crowd.\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power\n\nCrowds can enter a state of stagnation, where they are not actively moving\ntowards a goal but are instead absorbed in the experience of being part of the\ncrowd. This emotional engagement can lead to a deliberate slowing down as the\ncrowd savors the feeling of unity and closeness without well thought out\nmovement towards a goal. In this case it makes sense to reduce the Openness of\nthe crowd and re-focus on the purpose. This can help one take inventory of the\ncurrent state of the crowd before needlessly growing without a purpose.\n\n##### Slowness due to direction\n\n> The crowd needs a direction. It is in movement and it moves towards a goal.\n>\n> ~ Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power\n\nThe direction or lack thereof can also cause slowness in a crowd. Crowds often\nneed a clear goal or stimulus to propel them forward. In the absence of a\nstrong directive or when the goal is not immediately achievable, the crowd's\nmovement can become aimless and slow, as there is no urgent motivation to move\nswiftly.\n\n#\n\nReferences\n\n  1. https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/essays/patience-hand-elias-canettis-crowds-power-current-crisis/\n\nIn the upcoming release in this series of Nature and Dynamics of a Crowd, we\nwill look at another interplay effect i.e. stagnation, some other essential\ncharacteristics of a crowd which define it\u2019s nature.\n\nof Constructions and Abstractions is a reader-supported publication.
