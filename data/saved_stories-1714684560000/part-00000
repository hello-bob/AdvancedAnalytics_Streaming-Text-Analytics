Tyson is one of the nation's largest meat and\npoultry producers\u2014and the world's second largest\u2014operating 123 US processing\nplants with more than 124,000 employees (The National Provisioner 2023;\nNewsweek n.d.; Stillerman 2022; Shahbandeh 2023). In 2023, it boasted $52.88\nbillion in revenue, a total that earned this publicly traded consolidated\nmegacorporation the number 80 spot in the Fortune 500 list of the highest\nrevenue-generating companies in the United States and provided lavish\ncompensation for its executives (Macrotrends n.d.; Boehm 2021; 50Pros 2024;\nSouza 2022). However, that prosperity comes at a high price\u2014especially for\ncommunities burdened by water pollution from Tyson processing plants.\n\nMeat Processing and Water Pollution\n\n## Meat Processing and Water Pollution\n\nThe agricultural industry is the largest consumer of freshwater worldwide, and\nmeat and poultry processors such as Tyson Foods account for nearly one-third\nof that freshwater consumption. Animal processing plants can generate millions\nof gallons of wastewater every day by engaging in activities such as washing\nanimals, cleaning meat and animal products, sanitizing equipment, and\nscrubbing work areas within the facility (Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations 2017; Gerbens-Leenes, Mekonnen, and Hoekstra 2013; Burkhart\net al. 2018). Wastewater discharged from meat processing plants is a complex\nmixture, often including the following:\n\n  * Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can deplete the oxygen in waterways and harm marine life (Burkhart et al. 2018)\n  * Animal body parts and byproducts, such as blood and feces\n  * Pathogens and microorganisms, including E. coli and Enterococcus (Environment America 2020)\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Tyson processed billions of animals, generating\nenormous quantities of wastewater\u2014according to the US Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), over 87 billion gallons (Tyson Foods n.d.; US EPA n.d.). That is\nenough to fill more than 177,000 Olympic swimming pools (City of Corvallis,\nOregon n.d.). In a single year, 2022, Tyson discharged over 18.5 billion\ngallons of wastewater. This wastewater contains millions of pounds of toxic\npollutants that damage the environment and threaten the health of plants,\nanimals, and people (Burkhart et al. 2018).\n\nTo investigate the extent of Tyson's water pollutant load, we used publicly\navailable data from the EPA to estimate the quantity and geospatial\ndistribution of Tyson's water discharges from 2018 to 2022. This investigation\nincluded Tyson facilities that piped wastewater directly into waterways,\nthreatening surface and groundwater quality (Burkhart et al. 2018). Our\nanalysis found that over five years, Tyson's meat processing plants dumped\n371.72 million pounds of pollutants into waterways across the United States,\nwith over half of the pollutant load concentrated in just three states:\nNebraska, Illinois, and Missouri.\n\nBecause discharges directly from meat processing plants are only a fraction of\nthe meat processing industry's overall water pollution, our analysis is likely\na drastic underestimation of Tyson's true environmental impact. Large\nindustrial meat processers such as Tyson Foods procure slaughter animals from\nconcentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which are sources of\nsignificant air, water, soil, noise, and odor pollution that harm the\nenvironment and threaten human health (Son, Miranda, and Bell 2021). The feed\nfor these slaughter animals is cultivated using harmful industrial agriculture\npractices\u2014such as the overapplication of synthetic nitrogen, phosphorus, and\nmanure fertilizer\u2014which can run off into waterways, resulting in serious\nenvironmental and human health issues and detrimental impacts to the economy.\n\nPrevious research by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) concluded that\nnitrogen fertilizer runoff from the Midwest causes up to $2.4 billion per year\nin damages to fisheries and marine habitats in the Gulf of Mexico (Boehm\n2020). Earlier research estimated a 10- to 15-fold increase in reactive\nnitrogen in US rivers over the past century (Sobota et al. 2015). Further, the\nEPA has highlighted states where groundwater sources exceed the maximum\ncontaminant level for nitrates, which are formed when excess fertilizers\ndecompose, threatening drinking water safety (US EPA 2023a; Schechinger and\nCox 2018).\n\nThis pollution creates additional burdens on traditionally marginalized\ncommunities living in close proximity to these facilities. In 2021, the EPA\nconducted an environmental justice screening of the meat and poultry product\nindustry and found that almost 75 percent of these water-polluting facilities\nare located within one mile of communities that are disproportionately\nimpacted by economic, health, and/or environmental burdens (US EPA 2021). The\nenvironmental injustices of the meat and poultry industry have been well\ndocumented, including through personal stories of community members harmed by\nthis polluting industry (Chamanara, Goldstein, and Newell 2021; Nicole 2013;\nStruthers Montford and Wotherspoon 2021; Andiman, Rutinel, and Saifuddin 2023;\nBurkhart et al. 2018).\n\nThe EPA estimates that only about 300 of the 7,000 meat, beef, and poultry\nprocessing businesses in the United States have mandatory monitoring reporting\nrequirements and regulatory limits for pollution (US EPA 2021). To help\naddress the loopholes that allow Tyson and other meat processing plants to\npollute waterways and threaten the environment and health, we identify policy\nrecommendations that can help reduce the harms from the meat and poultry\nprocessing industry and foster a more sustainable and resilient food and farm\nsystem.\n\nTyson's Prolific Pollution\n\n## Tyson's Prolific Pollution\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, 41 Tyson-owned meat processing plants released more\nthan 371.72 million pounds of pollutants directly into US waterways, including\n138.07 million pounds of chlorides, 82.51 million pounds of dissolved solids,\nand 40.26 million pounds of sulfates (Table 1; see appendix for methodology).\nAlthough trace amounts of chlorides, solids, and sulfates are naturally\npresent in surface waters, excessive concentrations can be detrimental to\nwater quality and can contaminate drinking water. Too much chloride can harm\nplants and animals, and can affect water infrastructure such as pipes, because\nit increases water's corrosivity (Missouri Department of Natural Resources\nn.d.; Hong et al. 2023; Water Resources Mission Area 2019a). Overabundant\nsulfates in drinking water can cause gastrointestinal problems in humans, and\nexcessive dissolved solids in drinking water may contain heavy metals or other\ntoxic substances (Minnesota Department of Health 2022; Wang 2021).\n\n## Table 1\n\nTyson meat processing plants discharged millions of pounds of pollutants into\nwater from 2018 to 2022 (totals rounded to two decimal places).\n\n* We report pollutant category \"Chlorides and sulfates\" separately from categories \"Chloride\" and \"Sulfate\" to reflect differences in reporting structures for different facilities. This does not reflect duplicate data (EPA, personal communication to the author, January 11, 2024).\n\nSOURCE: US EPA 2023c.\n\nWhere Tyson Pollutes\n\n## Where Tyson Pollutes\n\nTyson processing plants discharged millions of pounds of pollutants into\nwaterways from facilities in 17 states between 2018 and 2022 (Table 2). Almost\na third of this load\u2014111.22 million pounds of pollutants\u2014was discharged into\nrivers, lakes, ponds, and other water bodies in Nebraska.\n\n## Table 2\n\nTyson's meat processing plants discharged pollutants into waterways in 17\nstates from 2018 to 2022 (totals rounded to two decimal places).\n\nSOURCE: US EPA 2023c.\n\nThe largest single source of Tyson's water discharges in Nebraska during the\nstudy period was the Dakota City Tyson Fresh Meats facility, one of the\nnation's largest processing plants. It made headlines in April 2020 for a\ndeadly and widespread COVID-19 outbreak that sickened 15 percent of its\nworkforce (Dreeszen 2020). This single plant dumped over 60 million pounds of\npollutants into Nebraska waterways during the study period (Figure 1).\nIndividual high-volume emitting plants also propelled Tyson's discharge totals\nin Illinois (the Tyson Fresh Meats facility in Joslin), Michigan (the\nHillshire facility in Zeeland), and Pennsylvania (the Tyson Foods New Holland\nComplex). Combined, these four plants released 195 million pounds of\npollutants into community waters where over 13,000^1 people live.\n\n## Figure 1\n\nThe map shows Tyson meat processing plants by relative pollutant discharges\ninto waterways, 2018-2022.\n\nNote: An interactive version is available at http://bit.ly/tysonmaps.\n\nSOURCE: US EPA 2023c.\n\nTyson Pollutes; Life Suffers\n\n## Tyson Pollutes; Life Suffers\n\nThe meat and poultry industry is a primary industrial contributor of nitrogen\nand phosphorus water pollution, and Tyson processing plants are no exception\n(US EPA 2021). Between 2018 and 2022, Tyson plants discharged 34.25 million\npounds of nitrogen and 5.06 million pounds of phosphorus into US waterways\n(Table 1). While nitrogen and phosphorous are naturally occurring nutrients,\nwater bodies that contain excesses of these chemicals can be harmful to plant\nand animal life.\n\nThe process by which a water body becomes overburdened with these nutrients is\ncalled eutrophication (Water Resources Mission Area 2019b). In eutrophic\nwaters, excess nitrogen and phosphorus feed algal blooms that cover the water\nbody in a colored film, clogging water infrastructure and blocking sunlight to\nthe water habitat below. When the algae die and decompose, bacteria\nproliferate, depleting the oxygen in the water and releasing carbon dioxide\n(National Ocean Service 2024). As a result, fish and other aquatic life\nsuffocate and die in these dead zones, where life struggles to survive (US EPA\n2013a).\n\nTyson discharged large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other pollutants\ninto waterways in the Midwest, an area of the country that is already\nsaturated with nitrogen and phosphorus from excessive fertilizer use,\nprimarily from large industrial monoculture corn and soy farms (Calderon\n2021). The nutrient pollution from Tyson's processing plants in the Midwest\ncan travel along river-to-river pathways and ultimately deposit into the Gulf\nof Mexico (Figure 1). This contributes to the Gulf's massive and persistent\ndead zone. In 2023, scientists estimated the Gulf of Mexico's dead zone\nstretched over 3,058 square miles (National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science\n2023).\n\nNitrogen and phosphorus pollution poses direct threats to human health as\nwell. Harmful algal blooms that result from nutrient overload are linked to\nincreases in respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma\namong people living close to affected waters (Kirkpatrick et al. 2006). The\nnutrients themselves can also cause human health problems. For example,\nnitrate is a chemical form of nitrogen that is toxic at high levels, and Tyson\nprocessing plants released 4.55 million pounds of nitrate nitrogen into US\nwaters between 2018 and 2022 (Table 3).\n\nNitrate contamination of US drinking water is a serious environmental and\npublic health issue, especially for people who rely on private well water and\nthose who live in agricultural areas (Weir Schechinger 2020). Nitrate can\nleach from surface to groundwater, contaminating the aquifers people rely on\nfor drinking water (Abascal et al. 2022). Drinking water contaminated with\nnitrate has been linked to health outcomes such as the blood disorder\nmethemoglobinemia and neural tube abnormalities in infants, and colorectal\ncancer and thyroid disease in adults (Ward et al. 2018).\n\nWhile the EPA sets an enforceable maximum contaminant level (MCL) for nitrate\nin drinking water (10 milligrams/liter), research has found that low-level\nchronic exposure to nitrate below the MCL is associated with an increased risk\nof cancer (Temkin et al. 2019). In Iowa, recent research has estimated that\nexposure to nitrate in drinking water causes up to 300 cases of cancer each\nyear (Union of Concerned Scientists 2021). In Nebraska, where Tyson plants\nreleased 4.06 million pounds of nitrate into waterways between 2018 and 2022,\nresearch has identified possible associations between high levels of nitrate\nin waterways and elevated incidence of pediatric cancer (Table 3) (Ouattara\nand Rogan 2021).\n\n## Table 3\n\nTyson meat processing plants released millions of pounds of nitrate into\nwaterways in Nebraska and Texas from 2018 to 2022.\n\nNote: We include nitrates in the overall \"nitrogen\" pollutant category in\nother tables in this report.\n\nSOURCE: US EPA 2023c.\n\nTyson's water pollution includes bacteria and other microorganisms that\noverconsume oxygen in waterways. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) indirectly\nmeasures these oxygen-depleting microorganisms in wastewater (Water Science\nSchool 2018; Kiepper 2022). High BODs are associated with elevated quantities\nof microorganisms that consume significant amounts of oxygen, leaving less\noxygen available to support aquatic plant and animal life. From 2018 to 2022,\nTyson's BOD was a staggering 15.24 million pounds (Table 1). With this\nbiological load compounding the oxygen-depleting effects of its nitrogen and\nphosphorous pollution, Tyson is truly sucking the life out of aquatic\nhabitats.\n\nMany of Tyson's water-polluting processing facilities are located close to\nfederally defined critical habitats for endangered or threatened species\n(Figure 2) (US FWS 2017). For example, between 2018 and 2022, the Tyson Fresh\nMeats facility in Lexington, Nebraska, discharged over 22.90 million pounds of\npollutants into waterways less than a mile and a half from a critical habitat\nfor the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana) (Nebraska Game and Parks\nCommission n.d.). Even Tyson facilities that dump pollutants into water bodies\nfurther from critical habitats pose risks, since water can carry pollutants to\nthese habitats through interconnected rivers, streams, and underground water\npathways (Destouni et al. 2010). The proximity of Tyson's polluting plants to\nessential habitats for species conservation adds a further source of stress to\nthose already burdened species.\n\n## Figure 2\n\nThe maps shows the relative proximity of water-polluting Tyson meat processing\nplants to critical habitats, 2018-2022.\n\nNote: An interactive version is available at http://bit.ly/tysonmaps.\n\nSOURCE: US EPA 2023c (Tyson plant locations); US FWS, NOAA, and US EPA 2023\n(critical habitat locations).\n\nGuilty, Fined, but Unimpeded\n\n## Guilty, Fined, but Unimpeded\n\nTyson Foods has come under legal scrutiny on multiple occasions for violating\nthe Clean Water Act (CWA) and water pollution regulations. Violations by\nTyson-owned plants include exceeding effluent limits for waste discharges into\nwaterways in numerous instances, improperly reporting discharges, and\npolluting nearby waters (US SEC n.d.). Over the past decade, Tyson's legacy of\nwater pollution has prompted shareholders to repeatedly urge the corporation\nto establish a water stewardship policy, but these shareholders have been\nvoted down (Investor Advocates for Social Justice 2017; Tyson Foods Inc. 2017;\nTyson Foods Inc. 2018). In the company's most recent sustainability report,\nTyson indicated it was working to address water quality where it operates and\nput forward a goal to \"develop Contextual Water Plans at 11 high-risk U.S.\nlocations by 2025\" (Tyson Foods Inc. 2022). It did not identify those\nlocations or provide details about the plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyson continues to pollute in violation of state and federal laws\ngoverning water quality, even as its offenses result in steep fines. For\nexample, in 2018, the Department of Justice ordered Tyson to pay a $2 million\ncriminal fine plus $500,000 in damages after discharges at Tyson's processing\nfacility in Monett, Missouri, poisoned Clear Creek with ammonia, resulting in\nthe death of approximately 108,000 fish (US Department of Justice 2018). But\nTyson has vast wealth at its disposal, so it can withstand even multimillion-\ndollar pollution penalties. In 2021, Tyson paid $3 million to settle a lawsuit\nover an illegal wastewater discharge that killed 200,000 fish in Alabama's\nBlack Warrior River (Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall 2021). The fine\nrepresented just 0.006 percent of its $47.05 billion in revenue that year\n(Macrotrends n.d.).\n\nIt Gets Worse\n\n## It Gets Worse\n\nThe hundreds of millions of pounds of pollutants that we report here represent\nonly a fraction of Tyson's environmental pollution. We relied on the EPA's\nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) database (see\nappendix) to gather water pollution data for Tyson's meat processing plants.\nSo our findings are limited to only the specific pollutants the CWA mandates\nthat Tyson report. Thus, our analysis likely underestimates the actual water\npollution of Tyson plants because it does not capture pollution from plants\nthat are not required to obtain NPDES permits (e.g., plants that do not exceed\nEPA and state minimum daily discharge limits and plants that discharge\ndirectly to municipal waste treatment systems; US EPA 2014; US EPA 2015). This\nmay explain why our search captured water pollution information for only a\nsmall fraction of the 123 meat processing plants owned by Tyson in the United\nStates (Stillerman 2022).\n\nThis report considers water pollution only from Tyson-owned facilities. It\ndoes not examine water pollution from facilities in Tyson's supply chain that\nare not directly owned by the Tyson corporation. For example, our methods do\nnot capture the water pollution from CAFOs that supply animals for slaughter\nat Tyson facilities (Hall et al. 2021). Furthermore, we limited our\ninvestigation to water pollution, but Tyson's facilities pollute more than\njust water. Tyson also has a history of polluting the air around its\nfacilities and has paid millions in fines for Clean Air Act violations (US EPA\n2013a). Additionally, research has identified the Tyson corporation as a top\nemitter of heat-trapping gases (IATP, GRAIN, and Stiftung 2017). So while the\nwater pollution we identified in this report is egregious, it is only a drop\nin the toxic bucket of Tyson's true environmental impact.\n\nA Path Forward\n\n## A Path Forward\n\nTyson's runaway environmental pollution can be curbed by expanding water\npollution regulations (Shapiro 2022). Fortunately, execution of this approach\nis currently underway (Woods 2024). In response to a successful lawsuit that\nfound current regulations allowed Tyson and other meat and poultry plants to\npollute lakes, rivers, streams, and community water resources, the EPA\nproposed updates to the pollution regulations governing the industry for the\nfirst time in almost two decades (US EPA 2023b; EIP 2023). Proposed regulatory\nchanges include tighter limits on the discharge of nitrogen, phosphorus, and\nother pollutants (such as fecal matter) that Tyson and other meat processing\nplants dump into waterways.\n\nTo ensure that new regulations effectively address the dire need for more\npollution control, the final regulations should reflect the current science,\nincluding available technologies for pollution detection and wastewater\ntreatment methods. The EPA should solicit input from the people who are most\nimpacted by meat producer pollution\u2014including plant workers and community\nmembers who live with Tyson's dirty water\u2014and incorporate their feedback into\nregulatory proposals and updates (Woods 2024; Jett 2021; WVTM 13 Digital\n2021). For example, the EPA could gather feedback by convening meetings in\nplaces such as Delaware, Florida, and Illinois, where slaughterhouse water\npollution has contaminated drinking water wells, killed hundreds of thousands\nof fish, and poisoned lakes, rivers, and streams (Burkhart et al. 2018).\nStronger regulatory standards will allow the EPA to begin revoking Tyson's\nlicense to pollute the environment.\n\nAs a multibillion-dollar company, Tyson can treat even hefty fines and\npenalties for polluting the environment as simply the cost of conducting\nbusiness its way (WVTM 13 Digital 2021). Tyson's deep pockets allow it to pay\nto play by its own rules in other arenas too, including futures markets, child\nlabor, and worker safety (McVan 2021; US Department of Labor 2013; Driver\n2022). As detailed in previous UCS reports\u2014such as Tyson's Need for Feed and\nTyson Spells Trouble for Arkansas\u2014Tyson employs aggressive acquisition and\nconsolidation to build and maintain its near-monopoly status as a\nmegacorporation that can afford to circumvent rules and regulations (DeLonge\nand Stillerman 2022; Boehm 2021).\n\nThe good news is that the federal government has the power to limit the\ninfluence of megacorporations through antitrust regulations that target\nmonopolies. Federal antitrust laws\u2014including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the\nClayton Antitrust Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2014grant the US\nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission the legal authority to\nscrutinize and regulate Tyson's antitrust activities that stifle competition\nand threaten free and open markets (Federal Trade Commission 2013; Federal\nTrade Commission 2021).\n\nAdditionally, the Packers and Stockyards (P&S) Act restricts monopolies and\nanticompetition practices specifically in the meat and poultry industry (USDA\nand AMS 2023). The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) should expeditiously\nfinalize and implement proposals to improve enforcement of the P&S Act to\nprevent Tyson from further consolidating and escalating monopolistic practices\nthat seek to maximize its profits at the expense of the environment, farmers,\nconsumers, and communities (Federal Register 2022; USDA 2021a; Lakhani 2021).\n\nThe need to enact a new five-year food and farm bill provides Congress with a\nhistoric opportunity to put limits on Tyson Foods and other giant corporations\nthat have hijacked our food and farming system for profit. A new food and farm\nbill can address consolidation in the meat and poultry industry and the\nresultant power it gives companies such as Tyson Foods to pollute at will and\notherwise harm communities, consumers, farmers, and workers (Union of\nConcerned Scientists 2023). To help achieve these goals, the next food and\nfarm bill should include the following provisions:\n\n  * Agriculture Resilience Act: This legislation (H.R. 1840/S. 1016) is a comprehensive bill focused on climate resilience and soil health and provides small- and medium-scale farmers with strategies and funding to thrive, even under a changing climate (Congress n.d. b; Goswami 2023). The bill promotes small-scale poultry and meat processing by creating new grant programs for small slaughtering establishments. Other key provisions of the bill focus on manure management in animal grazing systems and technical assistance for animal farmers.\n\n  * Farm System Reform Act: This legislation (H.R. 797/S. 271) aims to strengthen the P&S Act by curbing the monopolistic practices of meatpackers, for example, by placing a moratorium on large animal factory farms and CAFOs that represent the supply chain for Tyson Foods and other giant processors (Farm System Reform Act of 2023 2023).\n\n  * Protecting America's Meatpacking Workers Act: This bill (H.R. 798/S. 270) creates safer working conditions in meatpacking facilities by requiring, for example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to develop enforceable workplace standards for the meatpacking industry (Congress n.d. a). The bill also increases funding for programs that support regional food systems that allow small- and medium-scale farmers and ranchers to thrive despite the anticompetitive business practices of Tyson and other megacorporations.\n\n  * Strengthening Local Processing Act: This bill (H.R. 945/S. 354) is aimed at diversifying the US meat processing industry by increasing local slaughterhouse options for producers (Pingree 2023). Under the current system, because of the limited number of federally or state-inspected slaughterhouses, some farmers and ranchers must travel hundreds of miles to the nearest slaughterhouse. This bill increases federal cost sharing to help fund state inspection facilities and decrease the cost of shipping for farmers and ranchers. Additionally, the bill creates training programs to bolster the meat processing workforce. That assistance includes grants that support training specifically for small-scale farmers and ranchers, which can help dilute the market power of polluting megacorporations such as Tyson Foods.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the USDA has recognized how the consolidated\nmeat and poultry industry exemplified by Tyson hurts farmers, consumers, and\nthe environment, and how increased competition could help break these\nmegacorporations' choke hold on our food system (The White House 2022).\nAccordingly, the USDA has made substantial investments to expand small- and\nmedium-scale meat and poultry processing. Since 2021, the department has\ncommitted more than a billion dollars to make meat processing more accessible,\nexpand national meat processing capacity, and increase competition to reduce\nconsolidation, and this work includes the USDA's Build Back Better Initiative\n(USDA n.d.; USDA 2021b). In 2023, the department announced new grant programs\nthat will provide up to $125 million in grants to promote local meat and\npoultry markets and to expand opportunities for smaller-scale, local, and\nregional livestock producers, including funds to promote Indigenous peoples'\nmeat industry (The White House 2022).\n\nThe USDA should continue to increase investments in smaller-scale meat\nprocessing and other agricultural sectors to provide farmers, ranchers, and\nmeatpackers opportunities to build resilient new markets. These efforts will\nhelp curb the power of Tyson Foods and other giant processors in our food\nsystem and reduce their negative impacts on the environment.\n\nOmanjana Goswami is an interdisciplinary scientist in the UCS Food and\nEnvironment Program.

We used the US Environmental Protection\nAgency's Water Pollutant Loading Tool to gather facility-level water discharge\ndata from DMRs (US EPA 2023c). The loading tool aggregates the information\nsupplied by these facilities and makes that data available to the public.\n\nWe obtained annual water discharges for all pollutants from Tyson facilities\nfrom 2018 to 2022, the last five years of data available at the time of\nanalysis. We retained discharge data for meat and poultry facilities operated\nby Tyson Foods and two subsidiaries: Hillshire Brands and Tecumseh Poultry.\nAnother Tyson subsidiary, Keystone Foods, was excluded from the analysis\nbecause information on annual discharge pounds per year was not available for\nthe complete study period (EPA, personal communication, May 25, 2023).\n\nWe used the following search parameters in the Water Pollutant Loading Tool\n(US EPA 2023c):\n\n  * Year: Each year was selected individually from 2018 to 2022\n\n  * Location: Nationwide\n\n  * Pollutants: All pollutants\n\n  * Sources: All point sources\n\n  * Facility name: Tyson, Hillshire Brands, Tecumseh Poultry\n\nThe annual total amount of pollutants data were collected for each facility,\nas reported in total annual pounds.\n\nTo remove duplicate pollutant data, we excluded the following:\n\n  * Ammonia as N, inorganic nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, organic nitrogen, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen, because the data for these individual chemical forms were included in the \"Nitrogen\" data, which we retained (US EPA 2023d)\n\n  * Total phosphate, because the data were included in the \"Phosphorus\" data, which we retained (US EPA 2023d)\n\n  * Hexavalent chromium, because the data were included in the \"Chromium\" data, which we retained (EPA, personal communication, November 3, 2023)\n\nWe used the tidyverse package for R (version 4.2.2) to investigate the\ncumulative pounds of pollutants discharged by individual Tyson processing\nplants for the study period 2018 to 2022. Esri's ArcGIS Pro (version 3.2.1)\nwas used to investigate the geospatial distribution of water discharges by\nTyson plants (data from National Hydrography Dataset) and to analyze the\nproximity of discharging plants to waterways and critical habitats (data from\nthe US Fish and Wildlife Service). We obtained both sets of data via Esri's\nLiving Atlas. Interactive online and static print maps were created in ArcGIS\nPro. Code and data files are available on GitHub.\n\nReferences\n\n## References\n\n50Pros. 2024. \"List of Fortune 500 Companies.\" Accessed January 22, 2024.\nhttps://www.50pros.com/fortune500\n\nAbascal, E., L.
