This is the first of two shorter posts this\nweek. This is a follow-on from last week\u2019s The Paradox of x86. The next will\nlook at a historic moment in the development of modern semiconductors.\n\nLast week\u2019s post on x86 was well-timed as it coincided with\n\nCasey Muratori\n\nwriting about whether the x86 Instruction Set Architecture does or doesn\u2019t\n\u2018need to die\u2019.\n\nComputer, Enhance!\n\nDoes x86 Need to Die?\n\nAs many of you already know, I am a big fan of ThePrimeagen\u2019s Twitch channel.\nI\u2019ve been on it a few times now, and at least from my point of view as a\nguest, it consistently has the best energy of any show I\u2019ve done. Last week, I\njoined Prime to discuss a recent article called, ...\n\nRead more\n\n8 days ago \u00b7 66 likes \u00b7 7 comments \u00b7 Casey Muratori\n\nCasey\u2019s post followed his discussion on the topic with Twitcher ThePrimegen,\nrecorded for posterity on YouTube.\n\nThe whole discussion had been prompted by two recent articles. The first on\nHackaday Why x86 Needs To Die in turn prompted a response from the Chips and\nCheese blog entitled Why x86 Doesn\u2019t Need To Die.\n\nCasey is on the \u2018doesn\u2019t need to die \u2019 side of the argument and makes a range\nof very valid points, pretty much all of which I agree with. He summarises his\nposition as follows:\n\n> That said, on the measure, I would disagree that x86 \u201cneeds to die\u201d. The\n> reason I say that is because x86 (now x64) has done a remarkable job\n> stabilizing software development over the past forty years. Sure, you can\n> call that \u201clegacy\u201d or a \u201cmaintenance problem\u201d if you want to look at the\n> downsides. But you could also call it a remarkably flexible instruction set\n> if you\u2019d like to look at the upsides.\n\nCasey mentions Intel\u2019s APX proposals for \u2018spring cleaning\u2019 the x86\narchitecture, which we discussed briefly when they were announced back in July\nlast year.\n\n## Intel APX\n\nBabbage\n\n\u00b7\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nIntel has just announced APX, \u201cthe next major step in the evolution of Intel\u00ae\narchitecture\u201d: Intel\u00aeAdvanced Performance Extensions (Intel\u00ae APX) expands the\nIntel\u00ae 64 instruction set architecture with access to more registers and adds\nvarious new features that improve general-purpose p...\n\nRead full story\n\nKey proposals in APX include:\n\n  * Doubling the number of general purpose registers from 16 to 32;\n\n  * New three operand instructions (e.g. adding ability to subtract register1 from register2, and place the result in register3);\n\n  * New instructions to PUSH / POP two general purpose registers at once;\n\n  * New conditional load, store and compare instructions;\n\n  * Adds the option to suppress status flag writes for common instructions;\n\n  * New 64-bit absolute jump instruction.\n\nCasey highlights, in particular, the ability to suppress flag writes as a\npotential performance win for APX.\n\nWhile very largely agreeing with Casey, I do think that there are other\naspects to x86 that these discussions of the topic omit. In particular, the\nlock-in to two hardware vendors has been highly problematic, both for\ncompetition and for innovation. In the APX post, we asked the question:\n\n> Why didn't Intel / AMD do this a decade ago?\n\nx86-64, the 64-bit version of x86 was announced (by AMD) in 1999. The first\nIntel x86-64 cores appeared in 2004. When will the first APX cores appear? As\nfar as I can tell Intel hasn\u2019t told us yet, which must mean that it is 2025 at\nthe earliest.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any coincidence that these improvements - which probably\ncould have been introduced a decade ago - are appearing only when x86 faces a\nlot more competition. If we needed a demonstration of the problems of the x86\n\u2018lock-in\u2019 then this is it.\n\nIn any event, I think calling, as some do, x86 a \u2018legacy\u2019 architecture is\npremature. Intel and AMD have proven that it can remain competitive and it\nwill become more so with APX. As we\u2019ve discussed before, x86 will be around\nfor a long time - many decades at least - and will continue to be built at\nscale on leading-edge fabrication processes. It just won't be as dominant as\nit has been for the last couple of decades and that is surely healthy.\n\n## How Long Will x86 Endure?\n\nBabbage\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 25, 2022\n\nIt\u2019s 1979, and Intel has a problem. Its 16-bit 8086 microprocessor is losing\nout to its competitors. To quote from the Oral History: Dave House: ...\nMotorola was selling the 68000 and Zilog was selling the Z8000, and we were\ncommonly coming in third with the 8086 when it came to design win choices.\n\nRead full story\n\nShare\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600(Zen 2 | Matisse | CCD) - Courtesy of Fritzchens Fritz\n\n####\n\nAMD and x86: Life Inside Someone Else\u2019s Moat\n\nI\u2019m conscious of the fact that The Paradox of x86 glossed over several\ninteresting details. In particular, AMD\u2019s role in the development of x86 and\nthe potential challenge that \u2018it\u2019s not a moat if AMD is also making x86\ndesigns.\u2019\n\nIntel and AMD have been fierce competitors in the x86 CPU market for almost\nfive decades now. If you\u2019d like to know how it all started, then\n\nJon Y\n\ndoes his usual awesome job in the video below.\n\nIntel\u2019s efforts to compete with AMD have sometimes spilled over into, what has\nbeen ruled to be, illegal and anti-competitive behavior. For example, the\nEuropean Commission fined Intel over a billion Euros in 2009 for:\n\n> ... anti-competitive practices implemented by Intel to the detriment of its\n> competitor on the x86 CPU market, AMD, between October 2002 and December\n> 2007.\n\n(Note that this fine was later overturned and replaced by a smaller fine last\nyear.)\n\nGiven this fierce competition and Intel\u2019s decades-long manufacturing lead over\nAMD, it\u2019s perhaps remarkable that AMD survived at all.\n\nAMD\u2019s achievement of a market cap greater than Intel\u2019s ($236bn vs $145bn at\nthe time of writing on 22/4/24) has been made possible by access to TSMC\u2019s\nsuperior manufacturing. Even before that though, AMD has often proven to be a\nnimble and innovative competitor. The 64-bit version of x86 was, of course, an\nAMD creation - as AMD64 - whilst Intel pursued Itanium.\n\nOn the \u2018is it really a moat if AMD is also making x86 CPUs\u2019 challenge, a moat\nis just a defensive barrier. In this case, one that protects both firms, just\nnot from each other.\n\nIt\u2019s arguable too that AMD\u2019s presence as a maker of x86 CPUs has been good for\nIntel in several ways.\n\n  * Extending the physical moat analogy, AMD has plugged occasional gaps in the moat when Intel has been distracted with other things, with AMD64 being the most notable example.\n\n  * More recently, as Intel stumbled on 10nm, AMD has shown that x86 remains a competitive architecture, and possibly delayed some switches to Arm.\n\n  * Perhaps more significantly, I suspect that competition from AMD has helped to keep Intel \u2018match fit\u2019, and reduce the complacency that might otherwise have seen the firm falter earlier.\n\n  * Finally, I think that there would have been a lot more antitrust interest in x86 both in the US and the EU without AMD\u2019s presence in the market.\n\nI suspect that Intel\u2019s management believes this last point too. Perhaps then\nAMD\u2019s survival shouldn't be such a surprise after all?!\n\n14 Likes\n\n14\n\nShare this post\n\n#### More on x86\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nPaul BergerApr 23Liked by BabbageSmall typo...While very largely agreeing with\nCasey, I do think that there are other aspects to x86 that these discussions\non the topic omitExpand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Babbage\n\n1 more comment...\n\nDemystifying GPU Compute Architectures\n\nGetting 'low level' with Nvidia and AMD GPUs\n\nFeb 4 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n71\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Demystifying GPU Compute Architectures\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n9\n\nGoogle's First Tensor Processing Unit : Architecture\n\nLooking in more detail at Google's first Tensor Processing Unit\n\nMar 24 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n39\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Google's First Tensor Processing Unit : Architecture\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n5\n\nMoore on Moore\n\nWe look at the past, present and uncertain future of Moore's Law, with some\nhelp from Gordon Moore himself\n\nJan 21 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n38\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Moore on Moore\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Chip Letter\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
