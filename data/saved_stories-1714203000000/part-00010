The 2024 update to the Hive Systems Password Table that\u2019s been\nshown and written about in the news, published by universities, and shared by\nthousands of companies across the globe. How did we make this table and what\u2019s\nbehind the math? Read on!\n\nNot a reader? Stay tuned for our video review of this year\u2019s table in our\nupcoming episode of Hive Live in May!\n\nLooking for high resolution versions to download? Or the Password Table in\nother languages?\n\n### DOWNLOAD NOW\n\n## Looking at Passwords in 2024\n\n14 min\n\nSince 2020, we\u2019ve conducted a lot of research to develop and present the Hive\nSystems Password Table. But for those of you that want to learn more about how\nwe make the table - then you\u2019ve come to the right place! A lot more goes into\nit than just pretty colors, and while the data fits nicely into the table\nabove, things aren\u2019t as as simple as they look. So let\u2019s talk through the\ndata, our assumptions, and oh, you\u2019re going to see a LOT of variations of the\npassword table (including one that\u2019s all purple \ud83d\ude31).\n\n  * Got a question or comment? Leave a comment below, or message us on social media (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit)\n\n  * Heard about the LastPass breach? Check out the variations of our Password Table where we dive deeper into what happened and see how you may be impacted.\n\n### \u201cSo how'd you make the table?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re feeling a little nostalgic so let\u2019s start by looking back at how the\nPassword Table has changed over the years (including for 2024):\n\n  * In 2020, we first shared our Password Table, based on data from www.howsecureismypassword.net (now run over by the folks at security.org) and assembled by Mike Halsey, Microsoft MVP, which looked at the relative strength of a hashed password against a cracking attempt, based on the password\u2019s length, complexity, hashing algorithm used by the victim, and the hardware used by the attacker.\n\n    * 2020 hardware: 1 x RTX 2080 | 2020 password hash: MD5\n\n  * In 2022, we dove in deeper on the data and hardware used to create a more accurate picture. The data in that table was based on how long it would take a consumer-budget hacker to crack your password hash using a desktop computer with a top-tier graphics card and then how long an organized-crime-budget hacker would take leveraging cloud computing resources. We looked at big name providers like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure but also the growing non-corporate options where you can rent a person\u2019s computer at cost per hour.\n\n    * 2022 hardware: 8 x A100 | 2022 password hash: MD5\n\n  * In 2023, we updated our cracking hardware to the latest and greatest, including that of the internet darling ChatGPT, and opted for a more realistic set of special characters in our testing since most websites only accept these ^*%$!&@# and so we dropped the rest. That only impacted the right-most column of the table\n\n    * 2023 hardware: 12 x RTX 4090 | 2023 password hash: MD5\n\n  * In 2024, we took a look at what hashing (if any) had been observed in password breaches over the years and based on recent data and trends, moved from assuming MD5 to assuming bcrypt. For bcrypt, we also set it to 32 iterations. We stuck with 12x RTX 4090s because that still appears to be the best consumer accessible hardware configuration that won\u2019t block you from running tools used for brute forcing passwords. We also now offer the Password Table in multiple languages!\n\n    * 2024 hardware: 12 x RTX 4090 | 2024 password hash: bcrypt\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about \u201chashing.\u201d In the\ncontext of passwords, a \u201chash\u201d is a scrambled version of text that is\nreproducible if you know what hash software was used. In other words, if your\nfriend hashes the word \u201cpassword\u201d using MD5 hashing, the output hash will be\n5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99. Now if you hash the word \u201cpassword\u201d using\nMD5 hashing , you\u2019ll also get 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99! You and your\nfriend both secretly know the word \u201cpassword\u201d is the secret code, but anyone\nelse watching you just sees 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99. Passwords are\nstored in servers as hashes like this instead of in plain text like\n\u201cpassword.\u201d That way, if someone steals the database all they can see are\nthese hashes but not the password that made them.\n\nYou can\u2019t do the reverse. A hash digest like 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\ncan\u2019t be computed to produce the word \u201cpassword\u201d that was used to make it.\nHashing software is a one-way-street by design. The way that hackers solve\nthis problem is by \u201ccracking\u201d the passwords instead. In this context,\n\u201ccracking\u201d means making a list of all combinations of characters on your\nkeyboard and then hashing them. Then you look for matches between the list and\na breached database of password hashes. You can do that with any computer, but\nit is much faster if you accelerate the process with a powerful graphics card.\n\nGraphics cards are those circuit boards that stick out of your computer\u2019s\nbigger green circuit board. Among other things, this special circuit board has\na GPU on it. A GPU is the shiny square tile on your graphics card that maybe\nsays NVIDIA or AMD on it. GPU stands for graphical processing unit \u2013 they were\nbuilt to make pictures load faster on your computer screen (and to play great\nvideo games). As it turns out, they\u2019re also great at calculating hashes too. A\npopular application for hashing is called Hashcat. Hashcat includes hashing\nsoftware like bcrypt and allows you to try not just bcrypt but thousands of\nothers and see how fast it was able to do so. We usually say \u201chash function\u201d\ninstead of \u201chash software.\u201d\n\nWhen shopping for a graphics card or cloud GPU, you\u2019re given \u201ccalculations per\nsecond,\u201d usually in \u201cfloating point operations per second\u201d (FLOPS). The FLOPS\nmeasure doesn\u2019t take into account the unique properties of hashing algorithms,\npassword character composition, and the hardware \u201caround\u201d the graphics card\nlike your motherboard, CPU, and RAM. Fortunately, hashcat made it easy for\npassword recovery experts to automate testing their hardware on real hashing\nexercises and then log the results to share. The result is an ever-growing\ndataset of observed hashing performance using various hardware and hashing\napproaches called \u201cbenchmarks\u201d.\n\n### \u201cSo how much different is that in terms of time?\u201d\n\nAssuming the 8-character password recommendation from NIST is used:\n\nMax time required to crack randomly generated 8-character MD5 password hashes\nof various complexity on different hardware.\n\nMax time required to crack randomly generated 8-character bcrypt password\nhashes set to 32 iterations of various complexity on different hardware.\n\nSo even with benefit-of-the-doubt bcrypt, we\u2019re still talkin\u2019 5 days tops if\nyou have lots of cash. But for most budgets, up to 12 years seems decent if\nyou\u2019re also changing the password and it\u2019s randomly generated.\n\n### \u201cSo how did you pick just one of these to be the 2024 Password Table\u2019?\u201d\n\nWe reviewed password data breaches from 2007 to present, reported on\nHaveIBeenPwned.\n\nIn terms of the number of credentials breached, regardless of source this is\nwhat it looks like as of April 2024:\n\nThe count of passwords breached, regardless of source, colored by hash type.\nData from www.haveibeenpwnd.com\n\nThe count of whole password datasets breached, colored by hash type. Data from\nwww.haveibeenpwnd.com\n\nMD5 reigned supreme for several years but bcrypt was in the lead in 2020,\n2021, 2023 and again so far in 2024.\n\nPassword storage solutions like LastPass, 1Password, and Bitwarden use the\nhashing approach called PBKDF2 salted with a strong hash alternative to MD5,\ncalled SHA-256. Even NIST recommends PBKDF2 SHA-256. But as we\u2019ve seen, things\nlook different \u201cin the wild.\u201d Breached password hashes from Dropbox, Ethereum,\nMyFitnessPal and DataCamp all used bcrypt instead of a key derivation function\nlike PBKDF2. Bcrypt also seems to be the more secure option in terms of\nresources required to crack it. As a result, the 2024 Hive Systems Password\nTable is based on the power of the 12 RTX 4090 GPUs against bcrypt.\n\n### \u201cOk got it, but what if my password has been previously stolen, uses\nsimple words, or I reuse it between sites?\u201d\n\nOur password table focuses on the idea that the hacker is working in a \u201cblack\nbox\u201d situation and is having to start from scratch to crack your hash in order\nto show the \u201cworst case\u201d or \u201cmaximum time required.\u201d Most hackers will\nprioritize which words and strings of characters they\u2019ll work on first through\nthe use of rainbow tables, dictionary attacks, and previously stolen hashes.\nIf your password was part of another breach or uses dictionary words then your\npassword table looks like this:\n\nPassword table if your password has been previously stolen, uses dictionary\nwords, or if you reuse it between websites.\n\n### \u201cWhat about that xkcd comic on passphrases?\u201d\n\nFirst of all, can you believe that comic was from 13 years ago \ud83e\uddd3. Our password\ntable graphic doesn\u2019t go up to the number of characters in the xkcd example\n(25) simply because you have to draw a line somewhere with the size of an\nimage. For the stats on their password \u2018correcthorsebatterystaple. But for the\ncurious, that table and respective stats would look like this:\n\nAssuming bcrypt on 8 x A100s: 406 nonillion years (that\u2019s a LOT of zeros!)\n\nBUT the xkcd password is not a randomly generated password. Passphrases are a\nstring of known dictionary words. That means \u201ccracking\u201d will be less than 14\nQuadrillion years because when selecting which combinations of things to crack\nfirst we can start with relatively short, easy to memorize, words! The process\ncan be sped up even more if we know anything about the person and can focus on\nwords from topics we suspect they are interested in. It can even be narrowed\nby knowing which passphrase generator or dice kit they used. It will still\ntake a long time to crack passphrases but nowhere near as long as fully\nrandomly generated strings of the same length. Even so, if passphrases will\nget you into those higher character counts then the benefits may outweigh the\nrisks.\n\nFor more information and a nice explanation of the xkcd comic.\n\n### \u201cShould I trust LastPass?\u201d\n\nYou should perform a risk assessment and ensure your risk modeling technique\nincludes modeling the risk of security controls themselves (try using Derive\nto help!). The days of conveniently assuming security technology came with\nonly benefits and no risk are over! Check out our ACT post on the topic to\nhelp with your decision.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have the resources to do that, trusted security professional\nDaniel Miessler said in My Philosophy and Recommendations Around the LastPass\nBreaches, \u201cIn short, all companies can be hacked, including companies like\nLastPass, and it\u2019s much better to have your most sensitive assets with a large\ncompany that has nearly infinite security resources to detect and respond when\nit inevitably happens.\u201d which I generally agree with as a heuristic if you\ndon\u2019t have time to do a proper risk assessment.\n\n### \u201cOk but what\u2019s the deal with these huge numbers?\u201d\n\nDifferent countries, regions, and schools of thought use different\nabbreviations for numbers. The password table uses the following:\n\nCommas| Zeros| Sci| Log10| Abbrev| Word| e.g. (10^n zeros)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 3| 1.00E+03| 3| k| thousand| 1,000.00  \n2| 6| 1.00E+06| 6| m| million| 1,000,000.00  \n3| 9| 1.00E+09| 9| bn| billion| 1,000,000,000.00  \n4| 12| 1.00E+12| 12| tn| trillion| 1,000,000,000,000.00  \n5| 15| 1.00E+15| 15| qd| quadrillion| 1,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n6| 18| 1.00E+18| 18| qn| quintillion| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n7| 21| 1.00E+21| 21| sx| sextillion| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n8| 24| 1.00E+24| 24| spt| septillion| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n9| 27| 1.00E+27| 27| oct| octillion| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n10| 30| 1.00E+30| 30| non| nonillion|\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n11| 33| 1.00E+33| 33| dec| decillion|\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n12| 36| 1.00E+36| 36| undec| undecillion|\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n13| 39| 1.00E+39| 39| duod| duodecillion|\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n14| 42| 1.00E+42| 42| tred| tredecillion|\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00  \n  \n### Limitations of Our Work\n\n  * Cracking passwords this way assumes that the attacker has acquired a hash digest of one or more passwords, such as those found in password data breaches on HaveIBeenPwned or more recently LastPass (see that password table here)!\n\n  * The implied attack assumes that MFA is not used or has been bypassed. If you can get access to download the encrypted database, like what happened with LastPass, you don\u2019t need to deal with MFA when making attempts thereafter.\n\n  * These metrics assume that passwords are randomly generated. Non-randomly generated passwords are much easier and faster to crack because humans are fairly predictable. As such, the time frames in these tables serve as a \u201cbest case\u201d reference point. Passwords that have not been randomly generated would be cracked significantly faster.\n\n  * These metrics assume you\u2019re using a password that has not been part of a breach in the past. Attackers will try hashes to all common and breached passwords before bothering to crack new ones.\n\n  * Think of how vast the LastPass breach was. 30 million customers\u2019 secrets were stolen. But as of publishing this article, you won\u2019t find the LastPass breach represented in HaveIBeenPwned. Why? Because the trove of passwords hasn\u2019t surfaced in public yet! Imagine how many stolen secrets and vulnerabilities never reach the light of day or even the dark web. I\u2019d speculate keeping secrets secret gives more leverage and power to criminals than releasing them.\n\n  * Hashcat defaults to 999 iterations for PBKDF2 SHA-256 but that doesn\u2019t represent what people use. NIST recommends a minimum of 10,000 iterations and sites like LastPass (now) use 600,000, and 1password 650,000 iterations.\n\n  * Hashing a bunch of character combos is only one step to \u201ccracking.\u201d The second step is looking for matches between the hashed strings and the breached hashed password dataset. We assume that this lookup requires a trivial amount of additional computation and time.\n\n  * The password breaches that make it to HaveIBeenPwned may not be representative of reality. There may be selection and survival bias filtering out cases before they make it on there. For example LastPass had a big scary breach but they don\u2019t appear on HIBP because the actual data hasn\u2019t been shared publicly. It may also be that when people use strong enough encryption, they don\u2019t bother sharing or selling the dataset because nobody will buy it or bother cracking it.\n\n  * In earlier editions of the table we included all QWERTY keyboard symbols but this year we stuck with the set commonly accepted on most websites and generated by most password generators ^*%$!&@# . That choice only impacts the right-most column of our tables. In other words we excluded the symbols crossed out in the following table:\n\nEncoding| Alias| Character Range| Characters  \n---|---|---|---  \nASCII| Lowercase| a-z| 26  \nASCII| Uppercase| A-Z| 26  \nASCII| Numbers| 0-9| 10  \nASCII| Symbols A| ^*%$!&@#| 8  \nASCII| Symbols B| \\s?/.>,<`~|;:]}[{'\\\"< /td>| 19  \nUnicode| Latin Set| u00A1-u00A2, u00A4-u00FF| 93  \nUnicode| Latin Ext A| u0100-u017F| 128  \nUnicode| Latin Ext B| u0180-u024F| 208  \nUnicode| Latin Ext C| u2C60-u2C7F| 32  \nUnicode| Latin Ext D| uA720-uA7FF| 29  \nUnicode| Cyrillic Uppercase| u0410-u042F| 32  \nUnicode| Cyrillic Uppercase| u0430-u044F| 32  \n  \n### Acknowledgements\n\n  * Thank you to the over 1 million of you who have seen, read, and shared our work!\n\n  * Thank you everyone who commented on last year\u2019s Password Table here on the site, on Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, via email and everywhere else!
