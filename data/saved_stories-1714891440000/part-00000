The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

He is a trustee of\nGustavus Adolphus College.\n\n  * May 1, 2024\n\nSelective college admissions have been a vortex of anxiety and stress for what\nseems like forever, inducing panic in more top high school seniors each year.\nBut the 2023-24 admissions season was not just an incremental increase in the\nfrantic posturing and high-pressure guesswork that make this annual ritual\nseem like academic Hunger Games. This year was different. A number of factors\n\u2014 some widely discussed, some little noticed \u2014 combined to push the process\ninto a new realm in which the old rules didn\u2019t apply and even the gatekeepers\nseemed not to know what the new rules were.\n\nIt happened, as these things often do, first gradually and then all at once.\n\nIt started with a precipitous rise in the number of people clamoring to get\nin. The so-called Ivy-Plus schools \u2014 the eight members of the Ivy League plus\nM.I.T., Duke, Chicago and Stanford \u2014 collectively received about 175,000\napplications in 2002. In 2022, the most recent year for which totals are\navailable, they got more than 590,000, with only a few thousand more available\nspots.\n\nThe quality of the applicants has risen also. In 2002, the nation produced 134\nperfect ACT scores; in 2023 there were 2,542. Over the same period, the United\nStates \u2014 and beyond it, the world \u2014 welcomed a great many more families into\nthe ranks of the wealthy, who are by far the most likely to attend an elite\ncollege. Something had to give.\n\nThe first cracks appeared around the rules that had long governed the process\nand kept it civilized, obligating colleges to operate on the same calendar and\nto give students time to consider all offers before committing. A legal\nchallenge swept the rules away, freeing the most powerful schools to do pretty\nmuch whatever they wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne clear result was a drastic escalation in the formerly niche admissions\npractice known as early decision.\n\nThen Covid swept through, forcing colleges to let students apply without\nstandardized test scores \u2014 which, as the university consultant Ben Kennedy\nsays, \u201ctripled the number of kids who said to themselves, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got a\nshot at admission there.\u2019\u201d More applications, more market power for the\nschools and, for the students, an ever smaller chance of getting in.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision ending race-based affirmative\naction left colleges scrambling for new ways to preserve diversity and\nstudents groping in the dark to figure out what schools wanted.\n\nFinally, this year the whole financial aid system exploded into spectacular\ndisarray. Now, a month after most schools sent out the final round of\nacceptances, many students still don\u2019t have the information they need to\ndetermine if they can afford college. Some will delay attending, and some will\nforgo it entirely, an outcome that will have lasting implications for them\nand, down the line, for the economy as a whole.\n\nThese disparate changes had one crucial thing in common: Almost all of them\nstrengthened the hand of highly selective colleges, allowing them to push\napplicants into more constricted choices with less information and less\nleverage. The result is that elite admissions offices, which have always tried\nto reduce the uncertainty in each new year\u2019s decisions, are now using their\nmarket power to all but eliminate it. This means taking no chances in pursuit\nof a high yield, the status-bestowing percentage of admitted students who\nenroll. But low uncertainty for elite colleges means the opposite for\napplicants \u2014 especially if they can\u2019t pay the full tuition rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCanh Oxelson, the executive director of college counseling at the Horace Mann\nSchool in New York, says: \u201cThis is as much uncertainty as we\u2019ve ever seen.\nAffirmative action, the FAFSA debacle, test-optionality \u2014 it has shown itself\nin this one particular year. Colleges want certainty, and they are getting\nmore. Families want certainty and they are getting less.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, the only applicants who could be certain of an advantage were those\nwhose parents had taken the wise precaution of being rich.\n\nImage\n\n## The Early Bird Gets the Dorm\n\nFor Ivy Wydler, an elite college seemed like an obvious destination, and many\nof her classmates at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington,\nD.C., were headed along the same trajectory. After her sophomore year of high\nschool, she took the ACT and got a perfect score \u2014 on her first try, a true\nrarity. Her grades were stellar. So she set her sights high, favoring \u201cmedium\nto big schools, and not too cold.\u201d\n\nTouring campuses, she was dazzled by how great and exciting it all seemed.\nThen she visited Duke, and something clicked. She applied in the binding early\ndecision round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s a consequential choice. Students can do so at only one college, and they\nhave to promise to attend if accepted, before knowing what the school\u2019s\nfinancial aid offer will be. That means there is at least a chance an\napplicant will be on the hook for the full cost, which at Duke is $86,886 for\nthe 2024-25 year. Students couldn\u2019t be legally compelled to attend if they\ncouldn\u2019t afford it, but by the time they got the news, they would have already\nhad to withdraw their other applications.\n\nIf full tuition isn\u2019t a deal killer, as it wouldn\u2019t be for Ivy\u2019s family, the\nrewards are considerable. This year, just over 54,000 high school seniors vied\nto be one of only 1,750 members of Duke\u2019s incoming class. The 6,000 who\napplied in the early decision round were three times as likely to get in as\nthe 48,000 who applied later.\n\nUntil recently, early decision was a narrow pathway \u2014 an outlier governed,\nlike the rest of this annual academic mating season, by a set of mandatory\npractices laid out by the National Association for College Admission\nCounseling, which is made up of college admissions officers and high school\ncounselors. Those rules said, for example, that colleges couldn\u2019t recruit a\nstudent who was already committed to another school or actively encourage\nsomeone to transfer. Crucially, the rules said that colleges needed to give\nstudents until May 1 to decide among offers (noting early decision, which\nbegins and ends in the fall, as a \u201crecognized exception\u201d).\n\nThe Justice Department thought those rules ran afoul of the Sherman Antitrust\nAct, which bars powerful industries from colluding to restrain competition. At\nthe end of 2019, NACAC agreed to a settlement mandating that the organization\n\u201cpromptly abolish\u201d several of the rules and downgrade the rest to voluntary\nguidelines. Now, if they chose to, colleges had license to lure students with\nspecial offers or benefits, to aggressively poach students at other schools\nand to tear up the traditional admissions calendar.\n\nAt that point, nothing restrained colleges from going all in on early\ndecision, a strategy that allows them to lock in students early without making\nany particular commitments about financial aid. Of the 735 first-year students\nthat Middlebury College enrolled last year, for example, 516 were admitted via\nbinding early decision. Some schools have a second round of early decision,\nand even what amounts to an unofficial third round \u2014 along with an array of\nother application pathways, each with its own terms and conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the rules now abandoned, colleges got a whole new bag of tricks. For\nexample, a school might call \u2014 at any time in the process \u2014 with a one-time\noffer of admission if you can commit on the spot to attend and let go of all\nother prospects. Hesitate and it\u2019s gone, along with your chances in subsequent\nrounds. \u201cWe hear about colleges that are putting pressure on high school\nseniors to send in a deposit sooner to get better courses or housing options,\u201d\nsays Sara Harberson, the founder of Application Nation, a college advising\nservice.\n\nTo inform these maneuvers, colleges lean on consultants who analyze applicant\ndemographics, qualifications, financial status and more, using econometric\nmodels. High school seniors think this is checkers, but the schools know it\u2019s\nchess. This has all become terrifying for students, who are first-time players\nin a game their opponents invented.\n\nApplication season can be particularly intimidating for students who, unlike\nIvy, did not grow up on the elite college conveyor belt. When Rania Khan, a\nsenior in Gorton High School in Yonkers, N.Y., was in middle school, she and\nher mother spent two years in a shelter near Times Square. Since then she and\nher younger brother have been in the foster system. Despite these challenges,\nshe has been a superb student. In ninth grade, Rania got an internship at\nGoogle and joined a research team at Regeneron, a biotechnology company. She\nwon a national award for her study of how sewage treatment chemicals affect\nriver ecosystems. Looking at colleges, she saw that her scores and credentials\nmatched with those of students at the very top schools in the country.\n\nOne of the schools she was most drawn to was Barnard. \u201cI like that it\u2019s both a\nsmall college and\u201d \u2014 because it\u2019s part of Columbia \u2014 \u201ca big university. There\nare a lot of resources, and it\u2019s a positive environment for women,\u201d she said.\nAnd it would keep her close to her little brother.\n\nBarnard now fills around 60 percent of its incoming class in the early\ndecision round, giving those students a massive admissions advantage. It would\nhave been an obvious option for Rania, but she can\u2019t take any chances\nfinancially. She applied via the general decision pool, when instead of having\na one in three chance, her odds were one in 20.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficially, anyone can apply for early decision. In practice it\u2019s priority\nboarding for first-class passengers.\n\n## Unstandardized Testing\n\nWhen selective colleges suspended the requirement for standardized testing, it\ndidn\u2019t really seem like a choice; because of the pandemic, a great many\nstudents simply couldn\u2019t take the tests. The implications, however, went far\nbeyond mere plague-year logistics.\n\nThe SAT was rolled out in 1926 as an objective measure of students\u2019 ability,\nabsent the cultural biases that had so strongly informed college admissions\nbefore then. It\u2019s been the subject of debate almost ever since. In 1980, Ralph\nNader published a study alleging that the standardized testing regimen\nactually reinforced racial and gender bias and favored people who could afford\nexpensive test prep. Many educators have come back around to regarding the\ntests as a good predictor of academic success, but the matter is far from\nsettled.\n\nRemarkably, students still take the exams in the same numbers as before the\npandemic, but far fewer disclose what they got. Cindy Zarzuela, an adviser\nwith the nonprofit Yonkers Partners in Education who works with Rania and\nabout 90 other students, said all her students took the SAT this year. None of\nthem sent their scores to colleges.\n\nThese days, Cornell, for example, admits roughly 40 percent of its incoming\nclass without a test score. At schools like the University of Wisconsin or the\nUniversity of Connecticut, the percentage is even higher. In California,\nschools rarely accept scores at all, being in many cases not only test-\noptional, but also \u201ctest-blind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe high-water mark of test-optionality, however, was also its undoing.\n\nApplicants tended to submit their scores only if they were above the school\u2019s\nreported median, a pattern that causes that median to be recalibrated higher\nand higher each year. When Cornell went test-optional, its 25th percentile\nscore on the math SAT jumped from 720 to 750. Then it went to 760. The ceiling\nis 800, so standardized tests had begun to morph from a system of gradients\ninto a yes/no question: Did you get a perfect score? If not, don\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe irony, however, was that in the search for a diverse student body, many\nelite colleges view strong-but-not-stellar test scores as proof that a student\nfrom an underprivileged background could do well despite lacking the\nadvantages of the kids from big suburban high schools and fancy prep schools.\nWithout those scores, it might be harder to make the case.\n\nMultiply that across the board, and the result was that test-optional policies\nmade admission to an elite school less likely for some diverse or\ndisadvantaged applicants. Georgetown and M.I.T. were first to reinstate test\nscore requirements, and so far this year Harvard, Yale, Brown, Caltech,\nDartmouth and Cornell have announced that they will follow. There may be more\nto come.\n\nImage\n\n## The Power of No\n\nOn Dec. 14, Ivy got an answer from Duke: She was rejected.\n\nShe was in extremely good company. It\u2019s been a while since top students could\nassume they\u2019d get into top schools, but today they get rejected more often\nthan not. It even happens at places like Northeastern, a school now ranked\n53rd in the nation by U.S. News & World Report \u2014 and not long ago, more than\n100 slots lower than that. It spends less per student on instruction than the\nBoston public schools.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no target school anymore and no safety school,\u201d says Stef Mauler, a\nprivate admissions coach in Texas. \u201cYou have to have a strategy for every\nschool you apply to.\u201d\n\nNortheastern was one of the 18 other schools Ivy applied to, carefully sifting\nthrough various deadlines and conditions, mapping out her strategy. With Duke\nout of the picture, her thoughts kept returning to one of them in particular:\nDartmouth, her father\u2019s alma mater. \u201cMy mom said, \u2018Ivy, you love New\nHampshire. Look at Dartmouth.\u2019 She was right.\u201d She had wanted to go someplace\nwarm, but the idea of cold weather seemed to be bothering her less and less.\n\nMeanwhile Rania watched as early decision day came and went, and thousands of\nhigh school seniors across the country got the best news of their lives. For\nRania, it was just another Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## A Free Market in Financial Aid\n\nIn 2003, a consortium of about 20 elite colleges agreed to follow a shared\nformula for financial aid, to ensure that they were competing for students on\nthe merits, not on mere dollars and cents. It sounds civilized, but pricing\nagreements are generally illegal for commercial ventures. (Imagine if car\ncompanies agreed not to underbid each other.) The colleges believed they were\nexempt from that prohibition, however, because they practiced \u201cneed-blind\u201d\nadmissions, meaning they don\u2019t discriminate based on a student\u2019s ability to\npay.\n\nIn 2022, nine current and former students from an array of prestigious\ncolleges filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit \u2014 later backed by the Justice\nDepartment \u2014 arguing that the consortium\u2019s gentlemanly agreement was depriving\napplicants of the benefits of a free market. And to defang the defense, they\nproduced a brilliant argument: No, these wealthy colleges didn\u2019t discriminate\nagainst students who were poor, but they sure did discriminate in favor of\nstudents who were rich. They favored the children of alumni and devoted whole\ndevelopment offices to luring the kinds of ultrarich families that affix their\nnames to shiny new buildings. It worked: Early this year, Brown, Columbia,\nDuke, Emory and Yale joined the University of Chicago in conceding, and paying\nout a nine-figure settlement. (They deny any wrongdoing.) Several other\nschools are playing on, but the consortium and its rules have evaporated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis set schools free to undercut one another on price in order to get their\npreferred students. It also gave the schools a further incentive to push for\nearly decision, when students don\u2019t have the ability to compare offers.\n\nFor almost anyone seeking financial aid, from the most sought-after first-\nround pick to the kid who just slid under the wire, the first step remained\nthe same: They had to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid\nform, or FAFSA.\n\nAs anyone knows who\u2019s been through it \u2014 or looked into the glassy eyes of\nsomeone else who has \u2014 applying for financial aid can be torture at the best\nof times. This year was the worst of times, because FAFSA was broken. The\nform, used by the government to determine who qualifies for federal grants or\nstudent loans, and by many colleges to determine their in-house financial aid,\nhad gotten a much-needed overhaul. But the new version didn\u2019t work, causing\nendless frustration for many families, and convincing many others not even to\nbother. At mid-April, finished FAFSA applications were down 29 percent\ncompared with last year.\n\n\u201cThe FAFSA catastrophe is bigger than people realize,\u201d says Casey Sacks, a\nformer U.S. Department of Education official and now the president of\nBridgeValley Community and Technical College in West Virginia, where 70\npercent of students receive federal funds.\n\nAbigail Garcia, Rania\u2019s classmate and the 2024 valedictorian of their school,\napplied to in-state public colleges as well as Ivies. She couldn\u2019t complete\nthe FAFSA, however, because it rejected her parents\u2019 information, the most\ncommon glitch. She has financial aid offers from elite schools, all of which\nuse a private alternative to the government form, but she can\u2019t weigh them\nagainst the public institutions, because they are so severely delayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor most students, 2024\u2019s FAFSA crisis looks set to take the uncertainty that\nbegan last fall and drag it into the summer or beyond. \u201cThat\u2019s going to reduce\nthe work force in two to four years.\u201d Ms. Sacks says. \u201cFAFSA completions are a\npretty good leading indicator of how many people will be able to start doing\nthe kinds of jobs that are in highest demand \u2014 registered nurses,\nmanufacturing engineers, those kinds of jobs.\u201d\n\nAs the FAFSA problem rolls on, it could be that for the system as a whole, the\nworst is still to come.\n\nImage\n\n## Can Any of This Be Fixed?\n\nOn the numbers, elite college applicants\u2019 problems are a footnote to the story\nof college access. The Ivy-Plus schools enroll less than 1 percent of\nAmerica\u2019s roughly 15 million undergraduates. If you expand the pool to include\nall colleges that are selective enough to accept less than a quarter of\napplicants, we\u2019re still talking about only 6 percent of undergraduates. The\neasiest way to alleviate the traffic jam at the top is to shift our cultural\nfocus toward the hundreds of schools that offer an excellent education but are\nnot luxury brands.\n\nLuxury brand schools, however, have real power. In 2023, 15 of 32 Rhodes\nscholars came from the Ivies, nine from Harvard alone. Twenty of this year\u2019s\n38 Supreme Court clerks came from Harvard or Yale. If elite colleges\u2019\nselection process is broken, what should we do to fix it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere\u2019s what we can\u2019t do: Let them go off and agree on their own solution.\nAntitrust law exists to prevent dominant players from setting their own rules\nto the detriment of consumers and competitors.\n\nHere\u2019s what we won\u2019t do: Legislate national rules that govern admissions. Our\nsystems are decentralized and it would take a miracle for Congress not to make\nthings worse.\n\nBut here\u2019s what we can do: Hold the schools accountable for their processes\nand their decisions.\n\nInstitutions that receive federal funds \u2014 which include all elite colleges \u2014\nshould be required to clearly state their admissions criteria. Admissions as\ncurrently practiced are designed to let schools whose budgets run on billions\nof taxpayers dollars do whatever they want. Consider Stanford\u2019s guidance to\napplicants: \u201cIn a holistic review, we seek to understand how you, as a whole\nperson, would grow, contribute and thrive at Stanford, and how Stanford would,\nin turn, be changed by you.\u201d This perfectly encapsulates the current system,\nbecause it is meaningless.\n\nColleges should also not be allowed to make anyone decide whether to attend\nwithout knowing what it will actually cost, and they should not be allowed to\noffer better odds to those who forgo that information. They should not offer\nadmissions pathways tilted to favor the rich, any more than they should offer\npathways favoring people who are white.\n\nIt just shouldn\u2019t be this hard. Really.\n\n## The Envelope Please ...\n\nIvy has the highest academic qualifications available inside the conventional\nsystem, and her family can pay full tuition. Once upon a time, she would have\nhad her pick of top colleges. Not this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the course of the whole crazy admissions season, the school she had come\nto care about most was Dartmouth.\n\nAlong with the other seven Ivies, Dartmouth released this year\u2019s admissions\ndecisions online on March 28, at 7 p.m. Eastern. Ivy was traveling that day,\nand as the moment approached, she said, \u201cI was on the bed in my hotel room,\njust repeating, \u2018People love me for who I am, not what I do. People love me\nfor who I am, not what I do.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe was rejected by Duke, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Columbia and the University of\nSouthern California, where Operation Varsity Blues shenanigans could once\nguarantee acceptance but, as Ivy discovered, a perfect score on the ACT will\nnot. She landed on the wait list at Northeastern. She was accepted by Michigan\nand Johns Hopkins. And Ivy was accepted at both her parents\u2019 alma maters: the\nUniversity of Virginia and Dartmouth, where she will start in September.\n\nFor Rania, the star student with an extraordinary story of personal\nresilience, the news was not so good. At Barnard, she was remanded to the wait\nlist. Last year only 4 percent of students in that position were eventually\nlet in. N.Y.U. and the City University of New York\u2019s medical college put her\non the wait list, too.\n\nA spot on a wait list tells applicants that they were good enough to get in.\nBy the time Rania applied to these schools, there just wasn\u2019t any room. \u201cIt\nwas definitely a shock,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was I missing? They just ran out of\nspace \u2014 there are so many people trying to get into these places. It took two\nweeks to adjust to it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe did get lots of other good news, a sheaf of acceptances from schools like\nFordham and the University at Albany. But then came the hardest question of\nall: How to pay for them? Some offered her a financial aid package that would\nleave her on the hook for more money than undergraduates are allowed to take\nout in federal student loans. Even now, some colleges haven\u2019t been able to\nprovide her with financial aid information at all.\n\nRania had all but settled on Hunter College, part of the City University\nsystem. It\u2019s an excellent school, but a world away from the elite colleges she\nwas thinking about when she started her search. Then at almost the last\nmoment, Wesleyan came through with a full ride and even threw in some extra\nfor expenses. Rania accepted, gratefully.\n\nFor Rania, the whole painful roller coaster of a year was over. For so many\nother high school seniors, the year of broken college admissions continues.\n\nDaniel Currell, a lawyer and consultant, was a deputy under secretary and\nsenior adviser at the Department of Education from 2018 to 2021.
