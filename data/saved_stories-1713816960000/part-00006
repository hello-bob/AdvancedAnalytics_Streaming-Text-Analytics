Are\nfloral smells perpendicular to smoky ones? Is the geometry of \u2018odour space\u2019\nEuclidean, following the rules about lines, shapes and angles that decorate\ncountless high-school chalkboards? To many, these will seem like either\nunserious questions or, less charitably, meaningless ones. Geometry is logic\nmade visible, after all; the business of drawing unassailable conclusions from\nclearly stated axioms. And odour is, let\u2019s be honest, a bit too vague and\nvaporous for any of that. The folksy idea of smell as the blunted and\nstructureless sense is at least as old as Plato, and I have to confess that,\neven as an olfactory researcher, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m studying the Pluto\nof the sensory systems \u2013 a shadowy, out-there iceball on a weird orbit.\n\nIn recent years, however, things have changed dramatically, and understanding\nwhat one might call \u2018the geometry of smell\u2019 is a field that now enlists task\nforces of neuroscientists working together with mathematically trained\ntheorists and artificial intelligence (AI) experts. While we\u2019re notoriously\nbad at intuiting how our minds organise phenomena like colours and smells,\nmachines offer a potential route for outsourcing introspection, and doing it\nwith rigour. They can be trained to mimic human performance on perceptual\ntasks, and they make available the internal representations they use to do\nthis \u2013 the abstract spaces and coordinate frames in which the ineffable stuff\nof thought lives.\n\nThe recent publication of an unprecedentedly comprehensive and accurate \u2018odour\nmap\u2019 in the journal Science is a declaration of this new paradigm for smell.\nIn the same way that a map of the United States tells you that Buffalo is a\nbit closer to Detroit than to Boston, the odour map can tell you that the\nsmell of lily is closer to grape than it is to cabbage. That much may seem\nobvious, but the real magic comes from the fact that any arbitrary chemical\u2019s\nprecise location on the odour map can be calculated. From having only a few\nfacts on hand about a chemical, we can compute that it smells, say, 13 per\ncent closer to lily than to grape. By analogy, it would be something like\nhaving a formula that takes in information about an unknown city\u2019s population\nsize and soil composition, and spits out, correctly, the exact longitude and\nlatitude of Philadelphia.\n\nA map like this isn\u2019t just an accurate, laboriously assembled catalogue of\nrelative locations and perceptual similarities. It\u2019s something much more\npowerful: a set of derived rules for calculating which odour goes where.\nKnowing these rules, you can apply them not just to a small handful of\nchemicals, but to the entire world of odorous chemicals. You can see where the\nmost densely populated areas are, and where the \u2018state lines\u2019 are in the world\nof smells. This is a prospect that dazzles the world\u2019s perfumers and\ngourmands, and anyone else interested in the notoriously difficult and fickle\ntask of predicting how something will smell from its chemical properties.\n\nBut, even more than this, it also raises intriguing philosophical questions\nabout what our noses even think chemicals are, and what it means to measure\ntheir similarity. What is it about the world that our noses are \u2018mapping\u2019, in\nother words, when they put lily close to grape? Are they latching on to some\nsingle molecular property like a chemical\u2019s weight or size? Are they\ncalculating some kind of average fingerprint across a variety of such\nproperties? Or are they doing something different altogether, like locating\nmolecules in a space of common metabolic reactions?\n\nInterestingly, the last of these seems to be more the case. The perceptual\nyardstick our brains use to measure, organise and compare smells may\nultimately have less to do with what a chemist could discover from running a\nsample, and more to do with our deep relational histories with the world. Our\nnoses may turn out to be geometers not of the world\u2019s fixed and invariant\nproperties, but of its evolved and Earthly processes.\n\nThere is something poetic in the idea that, in order to crack the \u2018ancient\nsense\u2019, the crude, most scientifically incorrigible sense, we\u2019ve had to wait\nfor machine intelligence. This is in contrast with the other sensory\nmodalities, which began to share their secrets in the 17th century to wizard-\nlike seers bearing prisms and tuning forks.\n\nThe basic investigative template for \u2018geometrising\u2019 the senses was developed\nby Isaac Newton in the late 1600s. In his iconic experiments in optics,\nperformed in his Cambridge parlour, he uncovered a relationship between the\ncolour of light and its refrangibility \u2013 the degree to which it was bent by a\nsimple prism. The mere description of this fact would have ranked among the\nmost important scientific discoveries ever, but Newton went a step further,\nand fit his observations to a geometric model. Wrapping the seven primary\ncolours of the visible spectrum along the circumference of a circle (see\nfigure below), he produced the first \u2018chromaticity diagram\u2019 \u2013 a forerunner of\nthe colour wheels that we use to organise our thinking about colours and their\nmixtures.\n\nThe circle, for Newton, was not just some poetic flourish, but a commitment to\na very particular way of encoding colour\u2019s properties. It was an invitation to\npull out our protractors and rulers, and make calculations about how colours\nrelate to one another, and combine into mixtures. The components of a three-\npart mixture of fully saturated red, yellow and green, for example, would be\nrepresented as the three vertices of a triangle, with each vertex pinned on\nthe colour circle\u2019s circumference at the appropriately labelled point. The\ncentre of mass of this triangle is a single point in the circle\u2019s interior,\nand specifies the hue and saturation of the resultant mixture. In the case of\nmixing all seven primary colours to an equal degree, the centre of mass of the\nseven-pointed figure would be at the exact centre of the circle, which Newton\ndesignated as white.\n\nFigure 1: Isaac Newton\u2019s colour circle. Courtesy Wikipedia\n\nThere is of course a lot more to colour vision than what Newton described in\nhis Opticks (1704), and even his contemporaries noted flaws and shortcomings\nin his model. Nevertheless, his achievement still encapsulates the ambition of\nthe classical paradigm for sensory mapping. It seeks a mathematical\ncorrespondence between measurable and intrinsic properties of the natural\nworld (like light\u2019s refrangibility, which we now attribute to wavelength), and\nphenomenological qualities of mind (like colour, pitch and smell). There is\nsomething like a Pythagorean, the-world-is-mathematics mysticism to the\nendeavour.\n\nThe basic logic of pitch perception was also cracked similarly, with simple\ntools like tuning forks and spherical \u2018resonators\u2019 used to produce pure tones\nof a single frequency, from which rules about consonant pitch combination\ncould be derived. Pitch perception as a whole is fantastically complex but, in\nbroad strokes, our entire auditory system \u2013 from the tiny coiled-up cochlea of\nour inner ear, to the auditory portions of our sensory cortex \u2013 is built on\nthe basic principle of organising low, middle and high tones like the keys of\na piano. Striking neighbouring notes on a piano will also \u2018strike\u2019\nneighbouring neurons in your brain.\n\nSmell could never be parsed with a tool as fundamental as a tuning fork, and\nit never got its Newton, but it was not for a lack of people trying to follow\nhis lead as a geometer of the senses. The idea that there might exist a small\nnumber of \u2018odour primaries\u2019 that, by analogy to the prismatic colours,\norganised the world of smells has occurred to many, and the search for these\ncontinued in earnest well into the 20th century.\n\nAn early and influential classification scheme for odours by the famed\nbotanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, in 1756, included seven types:\naromatic, fragrant, ambrosial (musky), alliaceous (garlic), hircine (goaty),\nrepulsive, and nauseous. A contemporary of Linnaeus\u2019s, Albrecht von Haller,\nwas a bit stingier with his adjectives, and proposed a more austere scheme of\nthree basic odour types: sweet/ambrosiac, stench, and intermediate. One senses\nthat \u2018intermediate\u2019 is doing a lot of work here, but perhaps Haller adopted\nthe idea out of a conviction that all odours could be squeezed onto a line,\nand organised along a single axis. If these early odour taxonomies sound like\nthey have a rather ad-hoc feel to them, it\u2019s because they were the fruit of\nintrospection rather than careful data collection and measurement. Basically,\nthese guys were winging it.\n\nStill life with rotting fruit and nuts on a stone ledge by Abraham Mignon.\nCourtesy the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England\n\nIn fairness though, it wasn\u2019t (and honestly still isn\u2019t) really obvious how to\nnot wing it. With all due deference to one of history\u2019s geniuses, Newton had\nit easy. He could create essentially any visible colour at will by rotating a\nfew pieces of polished glass in a slit of sunlight. The stimulus just showed\nup, unasked for, when the sun rose, and in a form that was virtually readymade\nfor scientific interrogation. Odours are far less workable. If Newton had\nwanted to study odour, he would have had to start by grabbing some plants,\nmaybe some spoiled food, a crust of bread, a swab from his chamber pot if he\nwas feeling audacious and naughty. This doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018Newtonian\u2019.\nThe critical missing abstraction of \u2018the chemical compound\u2019 as the basic\nproperty-bearing token of smell was still far off, as were the techniques for\nsynthesising pure chemicals for testing purposes.\n\nHenning proposed an odour prism that organised smells into flowery, fruity,\nresinous, spicy, burnt, and foul\n\nBut even if these impediments could have been, miraculously, dealt with, there\nare additional, deeper complications that make the problem of smell harder\nthan the problem of colour. These boil down to the fact that chemicals aren\u2019t\nsmoothly graded variations of a single underlying phenomenon, like light is.\nRather, they\u2019re collections of the world\u2019s particulate stuff. And, ultimately,\nthere\u2019s just a lot of stuff and kinds of stuff out there, making it highly\nunlikely that some single chemical property \u2013 a molecular analogue of light\u2019s\nrefrangibility \u2013 will capture all the meaningful variability in the wild and\nwoolly world of chemicals. If there was a map from chemical features to odour\nqualities, it would have to involve something more complicated than a circle,\nwith more places \u2013 in fact, more dimensions \u2013 to distribute the chemicals.\n\nPerhaps something like a prism would do? If we take it as a loose geometric\nmetaphor, it seems to have some virtues over the circle, and is reaching in\nthe right direction. The prism has faces and facets on different planes, which\ncould be used for organising molecules according to diverse criteria like atom\ntype or chemical group. Its sharp points suggest areas of aggregation and\nseparation in chemical space that emphasise odour\u2019s discrete categories versus\nlight\u2019s continua.\n\nFor the German scholar of smell Hans Henning, this was more than just\nmetaphor. In his book Der Geruch (\u2018Smell\u2019) (1916), he proposed the idea of an\nabstract odour prism that organised the world of smells, with its six pointy\nvertices corresponding to what he considered to be the olfactory primaries:\nflowery, fruity, resinous, spicy, burnt, and foul. Even though there had been\nconsiderable developments that allowed for better quantification of how humans\nperceive odour, and better physical descriptions of odour stimuli, the field\nwas not ready for a proposal like Henning\u2019s. He was, by all accounts, one of\nthose scientists, described by the US neurobiologist Gordon Shepherd, \u2018whose\nimaginations cannot resist the temptation to put together an underconstrained\ntheory.\u2019 Also, Henning didn\u2019t do himself any favours in forcefully promoting\nhis work, and swiping at influential icons of the field like the Dutch\nscientist Hendrik Zwaardemaker, who had pioneered the use of olfactometers \u2013\nsteam-punky contraptions of valves and tubing that delivered controlled doses\nof odour. An early reviewer who otherwise spoke very positively of Henning\u2019s\nbook still felt compelled to refer to him, on the record, as \u2018a ruthless \u2013 in\nfact very uncivil \u2013 iconoclast.\u2019 Henning had bulldozed into the discussion a\nstrongly geometric conception of odour that was inspired and influential but,\nultimately, a house of cards.\n\nFigure 2: Hans Henning\u2019s odour prism: faulig (foul); fruchtig (fruity); blumig\n(flowery); brenzlich (burned); w\u00fcrzig (aromatic); harzig (resinous). Public\ndomain\n\nTo Henning\u2019s credit, despite his theory\u2019s shakiness, it was specific enough to\nbe testable, and the invitation was taken up by several, including the\npsychologist Malcolm Macdonald. In a comprehensive and devastating critique\nfrom 1922 that ended with a long section entitled \u2018Logical and Factual\nInadequacies of Henning\u2019s Theory\u2019, Macdonald investigated whether there was\nreally a prism behind things in the world of smells. Using judgments of\nrelative odour similarity as a proxy for distance (where \u2018similar smelling\u2019 =\n\u2018close\u2019), he performed critical perceptual reality-checks, like asking whether\nchemicals taken from opposite ends of the long prism diagonal smelled the\nleast similar. When you say that odour is a prism, you should expect that your\ncolleagues will pull out their calculators and check.\n\n\u2018Odour maps\u2019 gave a bird\u2019s eye view of how the human nose organises the world\nof chemicals\n\nWhat, exactly, did Henning get wrong? The question is a bit tongue-in-cheek,\nbecause it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s anything he got right. Still, if we want\nto be charitable, we might say he was seduced by a Lego-like view of molecules\nthat organic chemists were developing at the time. They saw a modular system\nin which organic molecules were assembled from a small library of so-called\nfunctional groups, resulting in motifs of a few atoms arranged in stereotyped\nways. In addition to haunting the dreams of hopeful premeds everywhere, these\nfunctional groups were thought to confer a molecule\u2019s specific properties, and\ndefine its basic reactivity. In Henning\u2019s view, it was perfectly sensible that\nthe same functional groups should also confer the primary odours he had\nidentified. Indeed, there is something enticing about the idea that the\nchemist\u2019s alphabet for organic molecules might also be the nose\u2019s alphabet for\nsmell. Ultimately, however, nature chose not to oblige. Few olfactory\nneuroscientists would claim that functional group is unimportant for\ndetermining odour quality, but it is clearly not the whole story.\n\nIn modern machine-learning parlance, we might say that Henning didn\u2019t have a\nrich enough feature set for representing smells. In committing to functional\ngroup as his basic smell alphabet, he implicitly adopted a specific idea of\nwhat a molecule fundamentally is, and discarded other potentially useful\nfeatures that could serve as the grist for odour prediction. A molecule, after\nall, isn\u2019t just a list of the Lego blocks from which it\u2019s made. It\u2019s also a\nspringy little thing that spins and vibrates, and chemists can ring it like a\ntiny molecular bell to listen for clues about its structure. It is also a list\nof descriptive attributes like \u2018strongly acidic\u2019, or \u2018non-polar\u2019 (having\nsymmetrically distributed charges). And it\u2019s also a lump of just so much\nstuff, maybe a bit bulkier here, and more stretched-out there.\n\nInstead of doing what Henning did, seizing on one characteristic in advance,\nthe best way forward is obviously an agnostic mindset where the data does the\ntalking. Instead of making fantastically wrong guesses about which chemical\nfeatures determined odour quality, why not winnow them down from a massive\nlist of all conceivable features?\n\nThat\u2019s the approach in studies pioneered by the US scholar Susan Schiffman and\nothers in the 1970s and \u201980s. The basic idea was to take a set of a few dozen\nodorous molecules and create a map summarising their relative perceptual\nsimilarities. Similar to how one could create a rough map of the US from a\ntable of all (of the many!) between-city distances, these \u2018odour maps\u2019 gave a\nbird\u2019s eye view of how the human nose organises the world of chemicals. With\nthis perceptual map in hand, the question then turned to chemistry: what is it\nabout molecules that assigns them to some particular portion of the perceptual\nmap? To get at this, Schiffman and others used a range of \u2018dimensionality\nreduction\u2019 techniques to see which chemical features \u2013 of the many hundreds\npotentially available \u2013 were most effective at recapitulating the map. These\napproaches generated significant interest for a time, but they too were unable\nto solve the problem and went dormant for decades \u2013 until the age of AI.\n\nIt was in 2017 that data sets were finally democratised enough for machine\nlearning to help scientists widen the search. An important milestone that year\nwas the DREAM challenge to see who might solve the odour map using AI.\nPublished in Science, the winning models were endorsed by the community as\npotential inroads \u2013 suggesting that handing our model-making to the custody of\nthe machines was the right intellectual move.\n\nThe best models, the so-called \u2018random forests\u2019, used AI to aggregate a host\nof models. The result could be baroque and inscrutable systems of rules for\nperforming prediction tasks. They can get the right answer, but it\u2019s often by\nfinding lengthy and complex rubrics along the lines of: \u2018If the molecular\nweight is > X, and the number of carbons is > Y, and the Moreau-Broto\nautocorrelation of lag 7 is < Z, and..., and..., then the molecule will smell\nlike rose.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s of course possible that odour categorisation is handled by similar\n\u2018brute\u2019 computations in the brain, but one is left with the nagging question:\nis that really how nature solved it? Not through the economy of Occam\u2019s razor\nbut in the thicket of Occam\u2019s forest? Where\u2019s the deep principle? The basic\norganising axes? The geometric insight? An important and often-asked question\nabout these kinds of \u2018data-driven\u2019 models is whether their success at\nprediction actually indicates understanding or, at least, the kind of\nunderstanding that science has historically prized and glorified through tidy\nparables of discovery like \u2018Newton and the prism\u2019.\n\nOne way forward is to give up on the idea of an organised odour space whose\ncurves and contours cleanly track some yet-to-be revealed chemical properties.\nAfter all, if \u2018stinky feet\u2019 and \u2018gourmet cheese\u2019 can be two valid descriptions\nof the same physical object, perhaps odour qualities are just too labile and\nindividual to really serve as the targets for prediction. Perhaps they reflect\nmore what we\u2019ve learned from living in the messy world than anything intrinsic\nto it, encoding our idiosyncratic experiences with, and predilections for,\nfeet and cheeses. Perhaps there is even something romantic and worth defending\nhere in the idea of a sense that, decades into the age of mass digitisation,\nremains stubbornly phantom-like and evanescent, unmeasurable, and\nfundamentally unavailable for capture by geometric concepts.\n\nScientists are training, tuning and tweaking million-parameter models that\ningest digitised molecule after digitised molecule\n\nOr we go in the opposite direction. Hit the problem with even more data and\nmore computing power. This was the big bet made by Osmo, a startup based in\nCambridge, Massachusetts that began several years ago as the digital olfaction\ngroup at Google Brain, and which now has several dozen neuroscientists,\nchemists and computer scientists on its staff.\n\nOsmo is the brainchild of Alex Wiltschko, a Harvard-trained neurobiologist who\nmade his mark in grad school developing pioneering computer-vision systems for\nanalysing animal behaviour. After growing up in small-town Texas, where, he\ndrily notes \u2018neither computers nor perfume were popular\u2019, his twin passions\nfor aromas and algorithms eventually landed him at the helm of a company that\nis \u2018giving computers a sense of smell\u2019.\n\nThis is about as far as one can get from Newton investigating the senses in\nhis lonely parlour, sketching models on vellum with a quill pen. Instead,\nthese scientists are collaborating to develop dense code repositories,\ntraining, tuning and tweaking million-parameter models that ingest digitised\nmolecule after digitised molecule under the mandate This one smells like rose,\nthis one smells like grass, figure out how to make that happen. The chemicals\nare not given to the model as lists of predetermined molecular properties that\nare served up to some homunculus chemist in the nose. Instead, they\u2019re\nrepresented as skeletal and stripped-down graphs that capture only basic\ninformation about atom identities and their connectivity. The model is not\ntrying to find what aspects of known chemistry are important for smell. It\u2019s\ntrying to discover whether chemical principles we haven\u2019t yet thought of may\nhold the key for smell.\n\nThe Osmo model is a type of graphical \u2018deep net\u2019 that\u2019s loosely inspired by\nthe successive processing stages of the brain\u2019s sensory systems. The analogy\nisn\u2019t exact, but it\u2019s similar to how your brain captures raw information from\nthe world and passes it downstream to units that will ultimately have\nsomething useful or actionable to say about the inputs: \u2018It\u2019s a cat!\u2019 or\n\u2018Smells awful!\u2019 The output units are the doers and the deciders whose\nperformance can be evaluated (\u2018Nope, it\u2019s actually a dog\u2019 or \u2018Yup, that\nchemical really does smell awful\u2019), but many important insights are found in\nthe intermediate, or \u2018hidden\u2019, network layers, too. These can be thought of as\na transformational space that squeezes and warps raw sensory inputs into\nsensory judgments. The connections between units that define these\ntransformations are learned gradually and incrementally by an AI system as it\ncontinually iterates and self-adjusts based on how well it mimics human\njudgments. By peeking at these intermediate layers, we can get the insights of\na latterday, AI-supercharged Newton of smell. They tell us how we might think\nabout the space that chemicals live in. Or at least, as our nose sees it.\n\nSo how do we get from the transformations within the Osmo net to a literal\ngeometry? The geometry at hand is not a circle, or a prism, or any kind of\nsimple archetypal shape. Instead, it\u2019s more like a world of craggy chemical\ncontinents, each demarcating a conspicuous aspect of human ecology, each\nseeming to invite a set of actions or appetites. There is, for example, a\ncontinent of \u2018fermentation\u2019, a \u2018green\u2019 continent, a land of the \u2018meaty and\nsavoury\u2019. The key notion is that, in this space, two chemicals are rendered as\nclose together and similar-smelling not because they necessarily share\nintrinsic structural features, but because they share ecological roles and\nhave a close and contingent relationship out in the wild, as it were.\n\nThe Newtonian story of colour space is about how human perception latches on\nto the world\u2019s universal and impersonal attributes (think about light\u2019s\nwavelength and refrangibility). But the developing story of smell is about how\nour noses have decoded the world as it manifests locally, relationally and\nidiosyncratically on our planet. Odour space, in other words, is framed in\nhuman-centred coordinates, reflecting our histories as foragers and hunters in\na world that blooms and withers, with matter that ripens and decays. It is a\ngeometry that invests matter with its meanings and possibilities for us.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just some loosely poetic space. Tapping the Osmo model, one can\ncompute distances and angles here, predict which chemical will smell exactly\nhalfway in-between musk and carvone, examine whether a collection of chemicals\nshould trace out a smooth or squiggly path in odour-perceptual space.\nMoreover, the Osmo model does this demonstrably better than other attempts,\nsuggesting that the way it\u2019s measuring distances between chemicals may point\nto a deep principle of odour processing.\n\nTo smell something is to understand the neighbourhood it lives in\n\nInterestingly, distances computed on the map correlate strongly with what has\nbeen termed \u2018metabolic distance\u2019 \u2013 roughly, how reachable one chemical is from\nanother through common metabolic pathways. If nature can easily move from\nchemical A to chemical B through a small number of fermentation reactions,\nsay, chances are your nose will find A and B to smell alike, even if they lack\nobvious structural similarities. The important corollary is that molecules\nwith striking structural similarities needn\u2019t smell alike (though, of course,\nthey often will). A and B might hypothetically differ by only one double bond,\nbut if it\u2019s a very expensive double bond to form or break, requiring a large\nnumber of synthesis steps and chemical pirouettes, then the compounds will\nsmell different to us. What the nose seems to know is not the static world of\nchemicals, but the movements that nature makes through it.\n\nA philosopher would say that your nose appears to be an empiricist \u2013 it\nclassifies and categorises chemicals on the basis of relationships that must\nbe learned from the world either over evolutionary timescales or over an\nindividual\u2019s lifetime. A mathematician, following up, would say that what is\nlearned is the abstract, high-dimensional manifold that tracks the world\u2019s\nchemical relationships \u2013 its partitioning into the branches, cycles and\npathways that shuttle around the world\u2019s carbon. To smell something is to\nlocate it on this manifold, to understand the neighbourhood it lives in.\n\nThese are still early days for theorising about the structure of odour space,\nbut several investigators have put forward the idea that the space is non-\nEuclidean, meaning that it\u2019s a far cry from the \u2018intuitive\u2019 geometry of\nsecondary school, where the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.\nInstead, odour space may have an intrinsic curvature to it (like a potato\nchip, according to one theorist), driven by the fact that distances in odour\nspace are defined less like the physical distance between two people, and more\nlike their social distance.\n\nAmazingly, Macdonald, the critic of Henning described above, had an intuition\nof this back in 1922, when he suggested modifications to the odour prism that\namounted to replacing it with a \u2018hollow hyper-solid with solid tetrahedrons as\nits sides\u2019. This is difficult to visualise but, basically, it is a higher-\ndimensional prism that gives odours more space in which they can distribute\nthemselves. \u2018There is no reason why mental continua should occur only under\nEuclidian [sic] limitations,\u2019 he noted.
