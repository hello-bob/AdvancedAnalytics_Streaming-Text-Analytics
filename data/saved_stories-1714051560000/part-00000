Longer hot\nseasons and less frequent frosts have meant it has become the fastest-\nspreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, and it is taking hold in\nEurope.\n\nThe Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), carries dengue fever and has\nbecome established in 13 European countries as of 2023: Italy, France, Spain,\nMalta, Monaco, San Marino, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Germany,\nAustria, Greece and Portugal.\n\nMap\n\nThe insect is thriving; nine out of the 10 most hospitable years for\ntransmission of the disease have occurred since 2000, and the number of dengue\ncases reported to the WHO has increased eightfold in the past two decades,\nfrom 500,000 in 2000 to more than 5m in 2019.\n\nLowe said climate breakdown would turbocharge this spread as droughts followed\nfloods: \u201cDroughts and floods linked to climate change can lead to greater\ntransmission of the virus, with stored water providing additional mosquito\nbreeding sites.\n\n\u201cLessons from previous outbreaks underscore the importance of assessing future\nvector-borne disease risks and preparing contingencies for future outbreaks.\u201d\n\nShe said that if the current trajectory of high carbon emissions and\npopulation growth continued, the number of people living in areas with\nmosquito-borne diseases would double to 4.7 billion by the end of the century.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

We must anticipate outbreaks and move to\nintervene early to prevent diseases from happening in the first place.\n\n\u201cEfforts need to focus on enhancing surveillance with early warning and\nresponse systems similar to those seen in other parts of the world, to more\neffectively target finite resources to the most at-risk areas to control and\nprevent disease outbreaks and save lives.\u201d\n\nClimate breakdown is also amplifying the threat from antimicrobial resistance,\na separate presentation at the conference will warn.\n\nProf Sabiha Essack, the head of the antimicrobial resistance unit at the\nUniversity of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, said climate breakdown was a\n\u201cthreat multiplier\u201d for antimicrobial resistance: \u201cClimate change compromises\nthe ecological and environmental integrity of living systems and enables\npathogens to increasingly cause disease. The impact on water systems, food-\nproducing animals and crops threatens global food supply.\n\n\u201cHuman activities associated with population growth and transport, together\nwith climate change, increase antibiotic resistance and the spread of\nwaterborne and vector-borne diseases of humans, animals and plants.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Dengue fever\n  * Europe\n  * Malaria\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
