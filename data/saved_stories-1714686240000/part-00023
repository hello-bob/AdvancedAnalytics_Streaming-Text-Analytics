Instead, the Autonomous Racing\nLeague broke barriers when it kicked off its first real-life competition at\nthe Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. However, the barriers being broken were\nthe ones bordering the circuit, as the event was plagued with random crashes\nand spins from the self-driving race cars.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nCan Americans get into motorcycle racing?

However, instead of\nhaving space for a driver in the cockpit, the A2RL cars has an array of\ncameras, sensors and computers to drive the car.\n\nA2RL RECAP\n\nWhen all that computer power hit the track, things didn\u2019t go super well. As\nthe Verge explains:\n\n> The first race of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) took place\n> on the Yas Marina Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 track today, and I\u2019m\n> pleased to report that a race both began and ended. But the event was not\n> without strife \u2014 far from it. During qualifying time trials, the driverless\n> Dallara Super Formula racers outfitted with cameras and software seemed to\n> struggle mightily to complete a full lap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of that full lap, the onboard computers are expected to find\nthe perfect racing line, monitor tire performance and even try to overtake one\nanother. That, at times, proved too much for some of the cars, with them\nspinning wildly on the straights, turning randomly into barriers and crashing\nin spectacular style. As the Race adds:\n\n> There were a couple of incidents: on one occasion a car turned straight into\n> the barriers at the inside of a corner; on another occasion one car rear-\n> ended another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all that drama, you\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting that teams had to set\ntimed laps around the Yas Marina F1 circuit, with the fastest outfit being\nPolimove in with 2:00.653, reports the Race.\n\nFor comparison, the F1 lap record around the circuit is 1:26.103, while F2\ncars can lap the track in 1:37.445. The closest driver-driven car around Yas\nMarina is the Gulf Radical Cup, which sees modified Radical racers compete\naround the track in lap times of around one minute 57 seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould you see this kind of racing take off?Photo: Waleed Zein/Anadolu (Getty\nImages)\n\nThe race itself then got underway, and was also hit with dramatic crashes and\nspins. As the Verge reports:\n\n> When it came time for the actual race, the lead racer, Polimove, spun out on\n> the fourth of eight laps. The second car, Tum, passed it safely, but shortly\n> after that, the event\u2019s officials threw up a yellow flag. And since these\n> are good AI drivers who obey the rules, the two behind Polimove stopped,\n> unwilling to pass the spun-out yellow car. Racers aren\u2019t supposed to pass\n> each other during a caution lap, you see.\n>\n> About an hour after the first lap of A2RL began, the AI racers completed\n> their eight-lap race. If you must know, Tum won.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in, it was certainly an interesting science experiment but maybe not the\ngreatest racing spectacle of all time. But what do you think? Is motorsport\nthe best way to train and trial autonomous driving systems, or is that better\nleft to untrained drivers on the crowded streets of America, as Tesla seems to\nthink.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared on Jalopnik.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
