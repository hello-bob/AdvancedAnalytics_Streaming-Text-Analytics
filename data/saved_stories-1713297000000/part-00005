But\nwhen it comes to sales-led B2B startups, we\u2019ve reverse engineered a method to\nincrease the odds of unlocking it. We\u2019ve worked with some of the world\u2019s most\niconic enterprise founders and distilled what they did in their first six\nmonths into a series of tactical sessions for taking a straighter path to PMF.\nToday, we\u2019re open sourcing the first session, which shares how we\u2019ve broken\nPMF down to an incredibly granular level in order to help more builders get\nthere faster.\n\nEven though finding product-market fit is the single most important objective\nany company must achieve, it\u2019s still a black box for founders \u2014 seemingly\nrequiring some mysterious combination of luck, market timing, and sheer grit.\n\nWhile much has been written on the topic, no one has broken down the inputs,\nleading indicators and tactical steps that could increase the odds of finding\nPMF. In our view, one of the key reasons this topic hasn\u2019t been successfully\n\u201cframework-ified\u201d is that most folks still talk about the concept in\ngeneralities.\n\nFish are jumping into the boat. Leads are falling on the floor. You\u2019re chasing\n\u2014 not pushing \u2014 a boulder. The product is being pulled out of your hands.\nYou\u2019ll know it when you see it. You can feel when it\u2019s not happening. These\ndescriptions lack the specificity that we see in other areas of company\nbuilding.\n\nAnother issue? Most resources target a wide range of builders \u2014 which results\nin watered-down advice that\u2019s more hand-wavy than tactical. Founders are left\nwith approaches that are neither replicable nor practical, ranging from\nunhelpful \u201cWe kind of just started going viral\u201d founding stories to one-size-\nfits-all frameworks that don\u2019t address the nuances of their specific business.\n\nWhile the hunt for PMF can be more of a dice game with poor odds for, say,\nconsumer apps, our experience has taught us that for sales-led B2B companies,\nyou can reduce the role of luck.\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ve developed that conviction: As a firm of former founders and\nstartup builders, we\u2019re coming up on our 20th year of investing in pre-\nproduct-market fit startups. Along with Square, Notion, Looker, and Verkada,\nwe\u2019ve backed hundreds of companies when they were just a couple of founders\nand an idea.\n\nDrawing on our own data and observations from more than 500 investments, we\u2019ve\nspent the last several years breaking down the decade-long project of building\na category-defining B2B company into more concrete steps \u2014 in hopes that we\ncould create this resource that we feel is missing from the ecosystem.\n\n### To put it even more plainly: Despite all the talk about product-market\nfit, it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was meaningfully putting the pieces together\nto help B2B founders increase their odds of finding it. We wanted to change\nthat.\n\nIn addition to distilling lessons from decades of our own experience, we\u2019ve\nlayered on hundreds of hours of research and interviewed dozens of founders\nwho\u2019ve gotten further on this journey than most, from both within and outside\nof our community. (If you\u2019re a regular reader of The Review, you may have\nnoticed that we\u2019ve started publishing some of these stories in our series\nPaths to PMF \u2014 focusing on the down-in-the-weeds details of how companies from\nVanta to Vercel took off.)\n\nAs the culmination of that work, today we\u2019re proud to unveil Product-Market\nFit Method, an intensive 14-week experience designed to help exceptional pre-\nseed founders build epic B2B SaaS companies. From proven tactics to detailed\nbenchmarks that help founders gauge progress, we\u2019ve mined the secrets that are\nburied in the best B2B builders\u2019 experiences to create a new methodology that\nhelps startups take a straighter path to PMF.\n\nThe program (which kicks off on May 29 and can be applied for here) consists\nof eight tactical sessions. We\u2019ll cover everything from validating your\nproduct insight and market, to approaching positioning, design partners, and\nproduct iteration, to learning the ropes of what we call \u201cdollar-driven\ndiscovery\u201d and founder-led sales.\n\nWhile this is currently a highly-curated program with a limited number of\nspots, our tradition here at First Round has been to open-source everything we\ncan to share what we\u2019ve learned with the broader startup ecosystem \u2014 whether\nit\u2019s a decade of advice on The Review or years spent building communities like\nAngel Track. In keeping with that spirit, we\u2019ve decided to publish the content\nof the first session in full, as a preview.\n\nNo commitment to applying. No email paywall (although of course, we\u2019d highly\nrecommend subscribing to The Review newsletter). No charge. And no equity\nrequired for the program either \u2014 our aim is to increase the odds that more\nfounders find product-market fit, whether they\u2019re backed by First Round or\nnot.\n\n### The deck may seem stacked, but we're on a mission to rebalance the odds in\nthe early founder's favor. We\u2019re firm believers that you don\u2019t have to go at\nit alone \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to make it all up as you go either.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a systematic approach to defining what product-market fit is and\nidentifying truly tactical steps for how to go about finding it. But to be\nvery clear, the first session that we\u2019re open-sourcing here is all about\nexploring the former, breaking down the elements of PMF so it\u2019s easier to\nunlock. The rest of the sessions in PMF Method tackle the latter in much\ngreater detail \u2014 with expert-led workshops, practical exercises and templates,\nactual customer introductions, and unique access to our network of established\nfounders and angel investors.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s dive in.\n\n## Levels of PMF\n\nINTRODUCING EXTREME PRODUCT-MARKET FIT\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious question: What is product-market fit? Here\u2019s our\nspecific definition of what founders are aiming for \u2014 and why it\u2019s a bit\ndifferent from what you may have seen before:\n\n### Extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product\nthat satisfies a critical need and \u2014 crucially \u2014 can be delivered repeatably\nand efficiently to each customer.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, the way most people have talked about product-market fit feels\ninsufficient. More specifically, there are certain nuances that we feel\nhaven't yet been adequately addressed:\n\n  * Product-market fit progresses in levels. It\u2019s not a binary state where you have it and you\u2019re golden, or you don\u2019t and you\u2019re not on the path. But it\u2019s also not a vague spectrum or fuzzy sliding scale, where you can\u2019t be sure where you\u2019re at.\n\n  * There are a few dimensions of PMF that are in tension with each other, requiring deliberate tradeoffs at each level. There isn\u2019t just one element to emphasize above all else. And importantly, there are different times in a company\u2019s lifespan where founders need to intentionally prioritize one over another.\n\n  * There isn\u2019t nearly enough emphasis on repeatability. As you move your way up through the different levels of product-market fit, what you\u2019re really unlocking is repeatability \u2014 across demand generation, product development, customer satisfaction and unit economics. A startup hasn\u2019t reached the upper levels of product-market fit until it has developed a fine-grained understanding of who the right customer is, how to land them, and how to deliver a product that (in most cases) isn\u2019t bespoke for each customer yet consistently solves a significant need. In a nutshell, you don\u2019t have to work as hard to find what we\u2019re calling your \u201cmarginal customer\u201d (more on that in the section below).\n\n### Repeatability is the holy grail on the hunt for product-market fit.\nWithout any patterns, it\u2019s nearly impossible to generate early momentum and\nplot a course forward.\n\nThat\u2019s why when we picture product-market fit, we see three distinct building\nblocks:\n\n  * Four Levels: Nascent, Developing, Strong, Extreme Product-Market Fit\n\n  * Three Dimensions: Satisfaction, Demand, Efficiency\n\n  * Levers: Change your persona, your problem, your promise, or your product (our version of the 4Ps) to make the work of finding, winning, serving and retaining your marginal customer easier.\n\nTo be clear, pieces of this approach may exist here or there in different\nframeworks \u2014 after all, all great ideas are built on what's come before. But\nour hope is that we're bringing things together and diving deeper into the\ndetails in a way that's unique and valuable \u2014 plus we\u2019ll take the added step\nof sharing how a company, Looker, made its way to product-market fit, sharing\nits actual data across the years. Let\u2019s dig into each one.\n\n####\n\nThe 4 Levels of Product-Market Fit\n\nWe\u2019ve identified four concrete levels of PMF, with what we\u2019re calling extreme\nproduct-market fit as the ultimate goal \u2014 what\u2019s required to build a\ngenerational company.\n\nRather than a blanket \u201cyou\u2019ll know it when you have it,\u201d we\u2019ve found that for\nenterprise companies there's a clear progression that companies go through\nthat is fairly predictable. Many founders have walked this path, and based on\nwhat we\u2019ve seen from the hundreds of early-stage startups we\u2019ve backed, this\njourney to extreme product-market fit usually takes anywhere from two to six\nyears.\n\n### Our contention is that product market fit is not binary \u2014 and it's not\nsomething that you get to overnight, despite what all of those \u201cwe just went\nviral\u201d founding stories may have you believe.\n\nOnce in a while, a company shoots up the ladder quickly, but that tends to be\nthe exception. Some companies move up the progression over a longer period of\ntime, while others skip ahead at different moments, leapfrogging from nascent\nto strong, for example. In our experience, there are a couple of specific\ntiming patterns here that companies fall into, whether it\u2019s making their way\nthrough Levels 1-3 quickly but stalling out and never quite hitting Level 4,\nor reaching Level 1 in record time but then getting trapped at Level 2.\n\nWe\u2019ll also note that the journey to PMF is a two-way ladder, meaning levels\naren\u2019t permanently unlocked \u2014 it is possible to regress. To use another\nmetaphor, think of it more as a dynamic equilibrium. Just like in chemistry,\nyour actions, your competitors\u2019 actions, customer expectations, technology\nshifts and other factors are all at a tentative equilibrium state. If one of\nthose elements changes \u2014 maybe your competitor makes a huge leap forward \u2014 and\nyou don\u2019t adjust, you may not be at the same level of PMF anymore. (For\nanother take on this topic, we recommend three-time founder Bob Moore\u2019s\nframework here.)\n\nWe\u2019ll get deep into the details of what progressing through each level feels\nlike further down, but staying at our current altitude, there\u2019s one high-level\nquestion you can ask here if you\u2019re unsure where your company stacks up: How\nhard is it to find and serve your next \u201cmarginal\u201d customer? As you move up, it\nbecomes easier and easier, and increasingly more repeatable.\n\nAt Levels 3 and 4, for example, demand swells. Contrast that with Levels 1 and\n2, where the search for the marginal customer feels more like a battle on\nseveral fronts \u2014 finding the right person, convincing them that your solution\nis what they need, converting them, and turning them into satisfied customers.\n\n####\n\nThe 3 Dimensions of Product-Market Fit\n\nWe like to break that definition down even further into what we call the three\ndimensions of product-market fit:\n\n  * Satisfaction: How happy are customers with the product? Are you able to effectively retain customers? How much do people need the product? It may seem like splitting hairs, but we\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve intentionally used \u201cneed\u201d and not \u201clove\u201d here \u2014 there are many companies that have extreme PMF without customer love. (Salesforce is an example of a product that\u2019s perhaps not beloved, but certainly satisfies a critical customer need.)\n\n  * Demand: Do you have the proverbial \u201clines out the door\u201d? How quickly and how much can you sell your product for?\n\n  * Efficiency: Can the product grow repeatably and scale effectively? In our view, this is the critical piece that many definitions of PMF gloss over \u2014 even though it\u2019s one of the most important things that a company must achieve. Here\u2019s how we like to break it down: efficiency in finding the customer (CAC), selling and closing the customer (sales conversion, magic number, CAC payback), in activating and supporting the customer (length of integration cycle, NRR), in producing the product (COGS, gross margin), and across the company as a whole (burn multiple).\n\nSome may bristle at that last one. Most other definitions of product-market\nfit overtly focus on satisfaction and demand, implying that efficiency takes\ncare of itself in the long run. But our belief is that while your business\nwon\u2019t be efficient from day one \u2014 and may in fact be intentionally inefficient\nwhile you work to figure things out at Level 1 \u2014 there is tremendous value in\nbuilding with an eye towards efficiency throughout your entire journey as a\nfounder.\n\nAs a thought exercise, say you open up a stand on the side of the road where\nanyone who lines up and gives you $1 gets $100 in return. By classic\ndefinitions, product-market fit would be off the charts. You'd have lines out\nthe door. Customers would be very satisfied. But it would be a mirage. And a\nparticularly dangerous one at that, given the risk that you\u2019ll lull yourself\ninto the false belief that you\u2019ve unlocked PMF.\n\n### When you\u2019re starting a marathon, it\u2019s helpful to know what the final mile\nneeds to look like \u2014 even if you don\u2019t alter your approach to mile 1. If you\nkeep efficiency in the back of your mind even at the earlier stages, you\u2019ll be\nable to stay intentional in the tradeoffs you\u2019re making as you build.\n\nOne final note here: These dimensions are actually highly intertwined \u2014 and\nrequire distinct tradeoffs in different scenarios. For example, you can take\non several initiatives to increase efficiency \u2014 spending less time doing\nunscalable things, automating and operationalizing more aspects of your\nbusiness \u2014 but in many instances, that harms the customer experience, reducing\nsatisfaction. (Of course, there are times where there\u2019s more harmony than\ndiscord \u2014 for example, shipping a critical product feature might improve all\nthree at once.)\n\n#### The First Round 4Ps: Levers to Get Unstuck on Your Path to Product-Market\nFit\n\nAs for how you can get unstuck and catapult your company to the next level,\nyou can experiment with pulling these four levers at various points along your\njourney (our spin on the classic 4Ps framework):\n\n  * The persona: Who would benefit most from your insight? Do you have a person in a specific type of role or function who faces a set of challenges in mind? In this context, the persona can be the buyer (CTO or CRO), the company type (e.g. Fortune 10,000 financial services) or both. As you look to make adjustments here, consider whether it\u2019s too narrow, too broad \u2014 or needs to be abandoned altogether. Example from Plaid: Consumers didn\u2019t need another budgeting app, but fintech apps needed the integrations the team had built on the back-end.\n\n  * The problem: Is this an urgent and important problem that your target persona has? It\u2019s the classic painkiller versus vitamin question. You\u2019re looking to solve a problem that is urgent and, if solved, will provide huge relief to your potential customers. If not, you may need to explore adjacent problems for your persona, or rethink your persona and problem entirely. Example from Lattice: Stayed focused on people leaders, but went from building a solution for OKRs to solving performance management.\n\n  * The promise: Are those customers interested in what you\u2019ll do to address that need \u2014 your unique value proposition? It\u2019s easy to confuse this for your actual product, but the promise is how you communicate the benefit your product will deliver. In our experience, this is the lever that is most overlooked. Example from Ironclad: Repositioned from an AI legal assistant (that promised to automate lawyers\u2019 tasks) to a Contract Lifecycle Management platform (that promised to help enterprise companies create and manage legal contracts end-to-end) in order to play in an existing category.\n\n  * The product: Will the product that you\u2019re building actually deliver on this promise? Are customers interested in this particular solution to their problem? Would they pay for it? Example from Alma: Pivoted during the pandemic from a community-based physical office concept for therapists, to giving providers a suite of digital tools to build thriving private practices.\n\nFor example, a startup might be stuck at developing PMF, but later find that\npivoting to a new buyer is the move that unlocks the next level. Or another\ncompany may have stumbled onto nascent PMF with resonant positioning, but then\ncan\u2019t ship the correct product that delivers on its promise.\n\nThese levers, of course, fall more into the camp of how to go about finding\nPMF, which is not the focus of this essay. (But in PMF Method, we have a full\nsession dedicated to each of these levers, filled with tactics, real-world\nexamples, and hands-on exercises to better guide you.)\n\n####\n\nWhat Extreme Product-Market Fit Looks Like in the Real World:\n\nTo bring this new concept of extreme product-market fit to life, let\u2019s walk\nthrough an example from Looker when it reached this Level 4 milestone as a\nSeries C company with a team of 235 at the end of 2016 \u2014 after five years of\nhard work progressing through Levels 1-3. (You\u2019ll notice how the curve starts\nto inflect right around this timeframe in the chart below, taken from the\ncompany\u2019s April 2018 board deck.)\n\nHere\u2019s how Looker checked each box on our list of the three dimensions at this\ntime:\n\n  * Demand: Went from 450 to nearly 800 customers in a year, growing revenue from $11.5M to $27M and increasing ACV to $57.7K.\n\n  * Satisfaction: Extremely happy customers, with 141% NRR, an 18 month-streak of net negative churn and renewals higher than plan.\n\n  * Efficient: The company had built an efficient model, with 77.6% gross margin.\n\nLooker\u2019s path is a great example of each dimension coming together to\ncontribute to extreme product-market fit (and we\u2019ll be sharing more of it in\nthe pages below). But just as there are success stories like these, in our\nexperience, the absence of one or more of these dimensions is also the biggest\nreason that startups fail.\n\n### We believe that if you think about PMF in these terms, you'll be more\nlikely to end up at strong or extreme levels of PMF than all the companies\nthat didn't make it \u2014 in part because you and your co-founders will have a\nshared framework to more precisely diagnose where you might be falling short.\n\nTo help your startup achieve that feat, we\u2019ll dive into each of these levels\nand unpack them with more detail. In the sections that follow, we\u2019ll walk you\nthrough what it feels like to be at each one, the most important thing to\nfocus on, and thought starters from fellow founders on what you might try to\nlevel up.\n\nIn addition to benchmarks based on data we\u2019ve gathered and insights from\nestablished B2B founders who are where you want to be, we\u2019ve also drawn from\nthe hundreds of companies we\u2019ve worked with to create composite case studies\nof fictitious startups that bring each level to life. We\u2019ll also return to our\nexample of how Looker actually progressed through every level and eventually\nreached extreme product-market fit.\n\n## Level 1\n\nNascent\n\nWATCH (7 MIN)\u2022JASON BOEHMIG ON IRONCLAD\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\nAt this stage, a founder\u2019s primary job is to find a problem worth solving for\nthree to five customers. And by problem we mean an issue that is urgent and\nimportant for them, where solving it would be immensely valuable for their\nbusiness. With that in sight, it\u2019s time to build a product that solves the\nproblem and delivers high satisfaction for those customers. You may need to\niterate across our 4Ps (persona, problem, promise, product) a few times to\nland on the right combination.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not the primary focus of Level 1, you should also be thinking\nabout demand here, exploring whether you\u2019ll be able to find enough customers\nwith that problem who will need your product. While efficiency isn't something\nto spend much time on yet, we\u2019d recommend trying to start constructing a\ncredible argument in your head about how the business could eventually scale\nefficiently.\n\nIn our experience, we\u2019ve found that a fairly high percentage of startups get\nstuck at Level 1 \u2014 and stay stuck for six, 12, or even 18 months. That's when\nwe\u2019ve seen founders get bogged down in \u201cthe grind.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the hallmark of this level is that it lacks repeatability \u2014\nthat\u2019s to be expected at Level 1. Finding the marginal customer is the\nopposite of easy. At this point, you\u2019re not entirely clear on what a customer\nneeds to look like in order to be the right fit for what you\u2019re building. And\neven when you land on a rough hypothesis, acquisition is usually unscalable.\nThen when you do get in front of a prospect, your messages don\u2019t always land \u2014\nsome customers immediately \u201cget it,\u201d while for others it doesn\u2019t resonate.\n\nEach customer\u2019s needs (and thus the solutions that you build) are slightly\ndifferent. Some come in asking for a slew of additional features and\nfunctionality to meet their requirements, while others see an immediate impact\neven with an early version of the product.\n\n####\n\nWhat is Feels Like\n\nAs we talked to sales-led B2B founders about how they navigated this first\nphase, unsurprisingly, several different paths emerged. Some grappled with\nfinding the right product, others struggled to identify the target user, still\nothers doubted the size of the market or even abandoned their original idea\nentirely.\n\nThe common thread was wasted cycles before they stumbled upon those first few\nsparks of traction \u2014 which were more in the vein of \u201caha moments\u201d or \u201cthis\nmight just work\u201d inklings, rather than hard metrics and the beginning of a\nhockey stick growth curve.\n\nHere are three specific examples from Ironclad, Verkada and Plaid on what that\nearly traction felt like (after a winding path to getting there):\n\n####\n\nIronclad: Unlocking a more specific product by visiting customers IRL\n\nIronclad is now a well-known digital contracting platform (last valued at\n$3.2B), but unpacking their journey to nascent product-market fit highlights\njust how much manual, non-scalable work you\u2019ll find at this level.\n\nAfter serving as outside counsel for startups, co-founder Jason Boehmig\nstarted tinkering with automating parts of his own practice with coding that\nhe had taught himself along the way. After realizing that there was a gap both\nin new solutions for lawyers and a team that understood how they actually used\nsoftware products, he decided to leave his law firm life behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild to think back to this now that we're in the AI assistant boom\nbecause the first version of Ironclad was an automated assistant for legal\npaperwork \u2014 but it was really me on the backend of an email address,\u201d Boehmig\nsays.\n\n\u201cWe started by doing everything from corporate filings to NDAs and everything\nin between. So if you were doing an NDA, you would CC admin@ironclad.ai and be\nlike, \u2018Hey, I'm doing an NDA with Joe Smith. Can you help us get it done?\u2019 And\nI would send a series of responses as the Ironclad AI such as, \u2018Hey, I need\nthe following information,\u2019 or \u2018Here's the template. I filled it in.\u2019 I later\nmet my co-founder, Cai, who was an amazing engineer, and he\u2019d watch me work as\nthe assistant and then would automate what could be automated away.\u201d\n\nBut it was spending time in person with their initial customers that helped\nnarrow their product\u2019s focus. \u201cI remember that we flew out the whole company \u2014\nwhich was four or five people at the time \u2014to Boulder to see a customer who\nhad a bunch of product feedback for us. We all just sat around and watched\nthem use the product,\u201d Boehmig says.\n\n\u201cThey had two monitors, one showing their email and on the other was Ironclad.\nThey were just doing their day-to-day routine, working on a legal team. And by\nobserving them and seeing how important these routine, repeatable transactions\nwere to their profession, we realized we had to go all in on these corporate\nlegal teams \u2014 particularly legal operations, which was a role that was just\ngetting defined back in 2015.\u201d\n\n> \"At Ironclad, the early \u2018aha moments\u2019 came from watching our customers use\n> the product. It enabled us to pick a niche audience that we could go after \u2014\n> legal operations \u2014 and the specific task they were doing \u2014 routine\n> transactions.\"\n\nJason Boehmig\u2022 Ironclad\n\nWATCH (7 MIN)\u2022FILIP KALISZAN ON VERKADA\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\n#### Verkada: Going unreasonably deep and moving fast to wow customers\n\nVerkada has six different physical security product lines today, but the\nfounders started back in 2016 with video security. Inspired by IoT devices in\nthe consumer space, they realized the enterprise equivalent of applying\nsoftware to video security was missing. When co-founder Filip Kaliszan thinks\nback to the nascent stage of their journey to PMF, the team\u2019s speed and\nwillingness to get in the field stand out.\n\n\u201cThe very first version looked very funny. It was a Raspberry Pi based camera.\nWe just hacked it together from different parts \u2014 the supply chain was\nAmazon.com, We built maybe 100 of these little cameras and we gave them to\nfriends and businesses we knew,\u201d says Kaliszan. \u201cThe whole idea was to just\nlearn what it takes to build the software and build out the solution. The\nprototype was just about learning if the technology would work and convincing\nourselves that there was a there there.\u201d\n\nWhat struck us about Verkada\u2019s approach here was how hands on it was \u2014 and how\nquickly they moved to extract those insights. \u201cFor the first few customers, we\njust did whatever it took to get the customer deployed as fast as possible and\nthen stayed close to that customer to learn what was working for them and what\nwasn\u2019t. That approach has been extremely informative in shaping everything we\nbuild in our products,\u201d he says.\n\nTake this example: \u201cWe were very aggressive with sending trial units. The\nmoment we had a positive signal from the customer, we would get them a camera.\nWe made sure that the process was seamless, fast, and easy from the very\nbeginning. If you talked to us today, 24 hours later you\u2019d have a nice box of\nkit to try it out,\u201d Kaliszan says.\n\n\u201cWe were also going on site and doing a lot of installs for customers. This is\nbefore we had a partner ecosystem, before we had installers who wanted to work\nwith us. I remember flying to L.A. to install cameras at the Beverly Hills\nEquinox, one of our early customers. The gym closed at midnight, and we had\nuntil 5:00 AM to get the cameras installed. So I'm buying some drills, getting\nup on a ladder and pulling cables myself. We were making sure whatever needed\nto get done got done so that the product worked.\u201d\n\nThat commitment paid off. \u201cWe spent two years building, so 2018 was our first\nyear of sales. In the first couple of months of that year, we got enough pull\nand demand on the camera front where it was that validation \u2018aha\u2019 moment,\u201d\nKaliszan says. \u201cWe sort of always thought the idea was cool, but that was that\nmoment that really crystallized that what we had built was beginning to work\nfor the customers.\u201d\n\n> \"When you have any signs of early demand pull, you have to follow it and\n> work as hard as it takes to just make it happen. \"\n\nFilip Kaliszan\u2022 Verkada\n\nWATCH (7 MIN)\u2022ZACH PERRET ON PLAID\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\n#### Plaid: Pivoting and building conviction in an unproven market\n\nBut even with early customer traction, it can still feel like a slog. Plaid is\nnow known as the pioneer of the \u201cinvisible plumbing\u201d fintech infrastructure\nthat powers everything from paying your friends back on Venmo, to making an\ninvestment on Robinhood, to buying Bitcoin on Coinbase. But the product\nactually started out as a consumer budgeting app.\n\n\u201cThe response of consumers was such that we pretty quickly realized we weren't\ngoing to be any good at building budgeting apps. We tried for a while. We\nbuilt six different versions of budgeting management, analyzing your spend\ntypes of applications and they didn't really ever get any traction,\u201d says co-\nfounder Zach Perret.\n\n\u201cOne day, a friend who was one of the early engineers at Venmo came to us and\nsaid, \u2018Hey, your consumer products are not so good, but I'd like to license\nthe backend that you've built, the way that you've integrated with the banks\nin order to get the data into your app.\u2019 It took awhile, but eventually we\ndecided to make this pivot and shift over to building the platform,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe then had five or seven people who said that they would probably use the\nproduct if we built it. We even had one who said they would pay us if we built\nit. And so it was pretty easy to find nascent product-market fit in that very\nearly stage once we landed on the right idea,\u201d says Perret.\n\n\u201cThe bigger challenge for Plaid was that the market didn't really exist. So\nwhile we had these five or seven companies that wanted us to build something,\nthe real challenge was market development. That was the reason that almost\nevery VC passed on investing in Plaid in the early stages. They said, \u2018You've\nbuilt an interesting product, it could be useful for some customers, but the\nmarket's not very big.\u2019\u201d\n\n> \"When I think back to the earliest stage of Plaid\u2019s product-market fit\n> journey, the challenge wasn't finding a product that people would buy. It\n> was creating a market around the product that we believed would be very\n> important for the future, but was yet to be proven.\"\n\nZach Perret\u2022 Plaid\n\n\u201cConvincing ourselves and everyone else that there was a real market here \u2014\nthat financial services space would eventually have startups in it \u2014 that was\nthe hardest thing we had to do in the earliest phase,\u201d says Perret.\n\n####\n\nWhat it Looks Like: A Case Study on Nascent Demand, Satisfaction, Efficiency\nin Action\n\nTo return to the very beginning of our example from Looker\u2019s actual\ntrajectory, the data platform startup spent roughly from August 2011 to March\n2013 in the nascent stage. \u201cWe waited almost a year to raise money, until we\nknew it was a venture business \u2014 not every startup is, and you don\u2019t want to\nget locked in. We were cranking along with customers and revenue. And it\nwasn\u2019t all nailed down, but we had figured out enough of how go-to-market\nmight work to know that it was workable,\u201d says Looker co-founder Lloyd Tabb.\n\nHere\u2019s how the business looked at the nascent stage: With that early glimmer\nof traction, Looker raised a $2 million seed round from First Round and\nPivotNorth in August 2012. By the end of Q1 of 2013, the 9-person team was at\n$357K in ARR with 15 customers. (Incidentally, five of Looker\u2019s first six\ncustomers were First Round companies.) Outside of warm intros, one tactic the\nteam found effective early on was customer events. \u201cWe started doing\n\u2018Look&Tell\u2019 customer events super early on compared to other startups. I\nremember sweating and dragging cases of beer down Market Street to get to an\nevent we were hosting \u2014 I think we probably had about eight attendees, but we\nkept at it and they paid off eventually,\u201d says Tabb\u2019s co-founder Ben\nPorterfield.\n\nBut to show an even more detailed snapshot of what \u201cgood\u201d looks like at this\nlevel, we present a case study on our first fictitious startup: Ledgerly, a\nplatform that uses LLMs to help accounting teams \u2014 complete with very detailed\nqualitative descriptions and metrics.\n\nThe Ledgerly team is pretty new, with just five full-time employees. They\nraised a $1.2 million pre-seed round earlier this year and they don't even\nknow what their burn multiple is \u2014 but that\u2019s appropriate, given how early\nthey are.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:\n\n  * Demand: They only have four customers, all of which they acquired through warm intros from their personal networks or from investors. They don't have an outbound sales machine yet. Three of those customers are paying $15K each, putting them at $45K ARR. (The fourth one is a design partner and isn\u2019t paying yet.) But what you don\u2019t see in these stats is that they actually had to connect with 46 different companies to land these four customers. That\u2019s fairly typical. In the early stages, you're going to talk to a ton of different prospects as you try to figure out the following: who are the customers that are right for you, and who are the customers with a problem that you can solve with a single product. The Ledgerly team doesn\u2019t have any renewals yet since they're so early that none of their customers have hit the one-year mark. They did have one design partner churn due to lack of fit, but they don't consider that regretted churn.\n\n  * Satisfaction: All of their customers are starting to use the product regularly, at least once a week. Two of them have onboarded multiple users internally. Ledgerly is getting good feedback from the three customers they\u2019ve asked, so they\u2019re starting to see signs of satisfaction, but it's early and anecdotal at this point.\n\n  * Efficiency: This is the area the team has paid the least attention to, which is appropriate given their stage. Customer onboarding feels too lengthy (currently at eight weeks) and it takes them a lot of time to find qualified leads for new customers (at least five meetings to just find one prospective \u2014 not even signed \u2014 customer). What\u2019s more is that customers are making a lot of special requests, which is a common feature of the nascent stage. Four customers making four different sets of requests is pulling the team in different directions, but that\u2019s not unusual, given that the team is still zeroing in on the shape of the product and their ideal customer.\n\n####\n\nBenchmarks:\n\nWhile the above hopefully gives you a sense of what nascent product-market fit\nfeels like, we\u2019ve also collected these benchmarks that indicate your company\nis at Level 1 so you can more closely compare your progress.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that repeatability is nowhere in sight \u2014 and that some of these\nmetrics that we would take very seriously for later-stage companies don't even\napply yet.\n\n  * Your team is less than 10 people.\n\n  * You\u2019re at the pre-seed or seed-stage.\n\n  * Demand source is mostly friends and network, some cold outreach.\n\n  * Sales conversions: 1 out of every 10-20 warm intros converts to a customer.\n\n  * 3-5 customers.\n\n  * $0-$500K ARR.\n\n  * No renewals yet (too early). No regretted churn (some non-regretted).\n\n  * You don\u2019t even know what your gross margin and burn multiple are (N/A for each).\n\n#### What Matters Most:\n\nBut in addition to knowing how they stack up, founders also need to focus on\nwhat matters most in terms of getting to the next level of product-market fit.\n\nTo reach Level 2, founders need to focus on satisfaction most. In the case of\nour fictitious startup, Ledgerly, in order to move the needle on satisfaction,\ntheir goal is to increase daily use and number of users at each company and\nstart sending NPS surveys as a regular part of customer interactions. But\ndon\u2019t focus solely on these satisfaction metrics here \u2014 staying outcome-\noriented is key. This simple rule of thumb is a great reminder: Are you moving\nthe business outcome you promised to move for your customer, and by how much?\n\nWith satisfaction front and center, demand is second at this stage. While you\ndon't need heaps of customers, you do need an inkling that if you make this\nsmall set of customers happy, eventually there will be that proverbial line\nout the door. For Ledgerly, this means setting a target of landing two or\nthree more customers in the next few months.\n\nEfficiency comes in last at this stage. We\u2019d recommend that you don't spend a\nton of time thinking about it at Level 1. For Ledgerly, its planned\noptimizations are in service of improving satisfaction and demand. Their goal\nis to trim customer onboarding down to four weeks and create a faster, more\nrepeatable sales process to improve conversion.\n\n### To reach developing product-market fit, you have to build something that\nat least a handful of customers really, really need. It solves a problem for\nthem. They can't live without it. And that requires earning a very high level\nof satisfaction first.\n\nWATCH (5 MIN)\u2022LLOYD TABB ON LOOKER\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\nSticking close to your customers early on is key to cultivating that\nsatisfaction. But there\u2019s an important distinction here. \u201cIf you're not giving\nthem value, they don't want to be near you,\u201d says Looker\u2019s Lloyd Tabb. \u201cHow\nmany surveys do you get as a customer yourself? I just went and had my car\nrepaired and I got a survey, which isn\u2019t going to give me any value. You need\nto bring them something of value \u2014 otherwise you\u2019re just annoying them,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cFor Looker, the search for product-market fit was about figuring out how to\ndeliver the value. For our first four customers, I had different ways of\ndelivering what I was building, from pure consulting to a standalone product.\nBut the problem with just giving someone the software was that they didn't get\nas much value out of it. I realized I needed to be teaching how to do data as\nwell as delivering a product,\u201d says Tabb.\n\n\u201cWhat worked best was part product, part service. We used the demo as a chance\nto build a proof of concept, so we didn\u2019t have a dummy sales pitch version \u2014\nwe always asked the prospect for an actual dataset to play with. Then it was a\nvery quick forward-deploy. We would come in and do a free trial where we would\nset up the software and teach them how to use it. And then we would watch for\nengagement,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly when there was engagement would we close the deal.\nWe had almost no early churn because we only sold customers who got the value\nout of it.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, inefficiency is expected at Level 1. \u201cThe downside was that\nsome of the trials ran a really long time. If we didn\u2019t see that momentum, I\u2019d\ngo back in and be more hands-on to make sure they understood how we could\nanswer all of their data questions,\u201d he says.\n\n> \"I had no qualms about sinking a disproportionate amount of resources here.\n> In SaaS, focusing on making your customer successful is a retention\n> strategy, not a cost center. Complicated products require education. If\n> you're selling a complicated product, you are in the education business \u2014 so\n> the support you provide is everything.\"\n\nLloyd Tabb\u2022 Looker\n\n#### Yellow Flags to Watch Out for:\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell in the moment if you\u2019re mistaking a more tepid response for\nearly traction, or if an extra dose of founder grit will unlock the\nbreakthrough your business needs. Knowing when to keep forging ahead versus\nwhen to pull back and pivot is one of the trickiest parts of Level 1.\n\nPersona founder Rick Song had a thoughtful take here on why startups tend to\nget bogged down at Level 1. \u201cThe biggest challenge for a lot of early-stage\nstartups is that they lie to themselves about customer satisfaction. It\u2019s a\ncommon trap at this stage to have customers who like but don't love or need\nyour product. I use the relationship analogy a lot internally at Persona:\nknowing when someone likes but doesn\u2019t love something is very, very difficult\nbut if you\u2019ve ever been in the friend zone, you know that answer,\u201d he says.\n\nTo figure out if he was being \u201cfriend-zoned\u201d in the early years of Persona,\nSong sought to build trusted relationships with a handful of his early\ncustomers. He talked to them all the time, texted them, grabbed coffee with\nthem, and made sure he was very candid and self-deprecating to get that real\nfeedback. Song would ask questions like the ones below over and over until he\ngot strong enough answers that convinced him they were on the right track:\n\n  * If a competitor came along and charged you 50% less than what I'm charging you, would you switch?\n\n  * If we increase the price, is that something that you're going to have a lot of pushback around?\n\n  * Is Persona a game changer for your company? If Persona went away, how big a deal would that be for you?\n\n### You can\u2019t be in the friend zone forever \u2014 eventually you have to ask the\nhard question to find out if they desperately need what you\u2019re building.\n\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, here are the yellow flags we recommend watching out\nfor:\n\n  * Customers respond that if your product disappeared tomorrow, they wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.\n\n  * Usage is low and not growing over a period of six months.\n\n  * You have a handful of happy customers, but the most important feature is actually different for each of them \u2014 in other words, you're customizing the product too much to make each customer happy. (That puts you in consulting business territory.)\n\n  * It feels incredibly hard to find new customers.\n\n  * The sales cycles take too long, and if your champion quits the company, then the deal just falls apart.\n\n  * Design partners are hesitant about converting to paid or customers just don't seem willing to pay the ACV you\u2019re after.\n\nWATCH (8 MIN)\u2022JACK ALTMAN ON LATTICE\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\nWith the original idea for Lattice, Jack Altman felt this firsthand. \u201cThe\nfirst thing we built was an OKR software tool. We had seen at our last company\nthat quarterly OKR planning was a painful process for companies. We validated\nthat there was a real problem by talking to a bunch of other companies about\nhow hard it is. The execs get mad at each other. The employees are like, why\nare we doing this? Nobody adheres. But while it was in fact a real problem, we\nnever built software that truly solved that problem,\u201d says Altman.\n\n\u201cThere were two things that made that clear. One, it was really hard to get\npeople to actually pull out their credit cards and pay us. And so a lot of\nCEOs and people leaders were saying, \u2018We'd really like this. We want to manage\nour OKRs better. We're doing this in spreadsheets currently, it's not great.\nCan we try it? Can we test it for a quarter? Can we do a monthly thing? Can\nyou give me a login so I can poke around?\u2019 But when we tried to get them to\npay, it was very challenging,\u201d says Altman.\n\n\u201cThe second issue was that once we did get people into the product \u2014 even\nentire teams where the whole company would do an OKR planning cycle in Lattice\n\u2014 the next quarter didn't come easily. They were like, \u2018Ugh, we\u2019ve got to do\nthis.\u2019 And then by the third quarter they were like, \u2018This is not happening\nnaturally.\u2019 For the employees, the retention was just not there. So both sides\nwere not strong enough,\u201d he says.\n\nHis advice on how to get unstuck rang true for us: \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck, your only\nway out of the nascent stage is big changes, not small changes. A lot of\npeople hang out in nascent and make small changes for years, and that's just a\nliteral waste of everybody's time and resources. Moving up levels of product-\nmarket fit or getting unstuck requires more than just incremental steps or\ngiving it more time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou need to remind people of that reality so they don't stay in these loops\nfor too long and instead say, \u2018Alright, we're going to just move on and\nwholesale try a new thing.\u2019 After nine or 10 months of working on OKRs, we got\nto a place where there wasn\u2019t any line we could draw between what was\nhappening and a business that was going to make any sense for the next round\nof funding by the time we ran out of money. So we ended up needing to pivot a\ncouple of times before we landed on the thing that really worked, which was\nperformance management.\u201d\n\n> \"More often than not, if you're working on something that is not getting\n> great traction, you\u2019re probably not a 10% adjustment away \u2014 you\u2019re probably\n> a 200% adjustment away.\"\n\nJACK ALTMAN\u2022 LATTICE\n\nFor more on how to make the right adjustments that will get you unstuck and\nout of nascent product-market fit, apply to join PMF Method.\n\n## Level 2:\n\nDeveloping\n\nBy Level 2, you\u2019ve ticked through some of the classic milestones, such as\nbuilding something 20 or so customers need, or getting to your first $1M in\nARR. And while you haven\u2019t totally figured it all out, there\u2019s also much more\nrepeatability in your customers\u2019 needs, the messaging that resonates, and the\nproduct solution you\u2019re delivering.\n\nDeveloping PMF is when you're starting to see glimmering signs that the\nmarginal customer is more within reach \u2014 but it by no means feels easy yet.\nThis is one of the reasons why Level 2 is one of the two levels that the\nmajority of companies get stuck on. Think of it as reaching \"lite\" product-\nmarket fit.\n\n####\n\nWhat it Feels Like:\n\nAfter Lattice\u2019s product pivot, the difference in traction immediately felt\nclear to co-founder Jack Altman. \u201cIt was very obvious what market pull looked\nlike then. We had people paying us annual upfront contracts without ever\ntouching a real product, just on our design mocks \u2014 which couldn't be more\ndifferent than the experience we\u2019d been having with OKRs,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere were leads coming organically from all over the place. People were\ntelling their friends about us. People would say, \u2018I'm kicking off this\nperformance cycle in two weeks and I need this feature. You don't have it yet.\nCan we schedule time tomorrow to talk it through so we can help you build it?\u2019\nI think we booked twice as much revenue in the first month on that product\nthan we had booked in the previous year on the last one.\u201d\n\n> \"Once you've got something that's going to work, it's going to work even in\n> the face of a pretty undeveloped, incomplete, semi-broken product, which we\n> certainly had at this stage.\"\n\nJack Altman\u2022 Lattice\n\n#### What it Looks Like: A Case Study on Developing Demand, Satisfaction,\nEfficiency in Action\n\nLet\u2019s rewind the clock back to when Looker was at Level 2, roughly from March\n2013 to Nov 2014. The startup emerged from stealth in March 2013 with a\n34-person team and 20 customers, many of which were also in the First Round\ncommunity. For co-founder Lloyd Tabb, this was the stage when he knew they\nwere onto something. \u201cBy the time we had 20 customers, I knew it was going to\nbe big,\u201d he says.\n\nBy August 2013, they\u2019d made enough progress to raise a $16M Series A round. By\nNovember 2013, they\u2019d hit the coveted $1M in ARR milestone and grown to over\n40 customers. New channels outside of warm intros were proving successful,\nfrom outbound and sales prospecting with two SDRs, to the potential of partner\nmarketing with AWS Redshift and Snowplow. At this stage, that repeatability\nwas starting to peek through. The Looker team had a better sense of who they\nwere selling to (see their ICP from their Jan 2014 board deck below), having\nrecently closed clients like Thumbtack, The RealReal, and Gilt. They were\ninterested in going upmarket, and although they landed their first enterprise\nlogos in April 2014 (eBay\u2019s Venmo and NYTimes\u2019 Baseline), for the most part,\nenterprise remained \u201celusive\u201d at this level.\n\nBy July 2013, there was an average of 1600+ hours spent per month by customers\nin Looker. As the team put it in a board update, they continued to see amazing\nsatisfaction by \u201cmaintaining insane referenceability and minimal churn (3).\u201d\nAs for efficiency, by the end of 2013, their CAC was $54,000 with a payback\nperiod of 19 months. At this time they noted that from first meeting to close\nranged from two to seven months, with three months as the average.\nCustomizations were still cropping up, as white-labeling and self-service had\nunique requirements. While sales process improvements were underway, their\nunique forward-deploy trials were still taking 30-40 hours, which needed to be\nbrought down.\n\nAs for our example company at this level, meet Hire Hero, a fictional\ninterviewing platform that uses AI to help teams hire better. They've got 18\nfull-time employees. They recently raised a $10M Series A round, and they've\ngot a burn multiple of 4.2x. That's not where it should be \u2014 but at least they\nknow what it is.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:\n\n  * Demand: They\u2019re at $1.2M in ARR and they have 22 customers. Their average sales cycle is 32 days, but that's an improvement over 47 days. One promising sign is that their most recent five customers are paying twice as much as what their early customers paid. Increasing ACV is a very strong sign on the demand side.\n\n  * Satisfaction: This team has been around long enough to actually track renewals, and four of their customers have renewed. After selling for more than 12 months, four customers have churned, which isn\u2019t ideal, but two of those were non-regretted. This is pretty typical. As the product direction changes, you\u2019ll often realize that certain early customers are just not the right fit anymore. Additionally, weekly active usage is going up. The team is running classic NPS style surveys and getting roughly half nines and tens.\n\n  * Efficiency: At this stage, it\u2019s still not a focus, but at least they know they're at 65% gross margin. Software companies should be shooting for 75-80%+ when it comes to gross margin, so something to improve on. Their onboarding has gotten 15% faster. And very critically, fewer customizations are being asked for by each of their customers, meaning they\u2019re able to sell the same product to now 22 customers.\n\n####\n\nBenchmarks:\n\nThese are the benchmarks that we would consider very typical of Level 2:\n\n  * Team size: Up to 20 people.\n\n  * You're either a Seed or Series A company.\n\n  * Demand source: Early signs of a scalable channel that doesn't depend on warm intros from your VCs or your friends.\n\n  * Without a warm intro, your first call to closed-won percentage is approaching 10%.\n\n  * \u201cMagic Number\u201d (ARR/CAC) in the .5 to .75 range.\n\n  * 5-25 customers.\n\n  * $500K to $5M ARR.\n\n  * Some renewals, 10-20% regretted churn, NRR at least 100%.\n\n  * Not less than 50% gross margin.\n\n  * Not worse than 5X burn multiple.\n\nWATCH (8 MIN)\u2022CHRISTINA CACIOPPO ON VANTA\u2019S PATH TO PMF\n\n#### What Matters Most:\n\nTo level up, your priority needs to shift to demand. Here\u2019s why: We\u2019ve seen\ntrue grind-it-out founders muscle their way to 20 customers through sheer\nwillpower and effort. But you can\u2019t will your way to 100 or 200 customers \u2014\nthe satisfaction and demand for the product are starting to do the work for\nyou.\n\nStartups need to find a way to effectively drive demand. But in addition to\nworking on lengthening those lines out the door, you still have to maintain\nthe satisfaction bar that you\u2019ve reached. And while efficiency still isn't the\nprimary concern, it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll need to pay more and more\nattention to. Now is the time to start thinking about if this is going to be\nan efficient business, and starting to do the work to make it one.\n\nThe most helpful levers for pushing on demand are typically fine-tuning your\nproduct positioning and finding scalable channels, whether that\u2019s outbound\nsales or SEO, paid marketing, or referrals.\n\nFor Vanta\u2019s Christina Cacioppo, the latter is an area she would revisit with a\ntime machine. \u201cThere was this kind of tight call-and-response where someone in\na First Round community Slack channel or a YC forum would say \u2018SOC 2\u2019 and\nsomeone else would say \u2018Vanta,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe were so proud of ourselves with\nour brilliant guerilla marketing or whatever we thought we were doing, but I\nthink what actually happened is we really underinvested in learning how to\nexplain what we were building, outside of \u2018Vanta gets you SOC 2, and that's\nimportant for your business.\u2019 In retrospect, we should have started on some of\nthat earlier versus coasting on what was initially great word of mouth.\u201d\n\n> \"Word of mouth is wonderful, but in B2B you also need to scale ways you're\n> acquiring customers. You need to start on that work earlier than you think.\n> \"\n\nChristina Cacioppo\u2022 Vanta\n\n#### Yellow Flags to Watch Out for:\n\nIf you\u2019re still unsure of whether your business can be classified as\ndeveloping product-market fit, here are the yellow flags we recommend watching\nout for:\n\n  * Current customers are happy, but you're having trouble opening the floodgates.\n\n  * Regretted churn is greater than 20%. People bought your product and paid for it and just weren't happy \u2014 and one out of five of them is churning off.\n\n  * Starting to get concerned about your burn multiple, e.g. you're burning $200K per month and only bringing in $20K net new ARR per month, which would put you at a less-than-stellar burn multiple of 10. (You\u2019re aiming for as close to 1 as possible, or even below 1). But you feel like if you stop spending the money you're just going to stop growing.\n\n  * Sales cycle is taking too long and you lose deals late in the funnel. You start to lose to competitors. And you're just not feeling the urgency from potential customers.\n\n  * You're struggling to hit the price point that you want. This is often a signal that customers see your product as a nice-to-have versus a must-have. You often hear \u201cwe don't have the budget,\u201d or \u201cit's not the right time for us,\u201d in conversations.\n\nFor more on how to get your sales machine firing on all cylinders to propel\nyour company out of developing product-market fit, apply to join PMF Method.\n\n## Level 3:\n\nStrong\n\nIn our experience, the majority of startups never get to this level. If you\nget to strong product-market fit, your company has the potential to be very\nvaluable.\n\nThe big difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is that the demand floodgates\nhave opened. There\u2019s even more repeatability. Demand is coming inbound. People\nhave heard of you. The company feels like it\u2019s humming. You know who your\ncustomer is with much more specificity (for example, the head of security at a\ncompany with 250-1000 employees who\u2019s already using a Palo Alto Networks\nproduct). Your costs to acquire them are still a little high, but you\u2019ve found\nthat (most of the time) you can engage them with a clear and consistent\nmessage that resonates. You\u2019re able to deploy a solution with little\ncustomization that delivers a ton of value to the customer.\n\n####\n\nWhat it Feels Like:\n\nThis is the stage where most of those PMF analogies you\u2019ve previously heard\nstart to make sense \u2014 you start to really feel the effects of product-market\nfit.\n\nDavid Hsu from Retool put it this way: \u201cWe talked to someone who said that\nfinding product-market fit was so visceral that you immediately felt it \u2014 like\na geyser exploding. And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years.\nAt Retool every early customer we got, whether that was number four or number\n14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt more like\nrolling the stone uphill. If you stop pushing, it'll start rolling back on you\nimmediately. That's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR \u2014 that's\nwhen the boulder went down the other side, and we had to chase it to keep up.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Jack Altman from Lattice describes it: \u201cThe biggest shift was in\nthe ease of getting leads. I remember thinking, \u2018I don't even know where these\nleads are coming from.\u2019 And more just kept showing up every month,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Verkada\u2019s Filip Kaliszan, the feeling was similar. \u201cAfter our first year\nof sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up\nwith production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to\nhappen in the span of the next 12-18 months in order to deliver on everything\nthat customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. That in\nitself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey.\u201d\n\nFor Plaid\u2019s Zach Perret, this level felt noticeably different. \u201c2016 to 2017\nis when we knew we had very strong product-market fit, and that was mostly\nbecause we just saw rapid growth of many of our customers,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis is around when Robinhood and Coinbase started to take off, and we saw it\nin our numbers. One of the benefits of being a platform company is that you're\nable to install really early with a customer and then grow over time, and that\nscale is really, really lovely,\u201d says Perret. \u201cFor example, we eventually\nbranded a portion of the user signup flow within Venmo and other apps. And\nthat minor branding actually drove a lot of demand for our product because\npeople would see it and they would say, \u2018Hey, this is a new financial services\nexperience. I should call Plaid because Plaid helped build this one.\u2019 And so\nwe had this nice cycle of our customers doing well, driving demand back to us\nand then so on and so forth every time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut keep in mind, by this point it had been four or four and a half years\nsince we started the company. And so a lot of the early journey was based on\nfaith and belief that this market would exist, on good early signals that were\npartially real and partially manufactured by the work that we'd done.\u201d\n\n####\n\nWhat it Looks Like: A Case Study on Strong Demand, Satisfaction, Efficiency in\nAction\n\nLet\u2019s start again by tracing back to when Looker fit into Level 3, roughly\nfrom November 2014 to December 2015. By November 2014, the team had passed the\n$5M ARR mark. CEO Frank Bien put it best in an email update to us: \u201cThe\ngeneral feeling is that lots of companies can make it to $1 or 2M ARR, but\nhitting 5M shows you\u2019ve built something very real and sustainable. Also\nimpressive is how quickly we hit this point.\u201d\n\nIn February 2015, the company raised a $30M Series B round, noting they\u2019d\ngrown to 110 employees, and increased revenue by 400%. At this point, Looker\nhad 250 customers, adding new customers such as Uber, Instacart, Plaid, and\nEtsy. Continuing to open up new channels, the team closed its first reseller\ndeal in Q2 2015 and started expanding into Europe, opening their first EMEA\noffice in London. The team was focused on growing organic inbound through PR,\ncommunity, content & thought leadership, in addition to scaling their\npartnerships. For example, early in 2015 bringing on Segment and Snowflake was\na big win, as was being selected as one of three top launch partners for\nMicrosoft SQL DW & Azure. However, a main focus during this period was fine-\ntuning their positioning, to better appeal both to data experts and general\nbusiness users.\n\nCustomers experienced as much as 80-90% user adoption across an employee base.\nBy the end of 2015, 97% of customers were accessing Looker at least once per\nday, CAC had decreased to $45,300 and payback period was down to 17.5 months.\nGross margin improved from 62.5% in 2014 to 72.6% in 2015. The sales trial\nmodel continued to get more efficient, and the company had a 70% trial to win\nrate. But perhaps what was most impressive as efficiency shifted into the\nforefront was their planning accuracy: In seven years, the Looker team never\nmissed a bookings plan, achieving a rare 28-quarter streak of pure execution.\n\nFor our Level 3 case study, let\u2019s introduce GuardDog, a fictional incident\nmanagement tool to help security teams seamlessly identify and address\nsecurity issues. They have 64 full-time employees and are planning to raise a\n$25M Series B. Their burn multiple is now 2.1, which is getting respectable.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:\n\n  * Demand: GuardDog has 88 customers. With $10M in ARR and 14% sales conversion, they've got inbound and outbound channels that are working, and awareness is starting to spread. They're starting to see word of mouth traction, which is very common at this level. (Think: \u201cOh, you're a startup? You need a security solution, you should choose Guard Dog, that's what all the startups are using.\u201d) They're projecting 3x growth in ARR over the next 12 months.\n\n  * Satisfaction: They're at 108% net revenue retention, and 8% regretted churn per year. Quarterly user engagement has gone from 5.5 average users per customer up to nine.\n\n  * Efficiency: GuardDog is getting into the respectable zone here. The team did a ton of work both on the infrastructure side, and the services side to improve to a 71% gross margin. Onboarding has gotten faster by 60%.\n\n####\n\nBenchmarks:\n\n  * Team size: 30-100 people.\n\n  * Stage: Series A/B/C company.\n\n  * Demand source: 1+ scalable channels (you\u2019ve cracked marketing and sales). >10% of your inbound is coming from referrals/WoM.\n\n  * 1st call to closed won 10-15%.\n\n  * Magic number >.75, CAC payback <18 months.\n\n  * 25-100 customers.\n\n  * $5-25M ARR.\n\n  * >110% NRR.\n\n  * <10% regretted churn.\n\n  * 60-70%+ gross margin.\n\n  * Burn multiple in 1-3X range.\n\n#### What Matters Most:\n\nTo reach the next level, now is the time that you have to get serious about\nefficient economics. CAC payback, LTV to CAC ratio \u2014 these are all the metrics\nthat really start to matter. (Specifically you want to see a CAC payback\nperiod under 18 months, and LTV/CAC greater than three.)\n\nIf you eventually want to be valued well in the public markets (which you\u2019re\nprobably starting to think about at Level 3), you have to become more\nefficient \u2014 while still sustaining satisfaction and demand. Focusing on\nrefining your GTM motion (inside sales, outside sales, layering on channel\npartnerships) and figuring out broad awareness building is key here.\n\n### The difference between strong and extreme product-market fit is that you\nhave to successfully stay on that growth curve and make the whole operation\nmore efficient at the same time. It\u2019s a highwire act.\n\n#### Yellow Flags to Watch Out for:\n\nWhat we\u2019ve observed most at Level 3 is that this is when real competitors\nstart to emerge \u2014 before you may have been flying a bit under the radar. But\nnow your product is clearly working and other startups or mid- to late-stage\ncompanies have started to notice that.\n\nMany startups also get caught in the \u201cspend money to grow\u201d trap, caught\nbetween investor pressures to lower your burn multiple, but also your own\nfears that you\u2019ll stop growing if you go below 2-3X.\n\nHere are the yellow flags we recommend watching out for:\n\n  * You\u2019ve got a little bit of a leaky bucket: NRR below 90%, regretted churn greater than 10%.\n\n  * Referrals and word of mouth have started to plateau.\n\n  * Growth is slowing down. You grew 3X each of the prior two years, but you're struggling to hit 2X this year.\n\n  * You found your first scalable channel, but it's gotten saturated, and you're struggling to find a new channel.\n\nAt Looker, Frank Bien\u2019s mandate was to figure out how to scale Lloyd Tabb's\nearly sales approach into a model-driven company. Here\u2019s how he thought about\nbalancing these competing interests: \u201cAfter crunching the numbers, we saw that\nby the time we had 2,000 customers, we could be doing $100 million dollars in\nARR, and on the path to going public. That was the model from 2013 on. And as\na side note, we were pretty spot on \u2014 we were at 1,700 customers, so we\nactually did a little better than we predicted,\u201d says Bien.\n\n\u201cLloyd\u2019s early sales intuition was right, you had to do a robust proof of\nconcept. It reminded me of Palantir\u2019s forward-deployed engineers. We wanted to\ndo an inside sales motion of that. Those salespeople had to be supported by an\nembedded technical person. But you have to know your model backwards and\nforwards to make a bet like that,\u201d says Bien. \u201cWe knew the margins on the\ncosts we were sinking into pre-sales support made sense. But if we had been\nunsure whether it was going to take 2,000 customers or 100,000 customers to\nreach the $100 million run rate, that would have been an incredibly risky move\n\u2014 we very easily could have been lighting our VC dollars on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople often create models to drive valuation, they\u2019re always trying to do 2x\nthe plan. In my opinion, that\u2019s the most dangerous, company-killing move you\ncan make. We\u2019ve never adjusted our plan based on any external investor\ninfluence or a valuation we were trying to achieve in an upcoming round. We\ndid, of course, put our foot down on the pedal from time to time, but it was\nonly when we saw opportunity in the business,\u201d says Bien. \u201cFor example, when\nwe first started trying to expand into enterprise, we were testing the waters.\nOnce it started working, we invested more in our enterprise go-to-market\nefforts and bumped up our targets.\u201d\n\nBien notes that when it comes to setting your plan, you want to maximize\ngrowth, but you also want it to still feel like a win. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to throw\nthe plan numbers up much higher, and think that if you put the rabbit a little\nbit farther in front of the dog, it\u2019ll run much faster. But that\u2019s not how it\nworks. It mostly just leaves you feeling like you\u2019re treading water, which\nover the long run, actually slows you down,\u201d he says. \u201cWe set our numbers\naccording to our model, and we were ambitious, but not crazy \u2014 and in the end\nwe got there faster.\u201d\n\n> \"When it comes to setting your targets for the quarter, don\u2019t stray too far\n> from your model. Go faster where you can go faster, but don\u2019t take a blunt\n> force approach that makes your team feel like they\u2019re drowning.\"\n\nFrank Bien\u2022 Looker\n\nFor more on how to build a more efficient GTM motion that pushes you past\nstrong product-market fit, apply to join PMF Method.\n\n## Level 4:\n\nExtreme\n\nFinally, Level 4: extreme product-market fit, which should be the goal of\nevery startup.\n\nIf you\u2019re at this stage, repeatability shines through in your ability to win\nover customers that are in your crisply defined target persona \u2014 it doesn\u2019t\nmean you have a 100% conversion rate, but there\u2019s tremendous consistency.\n\nThis is also often where a company\u2019s brand often begins to inflect. With more\nwidespread recognition, you may be on the cusp of becoming the \u201cKleenex\u201d of\nyour category \u2014 making it dramatically easier to capture the marginal\ncustomer. (In the startup context, think of Vanta being synonymous with SOC 2,\nfor example.)\n\nBut a founder\u2019s quest for growth never really ends, so the journey here isn\u2019t\nover \u2014 the challenge becomes finding product-market fit over and over again as\nyou go multi-product. You feel your organization is ready for the new\nchallenge of expanding your TAM and launching a new bet outside your core\nproduct.\n\n####\n\nWhat it Feels Like:\n\nWhen building wholesale marketplace Faire (last valued at $12.6B), Max Rhodes\nremembers struggling with the question of when to expand. \u201cWe'd heard horror\nstories from other companies that tried too early. But we got good advice that\nyou shouldn\u2019t expand until you feel like you're pedaling at half speed, until\nyou as the CEO are comfortable with all the progress that is being made in\nyour core market,\u201d says Rhodes.\n\n\u201cWe made a pretty explicit choice to really focus on nailing things in our\ncore market. It wasn\u2019t until late 2019, so three years in, that we decided we\nwere ready to go international and to go after apparel \u2014 we made the decision\nto do both simultaneously,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere were a few boxes that I felt like we'd checked. One, we had the growth\nmodel figured out. I felt comfortable that growth was predictable and that we\nwere just going to keep growing in the U.S., and that we built a big enough\nlead on domestic competition that we didn't need to figure out new things to\naccelerate our growth. We were more in optimization mode than really needing\ndeep innovation,\u201d says Rhodes.\n\n\u201cSecond, we also had a leadership team in place for all the key functions.\nThat felt stable. And I no longer felt like I was having to put out fires all\nday every day because this person was going to quit, or this problem popped up\nthat we didn't know the answer to. My involvement in the day-to-day operations\nof all the functions no longer felt necessary. It felt like things were mostly\nworking,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd then the third thing is we had our unit economics figured out. I was no\nlonger worried that we would run out of money if we kept growing. We had good\npayback periods. We were historically a very low margin business. We were\nnegative contribution margin for the first two and a half years, but we'd\nfinally cracked the code on getting to positive contribution. And so it felt\nlike the systemic risks to the business, whether it was competition, hurting\nour growth, capital risk, or people execution issues, were in a solid place.\u201d\n\n> \"Earlier in company building, you\u2019re going uphill on a bike and pedaling as\n> hard as you can. When it comes time to expand your TAM, you're looking for\n> that feeling where you\u2019re not going downhill, but you\u2019re on a flat road and\n> there isn't as much resistance. You can pedal a bit and let momentum carry\n> you forward.\"\n\nMax Rhodes\u2022 Faire\n\n#### What it Looks Like: A Case Study on Extreme Demand, Satisfaction,\nEfficiency in Action\n\nOur example company for this level is called Metriq, a fictional intelligence\nplatform that delivers self-service analytics and reports so teams can make\ndecisions faster. They're at 186 employees and they just raised a $75 million\nSeries C. Their burn multiple is looking very good at .87 \u2014 last month they\nbrought in $2M of net-new ARR, and only burned $1.73M.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:\n\n  * Demand: They've got 262 customers. They're almost at $30M in ARR. Sales conversion is 24%. Their ACV is $112K. They grew ARR 3x over the prior 12 months, and are going to hit 2x over the next 12 months. What\u2019s more is that they can actually project the next 12 months of revenue growth with a fairly high degree of confidence.\n\n  * Satisfaction: Their customers are using the platform regularly and without prompting \u2014 the product is that important to them. They're at 123% NRR, and their regretted churn is only 6%. 13% of their inbound leads are just coming from customer referrals. The team gets two to three positive customer emails per week, completely unsolicited.\n\n  * Efficiency: The sales, onboarding, and customer success teams are running smoothly. They've got repeatable playbooks. Gross margin is up to 86% and they\u2019re at an 11 month CAC payback.\n\n####\n\nBenchmarks:\n\nHere are the benchmarks for a company that has extreme product-market fit:\n\n  * Team size: 100+ people.\n\n  * Company is at Series C or beyond.\n\n  * Demand Source: 2+ scalable demand channels.\n\n  * 1st call to closed won >15%.\n\n  * Magic number >1, CAC payback <12 months.\n\n  * 100+ customers.\n\n  * $25M+ ARR.\n\n  * >120% NRR.\n\n  * <10% churn.\n\n  * 80+% gross margin.\n\n  * Burn multiple 0-1X.\n\n#### What Matters Most:\n\nWhether it\u2019s Salesforce, Stripe, or Datadog, all the legendary enterprise\ncompanies have managed to enter multiple markets with multiple products and\nreach extreme PMF time and time again in new customer segments.\n\n### If you want your company to compound value, you\u2019re not done with growth in\nyear six or seven, or just because you\u2019ve reached a certain size. Growing over\na long period of time is actually the act of finding extreme PMF over and over\nagain. The very best companies are forever focused on expanding TAM and re-\nfinding PMF in new markets.\n\nIn our experience, most founders struggle with the timing, and start thinking\nabout expanding TAM too late. When you\u2019re focused on getting the core business\nto fire on all cylinders, it\u2019s hard to split your time. Atlassian stands out\nas an example to take inspiration from here \u2014 the company pursued this work\nmuch earlier than most.\n\n\u201cWe created our second product, Confluence, in Atlassian\u2019s second year, which\nis really unusual \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve got a breakout product like Jira\nthat\u2019s growing really nicely. Conventional company-building wisdom would say\nnot to do it \u2014 there\u2019s still a ton of work you need to do on the first\nproduct, and it will fragment your focus once you start working on a second\nthing, which could be a death sentence for a young company,\u201d says Jay Simons.\n\nBut not only did Confluence become a cornerstone of Atlassian\u2019s product suite,\nSimons also spots plenty of less-tangible upsides. \u201cWe began to build this\nmuscle around cross-merchandising, cross-selling, and upselling. How do you\nthink about pricing and packaging around multiple things? How do you do\nproduct planning and prioritization and budgeting and staffing? At a really\nearly age at Atlassian, we began to wire our brain to think about all of those\nthings that companies need to do as they get bigger,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder as you get bigger too, because the product you add actually needs\nto be bigger. For a company like Atlassian that has individual products that\nare hundreds of millions of ARR, a new thing that you add has got to grow\npretty quickly, and it\u2019s got to have a big market it can grow into,\u201d he says.\n\nTiming aside, the other hurdle is tackling the question of which path to take\nonce you hit that inflection point of needing to grow your TAM. We like this\nframework from Persona founder Rick Song:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve reached extreme product-market fit and are ready to attempt to do\nit all over again, you can effectively expand your TAM \u2014 which is how you\ncompound revenue \u2014 by remixing one (and eventually all) of three components:\nyour product, your market or your buyer.\n\nThat could look like:\n\n  1. Creating new product use cases by adding new features and functionality.\n\n  2. Creating a net-new product that you sell in the same market to the same buyer.\n\n  3. Taking the same product and expanding into a different market (whether that\u2019s a different sector or moving upmarket/downmarket).\n\n  4. Selling the same product in the same market to a different buyer.\n\nOver time, you will likely need to expand all of these. Let\u2019s return to\nAtlassian. For simplicity\u2019s sake, say Act I was JIRA (a single product) sold\nto an engineering leader (buyer) at companies between 10 to 100 people in size\n(market segment). You can change any of those three elements \u2014 but in most\ncases, it\u2019s best to do this serially.\n\nIn our Atlassian example, say Act II was taking the same product and selling\nit to security leaders to manage all the security tickets (new buyer, same\nmarket segment). Say Act III was introducing Confluence (a new internal wiki\nproduct), in many cases sold to the same buyers and market segment.\n\nOr consider how Salesforce sells into healthcare, financial services, and\ngovernment. The product use case is relatively similar, the buyer may be\ndifferent or the same, but the market segment is very different. Other times,\nthe buyer remains relatively consistent but the product use cases change. In\nits most simplistic form, Amazon\u2019s AWS has hundreds of use cases and SKUs sold\ninto the same (or a similar) buyer.\n\nAs you can see, there are countless combinations to explore. But in our\nexperience, when most founders think about building concentric circles around\ntheir core business, too often they concentrate on selling a new product use\ncase into an existing buyer. It seems like a lower lift, in the sense that you\nalready have the customer. And sometimes that's the correct thing to do \u2014\nSquare expanding into lending is a great example \u2014 but if that\u2019s the only path\nyou pursue, there will be a ceiling on your TAM.\n\nWhat\u2019s crucial is that for each one of these new bets, you need to get to\nstrong and extreme product-market fit. In some cases, the journey is much\nshorter, given the work your company has already put into understanding a\ncustomer or developing a market. But in other cases, this requires starting at\nthe very bottom of the ladder, moving through the levels of product-market fit\nall over again. In other words, a company might have extreme product-market\nfit with one product, buyer and segment, and perhaps only nascent product-\nmarket fit for another product with the same buyer and segment. That is the\njourney of building compounding revenue over years and then decades.\n\n### It\u2019s like you\u2019re assembling a layer cake over many many years. You\u2019re\nadding on new features, new products, new customers, new market segments \u2014\ntrying to stack your way to a multi-billion dollar valuation without knocking\nthe whole thing over. That\u2019s been the recipe for every fantastic B2B company.\n\nThat journey of climbing your way to extreme product-market fit only to have\nto move through the levels once more is certainly daunting \u2014 particularly when\nyou remember how tough those early days without traction were. \u201cAs much as I\nnow joke about Vanta\u2019s early days and how confused we were with all of our\ndifferent startup ideas, the truth is that period is really rough,\u201d says\nChristina Cacioppo.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, you can romanticize a founder\u2019s life and think, \u2018The\nworld's your oyster. You can build whatever you want. You're going to start a\ncompany, it'll be great. You get to decide everything.\u2019 And that's all true,\nbut in the day-to-day, it's more like, \u2018What am I doing? Does anyone care?\nWill anyone ever care?\u2019 There\u2019s so much in the early days where you can't tell\nif you\u2019re doing it wrong. Having a group of other people going through a\nsimilar experience to talk about that with and normalize some of the\nuncertainty is really, really helpful. It can help you figure out if it\u2019s an\nidea that you\u2019re pulled toward because you\u2019re just looking for something in\nall of the uncertainty, or if it\u2019s actually viable.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve purpose-built PMF Method to solve those challenges.
