Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and\nrevenue, fueled by a surprise decline in same-store sales.\n\nThe coffee chain also slashed its forecast for its fiscal 2024 earnings and\nrevenue, predicting that its cafes would keep underperforming for several\nquarters.\n\nShares of the company fell 12% in extended trading.\n\n\u201cIn a highly challenged environment, this quarter\u2019s results do not reflect the\npower of our brand, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead,\u201d CEO Laxman\nNarasimhan said in a statement. \u201cIt did not meet our expectations, but we\nunderstand the specific challenges and opportunities immediately in front of\nus.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s same-store sales fell 4% as traffic to its cafes declined 6% in\nthe quarter. Wall Street was anticipating same-store sales growth of 1%,\naccording to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nAcross all regions, Starbucks reported shrinking same-store sales and falling\ntraffic.\n\nIn the U.S., same-store sales decreased 3% as traffic sank 7%. This marks the\nsecond quarter that the company\u2019s home market has struggled. Last quarter,\nexecutives blamed sluggish sales on boycotts targeting the company due to\n\u201cmisperceptions\u201d of its stance on Israel.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 international segment reported same-store sales declines of 6% as\nboth average ticket and transactions dropped. In China, Starbucks\u2019 second-\nlargest market, same-store sales plunged 11%, fueled by an 8% decline in\naverage ticket.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, many customers have been more exacting about where and\nhow they choose to spend their money,\u201d Narasimhan told analysts on the\ncompany\u2019s conference call.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting,\nbased on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n  * Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 79 cents expected\n  * Revenue: $8.56 billion vs. $9.13 billion expected\n\nThe coffee giant reported fiscal second-quarter net income attributable to the\ncompany of $772.4 million, or 68 cents per share, down from $908.3 million, or\n79 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales dropped nearly 2% to $8.56 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Starbucks now expects revenue growth in the low single\ndigits, down from its prior forecast of 7% to 10%. The company also revised\nits projections for global and U.S. same-store sales growth to a range of low\nsingle digits to flat from its previous forecast of 4% to 6%. Same-store sales\nin China are expected to decline by single digits, down from the prior outlook\nof a single-digit increase.\n\nStarbucks now also expects earnings per share growth in a range of flat to low\nsingle digits. It previously forecast its earnings would climb 15% to 20% in\nfiscal 2024.\n\nThe company forecasts that sales will start improving in the fiscal fourth\nquarter.\n\n## Waning sales\n\nStarbucks\u2019 most dedicated customers have stayed loyal and been using discounts\noffered via the company\u2019s mobile app, executives said. But coffee drinkers who\nvisit only occasionally have been buying Starbucks\u2019 macchiatos and cold brew\nless often, executives said; Narasimhan said those customers want more variety\nfrom their coffee.\n\nStarbucks is planning to offer a version of its app that allows customers to\norder without being a loyalty member in order to attract these occasional\ncustomers to visit more frequently.\n\nNarasimhan said Starbucks is also exploring how to meet overnight demand, from\n5 p.m. to 5 a.m. The company conducted a pilot test, which Narasimhan said\ndoubled business.\n\nHe also said the chain\u2019s lavender drinks were one of its most successful\nlaunches.\n\n\u201cBuilding off that success, we are aggressively pursuing options to build a $2\nbillion business over the next five years,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, PepsiCo and other companies have said this quarter that low-income\nconsumers have pulled back their spending and are looking for deals.\n\n\u201cWhile it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance\nand sharpened our focus with a comprehensive roadmap of well thought out\nactions making the path forward clear,\u201d CFO Rachel Ruggeri said in a\nstatement.\n\nNarasimhan also said that the company now expects supply-chain cost savings of\n$4 billion over the next four years, revising its prior forecast of $3 billion\nover three years.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Tuesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Live Nation, Boeing, Coinbase, Amazon & more\n  * Dividend stocks are poised to outperform, says Bank of America.
