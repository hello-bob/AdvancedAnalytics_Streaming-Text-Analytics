Synthetic forms can be produced far quicker,\nbut they typically still require some intense squishing for up to several\nweeks.\n\nA new method based on a mix of liquid metals can pop out an artificial diamond\nin a matter of minutes, without the need for a giant squeeze.\n\nWhile high temperatures were still required, in the region of 1,025\u00b0C or\n1,877\u00b0F, a continuous diamond film was formed in 150 minutes, and at 1 atm (or\nstandard atmosphere unit). That's the equivalent of the pressure we feel at\nsea level, and tens of thousands of times less than the pressure normally\nrequired.\n\nThe team behind the innovative approach, led by researchers from the Institute\nfor Basic Science in South Korea, is confident that the process can be scaled\nup to make a significant difference in the production of synthetic diamonds.\n\nScanning electron micrograph of a diamond film grown in liquid metal. (Gong et\nal., Nature, 2024)\n\nDissolving carbon into liquid metal for the manufacture of diamond isn't\nentirely new. General Electric developed a process half a century ago using\nmolten iron sulfide, for example.\n\nBut these processes still required pressures of 5\u20136 gigapascals and a diamond\n'seed' for the carbon to cling to.\n\n\"We discovered a method to grow diamonds at 1 atm pressure and under a\nmoderate temperature by using a liquid metal alloy,\" write the researchers in\ntheir published paper.\n\nThe reduction in pressure was achieved using a carefully mixed blend of liquid\nmetals: gallium, iron, nickel, and silicon. A custom-made vacuum system was\nbuilt inside a graphite casing to very rapidly heat and then cool the metal\nwhile it was exposed to a combination of methane and hydrogen.\n\nThese conditions cause carbon atoms from the methane to spread into the melted\nmetal, acting as seeds for the diamonds. After just 15 minutes, small\nfragments of diamond crystals extruded from the liquid metal just beneath the\nsurface, while two-and-a-half hours of exposure produced a continuous diamond\nfilm.\n\nThough the concentration of carbon forming the crystals decreased at a depth\nof just a few hundred nanometers, the researchers expect the process can be\nimproved with a few tweaks.\n\n\"We suggest that straightforward modifications could enable growing diamond\nover a very large area by using a larger surface or interface, by configuring\nheating elements to achieve a much larger potential growth region and by\ndistributing carbon to the diamond growth region in some new ways,\" write the\nresearchers.\n\nThose modifications are going to take time, and research into this process is\nstill at its very early stages, but the authors of the new study think that it\nhas plenty of potential \u2013 and that other liquid metals could be incorporated\nto get similar or even better results.\n\nThe process currently used to create most synthetic diamonds \u2013 used for a wide\nvariety of industrial processes, electronics, and even quantum computers \u2013\ntakes several days and needs a lot more pressure. If this new technique\nfulfills its potential, making diamonds is going to become a lot faster and a\nlot easier.\n\n\"The general approach of using liquid metals could accelerate and advance the\ngrowth of diamonds on a variety of surfaces, and perhaps facilitate the growth\nof diamond on small diamond (seed) particles,\" write the researchers.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature.\n\nTrending News\n\nIt's Official: Scientists Finally Confirmed What's Inside The Moon Space2 days\nago\n\nFor The First Time, Scientists Showed Structural, Brain-Wide Changes During\nMenstruation Health4 days ago\n\nAI Detects Mysterious Detail Hidden in Famous Raphael Masterpiece Humans6 days\nago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
