At launch,\nit ranked as the 20th fastest supercomputer on the Top500.org list. The system\nwas originally slated to be replaced after five years, but then the COVID-19\npandemic struck, severely disrupting supply chains. Cheyenne was called upon\nto serve an additional two years\u2014maintained and supported by a dedicated staff\nof about 20 NWSC engineers\u2014until the necessary parts were available to build\nits successor.\n\nCheyenne was procured as an SGI ICE XA cluster\u2014HPE purchased SGI prior shortly\nbefore the system was installed\u2014with 4,032 nodes, each with two 18-core,\n2.3-GHz Intel Xeon E5-2697v4 \"Broadwell\" processors, for a total of 145,152\ncores. Cheyenne nodes had two memory sizes: 3,164 nodes had 64 GB and 864 had\n128 GB. The nodes were connected by a Mellanox EDR InfiniBand interconnect in\na 9-D enhanced hypercube topology. The system used the SuSE Linux operating\nsystem and the Altair PBS Pro scheduler. Accompanying the compute hardware,\nCheyenne also included a 40-PB storage resource based on DDN hardware and IBM\nSpectrumScale file system.\n\nCheyenne continued to improve on the power efficiency of NCAR's large-scale\nsystems. With a peak power consumption of 1.75 MW, Cheyenne consumed only 25%\nmore power than its predecessor, Yellowstone, while delivering twice the\nsustained computing performance on the typical NCAR workload.\n\nIn its lifetime, Cheyenne delivered over 7 billion core-hours, served over\n4,400 users, and supported nearly 1,300 NSF awards. It played a key role in\neducation, supporting more than 80 university courses and training events.\nNearly 1,000 projects were awarded for early-career graduate students and\npostdocs. Perhaps most tellingly, Cheyenne-powered research generated over\n4,500 peer-review publications, dissertations and theses, and other works.\n\nResearchers used Cheyenne to run increasingly detailed models simulating\ncomplex processes and how they might unfold in the future. Scientists also\nharnessed its computing power to run multiple simulations, or ensembles, to\nquantify a given event\u2019s probability\u2014providing needed intelligence for policy\nand resource planning.\n\nExamples of transformative research with Cheyenne include:\n\n  * Extremely high-resolution global simulations of the atmosphere. Researchers highlighted an underappreciated type of rapid intensification of hurricanes to help forecasters better anticipate such weather events.\n  * Insight into the impacts of wildfire emissions on air quality and climate. One study shows that smoke from massive Australian bushfires in 2019-20 helped generate a rare multi-year La Ni\u00f1a event. A separate study shows that increasingly large and intense wildfires in the Pacific Northwest have altered the seasonal pattern of air pollution across North America.\n  * New modeling approaches with large datasets. The Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE), with a staggering 24,800 simulated years of climate information, helps identify the event types most predictable as far as a decade in advance.\n\n\u201cCheyenne was a special machine that has certainly earned its retirement,\u201d\nsaid NSF NCAR Director Everette Joseph.\n\nPrevious Page\n\nGeyser & Caldera\n\nBack to Top\n\nNext Page\n\nCDC 3600\n\n### NCAR\n\n  * NCAR Homepage\n  * ACOM | Atmospheric Chemistry Observations & Modeling\n  * CGD | Climate & Global Dynamics\n  * CISL | Computational & Information Systems\n  * EdEC | Education, Engagement & Early-Career Development\n  * EOL | Earth Observing Laboratory\n  * HAO | High Altitude Observatory\n  * MMM | Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorology\n  * RAL | Research Applications Laboratory\n\n### UCAR\n\n  * UCAR Homepage\n  * Community Programs\n  * Diversity & Inclusion\n  * Education & Training\n  * For Staff\n  * Government Relations & External Engagement\n  * Member Institutions\n  * Tech Transfer & Engagement\n  * University Collaboration\n\n### Subscribe to NCAR|UCAR News\n\n#### Follow NCAR|UCAR\n\n\u00a9 2024 UCAR\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies\n  * Accessibility\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Copyright Issues\n  * Sponsored by U.S. NSF\n  * Report Ethics Concern\n  * Staff Login\n\nPostal Address: P.O.
