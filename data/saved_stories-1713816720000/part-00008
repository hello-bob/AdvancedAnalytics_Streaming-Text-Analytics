Since then, recognition of the\nholiday has expanded to more than 190 countries who have added Earth Day to\ntheir calendar.\n\nThe holiday is both a grim reminder of the work that must be done and a\ncelebration of the progress that has been made when it comes to climate change\nefforts. It's also been the catalyst for actions including the creation of\ninternational climate agreements and environmental agencies.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme is Planet vs. Plastics, which calls on government leaders,\nbusinesses, and everyday people to reduce plastic production by 60% by 2040.\nIt is also calling for the full elimination of single use plastics by the end\nof this decade.\n\n\u201cThe word environment means what surrounds you. In the case of plastics we\nhave become the product itself\u2014it flows through our blood stream, adheres to\nour internal organs, and carries with it heavy metals known to cause cancer\nand disease,\u201d said Kathleen Rogers, President of earthday.org. \u201cThe Planet vs.\nPlastics campaign is a call to arms, a demand that we act now to end the\nscourge of plastics and safeguard the health of every living being upon our\nplanet.\u201d\n\nHere are 10 interesting facts about Earth Day.\n\n## Earth Day was created by a senator\n\nGaylord Nelson, a Democratic senator from Wisconsin, was growing increasingly\nconcerned over the state of the U.S. environment in the 1960s. After a massive\noil spill in Santa Barbara, Calif. in January 1969, he had the idea to launch\na nationwide, environmentally-focused teach-in on college campuses, drawing\ninspiration from the anti-war movements against the Vietnam War occurring on\ncampuses around the country. Nelson recruited Denis Hayes, a young activist,\nto help bring the idea to the public.\n\n## The idea for Earth Day came after a series of environmental catastrophes\n\nHayes, one of the organizers behind the first Earth Day, previously told TIME\nthat the idea behind the holiday came following a number of events that drew\nattention to the environment, including the release of Rachel Carson\u2019s book\nSilent Spring in 1962 and the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire. Hayes said that while\nthere were a number of groups in the U.S. working on different environmental\nissues\u2014to reduce air pollution, bring attention to the impact of pesticides on\nfarm workers, and more\u2014they had never worked in conjunction.\n\n\u201cWhat we did was take all of those myriad strands, including wildlife\nprotection issues, and wove them all together. It sounds strange today, but\nback then, the folks involved with those various causes didn\u2019t think of\nthemselves as having anything in common with one another,\u201d he told TIME in\n2019. \u201cNo one was asking that question at the end of the 1970s.\u201d\n\n## More than 20 million people participated in the first Earth Day\n\nMillions of people participated in the first Earth Day celebration on April\n22, 1970. The event shut down Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue, as people demonstrated\nand participated in street clean-ups.\n\n\u201cThe holiday mood on Fifth Avenue was exemplified by members of the\narchitectural firm of Warner, Burns, Toan & Lunde, who spread a yellow\nand\u2010white quilt on the asphalt near 57th Street, put a tulip in a wine bottle\nfor a centerpiece and enjoyed a picnic in the sun. A laughing crowd gathered\naround them and sang, \u2018Happy Earth Day to You,\u2019\u201d the New York Times reported\nthat day.\n\n## Earth Day is on April 22 because of college schedules\n\nThe date for Earth Day was largely dictated by the schedules of the college\nstudents Hayes and Nelson were hoping to attract. April 22 fell on a weekday\nduring the school year\u2014nestled between spring break and final exams, when the\nweather was mild enough to allow people to be outside.\n\n## The Environmental Protection Agency was created after the first Earth Day\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which regulates mechanisms to\nprotect the environment, was created on Dec. 2, 1970 as a direct response to\nthe first Earth Day. Congress formed the agency after witnessing the huge\nparticipation in Earth Day demonstrations across the country, the EPA says.\n\n\u201cLast year some said there would never be another Earth Day. They saw concern\nfor our environment as a fad, and claimed that the instant enthusiasm of an\nactivist generation would soon flow elsewhere,\u201d said William D. Ruckelshaus,\nthe EPA\u2019s first administrator during the second Earth Day in 1971. \u201cI believe\nthey were wrong.\u201d\n\n## Earth Day went global in 1990\n\nMillions of people participated in the first Earth Day movement, which led to\nthe passage of key environmental laws, including the National Environmental\nEducation Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Clean Air Act\nin the U.S. later that year.\n\n\u201cEarth Day 1970 achieved a rare political alignment, enlisting support from\nRepublicans and Democrats, rich and poor, urban dwellers and farmers, business\nand labor leaders,\u201d says the earthday.org history page.\n\nBut its impact spans larger than just one country. The movement went global in\n1990, after a group of environmental leaders approached Hayes to organize\nanother major campaign for the planet, which mobilized 200 million people in\n141 countries.\n\nIn the new millennium, the movement switched its focus to campaign against\nglobal warming, and as recently as 2020, over 1 billion people worldwide\nparticipated in Earth Day actions.\n\n## The Paris Agreement opened for signature on Earth Day\n\nThe Paris Agreement, the most significant international climate accord in\nhistory, was opened for signature on Earth Day in 2016. The treaty has more\nthan 190 signatories, all of whom agreed to reduce carbon emissions and carry\nout other actions to reduce climate change.\n\n## United Automobile Workers union played a role in making Earth Day possible\n\nThe former head of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union was one of the\nbiggest contributors to the original Earth Day, donating $2,000 in 1970 (the\nequivalent of more than $15,500 today).\n\n\u201cThe UAW was by far the largest contributor to the first Earth Day, and its\nsupport went beyond the merely financial. It printed and mailed all our\nmaterials at its expense \u2014 even those critical of pollution-belching cars,\u201d\nHayes told Grist in 2010. \u201cIts organizers turned out workers in every city\nwhere it has a presence. And, of course, Walter then endorsed the Clear Air\nAct that the Big Four were doing their damnedest to kill or gut.\u201d\n\n## Organizers are trying to have the biggest Earth Day cleanup event in\nhistory in 2024\n\nFor this year\u2019s Earth Day celebration, earthday.org is working with Malaysian\norganizations to host the largest cleanup in Earth Day history. Penang Island,\nthe country\u2019s main island, has been impacted by plastic pollution due to\ntourism. At least 100,000 volunteers will be cleaning up the beaches and\nforests in the country, according to organizers. They will also plant more\nthan 1 million trees.\n\n## Tens of millions of trees have been planted on Earth Day\n\nSome 18 million acres of forest are lost every year due to deforestation, per\nthe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. To combat this,\nearthday.org founded the Canopy Project in 2010 and says it has since planted\ntens of millions of trees around the world.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
