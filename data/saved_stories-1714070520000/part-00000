Does the published code give the real algorithm? Are\nrankings purely based on votes or do invisible factors come into play? Do\nstories about the NSA get pushed down in the rankings? Why did that popular\nstory suddenly disappear from the front page after you commented on it?\n\nBy carefully analyzing the top 60 HN stories for several days, I can answer\nthose questions and more. The published formula is mostly accurate. There is\nmuch more tweaking of rankings than you'd expect, with 20% of front-page\nstories getting penalized in various ways. Anything with \"NSA\" in the title is\npenalized and drops off quickly. A \"controversial\" story gets severely\npenalized after hitting 40 comments. This article describes scoring and\npenalties in detail. [Edit: HN no longer penalizes NSA articles (details).]\n\n## How ranking works\n\nArticles are scored based on their upvote score, the time since the article\nwas submitted, and various penalties using the following formula:\n\nBecause the time has a larger exponent than the votes, an article's score will\neventually drop to zero, so nothing stays on the front page too long. This\nexponent is known as gravity.\n\nYou might expect that every time you visit Hacker News, the stories are scored\nby the above formula and sorted to determine their rankings. But for\nefficiency, stories are individually reranked only occasionally. When a story\nis upvoted, it is reranked and moved up or down the list to its appropriate\nspot, leaving the other stories unchanged. Thus, the amount of reranking is\nsignificantly reduced. There is, however, the possibility that a story stops\ngetting votes and ends up stuck in a high position. To avoid this, every 30\nseconds one of the top 50 stories is randomly selected and reranked. The\nconsequence is that a story may be \"wrongly\" ranked for many minutes if it\nisn't getting votes. In addition, pages can be cached for 90 seconds.\n\n## Raw scores and the #1 spot on a typical day\n\nThe following image shows the raw scores (excluding penalties) for the top 60\nHN articles throughout the day of November 11. Each line corresponds to an\narticle, colored according to its position on the page. The red line shows the\ntop article on HN. Note that because of penalties, the article with the top\nraw score often isn't the top article.\n\nThis chart shows a few interesting things. The score for an article shoots up\nrapidly and then slowly drops over many hours. The scoring formula accounts\nfor much of this: an article getting a constant rate of votes will peak\nquickly and then gradually descend. But the observed peak is even faster -\nthis is because articles tend to get a lot of votes in the first hour or two,\nand then the voting rate drops off. Combining these two factors yields the\nsteep curves shown.\n\nThere are a few articles each day that score much above the rest, along with a\nlot of articles in the middle. Some articles score very well but are unlucky\nand get stuck behind a more popular article. Other articles hit #1 briefly,\nbetween the fall of one and the climb of another.\n\nLooking at the difference between the article with the top raw score (top of\nthe graph) and the top-ranked article (red line), you can see when penalties\nhave been applied. The article Getting website registration completely wrong\nhit #1 early in the morning, but was penalized for controversy and rapidly\ndropped down the page, letting Linux ate my RAM briefly get the #1 spot before\nSimpsons in CSS overtook it. A bit later, the controversy penalty was applied\nto Apple Maps shortly after it reached the #1 spot, causing it to lose its #1\nspot and rapidly drop down the rankings. The Snapchat article reached the top\nof HN but was penalized so heavily at 8:22 am that it dropped off the chart\nentirely. Why you should never use MongoDB was hugely popular and would have\nspent much of the day in the #1 spot, except it was rapidly penalized and\nlanguished around #7. Severing ties with the NSA started off with a NSA\npenalty but was so hugely popular it still got the #1 spot. However, it was\nquickly given an even bigger penalty, forcing it down the page. Finally, near\nthe end of the day $4.1m goes missing was penalized. As it turns out, it would\nhave soon lost the #1 spot to FTL even without the penalty.\n\nThe green triangles and text show where \"controversy\" penalties were applied.\nThe blue triangles and text show where articles were penalized into oblivion,\ndropping off the top 60. Milder penalties are not shown here.\n\nIt's clear that the content of the #1 spot on HN isn't \"natural\", but results\nfrom the constant application of penalties to many articles. It's unclear if\nthese penalties result from HN administrators or from flagged articles.\n\n## Submissions that get automatically penalized\n\nSome submissions get automatically penalized based on the title, and others\nget penalized based on the domain. It appears that any article with NSA in the\ntitle gets an automatic penalty of .4. I looked for other words causing\nautomatic penalties, such as awesome, bitcoin, and bubble but they do not seem\nto get penalized. I observed that many websites appear to automatically get a\npenalty of .25 to .8: arstechnica.com, businessinsider.com, easypost.com,\ngithub.com, imgur.com, medium.com, quora.com, qz.com, reddit.com, rt.com,\nstackexchange.com, theguardian.com, theregister.com, theverge.com,\ntorrentfreak.com, youtube.com. I'm sure the actual list is longer. (This is\nseparate from \"banned\" sites, which were listed at one point.\n\nOne interesting theory by eterm is that news from popular sources gets\nsubmitted in parallel by multiple people resulting in more upvotes than the\narticle \"merits\". Automatically penalizing popular websites would help\ncounteract this effect.\n\n## The impact of penalties\n\nUsing the scoring formula, the impact of a penalty can be computed. If an\narticle gets a penalty factor of .4, this is equivalent to each vote only\ncounting as .3 votes. Alternatively, the article will drop in ranking 66%\nfaster than normal. A penalty factor of .1 corresponds to each vote counting\nas .05 votes, or the article dropping at 3.6 times the normal rate. Thus, a\npenalty factor of .4 has a significant impact, and .1 is very severe.\n\nControversy In order to prevent flamewars on Hacker News, articles with \"too\nmany\" comments will get heavily penalized as \"controversial\". In the published\ncode, the contro-factor function kicks in for any post with more than 20\ncomments and more comments than upvotes. Such an article is scaled by\n(votes/comments)^2. However, the actual formula is different - it is active\nfor any post with more comments than upvotes and at least 40 comments. Based\non empirical data, I suspect the exponent is 3, rather than 2 but haven't\nproven this. The controversy penalty can have a sudden and catastrophic effect\non an article's ranking, causing an article to be ranked highly one minute and\nvanish when it hits 40 comments. If you've wondered why a popular article\nsuddenly vanishes from the front page, controversy is a likely cause. For\nexample, Why the Chromebook pundits are out of touch with reality dropped from\n#5 to #22 the moment it hit 40 comments, and Show HN: Get your health records\nfrom any doctor' was at #17 but vanished from the top 60 entirely on hitting\n40 comments.\n\n## My methodology\n\nI crawled the /news and /news2 pages every minute (staying under the 2 pages\nper minute guideline). I parsed the (somewhat ugly) HTML with Beautiful Soup,\nprocessed the results with a big pile of Python scripts, and graphed results\nwith the incomprehensible but powerful matplotlib. The basic idea behind the\nanalysis is to generate raw scores using the formula and then look for\nanomalies. At a point in time (e.g. 11/09 8:46), we can compute the raw scores\non the top 10 stories:\n\n    \n    \n    2.802 Pyret: A new programming language from the creators of Racket 1.407 The Big Data Brain Drain: Why Science is in Trouble 1.649 The NY Times endorsed a secretive trade agreement that the public can't read 0.785 S.F. programmers build alternative to HealthCare.gov (warning: autoplay video) 0.844 Marelle: logic programming for devops 0.738 Sprite Lamp 0.714 Why Teenagers Are Fleeing Facebook 0.659 NodeKnockout is in Full Tilt. Checkout some demos 0.805 ISO 1 0.483 Shopify accepts Bitcoin. 0.452 Show HN: Understand closures\n\nNote that three of the top 10 articles are ranked lower than expected from\ntheir score: The NY Times, Marelle and ISO 1. Since The NY Times is ranked\nbetween articles with 1.407 and 0.785, its penalty factor can be computed as\nbetween .47 and .85. Likewise, the other penalties must be .87 to .93, and .60\nto .82. I observed that most stories are ranked according to their score, and\nthe exceptions are consistently ranked much lower, indicating a penalty. This\nindicates that the scoring formula in use matches the published code. If the\nformula were different, for instance the gravity exponent were larger, I'd\nexpect to see stories drift out of their \"expected\" ranking as their votes or\nage increased, but I never saw this.\n\nThis technique shows the existence of a penalty and gives a range for the\npenalty, but determining the exact penalty is difficult. You can look at the\nrange over time and hope that it converges to a single value. However, several\nsources of error mess this up. First, the neighboring articles may also have\npenalties applied, or be scored differently (e.g. job postings). Second,\nbecause articles are not constantly reranked, an article may be out of place\ntemporarily. Third, the penalty on an article may change over time. Fourth,\nthe reported vote count may differ from the actual vote count because \"bad\"\nvotes get suppressed. The result is that I've been able to determine\napproximate penalties, but there is a fair bit of numerical instability.\n\n## Penalties over a day\n\nThe following graph shows the calculated penalties over the course of a day.\nEach line shows a particular article. It should start off at 1 (no penalty),\nand then drop to a penalty level when a penalty is applied. The line ends when\nthe article drops off the top 60, which can be fairly soon after the penalty\nis applied. There seem to be penalties of 0.2 and 0.4, as well as a lot in the\n0.8-0.9 range. It looks like a lot of penalties are applied at 9am (when\nmoderators arrive?), with more throughout the day. I'm experimenting with\ndifferent algorithms to improve the graph since it is pretty noisy. On\naverage, about 20% of the articles on the front page have been penalized,\nwhile 38% of the articles on the second page have been penalized. (The front\npage rate is lower since penalized articles are less likely to be on the front\npage, kind of by definition.) There is a lot more penalization going on than\nyou might expect.\n\nHere's a list of the articles on the front page on 11/11 that were penalized.\n(This excludes articles that would have been there if they weren't penalized.)\nThis list is much longer than I expected; scroll for the full list.\n\nWhy the Climate Corporation Sold Itself to Monsanto, Facebook Publications,\nBill Gates: What I Learned in the Fight Against Polio, McCain says NSA chief\nKeith Alexander 'should resign or be fired', You are not a software engineer,\nWhat is a y-combinator?, Typhoon Haiyan kills 10,000 in Philippines, To\nPersuade People, Tell Them a Story, Tetris and The Power Of CSS, Microsoft\nResearch Publications, Moscow subway sells free tickets for 30 sit-ups, The\nsecret world of cargo ships, These weeks in Rust, Empty-Stomach Intelligence,\nGetting website registration completely wrong, The Six Most Common Species Of\nCode, Amazon to Begin Sunday Deliveries, With Post Office's Help, Linux ate my\nRAM, Simpsons in CSS, Apple maps: how Google lost when everyone thought it had\nwon, Docker and Go: why did we decide to write Docker in Go?, Amazon Code\nNinjas, Last Doolittle Raiders make final toast, Linux Voice - A new Linux\nmagazine that gives back, Want to download anime?

The penalty factor is defined by an if with several\ncases. If the article is not a 'story' or 'poll', the penalty factor is .8.\nOtherwise, if the URL field is blank (Ask HN, etc.) the factor is nourl-\nfactor*. If the story has been flagged as 'bury', the scale factor is 0.001\nand the article is ranked into oblivion. Finally, the default case combines\nthe controversy factor and the gag/lightweight factor. The controversy factor\ncontro-factor is intended to suppress articles that are leading to flamewars,\nand is discussed more later.\n\nThe next factor hits an article flagged as a gag (joke) with a heavy value of\n.1, and a \"lightweight\" article with a factor of .17. The actual penalty\nsystem appears to be much more complex than what appears in the published\ncode.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAn article's position on the Hacker News home page isn't the meritocracy based\non upvotes that you might expect. By carefully examining the articles that\nappear on the Hacker News page, we can learn a great deal about the scoring\nformula in use. While upvotes are the obvious factor controlling rankings,\nthere is also a complex \"penalty\" system causing articles to be ranked lower\nor disappear entirely. This isn't just preventing spam, but affects many very\npopular articles. And if an article has more comments than votes, don't add\nyour comment to it or you may kill it off entirely! See discussion on Hacker\nNews.\n\n## Update (11/18): article on penalties is penalized\n\nIronically, this article was penalized on Hacker News. Minutes after reaching\nthe front page, a heavy 0.2 penalty was applied to the article, forcing it off\nthe front page. The black line in the graph below shows the position of this\narticle on Hacker News. You can see the sharp drop when the penalty was\napplied. The gray line shows where the article would have been ranked without\nthe penalty. Without the penalty, the article would have been in the #5 spot,\nbut with the penalty it never made it back onto the front page (positions\n1-30). The lower green line shows the raw score of this article. (11/26: I'm\ntold that the penalty was because the \"voting ring detection\" triggered\nerroneously.)\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nLabels: arc, reverse-engineering\n\n#### 14 comments:\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nNice analysis!

I'd love to see more about the voting ring detection penalty. At\nthis point, every one of my posts that makes the front page gets penalized.\nAccording to PG this is due to voting ring detection. I'm certainly not\norganizing any voting rings. I believe this may be another inadvertent type of\npenalty for popular domains -- having too many friends that upvote you and set\noff \"voting ring detection\".\n\nIt's a bummer because I put a lot of time in the content and truly think it is\ngood content. The end result is that I \"set it and forget it\" on Hacker News.\nTrying to engage there just leads to frustration when the comment thread\nsuddenly drops from the front page.\n\nAnother observation - my posts on gender (which I no longer write about due to\nthe personal risk) got the \"flamewar\" penalty, even though they were honest,\nnoncontroversial pieces generating some really good discussion. Apparently it\nwas too much discussion.\n\nThe algorithm probably protects us from a lot of junk but it also hurts\nsometimes too.\n\n    November 26, 2013 at 10:24 AM\n\nKen Shirriff said...\n\n    \n\nVianney Lecroart: unfortunately I'm note running my crawler any more, so I\ndon't have data for your article.\n\nHN Reader: I'd like to know more about the voting ring detection too.\nApparently that's what nailed my article.
