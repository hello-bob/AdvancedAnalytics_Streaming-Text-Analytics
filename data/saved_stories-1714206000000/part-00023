By exposing mice to a specific pattern\nof horizontally moving stripes, the team observed that vasomotion matched the\nstimulus pattern\u2019s speed and spread throughout the brain.\n\nThis synchronization suggests a mechanism by which the brain enhances its\ncirculation of nutrients and clears waste, possibly boosting cognitive\nabilities. The findings could have implications for treating and preventing\nneurological conditions.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Innovative Monitoring Technique: The study introduces a novel method to observe blood vessel dynamics through the intact skull or deep within the brain using optical fibers.\n  2. Vasomotion Synchronization: Visual stimuli can entrain the brain\u2019s vasomotion, leading to synchronized blood vessel activity that enhances nutrient delivery and waste removal across the entire brain.\n  3. Potential Health Benefits: This synchronized vasomotion may improve learning, aid in stroke recovery, and potentially delay neurodegenerative diseases like dementia by improving the brain\u2019s metabolic efficiency.\n\nSource: Tohoku University\n\nCompared with computers, the brain can perform computations with a very low\nnet energy supply. Yet our understanding surrounding how the biological brain\nmanages energy is still incomplete.\n\nWhat is known, however, is that the dilation and constriction cycles of blood\nvessels, or vasomotion, spontaneously occur in the brain, a process that\nlikely contributes to enhancing the circulation of energetic nutrients and\nclearing wasteful materials.\n\nNow, researchers from Tohoku University have developed a method that easily\nobserves and monitors blood vessel dynamics in the mouse brain. This can be\ndone either through the intact skull of a mouse, or deep into the brain using\nan implanted optical fiber.\n\nThe findings were detailed in the journal, eLife, on April 17, 2024.\n\nSince it has been reported that sensory stimuli can cause dilation of blood\nvessels or hyperemia, researchers sought to induce vasomotion via presenting\nmice with visual stimuli.\n\nWhat they discovered was when a mouse was shown a horizontally moving stripe\npattern that changed direction every 2 to 3 seconds, it caused a reaction in\nthe mouse\u2019s blood vessels that matched the pattern\u2019s speed.\n\nMice were presented with 15-minute visual training sessions interleaved with\n1-hour resting periods for 4 times per day. With such spaced training, the\namplitude of the synchronized vasomotion gradually increased.\n\nInterestingly, the visually induced vasomotion was not confined to the area of\nthe cerebral cortex responsible for visual information processing. In other\nwords, synchronized vasomotion spread throughout the whole brain.\n\n\u201cSynchronized vascular motion can be entrained with slowly oscillating visual\nstimuli,\u201d says Professor Ko Matsui of the Super-network Brain Physiology lab\nat Tohoku University, who led the research.\n\n\u201cSuch enhancement of circulation mechanisms may benefit the information\nprocessing capacity of the brain.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s long been known that changes in neuron connections support learning\nand memory, the plasticity of vasomotion hasn\u2019t been described before.\n\nMatsui and his colleagues found that a specific visual pattern makes the eyes\nmove more, and this eye movement improvement depends on changes in the brain\u2019s\ncerebellum. The researchers also observed that blood vessel activity in the\ncerebellum synchronized with this optokinetic motor learning.\n\nLead study investigator, Daichi Sasaki, believes that synchronized vasomotion,\nwhich efficiently delivers oxygen and glucose, could improve learning\nabilities.\n\nHe states, \u201cOur next step is to explore the advantages of vasomotion\nsynchronization. It might help clear waste like amyloid beta, potentially\ndelaying or preventing dementia.\n\n\u201cStroke recovery could also benefit from better energy supply and waste\nremoval. Additionally, synchronized vasomotion might even enhance intelligence\nbeyond our natural capabilities.\u201d\n\n## About this cognition and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Public Relations Source: Tohoku University Contact: Public Relations \u2013\nTohoku University Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access. \u201cPlastic vasomotion entrainment\u201d by Daichi\nSasaki et al. eLife\n\nAbstract\n\nPlastic vasomotion entrainment\n\nThe presence of global synchronization of vasomotion induced by oscillating\nvisual stimuli was identified in the mouse brain.\n\nEndogenous autofluorescence was used and the vessel \u2018shadow\u2019 was quantified to\nevaluate the magnitude of the frequency-locked vasomotion.\n\nThis method allows vasomotion to be easily quantified in non-transgenic wild-\ntype mice using either the wide-field macro-zoom microscopy or the deep-brain\nfiber photometry methods.\n\nVertical stripes horizontally oscillating at a low temporal frequency (0.25\nHz) were presented to the awake mouse, and oscillatory vasomotion locked to\nthe temporal frequency of the visual stimulation was induced not only in the\nprimary visual cortex but across a wide surface area of the cortex and the\ncerebellum.\n\nThe visually induced vasomotion adapted to a wide range of stimulation\nparameters. Repeated trials of the visual stimulus presentations resulted in\nthe plastic entrainment of vasomotion.\n\nHorizontally oscillating visual stimulus is known to induce horizontal\noptokinetic response (HOKR). The amplitude of the eye movement is known to\nincrease with repeated training sessions, and the flocculus region of the\ncerebellum is known to be essential for this learning to occur.\n\nHere, we show a strong correlation between the average HOKR performance gain\nand the vasomotion entrainment magnitude in the cerebellar flocculus.\nTherefore, the plasticity of vasomotion and neuronal circuits appeared to\noccur in parallel.\n\nEfficient energy delivery by the entrained vasomotion may contribute to\nmeeting the energy demand for increased coordinated neuronal activity and the\nsubsequent neuronal circuit reorganization.\n\nTags\n\nblood flowbrain functionbrain researchcognitionneurobiologyNeuroscienceTohoku\nUniversityvisual neurosciencevisual stimuli\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
