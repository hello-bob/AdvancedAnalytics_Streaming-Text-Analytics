Yes, robots.\n\nIn Santiago, Chile there\u2019s an engineer, turned extreme sports photographer,\nturned visual artist that uses robots known as pen plotters to aid in the\ncreation of his artwork. This artist\u2019s name is Pablo Az\u00f3car.\n\nIf this sounds like one of those ads starring the Most Interesting Man in the\nWorld, you wouldn\u2019t be far off.\n\nGiphy\n\nPablo began his adult life working as an engineer in Chile. Often times his\nwork took him to breathtaking locations with beautiful landscapes that he\ncouldn\u2019t help but photograph.\n\nHolidays took him to locations like New Zealand where he honed his skills with\na camera while snowboarding - another passion of his. When an injury kept him\nfrom riding as much as he would\u2019ve liked, his camera gave him a reason to stay\non the slopes and capture the majesty of the mountains and skills of the\nsnowboarders around him.\n\nAt a certain point, Pablo found he was more interested in shooting\nskateboarding sessions with local guys after work than he was about\nengineering work itself.\n\nHe knew that if he was ever going to live up to his full potential as a\nphotographer & videographer, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it while also working\nfull-time as an engineer.\n\nSo, he took a leap of faith and quit his day job.\n\nThe photography career that followed allowed Pablo to travel all over the\nworld, work for major outdoor brands, and document extreme sports competitions\nfor over 10 years... until a global pandemic hit.\n\nThe pandemic halted outdoor gatherings, including sports competitions, and\ndrastically reduced the number of photography gigs that Pablo had made his\nspecialty. Fortunately, Pablo had another interest of which he\u2019d been slowly\nfanning the flames for several years.\n\nAs a kid, one of Pablo\u2019s favorite toys was a Spirograph. He started thinking\nabout Spirographs again around 2016, and the engineer in him wondered what it\nwould be like to somehow attach a motor to this simple toy. This led him to\nbuild his own polargraph, which in turn, inspired him to eventually buy a pen\nplotter - a machine that can be fed data to create drawings on flat, 2D\nsurfaces with pens, markers, and many other writing implements.\n\nWith the pandemic denying him opportunities to travel and photograph the\nevents that he loved, Pablo took yet another leap of faith and decided to\npursue art of a different kind as a new full-time job.\n\nMuch like an artist\u2019s hand informs a paintbrush on what to paint, Pablo\u2019s\nhands inform a pen plotter on what to draw.\n\nCourtesy of Pablo Az\u00f3car\n\nOut-of-the-box software, various plugins, and some basic programming skills\naid artists, like Pablo, in converting digital drawings and low-resolution\npreviews of complicated designs into pen-plotted masterpieces.\n\nWhen designing his artwork, Pablo has to carefully consider every adjustment\nhe makes to the code. He has to consider the materials he plans to use, how\ndifferent colors may layer on top of one another, and even has to account for\nfelt-tip pens losing their sharp point and growing fatter as the sometimes\n48-hour drawing process runs its course. An immense amount of planning and\nmonitoring goes into the creation of each piece.\n\nCourtesy of Pablo Az\u00f3car\n\nFrom the early days of the pandemic to now, Pablo has sold hundreds of unique\npieces at art fairs in Chile as well as on the web through various online\nshops.\n\nIn the last year Pablo was lucky enough to have his interests come full\ncircle.\n\nIn one of his posts on Instagram, he mentioned his love of cycling - one of\nthe many sports he\u2019s passionate about (not to mention one he photographed\nfrequently in his previous career). A clothing designer for the cycling brand,\nVelocio, saw this and ended up reaching out to Pablo asking if he\u2019d be\ninterested in designing a pattern for a piece of clothing.\n\nAfter many months of working together, Pablo and the folks at Velocio Aparrel\nproduced a special edition cycling jersey for both men and women.\n\nLooking forward, Pablo is excited for possiblities similar to the one he\nrecently had with Velocio. He\u2019s always tinkering and tries to split his time\nbetween producing more art and applying his art in some new experiment. He\u2019s\nmanaged to take aspects of all his work and passions - from engineering,\nphotography, extreme sports - and find ways to combine them in whatever his\ncurrent artistic endeavors may be.\n\nCourtesy of Pablo Az\u00f3car\n\nLet\u2019s break things down a bit to see exactly what worked for Pablo, and\nunderstand how he grew his Instagram following to over 245,000 people in just\na few short years.\n\n###### Just start.\n\nPablo first started selling art before he had made a website or had any\nsignificant following on Instagram.\n\nHe was passionate and excited about what he was creating, but he had also\ncommitted to going full-time as an artist and knew he couldn\u2019t wait around for\npeople to find and purchase his art organically.\n\nInstead, he:\n\n  * Listed his first 5 pieces on Big Cartel (and ended up getting his first sale almost immediately).\n\n  * Asked local coffee shops and restaurants if he could hang art over some of their blank wall space.\n\n  * Registered for several local art fairs (where he ended up getting most of his sales early on).\n\nPablo eventually found time to make his first website in between his second\nand third art fairs, but this was by no means perfect. He viewed this as a\n\u201cVersion 1,\u201d and ultimately recreated an improved website sometime later using\na different platform.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait to be perfect, because it\u2019ll never be perfect.\u201d\n\nPablo Az\u00f3car\n\n###### You\u2019re always selling, even if you don\u2019t realize it.\n\nAt one of these art fairs, a customer spent some time looking over Pablo\u2019s\nwork but decided not to purchase anything. That night, the customer ended up\nreconsidering and bought one of his pieces online the very next day.\n\nEven during slow days at art fairs when you get no sales, you still have an\nopportunity to promote yourself and have interactions with people who may\ndecide to become your customers in the future.\n\nBe prepared for this.\n\nHave a website and Instagram (or other social media accounts) clearly visible\nat your booth or table. Consider generating a QR code for free that links to\nwhere customers can find you. Print it out and display it beside your artwork.\nThat way, if you didn\u2019t get as many customers as you would\u2019ve liked, you may\nstill have gained a few followers - some of which may buy from you in the days\nor weeks to come.\n\n###### Remove as much friction from the buying process as possible.\n\nAs someone whose business is selling art, you should make purchasing your\nartwork as simple as possible.\n\nSounds obvious, right? But how many steps does it take for someone to buy your\nart once they find you on Instagram?\n\nFrom Pablo\u2019s Instagram account, it only takes 3 clicks to have an original\npiece of artwork sitting in your cart on his website. No typing required.\n\n  * A click to open his website\n\n  * A click to select a piece of art (read a description, see additional photos, etc.)\n\n  * A click to \u201cadd to cart\u201d\n\nIf your process takes longer than this, ask yourself if the extra steps are\nproviding any additional value to your customers. If they don\u2019t, consider\nsimplifying things.\n\n###### Aspire to reach the largest market you can.\n\nIn business theres a term called \u201cTotal Adressable Market,\u201d or TAM. This is\nbasically everyone in the world who could buy a product in a given category.\n\nWhat\u2019s the TAM for a product like fishing rods? Well, that would be everyone\nin the world who likes fishing. As of 2022, that\u2019s anywhere from 220-700\nmillion people according to nature.com. That\u2019s a pretty good-sized market if\nyou were looking to get into selling some sort of fishing gear.\n\nThe reason we mention this is because when Pablo first started selling his art\nonline, he created all his posts strictly in Spanish - his native language.\n\nOver time, he felt that this was limiting him, so he started making posts in\nboth English and Spanish, and then eventually just English. Making this change\nled to a much larger following on Instagram and an increase in sales from\npeople in countries around the globe since much of the world speaks, or\nunderstands, English.\n\nThis example of increasing one\u2019s TAM as an artist can apply to more than just\nchanging the language you post in (I\u2019m sure most of you are posting in English\nalready). Incorporating more niches into the subjects you draw or paint is one\nway to do this. Just be careful not to expand so far that your brand or style\nbecomes unrecognizable to your original group of fans.\n\n###### Obsess over quality.\n\n... At least for the things that are in your control.\n\nWhether Pablo is making original works, prints, cycling jerseys, Instagram\nposts, or websites, he always makes sure the qualtiy is as high as possible.\n\nHis pieces are made with the utmost care and attention. He uses high quality\npens, inks, and paper. Each piece comes signed and embossed. His online store\nlooks professional and provides a thorough description paired with numerous\nhigh-resolution photos for each piece. He spends hours filming and editing\nInstagram reels to produce eye-catching videos that make users stop scrolling\nand engage.\n\nAll these things improve the likelihood of a sale.\n\nPablo was careful to say, however, that artists shouldn\u2019t get hung up on one\nerrant line or paint stroke that the customer won\u2019t likely have any issue with\nor notice anyway. Like most things, it\u2019s a balance.\n\nCourtesy of Pablo Az\u00f3car\n\n##### TL;DR\n\n  * Just get started. Start selling in the real world. Throw your first online store together. Don\u2019t spend months building the blueprint for a 7-figure business before you finally flip the \u201con\u201d switch and start selling.\n\n  * When you\u2019re not selling, you\u2019re marketing. Use the slow days as opportunities to get your name out there.\n\n  * Remove friction from buying. Make it as simple as possible for customers to buy your work.\n\n  * Consider if you can reach a broader group of customers by making a particular change (i.e. post in a different language, incorporate new popular niches in your work, etc.)\n\n  * Create a high quality product and shopping experience for your customers. Look at brands and artists you admire and see how they make their art & buying process feel professional.\n\n##### Additional Tidbits\n\n  * Pablo has often rejected the idea of accepting brand sponsorships from pen and marker companies even though this would increase his income in the short term. He\u2019s done this because he doesn\u2019t want to give up creative control of his process or how he creates content for his audience. Not to mention - many of these pens and drawing implements get pretty beat up, cut up, and generally abused during the creation of each original piece Pablo makes. Brands might not be a big fan of that.\n\n  * \u201cIf you\u2019re getting hate, that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d Pablo said this in regard to comments on some of his Instagram posts. People sometimes leave comments arguing that what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d art. In the past, he used to engage with them and try to explain that this machine is just a tool, and without him guiding it, nothing happens. Now, he doesn\u2019t get too involved. Often enough, other commenters leap to his defense and a large back & forth ensues. Pablo doesn\u2019t mind. Afterall, it\u2019s good for engagement and the Instagram algorithm.\n\n  * The \u201csatisfying\u201d and \u201crelaxation\u201d niches on Instagram are huge, and Pablo has found he\u2019s gained a lot of attention from those groups by posting certain types of reels that fall into those categories. Smooth time lapses synced with chill low-fi beats are something artists in any niche can recreate.\n\n##### Pablo\u2019s Tech Stack\n\n  * Jumpseller - Online store for original pieces\n\n  * Shopify - Online store for prints\n\n##### Pen Plotters and a Shake-Up in the Pen Plotting World\n\nOur featured artist, Pablo Az\u00f3car, creates his work using an AxiDraw pen\nplotter built by the company, Evil Mad Scientist.\n\nRecently however, Evil Mad Scientist was acquired by Bantam Tools and no\nlonger offers the AxiDraw series of products. The press release detailing the\nacquisition can be read here.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. If Pablo\u2019s story inspired you to run out and buy a high-\nquality pen plotter, it looks like a new option is on the horizon.\n\nBantam Tools will be offering a new and improved plotter called the NextDraw\n(coming Spring 2024). It\u2019s designed by the same folks from Evil Mad Scientist\nand offers increased speed & precision, an auto-homing feature, and many other\nimprovements. A link on their website allows you to sign up for updates\nregarding their new product.\n\nWhile the AxiDraw (soon to be NextDraw) is the most popular pen plotter on the\nmarket, other companies, like UUNA TEK, offer similar machines as well.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see more ways artists are using pen plotters to create\nartwork, check out the curated Instagram account, Pen Plot Art.\n\n##### Why every artist NEEDS their own newsletter \u2709\ufe0f\n\nThe simplest step an artist can take to improve their sales is to create a\nmailing list.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Not a huge following on Instagram or TikTok, but a modest - or\neven small - list of email addresses belonging to dedicated fans.\n\nWhy is this so valuable?\n\n  1. Customer Retention. Don\u2019t just get a sale then send that customer back into the marketplace maelstrom \ud83c\udf00. Capture their email. Establish a longer term relationship with them. Build hype for upcoming projects. Sell to them again in the future! Maybe they\u2019ll become a collector of your work \ud83d\udc40.\n\n  2. Platform Independence. Don\u2019t be beholden to the algorithms of Instagram, Etsy, Facebook... A mailing list is completely platform independent. You control the narrative, and if you decide to change the platform you use to send your newsletter, you can just export your entire mailing list and take it with you wherever you go. It\u2019s yours forever \ud83e\udd29.\n\n  3. Cultivate Relationships. Use your newsletter to create long-form content for your fans. These folks love your work and might want to hear more about your process than what you squeezed into your latest Instagram caption. This can even lead to new business opportunites and partnerships down the road \ud83e\udd1d.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself where you can get started, look no further than this\nnewsletter! Stay Sketchy is built on a dedicated newsletter platform called\nBeehiiv.\n\nBeehiiv was created by the developers that made the Morning Brew newsletter\ninto the media giant it is today (so they sorta know what they\u2019re doing).

He has since been fired, banned from the museum, and\npolice are currently investingating the matter.\n\nThe good news? They gave him his art back.\n\nAt least you can\u2019t say he isn\u2019t creative.\n\n### What did you think of this week's newsletter?  \n  \n---  \n  \n  * \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8 A masterpiece!\n  * \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfa8 High school art project\n  * \ud83c\udfa8 Kindergarten finger paints\n\n  \nLogin or Subscribe to participate in polls.  \n  \nThanks for checking out another edition of Stay Sketchy.
