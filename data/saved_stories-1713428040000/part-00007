I spent a few\nhours there while using his wifi along with a spare desk. Nothing was too\nunusual until I went to buy a USB cable I needed back at home so I pulled up\nAmazon.com.\n\nI was surprised to see\u2014due to my temporary local downtown Seattle IP\naddress\u2014my Amazon home page had new options. I showed my friend and he spun\nhis laptop around to show his homepage, which had even more options for\nproducts and services only available within Seattle proper.\n\nMost of it was stuff like groceries delivered within minutes, or headphones\nyou could get in an hour instead of relying on overnight shipping. Some of it\nwas experimental betas of pet products and healthcare but then I saw a banner\nfor the Amazon Go store.\n\nI remembered it had launched the year before and I was curious about this\nweird new store concept. The conceit was: you walk in, grab what you need,\nthen walk out and as you hit the sidewalk you get charged on the Amazon app\nfor any items you took with you. Seamless, fast, and the ultimate in\nconvenience was the promise.\n\nMy friend said he tried it once, thought it was strange but an ok experience\nand mentioned it was a couple blocks away so we could check it out later if I\nwanted. Immediately, I said let's go NOW. And we did.\n\nAmazon's HQ aka the Bezos Balls in June of 2019\n\nI floated along the sidewalk all the way. I'd been hearing about this\ntechnology for decades. I remember being a little kid in the 1980s and hearing\nbar codes were more complex and powerful than we thought and someday soon\nyou'd go to a grocery store, load up your cart, skip any checkout and just\nhead to your car and it would know everything you bought based on those new,\nsmarter bar codes. There were a bunch of AT&T ads in the early 1990s that also\npromised this kind of future, and how it was always just around the corner.\n\nBut there I was in Summer of 2019 and the giant leaps in convenience were\nalready here, just a block away in the Amazon Go Store I was about to enter\n(LITERALLY JUST AROUND THE CORNER). I was jazzed as hell and couldn't wait to\nsee what the experience was like.\n\nI remember it vividly. There were stainless steel turnstiles at the front and\na person in a blue Amazon polo shirt telling us to download a new Amazon Go\napp so we could beep our way into the store to let it track us.\n\nIt was a brightly lit, well-stocked convenience store with good brands and I\nlooked for snack options, eventually grabbing an egg salad sandwich off a\nshelf but changed my mind and instead opted for some prosciutto-wrapped cheese\nsticks and a can of seltzer water. As I started to head out I asked my friend\n\"so we just go now? really?\" and he said yeah. I wondered if I would be\ncharged for the sandwich I put back on the shelf.\n\nThe store had a very small staff, just the one greeter at the front and I\nthink a security guard near the exit. They told people you really could just\nleave and on my way back to the apartment I saw a charge from amazon for seven\ndollars and something cents for my items. I noticed the charges were only for\nthe two things in my hands, which was cool, as it was smart enough to not\ncharge me for the sandwich I didn't ultimately take.\n\nmy actual Amazon Go Store receipt, still in my amazon account history today\n\nAt the time, Amazon's marketing push around the Go store was how\ntechnologically advanced it all was. They said they put weight sensors on\nevery shelf for every item. You beeped your QR code on the way in, and perhaps\nthrough a mix of Bluetooth and RFID and NFC it could track your in-store\nmovements and match it with shelf sensors whenever you grabbed items. You left\nthrough a magical set of turnstiles that beeped you out and figured out what\nyou touched and carried out while you were in there.\n\nIt was all very futuristic and honestly, felt that way using it in 2019. It\nreally was fast and convenient and even though the tech seemed far-fetched it\nseemed just about plausible. Maybe this really was the future of shopping.\n\nYou probably heard the news a couple weeks ago that Amazon was shutting down\nits Go Store concepts and in the small print they revealed there were actually\nabout 1,000 employees behind the scenes, staring at cameras all day in a room\nplaying live video from inside their stores that made the \"magical AI\"\npossible to run a Go store.\n\nIt's funny because it's a pattern that has repeated for hundreds of years.\nSomeone debuts an incredible new technology, but then eventually the public\nfinds out it was a trick all along. The origin of this is the chess-playing\nrobot that toured around the world beating grandmasters in the 18th century\nuntil it was revealed to not actually be a robot, but a guy hidden inside a\nbox controlling the Turkish Robot that appeared to make the moves.\n\nA Mechanical Turk they called it. Strangely, that's what Amazon calls their\nown service that is powered off the backs of a virtual army of people\ncompleting anonymous small tasks who get paid pennies to click a button or\nanswer a question hundreds of times a day.\n\nThe entire premise of the Amazon Go store was faster, easier shopping in a\nsetting that requires much less store labor, all because weight sensors and\ncameras would figure out what customers bought and charge them appropriately\nwithout the need for checkout workers.\n\nIn the end, it was just a fake tech demo, with a thousand off-shore\ncontractors behind the curtain doing all the actual work promised by tech.\nThere really weren't any shortcuts in this kind of innovation.\n\nHonestly, I felt duped and cheated after hearing the Amazon Go news earlier\nthis month. I'm big into the Internet of Things and I've followed home\nautomation technology for years with lots of that tech in use in my own house\ntoday. Though the Amazon Go store seemed like magical hocus pocus at the time,\nit was conceivable that a combo of sensors and cameras could magically remake\nshopping and I was impressed with my experience after using it in Seattle.\n\nI spent weeks afterwards wondering where this technology could best be\napplied. A faster shopping experience at a 7-Eleven wasn't really a thing I\nneeded in my daily life, but as I was flying around for work, I thought an\nAmazon Go store in every airport could be amazing as you're often jumping off\none plane to grab another, trying to grab a bottle of water and a pack of\npeanut M&Ms in the few minutes you have before your next flight boards.\n\nThat was the only \"killer app\" I came up with after my Amazon Go experience.\nIt was the only place where time was so much of the essence and I could recall\ninstances where I had to put down items I wanted to buy while stuck in a long\nline in O'Hare because my phone buzzed to tell me boarding started so I had to\nrun to a plane instead. Amazon Go could have solved a problem in those\nsituations.\n\nI know innovation can be a messy business. And I know early betas can be\n\"faked\" or a temporary fix put in place at launch, with continued development\nslated for later. I've heard rumors the landmark January 2007 debut of the\niPhone that much of what Steve Jobs showed on stage was faked. Some of the\napps were just Steve swiping from one JPEG to another while acting like it was\na functioning app (granted, the apps were built and shipped in the six months\nbefore the iPhone's product launch in June of 2007).\n\nI'm not surprised to hear there were actually hundreds of pairs of eyes\nfollowing my every move in that store, especially in 2019 when it was so new.\nWhat I find baffling today is hearing it never got better than that in six\nyears of running the project? They never figured out reliable weight sensors?\nOr the use of local RFID/NFC tracking of customers? It really was people\naround the world staring at monitors and clicking boxes whenever a customer\npicked a product? How did it continue for so long in this iteration? Why\nwasn't it killed years ago?\n\nI still love following tech news and will continue to approach new innovation\nwith a combination of curiosity and fascination, but I will always remember to\nbring a touch of skepticism to the table, since so many tech demos often end\nup hiding an ugly truth deep down.\n\n## Embrace the weird\n\nThe other day I was complaining to a friend how I've been spinning my wheels\nlately, having trouble finding any projects or gigs I could work on. He came\nback with a quick, short, smart response: Who cares? Just make weird shit. It\nhit me like a ton\n\nApr 16, 2024 2 min read 2 comments\n\n## A sandwich so good I nearly wept\n\nI'm a big fan of food and I'm always looking out for new places to eat,\nespecially in Portland, Oregon where lots of new food places regularly spring\nup in food carts and restaurant pop-ups.
