Even in death, he accompanies me on the path of truth.\n\nBy Anat Matar April 24, 2024 | Edit\n\nfacebook twitter email link\n\nWalid Daqqa at a hearing at Be'er Sheva District Court, January 23, 2018.\n(Oren Ziv)\n\nIn partnership with\n\nOn the wall in my study hangs a large picture.

As far as I\u2019m concerned, the artwork is\nhis last will and testament, the distillation of what he would pass on to the\nworld.\n\nI met Walid almost two decades ago, after I established the Israeli Committee\nfor Palestinian Prisoners together with Tamar Berger and Sanaa Salama-Daqqa \u2014\nWalid\u2019s upstanding and ever-determined wife and a good friend of mine. When\nWalid first heard from Sanaa about our small project, he wrote to me, marking\nthe start of a years-long political, personal, reflective, and philosophical\ncorrespondence. In order to convey even just a glimpse of the unique character\nof the person we lost this month, I want to share some excerpts of what he\nwrote to me from within the prison walls.\n\n# Subscribe to The Landline\n\n## +972's weekly newsletter\n\nBut before I do so, it\u2019s important to explain the circumstances that led him\nthere. The four-decade campaign of incitement against him \u2014 which has\ncontinued and intensified after his untimely death \u2014 obscures the man who\nwalked the path of truth.\n\n### No reprieve\n\nWalid Daqqa is a native of Baqa al-Gharbiyye, a Palestinian city in Israel. In\n1987, he was convicted of involvement in the abduction and murder of the\nIsraeli soldier Moshe Tamam, which took place three years prior. According to\nthe authorities, although Daqqa never saw Tamam \u2014 neither at the scene of the\nabduction, nor at the scene of the murder \u2014 he played a role in relaying\norders from his handlers in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\n(PFLP) to others in the group. Daqqa always denied the charge of commanding\nthe group.\n\nThe plan was to abduct and use an Israeli soldier as a bargaining chip,\ntransferring him first to Jenin in the occupied West Bank and then to Syria.\nThe indictment claimed that Walid instructed the others to kill the soldier if\nthe plan veered off course. This, horrifyingly, is what occurred. Four days\nafter his abduction, Moshe Tamam was found dead. Walid only learned of this\nafter the fact.\n\nDespite being sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in Tamam\u2019s\ndeath, Walid fought to clear his name. The military court in Lydd/Lod that\ntried Walid\u2019s case was dismantled years ago because it failed to meet the\nstandards of Israeli civilian courts; Walid sought a retrial, but his request\nwas denied.\n\nWalid Daqqa at a hearing at Be\u2019er Sheva District Court, January 23, 2018.\n(Oren Ziv)\n\nIn 2012, after a fierce public struggle, Israel\u2019s then-President Shimon Peres\nagreed to commute his life sentence and those of other Palestinian prisoners\naccused of murdering soldiers. The sentence was fixed at 37 years, meaning\nWalid would be released in 2023. But five years later Walid was convicted\nagain \u2014 this time for his role in smuggling phones into prison \u2014 and was\nsentenced to an additional two years.\n\nOver the years, Walid filed various requests for clemency, a reduction in his\nsentence, and ultimately for his release on humanitarian grounds, after\ndoctors predicted last year that he had no more than two years left to live\nand required an urgent bone marrow transplant. All these requests were denied.\nAnd so, left without adequate medical care and separated from his family, he\ndied this month, one year into his additional two-year sentence.\n\nNo one, either from the Israel Prison Service (IPS) or the hospital where he\ndied, bothered to inform Walid\u2019s family; they learned of his hospitalization\nand death from social media. The mourning tent erected outside his home was\nviolently dismantled by police, and his body is still being held by Israeli\nauthorities. The High Court approved the IPS\u2019s request to keep holding Walid\u2019s\nbody until at least May 5, possibly due to the fact that it may be included in\na future hostage-prisoner exchange deal with Hamas.\n\n### \u2018I have a Jewish sister\u2019\n\nThe Israeli public\u2019s reaction to Walid mirrors its reaction to the current war\nin Gaza: it is stuck, exclusively focused on the moment of Israeli pain, even\nas brutal violence is unleashed on Palestinians. In the case of Walid, that\nmoment is the murder of Moshe Tamam. But even if you freeze time at this\nmoment, it is unclear why Walid should be the target of decades of Israeli\nvitriol: contrary to the narrative obsessively recounted online and in the\nmedia, Walid was not present at the scene of the abduction or the murder, and\ndid not know that Tamam was killed until afterward.\n\nIn any case, Walid himself was not stuck in that moment in time at all. On the\ncontrary, as a man well aware of his rationality, subjecthood, and freedom\n(I\u2019m deliberately using the Hegelian terms Walid used to describe man in\ngeneral and himself in particular), he repeatedly and publicly expressed\ncomplete remorse for his actions.\n\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords, he believed that he could express\nhimself fully as an Israeli citizen. He took unusual action and asked the IPS\nto revoke his affiliation with the PFLP. Walid joined Balad, the democratic\nArab nationalist party based in Israel, and to the extent that was possible\ngiven the constraints of his imprisonment, he played an active role in the\nparty.\n\nPalestinians protest outside Megiddo Prison, northern Israel, August 22, 2021.\n(Oren Ziv)\n\nHis writings were critical and profound, original and without a shred of\nsycophancy. As a result, over the years he has become one of the most\nprominent and respected Palestinian intellectuals. From his unique perspective\noutside of time (he called his prison sentence \u201cparallel time\u201c) and place,\nWalid was able to articulate the challenges at the heart of Palestinian and\nIsraeli societies, and their possibilities for growth.\n\nWalid\u2019s insight and courage also touched those around him in prison. I heard\nthis from prison officials, who praised his influence on other prisoners: he\nspent hours with young prisoners, teaching them about the importance of\nnonviolent struggle, devotion to life, and the disastrous consequences of\narmed struggle.\n\nOne day, I was surprised when I found a postcard in the mailbox from a\nprisoner whose name I had never heard before. This prisoner, who was also\nsentenced to life imprisonment for murdering Israeli soldiers, wrote that he\nhad heard of me from Walid and was convinced that joint Palestinian-Jewish\npolitical struggle was the right path.\n\nFor one man to have such an influence is extraordinary. Here is what Walid\nwrote to me about these conversations:\n\nI read [other prisoners] our letters ... and I see that eventually things\nchange and permeate and create a change that sows questions in their souls\naround the absolute truths they believed. Your letters, Anat, long ago stopped\nbeing just letters. Our relationship has long been more than just a\nrelationship between a Jew and an Arab, and when I mention that you are\nJewish, I do so emphatically and deliberately. Because of this, I wanted to\nscream: I have a Jewish sister. The success of our relationship and your\norganizing is not measured, in my opinion, by whether I will be released as a\nresult of it. We\u2019re already doing well. Your letters are a mirror I put in\nfront of those who want to know how ugly they are when they judge people by\ntheir origin and religion.\n\nWalid\u2019s insistence on the equal dignity of all people was grounded in his\nrigorous philosophical thinking. A highly reflective person, he enrolled at\nthe Open University and completed a master\u2019s degree in Democracy Studies. At\nsome point in our correspondence, the idea even arose that I would supervise\nhim through a PhD. We fantasized about him one day writing a dissertation that\nwould connect the work of Hannah Arendt with that of Foucault \u2014 an exploration\nof totalitarianism, imprisonment, enlightenment, and the human image. That\nfantasy never came to pass, but Walid\u2019s writing was nevertheless consistently\ninfused with intellectual and moral insight.\n\nSanaa Salama-Daqqa at a hearing for her husband Walid at Be\u2019er Sheva District\nCourt, January 23, 2018. (Oren Ziv)\n\n### \u2018To feel the pain of humanity is the essence of civilization\u2019\n\nDear Anat, hello,\n\nThere are areas we do not know and are not even entitled to define, among them\nsuccess and failure. Is living by certain principles \u2014 as individuals or as a\nsociety \u2014 a success or a failure? Is being a human a success or a failure?\nSome things are neither successes nor failures. To be a person is to be a\nperson ... This is an end in itself, or the end of ends. When the law of\ngravity stops working, we are not talking about failure but about the\ndisintegration of the universe, something beyond the concepts of success and\nfailure. So too, the human universe: society, and within it the human\nindividual.\n\nWhen someone ceases to act as a person, it is disintegration. I once wrote\nthat the essence of man and human culture is to feel the other. Numbness in\nthe face of horrors is like a nightmare for me. To feel people, to feel the\npain of humanity \u2014 this is the essence of civilization. The will is the\nessence of the intelligent man. The act of doing is our physical essence.\nEmotion is our spiritual essence. And feeling \u2014 sensing people and feeling\ntheir pain \u2014 is the essence of all human culture.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict is already being waged \u2014 especially in the past\ndecade \u2014 in a reality of \u201cliquid modernity,\u201d as Zygmunt Bauman put it ...\nRationality and morality are becoming two poles on an axis that continues to\nlengthen and the poles grow ever distant. In the present conflict, any means\nhas become a legitimate means as long as it achieves a certain result. Both\nsides, Israeli and Palestinian, have learned quickly from the other, thanks to\nthe media, to the point that we have become alike. In the absence of morality,\nit is not at all important what is reality and what is its reflection.\n\nIn response to my skepticism about the optimism that arose from his analyses\nand about our ability to persuade others to share narratives, Walid replied:\n\nIt is impossible to convince those who commit genocide, those who have\nrenounced human civilization based on rational calculations, to see the error\nof their ways; not with the words and language of civilized peoples. This kind\nof society and leadership, which has removed itself from human society, is\ndoomed to die. A society that has stopped speaking the language of humanity\nand created another language for itself cannot and will not understand the\nlanguage of persuasion. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has not reached this\nlevel, although the killing and hostility have reached alarming proportions.\n\nPalestinians protest in front of Ofer Prison, occupied West Bank, December 19,\n2019. (Ahmad Al-Bazz/Activestills)\n\nI do not propose to be alarmed or hasty in giving up the means of persuasion\nand influence. This kind of renunciation is a recognition that we have reached\na situation where the other side is not a human interlocutor. Factually, this\nis not the case. This, despite the fact that there are influential groups in\nboth camps that not only use terminology taken from the Holocaust, but have\nplans and ideas, some of which they attribute to God\u2019s inescapable will, and\nmarket them as a kind of historical necessity. These plans and ideas have not\nyet become a central and cohesive agenda or a political force, but they are\nidentified with political forces currently operating in Israel and in the Arab\nand Islamic world.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to shudder at these words. I wonder how Walid responded to\nOctober 7 and its bloody aftermath \u2014 but between then and his death, there was\nno contact between us. Like all Palestinian political prisoners, Walid was cut\noff entirely from the outside world when the war began, with the IPS banning\nfamily visits and even the exchange of letters; only occasional visits from\nlawyers are permitted.\n\n### The refusal of death\n\nHello, Anat... Hello, my dear sister.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be optimistic and believe in life when there is so much\ndestruction and death in our region, but the refusal of death is a fragile\nfaith in life. And fragile faith is preferable to surrender.\n\n\u201cAre this Arab man and Jewish woman truly siblings?\u201d the postcard examiners at\nthe prison gates, the postmasters, and perhaps many others will wonder when\nthey do not understand the depth of the connection begotten by the refusal of\ndeath.\n\nThis heretical belief is strong and penetrates every wall and crosses every\nbarrier, because it cannot be categorized ... This belief has no nationality\nand no religion. This heretical belief is the new religion that grows out of\nrevulsion at destruction and ruin, and out of a strong desire to live.\nHeretical faith is spreading and is carried by Arab and Jewish mothers and\nparents as a prayer that their children will be the last victims.\n\nFew are the people with whom I want to be in very private moments of freedom\nand who might rejoice in my joy. I would be very happy if you would be among\nthem.\n\nGoodbye, my dear sister.\n\nWalid Daqqa at a hearing at Be\u2019er Sheva District Court, January 23, 2018.\n(Oren Ziv)\n\nI believe that I was privileged to receive from Walid the wonderful picture of\nAli ibn Abi Talib\u2019s teaching because he recognized in me a shared belief in\nthe refusal of death: the insistence on clinging to life and seeing the full\nvalue of the other and of ourselves.\n\nOne day my cellmate said to me: \u201cTell me, haven\u2019t you given up on saying good\nmorning to that guard who opens the cell door and doesn\u2019t bother to answer you\nevery day?! Don\u2019t you have self-respect?! Enough, don\u2019t tell him good\nmorning.\u201d At that moment, I didn\u2019t have much to answer my friend. But I didn\u2019t\ngive up, and I didn\u2019t stop saying good morning to the guard, because I didn\u2019t\ngive up on being human ... Because every good morning is a reminder to the\nguard that I\u2019m a human being, and every good morning reminds him that he\u2019s a\nhuman being, and the fact is that he doesn\u2019t answer because he\u2019s afraid to\nacknowledge that fact, and if I stop my good morning, it means that his fear\nwon me over and turned me into something else.\n\nI won\u2019t let prison change me or control me. And in your words, I am a subject\nwho has will and consciousness, I will not let myself be turned into an\nobject. It is my self-respect, to have free will in prison. This mirror that I\nput up every morning for the guard \u2014 it will change him. And it does.\n\nDespite his relentless belief in life and humanity, Walid was denied the\nfundamental right to have a family. The IPS refused to allow conjugal visits\nfor Walid and Sanaa, and a court subsequently upheld that decision. So Walid\nsmuggled his sperm out of prison, and nine months later Sanaa gave birth to\nMilad. Just recently, I visited them in their home, which was decorated in\nanticipation of Dad finally being released.\n\nDuring his attempt to have a child and after the birth of his lovely daughter,\nWalid wrote and published two children\u2019s books. The first, \u201cThe Secret of the\nOlive Tree,\u201d tells the story of a child born through the same creative,\ndefiant, and life-affirming means by which Milad was born. The child in the\nbook, Jude, organizes a small group of friends \u2014 the rabbit Samur, the bird\nAbu Risha, the cat Khanfour, and the dog Abu Nab \u2014 and together they manage to\nreach Jude\u2019s father\u2019s cell in prison.\n\n### Most read on +972\n\n\u2018Lavender\u2019: The AI machine directing Israel\u2019s bombing spree in Gaza\n\nSix months after October 7, a lament for the paths not chosen\n\n\u2018The soldiers opened the way for the settlers\u2019: Pogroms surge across West Bank\n\nThere, they learn an important lesson: the future lies in learning, in\neducation, in independent thinking.

But Walid will accompany me in another way: walking\nthe path of truth. I don\u2019t walk it alone. It is not crowded, it\u2019s true \u2014 but\nwe are not alone, Walid.
