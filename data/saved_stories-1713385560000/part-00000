Bellwether has been testing the tech with the National Guard,\nwhich will deploy it in time for the summer wildfire season, said Nirav Patel,\na program manager with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a Pentagon unit that\nhelps the military integrate commercial technology and that helped organize\nthe partnership.\n\nUp until now, the National Guard \u2014 which coordinates the military\u2019s response\nto tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires inside the United States and\nits territories \u2014 has had to rely on human analysts poring over aerial photos\nto figure out specifically which areas, buildings and infrastructure have been\ndamaged after a disaster before being able to direct the right resources to\nthe right places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhat used to take hours or days now takes just seconds, said Patel. He said he\nexpects the tech to only become more important. \u201cAs climate change is\nimpacting different parts of the Earth\u2019s surface, the [Defense Department] is\nbeing pulled in,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWe unfortunately only see that increasing.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration between Bellwether and the National Guard shows how Silicon\nValley is working more closely with the Defense Department. Though military\nfunding and the space program were integral to getting Silicon Valley up and\nrunning in the 1950s and 1960s, few tech founders in recent decades have built\ncompanies with the goal of serving the military. The DIU was set up in 2015 to\ntry to close that gap and find a way to cut through bureaucratic procurement\nprocesses and get the tech industry to work more closely with the Defense\nDepartment.\n\nMore recently, a new wave of Silicon Valley tech companies, including drone\nmaker Anduril and AI company Shield AI, have begun building tech specifically\nfor the military, casting themselves as patriots aiming to arm the U.S.\nmilitary to retain its dominance through the 21st century. Venture-capital\nfunding for defense tech start-ups is growing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGoogle has a complicated history with the U.S. military. In 2018, the company\nwalked away from a contract to build AI image-recognition tools for the\nPentagon after employees protested the deal. But since then, it has steadily\nreturned to military work and was one of four companies awarded a massive $9\nbillion contract to build cloud services for the Defense Department.\n\nSpokespeople for both the DIU and Google X said that the AI would only be used\ndomestically within the United States and its territories, and for disaster\nresponse, not military action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nWhat\u2019s with all the black-and-white logos for apps?\n\nAnalysis|Chatbots\u2019 flaws aren\u2019t stopping tech giants from putting them\neverywhere\n\nTikTok is obsessed with ... premium-grade industrial glycine from China?\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": false}
