He had prior experience building his own startup and doing\nfreelance work. But that was a different world - one where his day often\nstarted just before noon.\n\nNow, he faced the reality of a traditional job as a web developer. Unlike\nprevious years, he would receive a regular paycheck and work alongside a team\nof other web developers. Most importantly, he would no longer have to build\nand fix things on his own.\n\nThe previous years had not been kind. Sleepless nights spent in the midst of\nmultiple projects with multiple promises and singular resources.\n\nAt first he was excited. However, the technical work soon proved to be far\nless challenging than what he was accustomed to. It was simpler, more cosmetic\nin nature. He went from developing mobile apps and APIs to merely rearranging\npanels in WordPress. Though less thrilling, it did pay - enough. And most\nimportantly he could go home on time - no more late, sleepless nights in front\nof the blue square box.\n\nGradually they came to see his technical capability. They tasked him with\nlarger projects, ones with increasingly ambiguous requirements. He relished\nthe work, not just because he could challenge himself technically but also\nbecause it demonstrated the trust they had in him.\n\nIt went from smaller brochure like marketing websites to larger, more\ndemanding, Magento projects. He could finally work in something other than\njQuery. He could finally write \u2018real\u2019 code.\n\nThe big projects came and went, each marked by vague outlines and meandering\nrequirements. They progressively became more difficult. It wasn\u2019t always the\nrequirements that made it so but the solutions.\n\nHe could see beyond the simple requirements to what lay ahead. He wouldn\u2019t\njust build the best e-commerce store, he would build one that would endure and\ndemand praise. One that capture the attention of customers and rival agencies\nalike.\n\nHe had the freedom to make pivotal decisions, and he was the only one that\ncould. Every shiny tool was at his disposal from the newest of javascript\nlibraries to the latest engineering paradigms.\n\nRecognized as a technical savant, he was involved in every significant\ntechnical discussion. He was not merely a competent software engineer; he was\nthe technical lead - he who shall be consulted.\n\nHe once relished in knowing he would not be alone, cherished being part of a\nteam. But gradually the team would disappear. Some left, some didn\u2019t meet his\nexpectations and some didn\u2019t want to.\n\nHe was the one they all went to when something went wrong but it wasn\u2019t\nbecause of his personality. He would often lambast others, detailing how they\nweren\u2019t up to his level or how they lacked basic skills. He would often\nrewrite others code because it simply wasn\u2019t good enough or up to his\nstandard.\n\nHe took pride in his work and was given multiple promotions. Maybe it was\nbecause he was that good or maybe it was because he was the only one who knew\nwhere the bodies were buried.\n\nThere are hard projects and then there are harder still. The former may be\nvague or technically challenging. The latter is often the same but someone\nalready built it. His job was to unearth the multiple bodies on top of which\nthese project were built.\n\nBigger projects by way of bigger promises and no one smart enough to assist\nhim or know one willing to.\n\nHe became steadily more irritable. The predictable workdays were replaced by\nearly morning Uber rides home. Sometimes he would miss meetings because he\nworked so late. They didn\u2019t appreciate it but they didn\u2019t do anything about\nit.\n\nHe was too important.\n\nHe was too difficult to confront.\n\nThey didn\u2019t need to, for he decided to leave in the end, of his own accord.\nThe work got to him, and he could feel himself slipping.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t as quick.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t as clever.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t who he wanted to be.\n\nThis is usually the point in the story where I reveal that the person was me.\nI took some creative liberties because it wasn\u2019t just me, and it wasn\u2019t just\nthat one time.\n\nThe fault wasn\u2019t entirely my own. We aren\u2019t all paragons of humility and\nintelligence and we should be told as much. Management steered us wrong, and\nlike a self driving car that hasn\u2019t worked out the kinks, we veered further\noff course.\n\nThere are moments in my career when I look back on that time. My memory isn\u2019t\nperfect, so the details are fuzzy, but the feelings remain vivid. I remember\nit better as I see it replayed.\n\nAn epiphany is sudden but these aren\u2019t. They emerged gradually and often I\nneed reminders. In some of my recent roles I\u2019ve felt the pangs of familiarity.\nSometimes it\u2019s not because I see it in myself but because I see it in others.\n\nI don\u2019t know the official words to describe this kind of me. Some say it\u2019s the\n\u201c10x engineer\u201d. Some refer to it as the \u201cunicorn\u201d.\n\nI think there\u2019s a better word: TURD (The Uncooperative Rude Developer)\n\nDon\u2019t be a Turd.\n\nAnd don\u2019t let them hang around.\n\nThanks for reading A Perfectly Cromulent Software Engineer!
