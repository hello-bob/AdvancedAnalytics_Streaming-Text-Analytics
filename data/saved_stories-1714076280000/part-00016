(As Evan points out, he\nactually defined six, with Polity \u2014 government by political organizations \u2014\nranked first. Which is what we have. Lucky us.)\n\nI\u2019m a qualified yes on this \u2014 I think it\u2019s more nuanced, with flavors and\ncombinations of each \u2014 but I\u2019d like to offer a different framework for three\nkinds of government.\n\nI speak, of course, of iOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\nHear me out.\n\niOS: Everything is centrally planned and fits together really well \u2014 as long\nas what you want to do is within the expectations and rules of the central\nplanners. Every business, every payment must be approved by the central\nplanners. Although they claim to be pro-human \u2014 they\u2019re building a \u201cbicycle\nfor the mind\u201d for people who \u201cthink different\u201d \u2014 ultimately these policies\nbenefit the planners and the people in their inner circle. People who disagree\nwith the central planners are often shouted down by the faithful.\n\nWindows: Here, anyone can build a business, but there is still some central\nplanning. There have been ebbs and flows of more and less central control:\nthere have been app stores here and locked-down user interfaces there, but\nultimately the public has had some sway over the design. The operating system\nhas been historically a little less safe than iOS because of its anything-goes\npoint of view, and the interface is less beautifully polished than iOS. But\nanyone really can ship software for it without having to go through anyone\nelse. Lately there has been more underhanded economic activity from the\ncentral planners, like advertising in the Start menu and agents that\nunnecessarily track your data for their benefit.\n\nLinux: There\u2019s no real central planning, there\u2019s no tracking what people do,\nthere\u2019s no money inherent in the system. Everything is borne from grassroots\nco-operation and interconnected communities that negotiate with each other.\nThe interface is far less polished and you often have to compile your own\ninfrastructure if someone in a co-operative hasn\u2019t taken the time to smooth\nout an experience for someone exactly like you. There isn\u2019t even a consensus\non what to call it \u2014 is it Linux? GNU/Linux? GNU? \u2014 let alone the legal\nlicensing and how communities should operate. Still, users have full ownership\nof their computers and software. Where this model has been most useful in\npractice is behind the scenes in services used by users of the other operating\nsystem models; essentially elements of this ideology have been cherry-picked\nby these other models.\n\nEach of these, of course, emerged from the centrally planned monarchies of\nUNIX and OS/360. Some operating systems \u2014 notably Linux \u2014 were the result of\nrevolutions that moved their users away from similar models; others are simply\nan evolution.\n\nSo, there it is. I\u2019ll be taking no questions. I await my honorary doctorate in\npolitical computer science with thanks.\n\nabout an hour ago \u00b7 Asides \u00b7 Share this post\n\nShare this post on social media.\n\nI\u2019m writing about the intersection of the internet, media, and society.
