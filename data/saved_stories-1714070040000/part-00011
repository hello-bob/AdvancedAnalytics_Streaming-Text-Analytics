This new A16 manufacturing process will be\nthe company's first Angstrom-class production node, promising to outperform\nits predecessor, N2P, by a significant margin. The technology's most important\ninnovation will be its backside power delivery network (BSPDN).\n\nJust like TSMC's 2nm-class nodes (N2, N2P, and N2X), the company's 1.6nm-class\nfabrication process will rely on gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors,\nbut unlike the current and next-generation nodes, this one uses backside power\ndelivery dubbed Super Power Rail. Transistor and BSPDN innovations enable\ntangible performance and efficiency improvements compared to TSMC's N2P: the\nnew node promises an up to 10% higher clock rate at the same voltage and a 15%\n- 20% lower power consumption at the same frequency and complexity. In\naddition, the new technology could enable 7% - 10% higher transistor density,\ndepending on the actual design.\n\n(Image credit: TSMC)\n\nThe most important innovation of TSMC's A16 process is the introduction of the\nSuper Power Rail (SPR), a sophisticated backside power delivery network\n(BSPDN). This technology is tailored specifically for AI and HPC processors\nthat tend to have both complex signal wiring and dense power delivery\nnetworks.\n\nBackside power delivery will be implemented into many upcoming process\ntechnologies as it allows for an increase in transistor density and improved\npower delivery, which affects performance. Meanwhile, there are several ways\nto implement a BSPDN. TSMC's Super Power Rail plugs the backside power\ndelivery network to each transistor's source and drain using a special\ncontract that also reduces resistance to get the maximum performance and power\nefficiency possible. From a production perspective, this is one of the most\ncomplex BSPDN implementations and is more complex than Intel's Power Via.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\n(Image credit: TSMC)\n\nThe choice of backside power rail implementation is perhaps why TSMC decided\nnot to add this feature to its N2P and N2X process technologies, as it would\nmake using the production nodes considerably more expensive. Meanwhile, by\noffering a 1.6nm-class node with GAA nanosheet transistors and SPR as well as\n2nm-class nodes with GAAFETs only, the company will now have two distinct\nnodes that will not compete with each other directly but offer distinctive\nadvantages for different customers.\n\n(Image credit: TSMC)\n\nThe production timeline for A16 indicates that volume production of A16 will\ncommence in the second half of 2026. Therefore, actual A16-made products will\nlikely debut in 2027. This timeline positions A16 to potentially compete with\nIntel's 14A node, which will be the Intel's most advanced node at the time.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
