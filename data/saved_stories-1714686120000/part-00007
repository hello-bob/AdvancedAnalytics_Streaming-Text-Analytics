Based on the original text manual\nfound in the source code, this is a formatted version of that manual for easy\nreadability on mobile devices and to make linking to specific sections\npossible.\n\nA big thanks again to ToyKeeper for continued innovation and updates on the\ngreat Anduril UI firmware.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Anduril 2 User Manual\n\nAnduril is an open-source firmware for flashlights, distributed under the\nterms of the GPL v3. The sources can be obtained here:\n\n  * Link 1\n  * Link 2\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAfter putting a battery in the light and tightening the parts together, the\nlight should quickly blink once to confirm it has power and is now\noperational. After that, basic usage is simple:\n\n  * Click to turn the light on or off.\n  * Hold the button to change brightness.\n  * Release and hold again to change brightness the other way.\n\nThat is all the user needs to know for basic use, but there are many more\nmodes and features available for people who want more.\n\nBefore reading the rest of this manual, it is recommended that users look at\nthe Anduril UI diagram(s), which should be provided along with the flashlight.\n\nWith great power comes great complexity \ud83d\ude35.\n\nNote: the above diagram does not include some of the latest features of\nAnduril 2 with Tint Ramping and Channel Switching. Please see Anduril 2: Dual\nChannel Features or reference LuxWad's video.\n\n## Button presses\n\nButton presses are abbreviated using a simple notation:\n\nButton| Meaning  \n---|---  \n1C| One click| Press and then quickly release the button  \n1H| Hold| Press the button, but keep holding it  \n2C| Two clicks| Press and release quickly, twice  \n2H| Click, hold| Click two times, but hold the second press  \n3C| Three clicks| Press and release quickly, three times  \n3H| Click, click, hold| Click three times, but hold the final press  \n  \nThe same pattern is used with higher numbers too. For example, 10C means ten\nclicks... and 10H means ten clicks but hold the final press.\n\n## Simple UI\n\nBy default, the light uses a simple UI. This is useful if you lend the light\nto someone else, or if you just don\u2019t want to bother with any crazy disco\nmodes.\n\nSimple UI has all the basic functions needed to work as a flashlight, but the\nminimum and maximum brightness are limited by default to make it safer, and\nany complex or advanced functions are blocked.\n\nSimple UI diagram/flowchart.\n\nFunctions available in Simple UI include:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1C| On / off  \n1H| Ramp up (or down, if button was released less than a second ago)  \n2H| If light is on : ramp down / If light is Off: momentary high mode  \n2C| Double click to go to / from highest safe level  \n3H| Tint ramping (on lights that have it)  \n4C| Lockout mode  \n  \nSome other modes and functions are available too. When the light is Off, these\nare the options:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n3C| Battery check mode (displays voltage once, then turns off)  \n4C| Lockout mode  \n10H| Switch to Advanced UI  \n15C or more| Version check  \n  \nIn Lockout mode with Simple UI, there are a few functions:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1H| Momentary moon  \n2H| Momentary low  \n3C| Unlock and turn off  \n4C| Unlock and turn on  \n4H| Unlock and turn on at low level  \n5C| Unlock and turn on at high level  \n  \nTo change between Simple UI and Advanced UI, turn the light Off and then do\none of these:\n\nUI| Button| Action  \n---|---|---  \nSimple UI| 10H| Go to Advanced UI  \nAdvanced UI| 10C| Go to Simple UI  \nAdvanced UI| 10H| Configure Simple UI  \n  \nIf you get lost, or if you want to auto-calibrate the temperature sensor, do a\nfactory reset. The process for this is:\n\n  1. Loosen tailcap\n  2. Hold button\n  3. Tighten tailcap\n  4. Keep holding button for about 4s\n\nThe light should flicker while getting brighter, then briefly burst to full\npower. Hold until it reaches full power to do a reset, or let go of the button\nearly to abort.\n\nOn some lights, like products where the tailcap method is impossible, use 13H\nfrom Off to do a factory reset. If this is difficult, try counting it like\nmusic to make it easier:\n\n    \n    \n    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 HOLD\n\nSimple UI is enabled after each factory reset.\n\nSimple UI can be configured in several ways, but not while Simple UI is\nactive. So go to the Advanced UI, configure things, then go back to Simple UI.\n\nConfigurable options include:\n\n  * floor level\n  * ceiling level\n  * number of steps (in stepped ramp)\n  * turbo style\n\nOther options are inherited from Advanced UI:\n\n  * ramp style (smooth / stepped)\n  * smooth ramp speed\n  * ramp-after-moon style\n  * memory settings\n  * auto-lock settings\n  * aux LED settings\n  * voltage calibration\n  * thermal regulation settings\n  * hardware-specific \u201cmisc menu\u201d settings\n\n## Advanced UI\n\nMost of the information below this is for the Advanced UI. Anything not\nalready noted above is blocked in the Simple UI.\n\n## Ramping / Stepped Ramping Modes\n\nAnduril\u2019s ramping mode uses a smooth ramp or a stepped ramp, depending on\nwhich style the user prefers.\n\nEach ramp has its own settings:\n\n  * floor (lowest level)\n  * ceiling (highest level)\n  * and the stepped ramp can also have a configurable number of steps\n\nAdditionally, Simple UI has its own ramp settings for floor, ceiling, and\nnumber of steps. The smooth/stepped style is inherited from the Advanced UI\u2019s\nramp.\n\nThere are four ways to access Ramping mode when the light is Off:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1C| Turn on at the memorized brightness. (see below for details about what\n\u201cmemorized\u201d means)  \n1H| Turn on at the floor level. Let go after the light turns on to stay at the\nfloor level, or keep holding to ramp up.  \n2C| Turn on at the ceiling level.  \n2H| Turn on at full power, turn off when released. (momentary turbo) (in\nSimple UI, this uses the ceiling level instead of turbo)  \n  \nWhile the light is on, a few actions are available:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1C| Turn Off.  \n2C| Go to or from the turbo level. (or if it has regulated down, \u201cbump\u201d back\nup to turbo) (turbo level / behavior is configurable)  \n1H| Change brightness (up). If the button was released less than a second ago,\nor if it\u2019s already at the ceiling, it goes down instead.  \n2H| Change brightness (down)  \n3C| Switch to the other ramp style. (smooth / stepped)  \n3H| Tint ramping (on lights which have it).  \n3H| Momentary turbo (on lights with no tint ramping).  \n4C| Go to Lockout mode.  \n5C| Go to Momentary mode.  \n5H| Start a Sunset Timer.  \n7H| Ramp config menu.\n\n  * Item 1: Floor level.\n  * Item 2: Ceiling level.\n  * Item 3:\n    * Stepped ramp: Number of steps. Can be 1 to 150.\n    * Smooth ramp: Ramp speed.\n      * 1 = Full speed, ~2.5s from end to end.\n      * 2 = Half speed, ~5s from end to end.\n      * 3 = Third speed, ~7.5s.\n      * 4 = Quarter speed, ~10s.\n\n  \n10C| Activate Manual memory and save the current brightness.  \n10H| Ramp extras config menu.\n\n  * Item 1: Disable manual memory and go back to automatic memory. (doesn't matter what value the user enters at the prompt)\n  * Item 2: Configure the manual memory timer. Sets the timer to N minutes, where N is the number of clicks. A value of 0 (no clicks) turns the timer off.\n  * Item 3: Configure whether to ramp up after Off -> 1H.\n    * 0: Ramp up after moon.\n    * 1: Don't ramp up, just stay at the floor level.\n  * Item 4: Configure Advanced UI's turbo style:\n    * 0: No turbo, only ceiling.\n    * 1: Anduril 1 style. Ramp -> 2C goes to full power.\n    * 2: Anduril 2 style. Ramp -> 2C goes to ceiling, or goes to full power if user ramped up to ceiling first. This value also affects momentary turbo in Ramp and Off modes.\n\n  \n  \nMemory determines which brightness level the light goes to with 1C from Off.\nThere are three types of brightness memory to choose from:\n\nMemory Style| Brightness  \n---|---  \nAutomatic| Always uses the last-ramped brightness. (does not memorize levels\naccessed by a shortcut, like turbo, 2C for ceiling, or 1H-from-off for floor)  \nManual| Always uses the user\u2019s saved brightness.  \nHybrid| Uses the Automatic memory brightness if the light was only off for a\nshort time, or resets to the Manual memory level if it was off for a longer\ntime. The timer for this is configurable from 0 to ~140 minutes.  \n  \nAnother way to think of it is: There are three styles of memory for the last-\nramped brightness level...\n\n  * Always remember (Automatic)\n  * Remember for N minutes (Hybrid)\n  * Never remember (Manual)\n\nTo choose a memory style, set the configuration accordingly:\n\nMem Style| Manual mem| Manual mem timer  \n---|---|---  \nAutomatic| off| any  \nManual| on| zero  \nHybrid| on| non-zero  \n  \n## Sunset Timer\n\nIn the Ramp mode or Candle mode, it\u2019s possible to make the light turn itself\noff after a while.\n\nTo activate the timer, go to the brightness you want and then use a 5H. Keep\nholding the button, and the light should blink once per second. Each blink\nadds 5 minutes to the timer.\n\nIn Ramp mode, it slowly dims until it\u2019s at the lowest level, then shuts off.\nIn Candle mode, it stays at the same brightness until the final minute, at\nwhich point it dims and dies out.\n\nThe user can change the brightness while the timer is active. If this happens\nduring the final few minutes, it also \u201cbumps\u201d the timer up to a minimum of 3\nminutes. So if it\u2019s getting really dim and you need a little more time, you\ncould do a 5H to add 5 minutes, or simply ramp up to the desired brightness.\n\n## Other Modes\n\nAnduril has several other modes too. To access these, press the button more\nthan 2 times when the light is off:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n3C| Blinky / utility modes, starting with battery check  \n3H| Strobe modes, starting with the most recently used strobe  \n4C| Lockout mode  \n5C| Momentary mode  \n7C / 7H| Aux LED configuration  \n9H| Misc configuration menu (only on some lights)  \n10H| Simple UI configuration menu  \n13H| Factory reset (on some lights)  \n15C or more| Version check  \n  \n## Lockout Mode\n\n4C from Off to enter Lockout mode. Or 4C from Ramp mode. This makes the light\nsafe to carry in a pocket or a bag or anywhere else the button might be\npressed by accident.\n\nTo exit Lockout mode, 4C. The light should blink briefly and then turn on at\nthe memorized level. Or 4H to turn on at the floor level instead:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n4C| Go to Ramp mode (memorized level). (uses manual mem level if there is one)  \n3C| Unlock and go to Off mode  \n4H| Go to Ramp mode (floor level).  \n5C| Go to Ramp mode (ceiling level).  \n  \nLockout mode also doubles as a momentary moon mode, so the user can do quick\ntasks without having to unlock the light. The brightness in Lockout mode has\ntwo levels:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1H| Light up at the lowest floor level.  \n2H| Light up at the highest floor level. (or the manual mem level, if there is\none)  \n  \nIt is also possible to make the light lock itself automatically after being\nturned off. To enable this, go to Lockout mode and use 10H to activate the\nauto-lock config menu. Release the button after the first blink. Then at the\nprompt, click N times to set the auto-lock timeout to N minutes.\n\n  * 10H: Auto-lock config menu. Click N times to set timeout to N minutes. A value of zero disables the auto-lock feature. So, to turn off auto-lock, don\u2019t click at all.\n\nAnd on lights which have aux LEDs, there may be additional functions:\n\n  * 7C / 7H: Change Lockout Mode\u2019s aux LED pattern. More details on this below, in a separate section.\n\n## Blinky / Utility Modes\n\n3C from Off to access Anduril\u2019s blinky / utility modes. This always starts at\nBattery check and the user can proceed to other blinky modes if Advanced UI is\nenabled. The sequence is:\n\n  1. Battery check\n  2. Temperature check (if light has a temperature sensor)\n  3. Beacon mode\n  4. SOS mode (if enabled)\n\nIn all of these modes, some basic actions are available:\n\n  * 1C: Turn off.\n  * 2C: Next blinky mode.\n\nAdditionally, in Battery check and Temperature check modes:\n\n  * 7H: Go to the voltage config menu or thermal config menu.\n\nIn more detail, this is what each blinky / utility mode does:\n\n### Battery check\n\nBlinks out the battery voltage per cell. Full is 4.2V, empty is about 3.0V.\nThe light blinks the whole-number digit first, pauses, then blinks out the\n\u201ctenths\u201d digit. Then a longer pause, and it repeats.\n\nSo for 4.2V, it would be \u201cblink-blink-blink-blink .. blink-blink\u201d.\n\nA \u201czero\u201d digit is represented by a very quick blink.\n\nThe voltage config menu has one setting:\n\n  1. Voltage correction factor. This adjusts the battery measurement sensor, allowing the user to add or subtract up to 0.30V in 0.05V steps. Click N times to enter a value:\n\nClicks| Value  \n---|---  \n1C| -0.30V  \n2C| -0.25V  \n3C| -0.20V  \n4C| -0.15V  \n5C| -0.10V  \n6C| -0.05V  \n7C| default, 0V  \n8C| +0.05V  \n9C| +0.10V  \n10C| +0.15V  \n11C| +0.20V  \n12C| +0.25V  \n13C| +0.30V  \n\n### Temperature check\n\nBlinks out the current temperature in degrees C. This number should be pretty\nclose to what a real thermometer says. If not, it would be a good idea to\nenter the thermal config menu and calibrate the sensor. Or let the light\nsettle to room temperature, then use factory reset to auto-calibrate the\nsensor.\n\nThe thermal config menu has two settings:\n\n  * Current temperature. Click once per degree C to calibrate the sensor. For example, if the ambient temperature is 21 C, then click 21 times.\n\n  * Temperature limit. This sets the maximum temperature the light can reach before it will start doing thermal regulation to keep itself from overheating. Click once per degree C above 30. For example, to set the limit to 50 C, click 20 times. The default is 45 C, and the highest value it will allow is 70 C.\n\n### Beacon mode\n\nBlinks at a slow speed. The light stays on for 100ms, and then stays off until\nthe next blink. The brightness and the number of seconds between pulses are\nconfigurable:\n\n  * Brightness is the user\u2019s memorized ramp level, so set this in ramping mode before activating beacon mode. Follows the same memory rules as ramping \u2013 automatic, manual, or hybrid.\n\n  * Speed is configured by holding the button. The light should blink once per second while holding the button. Release it after the desired amount of time has passed, to set a new beacon speed. For example, to do a 10-second alpine beacon, hold the button for 10 seconds.\n\n### SOS mode\n\nBlinks out a distress signal. Three short, three long, three short. Repeats\nuntil light is turned off or until battery is low.\n\nThe memorized ramp level determines the brightness of SOS Mode.\n\n## Strobe / Mood Modes\n\nAnduril includes a few extra modes for a variety of purposes:\n\n  * Candle mode\n  * Bike flasher\n  * Party strobe\n  * Tactical strobe\n  * Lightning storm mode\n\nBeware: fast blinking lights ahead\n\n3H from Off to access these. The last-used strobe mode is remembered, so it\nwill return to whichever one you used last.\n\nIn all of these modes, a few actions are available:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n1C| Turn off  \n2C| Next strobe / mood mode  \n1H| Increase brightness, or strobe faster (except lightning)  \n2H| Decrease brightness, or strobe slower (except lightning)  \n5C| Go to momentary mode, for a momentary strobe (this is useful for light\npainting)  \n  \nAdditionally, Candle mode has one more action:\n\nButton| Action  \n---|---  \n5H| Activate Sunset Timer, and/or add 5 minutes to the timer  \n  \nIn more detail, here is what each mode does:\n\n  * Candle mode\n\nBrightness changes randomly in a pattern resembling a candle flame. If a timer\nis set, it will run until the timer expires, then get dimmer for one minute,\nthen sputter and turn itself off. Without a timer, candle mode runs until the\nuser turns it off. Brightness is configurable.\n\n  * Bike flasher\n\nRuns at a medium level, but stutters to a brighter level once per second.\nDesigned to be more visible than a normal ramping mode, but otherwise works\nmostly the same. Brightness is configurable.\n\n  * Party strobe\n\nMotion-freezing strobe light. Can be used to freeze spinning fans and falling\nwater. Speed is configurable.\n\n  * Tactical strobe\n\nDisorienting strobe light. Can be used to irritate people. Speed is\nconfigurable, and the duty cycle is always 33%.\n\nBe careful about heat in this mode, if using it for a long time.\n\n  * Lightning storm mode\n\nFlashes at random brightness and random speed to simulate lightning strikes\nduring a busy lightning storm. Do not look directly at the flashlight when\nthis mode is running, because it may suddenly go to full power without\nwarning.\n\n## Momentary Mode\n\n5C from Off to enter Momentary mode. Or 5C from Ramp mode, or 5C from a strobe\nmode.\n\nThis locks the flashlight into a single-mode interface where the LEDs are only\non when the button is held down. It is intended for Morse code, light\npainting, and other tasks where the light should be on only for a short time\nand probably in a pattern.\n\nMomentary mode does either a steady brightness level or a strobe, depending on\nwhich was active before going to Momentary mode. To select which one, go to\nthe mode you want to use, adjust the brightness and speed and other settings,\nthen 5C to enter Momentary mode.\n\nIn steady mode, brightness is the memorized ramp level, so adjust that in Ramp\nMode before entering Momentary mode.\n\nIn momentary strobe mode, the settings are copied from the last-used strobe\nmode, such as party strobe, tactical strobe, or lightning.\n\nTo exit this mode, physically disconnect power by unscrewing the tailcap or\nbattery tube.\n\n## Configuration Menus\n\nEvery config menu has the same interface. It has one or more options the user\ncan configure, and it will go through them in order. For each menu item, the\nlight follows the same pattern:\n\n  * Blink once, then go to a lower brightness. The user can keep holding the button to skip this menu item, or release the button to dive in and enter a new value.\n\n  * If the user released the button:\n\n    * Stutter or \u201cbuzz\u201d quickly between two brightness levels for a few seconds. This indicates that the user can click one or more times to enter a number. It will keep buzzing until the user stops clicking, so there is no need to hurry.\n\nThe actions here are:\n\n      * click: add 1\n      * hold: add 10 (only in versions 2021-09 or later)\n      * wait: exit\n\nAfter entering a number, or after skipping every menu item, it waits until the\nbutton is released then exits the menu. It should return to whatever mode the\nlight was in before entering the config menu.\n\n## Ramp Config Menu\n\nWhile the light is on in a Ramping mode, 7H to access the config menu for the\ncurrent ramp.\n\nOr, to access the ramp config for Simple UI, make sure the Simple UI is not\nactive, then do a 10H from Off.\n\nFor smooth ramping mode, there are three menu options:\n\n  1. Floor. (default = 1/150)\n  2. Ceiling. (default = 120/150)\n  3. Ramp speed. (default = 1, fastest speed)\n\nFor the stepped ramping mode, there are three menu options:\n\n  1. Floor. (default = 20/150)\n  2. Ceiling. (default = 120/150)\n  3. Number of steps. (default = 7)\n\nFor the Simple UI mode, there are four menu options. The first three are the\nsame as stepped ramping mode.\n\n  1. Floor. (default = 20/150)\n  2. Ceiling. (default = 120/150)\n  3. Number of steps. (default = 5)\n  4. Turbo style. (default = 0, no turbo)\n\nDefault values are different for each model of flashlight. The numbers above\nare only examples.\n\nTo configure the floor level, click the button equal to the number of ramp\nlevels (out of 150) at which the floor should be. To set the lowest possible\nlevel, click once.\n\nTo configure the ceiling level, each click goes one level lower. So 1 click\nsets the highest possible level, 2 clicks is the 2nd-highest, 3 clicks is the\n3rd-highest level, etc. To set the default of 120/150, click 31 times.\n\nWhen configuring the number of steps, the value can be anything from 1 to 150.\nA value of 1 is a special case. It places the step halfway between the floor\nand ceiling levels.\n\n## Version Check Mode\n\nThis allows people to see which version of the firmware is installed on their\nlight. The format for this is (usually) 12 digits \u2013 a date followed by a model\nnumber.\n\n> YYYYMMDDBBPP\n\n  * YYYY: Year\n  * MM: Month\n  * DD: Day\n  * BB: Brand ID\n  * PP: Product ID\n\nThe date is when the firmware was compiled. If the vendor did not set this\nvalue, it defaults to 1969-07-20, the date of first human contact with the\nmoon. However, it might not be a date at all; some vendors may specify a\ncompletely different type of value here.\n\nThe brand/product values are also known as the model number. These are hard-\ncoded in the source code for each light\u2019s build target, and can be looked up\nin the \u201cMODELS\u201d file or by using the \u201cmake models\u201d command.\n\n## Protection Features\n\nAnduril includes low voltage protection (LVP) and thermal regulation.\n\nLVP makes the light step down to a lower level when the battery is low, and if\nthe light is already at the lowest level, it shuts itself off. This activates\nat 2.8V. LVP adjustments happen suddenly, in large steps.\n\nThermal regulation attempts to keep the light from overheating, and otherwise\nadjusts output to stay as close as possible to the user-configured temperature\nlimit. Thermal adjustments happen gradually, in steps so small they are\ndifficult for humans to perceive.\n\nWARNING: thermal regulation only works in Ramping Mode (both Stepped/Smooth\nand Turbo, but not Momentary Turbo).\n\n## Aux LEDs / Button LEDs\n\nSome lights have aux LEDs or button LEDs. These can be configured to do\ndifferent things while the main emitters are off. There is one aux LED mode\nfor the regular Off mode, and another aux LED mode for Lockout mode. This\nallows the user to see at a glance whether the light is locked.\n\nAux LED modes typically include:\n\n  * Off\n  * Low\n  * High\n  * Blinking\n\nTo configure the aux LEDs, go to the mode you want to configure and then 7C.\nThis should change the aux LEDs to the next mode supported on this light.\n\n  * 7C: Next aux LED mode.\n\nIf the aux LEDs can change color, there are additional actions to change the\ncolor. It is the same as above, but hold the button on the last click and then\nlet go when the desired color is reached.\n\n  * 7H: Next aux LED color.\n\nOn most lights, the colors follow this sequence:\n\n  * Red\n  * Yellow (Red+Green)\n  * Green\n  * Cyan (Green+Blue)\n  * Blue\n  * Purple (Blue+Red)\n  * White (Red+Green+Blue)\n  * Disco (fast random colors)\n  * Rainbow (cycles through all colors in order)\n  * Voltage (uses color to display battery charge)\n\nIn voltage mode, the colors follow the same sequence, in the same order as a\nrainbow... with red indicating a low battery and purple indicating a full\nbattery.\n\nFor lights with a button LED, the button LED typically stays on while the main\nemitters are on. Its brightness level is set in a way which mirrors the main\nLED \u2013 off, low, or high.\n\nFor lights with a RGB button LED, the button LED indicates battery charge\nduring use in the same manner as the aux LED voltage mode.\n\nFor lights with front-facing aux LEDs, the aux LEDs typically stay off when\nthe main emitters are on, and when the light is otherwise awake. The aux LEDs\non most lights only turn on when the light is asleep.\n\n## Misc Config Menu\n\nSome models may have an extra config menu for settings which don\u2019t fit\nanywhere else. These settings are, in order:\n\n  * Tint ramp style:\n\n0 = smooth (blend channels in any proportion) 1 = toggle (only one channel\nactive at a time)\n\n  * Jump Start level:\n\nSome lights are prone to starting up slowly at low levels, so they have an\noption to \u201cjump start\u201d the engine by pulsing a higher power level for a few\nmilliseconds when changing from off to a low level. This setting specifies how\nbright that pulse should be.\n\nThe value can be from 1 to 150, but is usually between 20 and 50.\n\nThese settings are hardware-specific and may not be present on all lights. The\nnumber of settings in the global menu depends on the hardware model and the\nfirmware version.\n\n## Tint Ramping\n\nSome lights have more than one set of LEDs which can be adjusted to change the\ncolor temperature of the light. On these models, there is a global button\nmapping which works at all times unless it\u2019s overridden by the mode the light\nis in:\n\n  * 3H: Tint ramping\n\nSo, at almost any time, 3H, and it can change the color of the light. This is\nbest done with the light at a moderately high level, because it makes the\nchanges smooth. Low levels have more coarse resolution and will typically\nchange in very visible steps.\n\nAt both ends of the tint ramp, there is an \u201cauto tint\u201d mode. This\nautomatically chooses a tint based on the brightness level... so it can be\nwarm white while dim, or cool white while bright. Or vice-versa. To access\nthis, ramp to the end of the tint range, then keep holding until the light\nblinks a second time.\n\nThe misc config menu also has a setting to choose a tint ramp style. This can\nbe smooth, allowing the user to smoothly blend both channels in whatever ratio\nthey desire... or it can be \u201ctint toggle\u201d style, where only one channel is\nactive at a time.\n\n## UI Reference Table\n\nThis is a table of all button mappings in Anduril, in one place:\n\nMode| UI| Button| Action  \n---|---|---|---  \nOff| Any| 1C| On (ramp mode, memorized level)  \nOff| Any| 1H| On (ramp mode, floor level)  \nOff| Any| 2C| On (ramp mode, ceiling level)  \nOff| Simple| 2H| On (momentary ceiling level)  \nOff| Full| 2H| On (momentary turbo)  \nOff| Any| 3C| Battcheck mode  \nOff| Full| 3H| Strobe mode (whichever was used last)  \nOff| Any| 4C| Lockout mode  \nOff| Full| 5C| Momentary mode  \nOff| Full| 7C| Aux LEDs: Next pattern  \nOff| Full| 7H| Aux LEDs: Next color  \nOff| Full| 9H| Misc config menu (varies per light)  \nOff| Full| 10C| Enable Simple UI  \nOff| Simple| 10H| Disable Simple UI  \nOff| Full| 10H| Simple UI ramp config menu: 1: floor, 2: ceiling, 3: steps, 4:\nturbo style  \nOff| Any| 13H| Factory reset (on some lights)  \nOff| Any| 15+C| Version check  \nRamp| Any| 1C| Off  \nRamp| Any| 1H| Ramp (up, with reversing)  \nRamp| Any| 2H| Ramp (down)  \nRamp| Any| 2C| Go to/from ceiling or turbo (configurable)  \nRamp| Full| 3C| Change ramp style (smooth / stepped)  \nRamp| Any| 3H| Tint ramping (on some lights)  \nRamp| Full| 3H| Momentary turbo (on lights without tint ramping)  \nRamp| Any| 4C| Lockout mode  \nRamp| Full| 5C| Momentary mode  \nRamp| Full| 5H| Sunset timer on, and add 5 minutes  \nRamp| Full| 7H| Ramp config menu (1: floor, 2: ceiling, 3: speed/steps)  \nRamp| Full| 10C| Turn on Manual memory and save current brightness  \nRamp| Full| 10H| Ramp Extras config menu: 1: enable automatic mem, 2: set\nmanual mem timeout, 3: ramp after moon or not, 4: advanced UI turbo style  \nLockout| Any| 1C/1H| Momentary moon (lowest floor)  \nLockout| Any| 2C/2H| Momentary moon (highest floor, or manual mem level)  \nLockout| Any| 3C| Unlock (go to Off mode)  \nLockout| Any| 4C| On (ramp mode, memorized level)  \nLockout| Any| 4H| On (ramp mode, floor level)  \nLockout| Any| 5C| On (ramp mode, ceiling level)  \nLockout| Full| 7C| Aux LEDs: Next pattern  \nLockout| Full| 7H| Aux LEDs: Next color  \nLockout| Full| 10H| Auto-lock config menu (1: set timeout)  \nStrobe (any)| Full| 1C| Off  \nStrobe (any)| Full| 2C| Next strobe mode  \nStrobe (any)| Full| 3H| Tint ramping (on some lights)  \nStrobe (any)| Full| 5C| Momentary mode (using current strobe)  \nCandle| Full| 1H/2H| Brighter / dimmer  \nCandle| Full| 5H| Sunset timer on, add 5 minutes  \nParty strobe| Full| 1H/2H| Faster / slower  \nTactical strobe| Full| 1H/2H| Faster / slower  \nBiking| Full| 1H/2H| Brighter / dimmer  \nLightning| Full| 1H| Interrupt current flash or start new one  \nBatt check| Any| 1C| Off  \nBatt check| Full| 2C| Next blinky mode (Temp check, Beacon, SOS)  \nBatt check| Full| 7H| Voltage config menu  \nTemp check| Full| 1C| Off  \nTemp check| Full| 2C| Next blinky mode (Beacon, SOS, Batt check)  \nTemp check| Full| 7H| Thermal config menu  \nBeacon| Full| 1C| Off  \nBeacon| Full| 1H| Configure beacon timing  \nBeacon| Full| 2C| Next blinky mode (SOS, Batt check, Temp check)  \nSOS| Full| 1C| Off  \nSOS| Full| 2C| Next blinky mode (Batt check, Temp check, Beacon)  \nMomentary| Full| Any| On (until button is released)  \nMomentary| Full| Disconnect power| Exit Momentary mode  \nConfig menus| Full| Hold| Skip current item with no changes  \nConfig menus| Full| Release| Configure current item  \nNumber entry| Full| Click| Add 1 to value for current item  \nNumber entry| Full| Hold| Add 10 to value for current item  \n  \n## Additional Resources\n\n  * BudgetLightForum: Anduril ... 2?\n  * BudgetLightForum: Anduril 2 UI diagrams\n  * /r/flashlight: Anduril 2 explained\n  * Patreon: ToyKeeper\n\n\u00ab Previous Sourcetable Employee #1: Job, Notes, and Review\n\nNext \u00bb Apple Fall 2021 Event: California Streaming Notes\n\nQuestions?
