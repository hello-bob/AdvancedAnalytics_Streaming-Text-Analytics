He\u2019s now\nworrying about Xi Jinping\u2019s evident war preparations. (Metis Strategy photo)\n\nShare\n\nIn December 2021, Dmitri Alperovitch famously predicted that Vladimir Putin\nwould invade Ukraine\u2014two months before he actually did. A veteran\ncybersecurity maven and former chief technology officer at CrowdStrike, the\nfirm that uncovered the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee,\nAlperovitch has now expanded his horizons, warning in a new book, World on the\nBrink, that China\u2019s Xi Jinping is \u201clikely\u201d to invade Taiwan\u2014and may do so as\nearly as four years from now. It\u2019s a war that he acknowledges could provoke a\nfull scale military confrontation with the United States\u2014a conflict that in\nsome senses has already begun in what Alperovitch describes as a new Cold War.\nIn an interview with SpyTalk, Alperovitch explained his reasoning as well as\nthe nature of the China threat\u2013 including evidence of recent cyber espionage\nattacks by a Chinese military hacking group known as Volt Typhoon that may be\nmore alarming than anybody realized. What follows is an edited transcript of\nthe conversation.\n\nSpytalk: So you start out the book with this nightmare scenario of a full\nblown Chinese invasion of Taiwan\u2014gunships, guided missile destroyers, kamikaze\ndrones as part of a meticulously coordinated attack on the island. Tell us why\nyou think this is where things are headed?\n\nAlperovitch: As you know, Michael, I was one of the first geopolitical\nanalysts to have predicted that Putin was going to invade Ukraine months\nbefore it happened. And the reasons that I believe drove Putin to invade\nUkraine\u2014that convinced me back then that this war was almost inevitable\u2014are\nexactly the same reasons that are playing out in the Indo Pacific and which\nare driving Xi Jinping to want to conquer Taiwan in his lifetime. Both of\nthese authoritarian leaders are in their early 70s, looking at the twilight of\ntheir careers, looking at their legacies, looking at their longevity and power\nand their own mortality. And when you look at Putin, what drove him, I\nbelieve, is a distorted view of history. He did not believe that Ukraine was a\nnation. He believed it belonged to Russia. He thought it was Russia's destiny\nand his personal destiny to bring it back, at least into Russia's sphere of\ninfluence, if not under full occupation. The same thing you're seeing in the\nIndo Pacific. Xi of course believes that Taiwan is not a state. It's also a\ndestiny of the Chinese Communist Party to take Taiwan because of course it is\nunfinished business since the end of that civil war in 1949, when Mao defeated\nChiang Kai Shek, but didn't fully defeat him, because he fled with 2 million\nnationals to Taiwan. So taking [Taiwan] has enormous symbolism for the Chinese\nCommunist Party to really finish off that civil war and finally complete what\nXi himself calls \u201ca rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d\n\nSpytalk: But all this has been the case for decades now. What\u2019s bringing this\nto the crisis level now that you're suggesting it is?\n\nAlperovitch: Well, in the case of both men, they're also driven by ego and\nthey want to be the ones to do it. And it's not an accident that Putin invaded\nUkraine when he did because he was looking at it again at the twilight of his\ncareer, 25 years in power, looking at how long he may stay in power, how long\nhe may live and wanting to have that accomplishment in the history books,\ngiven to him and no one else. The same thing is how it's playing out in China.\nXi is very explicit that this problem of Taiwan cannot be a transition to\nfuture generations. He says this on multiple occasions. Well, again, Xi is 70.\nIn 2027, he is up for another election as the leader of the Communist Party,\nand he\u2019s very likely to win that election for another five year term that will\nend in 2032, when he'll be 79. So I think in his mind, that window of likely\n2028 to 2032 is going to be the opportunity for him to accomplish this long\ndesired task...as the leader who will go into the history books, as the leader\nthat is greater than Mao. So that is why I believe the next four to eight\nyears are going to be very, very dangerous.\n\nSpytalk: So as you point out in the book, in the past when American presidents\nwere asked about the prospect of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, they have said\nthat we would \u201chelp\u201d Taiwan to defend herself. But President Biden has gone\nbeyond that: When asked in 2022, whether the United States would defend\nTaiwan, he flatly said, \u201cYes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.\u201d\nAre we committed to a full scale war with China in the event of an invasion of\nTaiwan?\n\nAlperovitch: We do not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. We do not\nhave the legal commitment. And every time Biden says something like this\u2014and\nhe\u2019s done it now four times\u2014the White House staff points out that the policy\nthat we call strategic ambiguity\u2014essentially, we are not acknowledging or\ndenying that we will come to Taiwan\u2019s defense\u2014remains in place. But there's no\nquestion that the president is inherently changing that policy, if not\nofficially, but certainly [it is being] transmitted to Beijing, transmitted to\nTaiwan, Japan, the Philippines, that he wants to defend Taiwan.\n\nThis is a very, very tough call, even if Biden has that desire...at best a\n50-50 decision. Because when you start looking at the impact of American\n[intervention], the loss of life you're going to have on the scale we haven't\nseen since World War Two, perhaps even eclipsing it \u2014the destruction of the\nworld economy\u2014potentially as much as $10 trillion can be wiped out in the\nfirst year of a conflict.\n\n> This is really, really big stakes. Now I argue that the stakes for losing\n> Taiwan are also enormous. ...If China invades, whether it wins or loses, it\n> will be just an absolute disaster for the world, for America, for Taiwan,\n> for China itself. So we have to do whatever it takes to prevent that.\n\nSpytalk: Can you explain that a little bit? I mean, clearly, if the Chinese\nwere to take Taiwan, they would be the preeminent naval power in the South\nChina Sea and in the eastern Pacific. But, Japan will still be there, South\nKorea will still be there. We will still have allies in the region. Why would\nit be the disaster for U.S. interests that you portray?\n\nAlperovitch: Well, let me tell you the implications. And this is not a\nhypothetical. I've had senior officials in Japan and other countries in the\nregion tell me what happens in their view if China takes Taiwan from their\nperspective: they will start acting as if they now have a new sheriff in town.\nAmerica is kicked out of the region, America is irrelevant. And they have to\naccommodate them in a way that the Central Asian states, for example, have to\nkowtow to Russia, or the states in the Caucasus like Armenia have to be in\nRussia's sphere of influence. When Russia says jump, they really have to say\nhow high and they don't have many other options. That is going to be Korea,\nthat\u2019s going to be Japan, that\u2019s going to be the Philippines, not by choice\nbut because they will have no other alternative. With the Chinese domination\nof that region. China will be able to set the rules of trade, the rules of\nsecurity in that region. Again, 50% of the world's GDP is in that region. So\nby kicking America out, by dominating that region economically, and from a\nsecurity order perspective, that will weaken American power. There will be a\nretrenchment of American power and a retrenchment of the American economy.\nThat will be a weaker America and it will be a much more dangerous world.\n\nSpytalk: So what do we do to prevent this?\n\nAlperovitch: We have to make sure that Xi wakes up every single day, looks at\nhimself in the mirror as he's shaving and says today is not the day. We have\nto create numerous dilemmas for him on the military front. We have to help the\nTaiwanese build up capabilities on that island to defend it. But we also have\nto do everything possible on the economic front, to make it clear to China\nthat the consequences of a conflict over Taiwan regardless of whether we\ndecide to come to Taiwan's aid, or not, are going to be devastating for their\neconomy. I advocate a policy of uni-directional entanglement. In other words,\nmaking China more dependent on us in critical technologies like\nsemiconductors, like artificial intelligence, biotech, and others, and making\nus less reliant on them so that they can\u2019t punish our own economy in areas\nlike critical minerals, which they dominate the processing of today, in areas\nlike green energy, solar batteries or electric vehicles that they are\nestablishing dominance now as well.\n\nSpytalk \u2013 Does that include steps such as banning TikTok?\n\nAlperovitch: Look, TikTok is not in my top 10 list of things we should do\nagainst China, but I'm certainly supportive of [banning] it. I think that\nTikTok is essentially a foreign media platform that is owned by a company that\nis operated and influenced massively by our adversary, the Chinese Communist\nParty. Half the American population using TikTok is a problem. We would never\nallow the main news channel of the Soviet Union to be broadcast as a major\nnetwork in the United States, right? In fact, we do have laws on the books\nagainst that. You know, one of the most specific examples here is Rupert\nMurdoch, when he tried in the 1980s [to buy media properties in the United\nStates]. He was prevented from doing so until he became an American citizen.\nSo why would we let a foreign media company from an adversary country have\nthat level of influence?\n\nSpytalk: You are primarily known as a cyber security expert, who famously was\npart of the firm, CrowdStrike, that first uncovered the Russian hack of the\nDemocratic National Committee in 2016. You write a lot about the enormous\nChinese hacking capabilities and actions inside the United States. And this\nhas been viewed for years as a threat that revolves around the giant theft of\nAmerican intellectual property. That is bad enough. But there's a darker view\nof Chinese hacking, which suggests that they actually may be embedding\nthemselves in our critical infrastructure to prepare for a future conflict\nwith the United States. How do you parse out the goals of Chinese hacking\noperations\u2014 straight out intellectual property theft or perhaps the more\nsinister aim of embedding themselves in our infrastructure?\n\nAlperovitch: That's a fascinating question, Michael. So as you know, the\nChinese have had a cyber offensive program for well over two decades. In fact,\ngoing back to the early 2000s, much of it, as you rightly say, has been\nfocused on theft on both traditional espionage of the type that we do\u2014stealing\ngovernment secrets, breaking into government networks\u2014and a huge portion that\nhas been based on stealing intellectual property from the private sector for\nthe benefit of their own domestic industries, effectively waging economic\nwarfare on this country that was largely unanswered until the Trump\nadministration came along and instituted the so-called 301 tariffs in response\nto that intellectual property theft, raising tariffs in China.\n\nVolt Typhoon, a Chinese hacking group, has been worming its way into utilities\nhere and around U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region, which Alperovitch\nworries could immobilize them if war broke out.\n\nHowever, in recent years, and the last couple of years specifically, you've\nhad a shift where you have this group that is called Volt Typhoon, believed to\nbe affiliated with the Chinese military, that is infiltrating networks that\nhave no commercial benefit whatsoever\u2014a small time water utility, a small\nelectric utility, particularly organizations in the Indo-Pacific region, where\nwe have U.S. military bases. There is nothing to steal there from an\nintellectual property perspective. But there is everything to gain from the\nability to potentially attempt to disrupt operations in the event of conflict.\nAnd that worries the U.S. government greatly, that this is pre-positioning for\npotential disruption to try to delay our ability to flow forces to the\nPacific, to defend Taiwan if it comes to that. And this is, you know, yet\nanother sign that this is not just rhetoric that they're preparing for\nconflict.\n\nAnother amazing sign is some satellite photos that were released just in the\nlast few weeks\u2014open source satellite photos of the largest military training\ncamp of the Chinese military in Inner Mongolia, where they built this\ninteresting road network. If you overlay that road network on the city of\nTaipei, the capital of Taiwan, it is exactly the same down to every sort of\nturn of those roads. And in the center of that road network, sits the\npresidential palace of Taipei, right? So they're not just talking, they're\npreparing. They're exercising. And you know, when you think about it, why\nwould you want to attack the presidential palace of Taipei? It's not a\nmilitary target, it is the seat of the government of Taiwan. And the only\nreason that you would practice potential special forces raids on that\npresidential palace is because you want to orchestrate a coup. You want to\ntake over that country.\n\nSpytalk: As Xi looks at the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and all the problems\nPutin has had, how does he process that and what lessons do you believe he's\ntaking from the Russian experience?\n\nAlperovitch: It is fundamentally unknowable, because we're not in his head. I\ndon't want to be in his head. He also doesn't strike me as a great learner to\nbegin with, so I'm not sure that he's learning any lessons from it. But you\ncould make the case on both sides that, you know, the case that some would\nmake and do make, is that he looks at the quagmire that Putin has found\nhimself in Ukraine, he looks at the economic impact of export controls and\nsanctions, some pressure on Western businesses to pull out of Russia, and he\nsays, I don't want any of that.\n\nBut I can tell you that I had a conversation with a senior Pentagon official\nearly on in the conflict, a couple of weeks into the war, and I asked that\nvery question. How do you think China is looking at the situation? And his\nresponse was, I think they're learning that the United States will not fight a\nnuclear power. Right? So perhaps he's learning that the Americans are\ndeterred, and they're seeing, of course, our debates about whether to provide\nUkraine with aid, they're seeing as being very slow to provide them with long\nrange weapons, and having restrictions on those weapons in terms of fighting\nRussia. And maybe they're saying, You know what, [the Americans] are gonna be\nscared, they're not going to interfere in defense of Taiwan. And if America is\nnot defending, we can take Taiwan.\n\n> Spytalk: Just to wrap up on Russia and Ukraine. You write in the book that\n> basically because American and NATO aid has helped the Ukrainians resist the\n> Russians, that they've lost the war. Its military has been decimated, its\n> stockpiles are depleted and it will take a decade or more to rebuild. But\n> then you also say, despite all the lofty rhetoric in the west, the Ukrainian\n> goal of regaining all of its territories might not be militarily achievable.\n> If that's the case, are we looking at an endless war of attrition? And is\n> there any strategy to change what seems to be the fait accompli on the\n> battleground, which is the Russians have Crimea and Donbass? The Ukrainians\n> have the West, and that's where this ends up?\n\nAlperovitch: Well, I've argued for a long time that this war is not going to\nbe endless. All wars ultimately do end. But it's going to continue on very\nlikely for a long time. In some ways. It's already been going on for 10 years,\nsince 2014. And, unfortunately, it can easily go on. And this is of course,\ndevastating for Ukraine, first and foremost, but that is a reality\u2014that as\nlong as Russia can keep sending men and storm trooper battalions against\nfortifications and lose them at astounding rates, they\u2019re gonna keep doing it\nuntil Putin or whoever replaces him one day decides to stop. But as I write in\nthe book, as you point out, Russia has been defeated effectively as a force to\nthreaten NATO. There's never been a moment in history, at least modern\nhistory, when NATO has been safer from Russia.\n\nSpytalk: But a major part of the argument for continuing to send military aid\nto Ukraine is because if they prevail there, then Putin will be emboldened to\nthen go after the Baltics or Poland or another NATO country. If, in fact,\nRussia is incapable of doing that, doesn't that take away one of the principal\nrationales behind continuing to fund the Ukrainian war effort?\n\nAlperovitch: So I never believed in that rationale. He has made it very, very\nclear that he is fearful of escalation with NATO. He wants to avoid it at all\ncosts because he knows he's weak. And he's of course much weaker now two and a\nhalf years almost into this war than he was at the beginning. Much of his army\nhas been decimated. 25% of the Black Sea fleet has been destroyed by the\nUkrainians, [and] that will take them decades to rebuild, if ever.. So NATO\nhas never been safer. But I do think that there is a strong case to defend\nUkraine and to help further weaken the Russian military as long as Ukrainians\nwant to keep fighting. That is both moral and legal because Russia is trying\nto change borders in Europe for the first time since 1945. They must pay a\nprice for it, a very hard price. So there are both legal, moral and strategic\nreasons to want to support Ukraine.\n\nWorld on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-\nFirst Century, by Dmitri Alperovitch (with Garrett M.

I see the pressures on XI\na bit differently, I agree that he would like to take Taiwan by force if\nnecessary. I also believe, however, that the understands that he will have to\nstrike US forces in the region at the start of any conflict bringing Japan,\nand probably Australia in from day one. It will also likely tip the balance of\nopinion in Japan and South Korea to go nuclear a development that does not\nwork in Beijing's favor. As stated the key is to keep Xi thinking that he\ncould possibly loose such a war which means our emphasis should be on Taiwan's\nability to kill Beijing's navy in the Strait.Expand full commentLike\n(2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nColin R ThompsonColin\u2019s SubstackMay 6I agree with Mr. Ford on this\ncase....mostly. The pressure of history on Xi is as great as any other\npressure. China's position has always been that Taiwan is a part of China and\nthat there will be a reunification., preferably peacefully, by force if\nnecessary. Time frame not stated, which gives wiggle room to Xi and those who\nfollow him as China's leaders. Xi threatens and provokes. Do did Mao, starting\nback before Xi was born. But Mao chose patience over power. So did all of\nChina's leaders since Mao. Why? No other choice, really, barring Taiwan's\noutright surrender Consider the enormity of such an invasion. The shortest\ndistance between China and Taiwan is 81 miles, all over water, roughly four\ntimes the distance from England to Normandy. Rockets can travel at incredible\nspeeds. Ships cannot. Preparations for an invasion would quickly become\napparent. Chinese ships chugging toward Taiwan would be sitting ducks. Chinese\nlosses would be enormous, possibly unsustainable. No one would win in the\nend.Couldn't China simply nuke Taiwan into surrender? Sure. But, again, at\nwhat cost to China? And China would still have to occupy Taiwan, a\nwasteland.Mr. Alperovitch and other like-minded pundits will continue to\nproduce dire commentary, preach doom and gloom and otherwise predict war, not\npeace. Let's hope they are wrong. And let's hope that the more practical among\nus will point out what is and isn't practical and do all we can to balance the\nnegativity that is thrust at us.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\n6 more comments...\n\nPutin Shooting to be Russia's Greatest Czar, Former Top Powell Aide Says\n\nLawrence Wilkerson also excoriates US arms makers for 'obscene profits' from\nUkraine war.\n\nMar 18, 2022 \u2022\n\nJeff Stein\n\n16\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Putin Shooting to be Russia's Greatest Czar, Former Top Powell Aide Says\n\nwww.spytalk.co\n\n1\n\nExclusive: FBI Agents Accuse CIA of 9/11 Coverup\n\nPreviously unreported interviews filed in court claim CIA is hiding\ninformation relating to a failed 'recruitment' effort\n\nMar 22, 2023 \u2022\n\nSeth Hettena\n\n77\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Exclusive: FBI Agents Accuse CIA of 9/11 Coverup\n\nwww.spytalk.co\n\n2\n\nHow the KGB Hooked Trump\n\n'American Kompromat,' a new book by Craig Unger, gets the lowdown from former\nRussian and U.S. spies\n\nJan 26, 2021 \u2022\n\nJeff Stein\n\n24\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How the KGB Hooked Trump\n\nwww.spytalk.co\n\n17\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Jeff Stein\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
