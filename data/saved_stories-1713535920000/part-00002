Credit: eLife\n(2024). DOI: 10.7554/eLife.84173\n\nSince Yale researchers first observed the ability of the anesthetic ketamine\nto dramatically improve symptoms in many patients with treatment-resistant\ndepression more than two decades ago, the drug has provided a powerful new\ntherapeutic option for mental health professionals.\n\nHowever, only 65% of patients treated with ketamine respond to therapy and a\nnew Yale-led study published in the journal eLife helps explain why.\n\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers found that\nketamine produces a variety of different response patterns in the brains of\nindividuals, an observation that challenges the widely held assumption that\ntreatments for mental health conditions produce the same effect in all people.\n\nThe study also found that the different ways that ketamine affects the brain\ncan be related to patterns of gene expression, a finding that might one day\nhelp predict who is most likely to respond to ketamine treatment.\n\n\"Collectively, these findings support the possibility for developing\nindividually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in\npsychiatry by using human neuroimaging,\" said Alan Anticevic, the Glenn H.\nGreenberg Associate Professor of Psychiatry and associate professor of\npsychology at Yale and co-senior author of the study.\n\nFor the study, the research team\u2014led by first authors Jie Lisa Ji, a former\ngraduate student in neuroscience at Yale, and Flora Moujaes, a postdoctoral\nfellow in Anticevic's lab\u2014analyzed fMRI data from 40 healthy individuals who\nwere administered a placebo followed by a ketamine injection.\n\nThey found that ketamine produced an unexpectedly wide variety of responses in\nthe brains of the participants. In fact, they found that ketamine produced\nmany more individually distinct \"functional connectivity signatures\" than has\nbeen observed in studies on the effects of psilocybin and LSD, the researchers\nreport.\n\nThe team also analyzed a database of gene expression patterns in the human\nbrain, which they compared to patterns observed in the ketamine responses.\nThis analysis showed that gene expression patterns for interneurons\u2014cells that\nmodulate excitatory activity in the brain\u2014were strongly aligned with the\neffects of ketamine in the human brain.\n\nThis approach may be used eventually to predict who is most likely to respond\nto ketamine therapy, researchers say.\n\nKatrin Preller, visiting assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of\nMedicine, is co-senior author of the paper.\n\nMore information: Flora Moujaes et al, Ketamine induces multiple individually\ndistinct whole-brain functional connectivity signatures, eLife (2024).
