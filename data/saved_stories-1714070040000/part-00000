You can upgrade anytime before\nthat.\n\n## Fedora 40: What's New?\n\nFedora 40 with the new art-style wallpaper\n\nFedora 40 goes subtle this time, making bleeding-edge tech improvements with a\nsafer approach.\n\nHere's what you get with Fedora 40:\n\n  * Desktop Environment upgrades (GNOME 46, KDE Plasma 6)\n  * New family of Atomic desktops\n  * Systemd hardening features for better security\n\n### Desktop Environment Upgrades\n\nFedora 46 with GNOME 46\n\nGNOME 46 is the highlight of Fedora 40, making things accessible, and\norganizing options in a cleaner way.\n\nThings like, a better-looking notification, an improved settings menu, a new\n\"System\" menu, and file manager improvements have made the Fedora 40\nexperience better than ever before.\n\nThe file manager (Nautilus) gets improvements in terms of performance, and\nfunctionality. You can find a new search button (in the top-left corner) along\nwith the older one with an updated icon.\n\nThe re-organized settings with a new \"System\" menu where you can access\noptions like language, date, and time, and the \"Privacy & Security\" entry\nlooks useful:\n\nWith GNOME 46, you also get GNOME's new snapshot app as the webcam app over\nCheese, which was the choice for Fedora 39. So, a good replacement there. I\nnoticed it with a fresh installation, but did not with an upgrade. So, I'm\nguessing you need to install it when you upgrade.\n\nYou can learn more about the GNOME 46 upgrades here:\n\nGNOME 46 Released: See What\u2019s New!\n\nGNOME 46 is a subtle but useful upgrade.\n\nIt's FOSS NewsSourav Rudra\n\nI have been using Fedora 40 since its pre-release edition, and now that it is\nhere, I can say that the user experience has been excellent.\n\nSure, the usual annoyances with Discord/Nvidia that I shared during my switch\nfrom Ubuntu to Fedora still exist \ud83d\ude44\n\nBut, I like it so far. I might decide to hop on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS when it is\nreleased.\n\nOf course, if you are leaning towards the KDE Plasma 6 side with the atomic\ndesktop Fedora 40 Kinoite, it will be yet another refreshing experience.\n\nKDE Plasma 6 is a big change. You get better HDR support, Wayland by default,\na better Discover app, and plenty of other refinements.\n\nYou can learn all about that here:\n\nKDE Plasma 6: The Big Release is Here!\n\nKDE Plasma 6, the much-awaited upgrade, is here. Let\u2019s take a look at it.\n\nIt's FOSS NewsSourav Rudra\n\n### Atomic Desktops\n\nFedora featured immutable distros like Silverblue as one of its spins.\nHowever, with Fedora 40, they decided to use the term \"Atomic\" over immutable,\nand categorize their special spins as a family of atomic desktops.\n\nSome newer spins have been re-named in the process, and the atomic desktops\ninclude:\n\n  * Fedora Silverblue\n  * Fedora Kinoite\n  * Fedora Sway Atomic (formerly known as Fedora Sericea)\n  * Fedora Budgie Atomic (formerly known as Fedora Onyx)\n\n### Linux Kernel 6.8\n\nUndoubtedly, Fedora 40 comes with the latest Linux kernel 6.8.\n\nWith this, you get plenty of new hardware support and compatibility\nimprovements across the board. You can explore more about the kernel features\nhere:\n\nLinux Kernel 6.8 Released! Goes Big On Hardware Support\n\nRaspberry Pi 5 graphics, Intel Xe, Snapdragon, Nintendo, you name it. You will\nprobably find it here.\n\nIt's FOSS NewsAnkush Das\n\n### Other Technical Changes\n\nThere are many useful under-the-hood changes in Fedora 40. Starting with the\nNetworkManager getting the new ability to address conflicts of duplicate IPv6\naddresses in the same physical network.\n\nThis would help resolve connectivity issues.\n\nIn addition, Fedora 40 enables high level systemd security hardening settings.\nIt aims to isolate and sandbox system services for enhanced protection.\n\nFor a better network privacy, Fedora 40 randomizes the Mac addresses for each\nWi-Fi connection with a stable/individual address to reduce passive\nsurveillance by Internet Service Providers.\n\n### Package Updates & Improvements\n\nOf course, Fedora 40 comes with updated apps, and packages under-the-hood.\n\nSome of these updates include:\n\n  * Firefox 125\n  * Ruby 3.3\n  * PHP 8.3\n  * Podman 5\n  * Wget replaced by Wget2 (a modern alternative)\n  * PyTorch for Fedora is now packaged in the repository for seamless integration\n\nFor more details on the technical changes, you can refer to the official\nchangelog and the announcement.\n\n## Install Fedora 40 and Get Started\n\nYou can download the Fedora 40 workstation flagship edition or any of its\natomic desktop spins from its official website or official ISO repo (if the\ndownload webpage is not yet updated at the moment).\n\nOnce you get it installed, you might want to follow some of our post-\ninstallation tips for an enhanced experience:\n\n17 Things to Do After Installing Fedora 40\n\nInstalled Fedora 40 on your system?
