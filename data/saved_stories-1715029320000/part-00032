In that time, it's an understatement to say that I've learned a lot.\nOne of the things I've learned is that a lot of founders, myself included,\nignore some pretty crucial business metrics. One of those metrics that we'll\nbe talking about today is time-to-convert.\n\nWhen I first started Keygen, I did what everybody probably does and set up a\n14-day free trial. What I quickly found is that it's very hard for a potential\ncustomer to integrate a software licensing API into their entire stack within\na 14 days timeframe.\n\nSo I started offering free trial extensions. I'd push this on my pricing page,\nin onboarding emails, in follow up emails, etc. I wanted to make potentional\ncustomers aware that they had more time.\n\nWhat I found over the next couple years was that the majority of converting\ncustomers had asked for a free trial extension. And out those that did and\nthose that didn't, my conversion rate was higher when they did ask for one.\n\nWas there a reason why this was the case? Possibly!\n\nWhen I extended a trial, I would require the potential customer to put a card\non file before I extended their trial. So we go from free trial without a\ncard, to free trial with a card. Much better.\n\nYou may be thinking \u2014 what does this have to do with time-to-convert?\n\nWe'll get there.\n\nAnyways \u2014 after discovering that free trial extensions increase conversion\nrate, I started personally sending emails to potentional customers that were\nnearing their trial's end to offer a trial extension. This was a pretty big\nsuccess.\n\nSo much of a success, actually, that I stopped being so strict about requiring\na card be put on file \u2014 mainly out of laziness \u2014 because it was such an\nannoying back-and-forth step to do before extending a potential customer's\ntrial.\n\nUnintuitively to what I learned prior, this didn't hurt conversion rate (so\nthat potential reason for a higher conversion rate was moot).\n\nI chugged along manually extending trials for a couple more years.\n\nThen I got fed up with limited metrics from Baremetrics and replaced it with a\nRake task. I no longer use that Rake task (it didn't scale as my Stripe\ncustomer count grew), but through that, I learned about my time-to-convert,\nwhich is a crucial business metric that remains unknown to many, many founders\n(myself included at the time).\n\nWhat is time-to-convert? It's the time it takes from a customer signing up to\na customer paying you. Pretty simple.\n\n(For brevity, I'll refer to this metric as TTC.)\n\nSo why was this such a big deal?\n\nWell, because my 14-day free trial didn't line up with the time it takes a\ncustomer to realize value from Keygen \u2014 to get to that fork in the road where\nthey can decide \"is this worth my money?\"\n\nI gave them 14 days to get to that fork.\n\nBut my p50 TTC is 41 days. My p90, 130 days; p95, 198; p99, 290.\n\nIf you want to calculate yours using Stripe Sigma, try this query:\n\n    \n    \n    SELECT\n    \n    format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.5)) AS time_to_convert_p50,\n    \n    format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.9)) AS time_to_convert_p90,\n    \n    format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.95)) AS time_to_convert_p95,\n    \n    format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.99)) AS time_to_convert_p99\n    \n    FROM (\n    \n    SELECT\n    \n    DATE_DIFF('day', MIN(customers.created), MIN(charges.created)) AS time_to_convert,\n    \n    customers.id\n    \n    FROM\n    \n    customers\n    \n    INNER JOIN charges ON charges.customer_id = customers.id\n    \n    WHERE\n    \n    customers.created BETWEEN DATE_ADD('year', -1, CURRENT_DATE) AND CURRENT_DATE\n    \n    AND charges.paid = TRUE\n    \n    AND charges.amount > 0\n    \n    GROUP BY\n    \n    customers.id\n    \n    )\n\nAs I mentioned, I realized that what I was really doing was asking people to\nsign up now and complete a proof-of-concept integration in 14 days. This\nincludes reading documentation, onboarding, and planning and executing a\nproof-of-concept (PoC).\n\nBut my median TTC is 41 days!\n\nThat just doesn't work.\n\nUnderstanding and integrating a new API can be a lot. On top of other\nprojects, it can end up being impossible to do in 14 days, from first\ndiscovery to being integrated (or at least with a PoC in-hand).\n\nWhat I was really asking potential customers to do was wait.\n\nWait until they're ready to start understanding the API.\n\nWait until they're ready to go through onboarding.\n\nWait until the PoC is planned.\n\nWait until dev is freed up.\n\nWait. Wait. Wait.\n\nWhat ends up happening is that people get busy and they end up seeing that 14\nday deadline, determine that they're not ready yet, so they bounce until they\nare ready, but then they never come back.\n\nI decided that I needed to remove that friction. I wanted to capture these\nleads as soon as they decide Keygen may be the solution for them. So\nultimately, I can start nurturing these leads.\n\nSo I did what every bootstrapper tells you to never do...\n\nI added an unlimited trial, a.k.a. a free tier.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nOverall sign ups increased, of course, as it always does with a free tier. But\nby segmenting out users that stay on the free tier, I found paid sign ups also\nincreased, with conversion rate staying steady, but now with no manual work. I\nsay that's a win-win.\n\nSo, what's your TTC?\n\nUntil next time.\n\n\u00a9 2016\u20132024 Keygen LLC \u2013 All Rights Reserved \u2013 Reach out <hello@keygen.sh>\n\n  * Status\n  * Security\n  * Changelog\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * SLA\n  * Integrate\n  * Compare\n  * Affiliates\n  * Blog\n  * Jobs\n  * License\n  * CLA\n\n", "frontpage": true}
