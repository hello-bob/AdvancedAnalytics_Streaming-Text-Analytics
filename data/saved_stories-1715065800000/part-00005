This dynamic is endemic across corporations and is lame.\"\n\nUlevitch said one effect is \"the decline of small businesses that power\nAmerica's industrial and manufacturing base,\" as people in these industries\nage out of the workforce, the work gets outsourced abroad, and these jobs are\nseen as less desirable than white-collar gigs. He also pointed to another\nconsequence:\n\n\"Another issue with all the 'BS' jobs in large corporations is that it takes\nprofits away from shareholders who are most often the pensioners and\nretirement accounts of the rest of America,\" he said. \"So those people aren't\njust being useless (and being coddled to think useless jobs actually matter \u2013\nthey don't), but they are also taking money away from the rest of the\nworkforce's retirement programs.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nUlevitch went on to point the finger at Google specifically, calling it \"an\namazing example.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I don't think it's crazy to believe that half the white-collar staff at\nGoogle probably does no real work,\" he said. \"The company has spent billions\nand billions of dollars per year on projects that go nowhere for over a\ndecade, and all that money could have been returned to shareholders who have\nretirement accounts.\"\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached by email,\nUlevitch told BI, \"My only comment is that I think it ranks as one of the\nleast controversial things I've ever said.\"\n\nOther VCs have also entered the debate around \"fake work\" and overstaffing\nwithin Big Tech in recent years.\n\nMarc Andreessen has criticized a managerial \"laptop class\" and tweeted in\n2022, \"The good big companies are overstaffed by 2x. The bad big companies are\noverstaffed by 4x or more.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTech investor and PayPal Mafia member Keith Rabois last year attributed mass\nlayoffs and Meta and Google to this.\n\n\"All these people were extraneous, this has been true for a long time, the\nvanity metric of hiring employees was this false god in some ways,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing for these people to do...it's all fake work,\" he continued.\n\"Now that's being exposed, what do these people actually do, they go to\nmeetings.\"\n\nThomas Siebel, the billionaire CEO of C3.ai, said last year that Google and\nMeta overhired staff and didn't have enough work for them to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They really were doing nothing working from home,\" he said. \"If you want to\nwork from home, like four days of work in your pajamas, go to work for\nFacebook.\"\n\nWhile some tech workers say they've had to \"basically fight to find work,\"\nothers say bad management is to blame, with bosses overhiring and assigning\nworkers busy work to make themselves look more important and secure\npromotions.\n\nTech firms like Meta and Google laid off thousands of workers in recent years,\noften citing an interest in becoming more efficient.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 would be the company's \"year of\nefficiency\" and expressed his distaste for a bloated organizational structure\nof \"managers managing managers.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly told\nstaff in a 2022 all-hands that \"there are real concerns that our productivity\nas a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount we have.\"\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Nearly 50,000 tech workers have been laid off \u2014 but there's a hack\nto avoid layoffs\n\nGoogle Work Tech\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
