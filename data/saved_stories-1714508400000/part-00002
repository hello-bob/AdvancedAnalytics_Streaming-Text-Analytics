These \u201cstore now, decrypt later\u201d\nattacks happen when attackers collect encrypted data and store it for future\nuse when new decryption methods are potentially developed using quantum\ncomputers or encryption keys.\n\nSystems often need to maintain compatibility with older hardware and software\nthat may not support the latest versions of TLS or newer cryptographic\nalgorithms, explained Jason Soroko, senior vice president of product at\nSectigo. To ensure broader accessibility, Soroko said some systems might\ncontinue to support older, less secure versions of TLS.\n\n\u201cThe larger key sizes associated with postquantum algorithms are simply not\nexpected by some of these legacy systems, and that\u2019s resulting in the broken\nTLS connections,\u201d said Soroko. \u201cThis highlights one of the main difficulties\nwe are going to have to secure systems in the postquantum world. We should not\nlet this problem impede progress. Instead, we should let it educate us to see\nwhat proportion of systems are badly in need of an upgrade.\u201d\n\nTom Siu, chief information security officer at Inversion6, added that browser-\nbased upgrades are the tail end of the patch chain, and server-based upgrades\nshould have been done earlier. Since Google has been testing this Chrome\nencryption enhancement since August, Siu said what we are seeing is the\ninevitable game of catch up for server admins and organizations that have\nolder software dependencies.\n\n\u201cI'm not certain of the urgency of the risk of stored encrypted sessions for\npostquantum playback attacks, because it would require the attackers to have\nwell-established indexing of large stored session traffic,\u201d said Siu. \u201cThe\ntopic of \u2018time-based security\u2019 applies, where the data sensitivity decreases\nas time passes. Therefore, any future playback attacks, and possible\ndecryption would yield low yield of data returns months to years after the\nencrypted key sessions have been recorded.\u201d\n\nLionel Litty, chief security architect at Menlo Security, added that the\nbroken connections are not too concerning because rolling out changes in TLS\noften comes with similar breakages and these get worked out over time.\n\n\u201cVendors and system administrators now need to do their part, by releasing\nfixes for their software and rolling these fixes out respectively,\u201d said\nLitty. \u201cWhile there's no need to panic, the sooner we broadly deploy\npostquantum algorithms the better.\u201d\n\nSteve Zurier\n\n### Related\n\nCloud Security\n\n##### Cloud sector rejects proposed know-your-customer EO\n\nSC StaffApril 29, 2024\n\nAhead of its imminent approval, the Biden administration's proposed executive\norder mandating U.S. cloud infrastructure-as-a-service providers to strengthen\nthe verification of their users' identities has received industry opposition\ndue to the increased financial and logistical burdens that would arise from\nsuch a rule, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm\nRecorded Future.\n\nCloud Security\n\n##### Misconfiguration exposes Empire Distribution data\n\nSC StaffApril 29, 2024\n\nU.S. independent record label Empire Distribution, which has worked with\nKendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent, had its sensitive data exposed as a\nresult of an environment file misconfiguration, Cybernews reports.\n\nAPI security\n\n##### Ten years of Heartbleed: Lessons learned\n\nDan RaywoodApril 29, 2024\n\nA look back at the Heartbleed bug and measuring its\u2019 legacy, impact and how\nsome view one of cybersecurity\u2019s biggest headaches as an important learning\nmoment.\n\n### Related Events\n\n  * Cybercast\n\n##### The regulatory landscape in 2030: What you need to know\n\nOn-Demand Event\n\n  * Cybercast\n\n##### How CISOs Adjust Security to the SaaS Transformation\n\nOn-Demand Event\n\n  * Cybercast\n\n##### A CISOs Guide to Effective Security Practices in Cloud Computing\nEnvironments\n\nOn-Demand Event\n\n### Get daily email updates\n\nSC Media's daily must-read of the most current and pressing daily news\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.
