Born in 1932 in\nTerrell, Texas, Dennard spent his early years on a farm with no electricity,\nattending classes in a one-room schoolhouse. In high school, Dennard\nestablished himself as a promising student but harbored no grand ambitions.\nWhen a guidance counselor suggested he pursue the growing field of electrical\nengineering, Dennard replied that he planned to join his friends at the local\njunior college.\n\nThen a band recruiter from Southern Methodist University discovered Dennard\u2019s\ntalents with the French horn and offered him an alternative path. Dennard\naccepted a scholarship to the university, where he studied electrical\nengineering. It was the first step toward what would become his crowning\nachievement: the invention of dynamic random-access memory, better known as\nDRAM, the revolutionary memory cell inside nearly every computer, server and\nconsumer electronic device on the market today.\n\n## Inspiration for DRAM\n\nPondering a presentation from the comfort of his couch\n\nIn 1958, Dennard completed his PhD in electrical engineering at the Carnegie\nInstitute of Technology, now known as Carnegie Mellon, and joined IBM as a\nresearcher. It was a time of technological ferment. A Texas Instruments\nengineer had just demonstrated the first integrated circuit, which laid the\ngroundwork for Dennard\u2019s own research. Engineers everywhere were focused on\nadvancing computer memory and logic, and no one more so than Dennard. He spent\nhis early days at IBM studying metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect\ntransistor (MOSFET) designs and circuit applications.\n\nWhat if he could store a bit of information in a single transistor? That\ninsight was the catalyst for DRAM.\n\nIn 1964, Dennard joined a microelectronics team intent on replacing the large,\nslow and power-hungry computer memory system \u2014 known as magnetic-core random\naccess memory, or RAM \u2014 currently in use. They developed an alternative system\nthat used six MOS transistors to store 1 bit of information on an integrated\ncircuit. While promising, the design was still too complex and its output too\nslow. Dennard wanted something faster, more elegant and cheaper.\n\nOne night while lying on the couch and pondering a presentation given by his\npeers earlier in the day, he had a notion: What if he could store a bit of\ninformation in a single transistor? The insight was the catalyst for DRAM \u2014\nDennard\u2019s most important innovation. Once the new technology came to market,\nit wiped earlier magnetic technologies off the map almost instantly and\nspearheaded dramatic progress in memory capacity and speed. Today, Dennard\u2019s\ninvention has permeated modern life.\n\n## Dennard\u2019s law\n\nNewer, smaller, ever-more-powerful memory chips\n\nDRAM is not Dennard\u2019s only contribution to the evolution of 21st century\ntechnology. In 1972, he outlined a theory that set the framework for computers\nto get smaller, faster and more efficient every year.\n\nKnown as Dennard scaling, or Dennard\u2019s law, the theory was based on Moore\u2019s\nlaw, which posits that the number of transistors that can be fit into a given\nspace will double approximately every two years. Dennard scaling predicted\nthat the performance of each watt would increase at roughly the same rate. In\nother words, power consumption would drop as transistors were made smaller,\nenabling chipmakers to increase processor clock speed without increasing power\ndraw.\n\nThanks to visibility gained from Dennard\u2019s law, consumers came to expect\nrapid-fire advancements in product performance and capability, but the theory\ncouldn\u2019t sustain the demand. As engineers whittled dimensions, transistors\nbegan to leak, causing the chip to heat up and consume more energy. By 2005,\nDennard\u2019s law broke down. But its impact on the ecosystem of newer, smaller\nand ever-more-powerful memory chips endures.\n\nDennard\u2019s work ethic and ingenuity shaped the culture at IBM\u2019s Thomas J.\nWatson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, a long-standing\nintellectual hive of top scientists and electrical engineers. Dennard became a\ncornerstone of the institution, where he hatched 75 US patents.\n\n## A career based on creativity\n\nDennard is lavished in honors and awards\n\nRuss Lange, an IBM Fellow and a former IBM vice president of technology, spent\ndecades working alongside Dennard and recalled his intrepid commitment to\ninnovation. \u201cBob and I would always have lively discussions about whether\nthere was going to be an end to the scaling,\u201d Lange said. \u201cAnd he would say,\n\u2018Yes, there\u2019s an end to scaling. But there\u2019s no end to creativity.\u2019\u201d\n\nThroughout his half-century career at IBM, Dennard won a slate of awards in\nrecognition of his seminal contributions. He was declared an IBM Fellow in\n1979, received the US National Medal of Technology from President Reagan in\n1988, was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1997, and\nreceived the prestigious IEEE Medal of Honor in 2009. Most recently, in 2019,\nthe Semiconductor Industry Association bestowed upon Dennard the Robert N.\nNoyce Award, the industry\u2019s highest honor.\n\nThough Dennard retired the French horn that paved his way, he never gave up\nhis love of music. Throughout his retirement, Dennard continued to fuel his\ncreativity through choral singing and Scottish dancing, which he practiced\nwith his wife, Jane. Dennard died on April 23, 2024, at the age of 91.\n\nYes, there\u2019s an end to scaling. But there\u2019s no end to creativity.
