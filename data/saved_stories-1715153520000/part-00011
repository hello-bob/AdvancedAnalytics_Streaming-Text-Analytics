The paperclip-shaped digital assistant helped you\nperform guided tasks in versions of Office that came out between 1997 and\n2004. The software giant officially ditched Clippy with the debut of Office\n2007, but now it's back helping you with an open-source, third-party utility\ncalled Winpilot. It is designed to remove bloatware, disable annoying UI\ndefaults, and purge ads from Windows 11.\n\nProgrammed by German developer Belmin Hasanovic, Winpilot has been around\nsince 2023, when it was originally called BloatyNosy. Out today, version\n2024.5.6 adds Tiny11builder, a utility that creates a stripped-down Windows 11\ninstall ISO, to its suite of features. Other features include the ability to\nturn off personalized ads, restore full context menus, purge preloaded\nbloatware, and turn off Bing Cloud content search.\n\nTo help you navigate the various features of Winpilot, Clippy and its\nspeech/interaction bubble sit on top of the application's UI. When you first\nlaunch Winpilot, and throughout your interactions, Clippy will present you\nwith the ability to ask questions and with two suggested activities -- Check\nthe Windows version or \"Debloat my system,\" for example.\n\nIf you haven't asked or clicked on anything in the bubble yet, you'll get a\nrandom suggestion or comment from Clippy. For example, when starting up one\ntime, I got this nugget from the assistant: \"You know something, champ? This\nis bullsh*t. I started this gig in '97. My ultimate goal was to take over Bill\nGates job.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIf you perform an action, such as removing a piece of bloatware, the status\nand confirmation will appear in place of Clippy's comment at the bottom of the\nspeech bubble. For example, when I removed Microsoft Messaging, an item\nWinpilot suggested I get rid of, Clippy displayed the \"Package removed\nsuccessfully\" message. As I used the Tiny11 tool, I saw all of its status\nupdates, which would typically appear in a Powershell window in Clippy's\nspeech bubble.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nUnfortunately, I found the Clippy speech bubble to be kind of annoying as it\noften covered over key parts of the UI. The good news is that you can\ntemporarily make the bubble, though not Clippy itself, go away by clicking on\nanother part of the window. However, when you perform another action, the\nbubble will reappear to show you the status of what you've done and it will\nstill have the two suggested actions in it.\n\nIf you close the speech bubble, you might notice a text box that says \"Ask the\nsavvy Clippy,\" which I thought would invoke a natural-language search where\nthe assistant could help me use Winpilot. Instead, it's just a very basic\nsearch box that almost never found what I was looking for. For example, when I\ntyped \"bloatware,\" it told me that it had \"no matches found\" and suggested\nthat I \"ask @Copilot.\" However, when I typed just \"bloat,\" it gave me the\noption to \"Debloat my system.\"\n\n## Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Unlike\nWinpilot, this FireCube app allows you to put Clippy directly on the Windows\n11 desktop and connect it to GPT 3.5 (with an API key) so you can use it as a\ntrue AI chatbot.\n\nOnce I got past the novelty of seeing Clippy on my screen, I focused on the\nmany useful features of Winpilot that would work just as well -- or better --\nif the assistant weren't there. The main menu has four options: Block Ads in\nWindows 11, Skip the Bloat, Community Power and Tiny 11.\n\nBlock Ads in Windows 11 has a series of toggles that allow you to\ndisable/enable features from the OS. These start with a list of ad locations\nsuch as Start Menu ads and File Explorer ads, though File Explorer ads aren't\na thing right now (they were in one Insider Build). You can also turn off\nsending diagnostic data to Microsoft or disable the annoying Privacy Settings\nexperience at sign-in (if you skipped that during install). You can also turn\non Full context menus in Windows 11 or remove Bing results from Windows\nsearch, which I recommend.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe Skip the Bloat menu has a list of apps or features that Winpilot\nrecommends that you remove. In my case, this included Microsoft.ZuneVideo and\nWindows Maps. It also has a list of all apps you have installed so you can\ndecide what to remove.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe Community Power menu gives you a list of other features and optional\nextensions for Winpilot that you can install. I installed one feature called\nthe Chris Titus Tool, a PowerShell-based program that seems a lot like\nWinpilot. It allows you to turn off a variety of Windows features and remove\nbloatware. There's also an extension that enables secure AutoLogon and another\nthat clears event logs.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nNew for this version of Winpilot, the Tiny11 feature runs the popular\nPowershell tool, which generates a debloated Windows 11 ISO without many\nunnecessary features installed. It's just as easy\u2014or easier\u2014to use Tiny11 on\nits own as it is to invoke it from Winpilot, but I guess some users will like\nthe convenience of seeing it here.\n\nTo use Tiny11, you must first download a Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft and\nthen select the location of the ISO file when prompted by Winpilot, which will\nmount the ISO and assign it a drive letter. Tiny11 will then appear in a\nPowershell window and ask you which drive letter it's on (shouldn't it know?)\nand what version of Windows 11 you are installing if multiple versions are in\nthe ISO. Then it will take several minutes to generate the ISO for you.\n\nOverall, Winpilot doesn't do anything you couldn't do without it. However, it\ndoes put a lot of interesting functions in one place.

Which is humorously perfect.\n\nNow if only they allowed for switching between him, Robb-E, Einstein, and MS\nLogo again. I was particularly fond of Robb-E and MS Logo.\n\nReply\n\n  * EdwardB78\n\nVery funny about the Clippy, I'd like to try that. And where can I download\nit, please? Not a single word in your article mentions a download link.\n\nReply\n\n  * apiltch\n\nMy bad. I have put the link in the story. It's\nhttps://github.com/builtbybel/Winpilot\n\nReply\n\n  * EdwardB78\n\n> apiltch said:\n>\n> My bad. I have put the link in the story. It's\n> https://github.com/builtbybel/Winpilot\n\nThanks, then it should work now. I actually downloaded the Firecube thing, but\nit can do nothing except show Clippy on the desktop and looks completely\ndifferent.\n\nReply\n\n  * JamesJones44\n\nOMG... Now they just need to bring back Microsoft Bob and the circle will be\ncomplete.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nLinux can run on only 4MB of SRAM \u2014 Azure Sphere and SudoMaker's X1501 Pico\nshow off the extremes of Linux's small-scale potential\n\nGlobal chip materials market declined in 2023 \u2014 China is the only country to\nexperience growth\n\nIntel reportedly demands all board partners implement Intel Default (Baseline)\nProfile by May 31 \u2014 company hopes to fix issues with some Core i9 chips\n\n'Digital Twins' research gains $285 million in CHIPS ACT funding \u2014 virtual\nchip tech could revolutionize semiconductor manufacturing\n\nExplosive HBM demand fueling an expected 20% increase in DDR5 memory pricing \u2014\ndemand for AI GPUs drives production cuts for standard PC memory\n\nChipmaking to go subzero \u2014 3D flash memory manufactured at -70C with next-gen\ntool\n\nBluetooth device on Earth connects to satellite in orbit \u2014 Hubble Network's\nconnection spans 600km with more to come\n\nRobert Dennard, father of DRAM, is deceased \u2014 also known for his foundational\nDennard scaling theory\n\nXFX releases hulking quad-slot triple-fan AMD GPU \u2014 XFX Radeon RX 7900 XTX\nPhoenix Nirvana graphics card launches in China at $1,100\n\nRaptor Lake 9.1 GHz overclockers share secrets behind eclipsing a 17-year-old\nCPU frequency world record\n\nSony makes Helldivers 2 PSN account linking U-turn \u2014 gamer uproar and review\nbombing turned the tide\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
