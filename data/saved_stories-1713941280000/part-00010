It is used by both students and teachers to\ntest and sharpen their understanding.^[4] Practice is primarily seen in Zen\ntraditions, particularly Rinzai Zen and the Kwan Um School of Zen. In both, it\nis a key component in the Dharma transmission process.^[5]^[6]\n\nZen practitioners will often have a sanzen, where the student has a face to\nface interview with their master.^[7] This is also called nishitsu, which\nliterally means \"entering the room\" and refers to the student entering the\nroom for private dharma combat.^[7]\n\nAn exchange is initiated when a master issues a challenge to members either\nindividually or as a group.^[3] The master will use confrontation as an\nemotionally charged tool to push a student into immediate realization.^[3]\n\nThe Dharma combat usually appears to be in the form of a debate, with\nquestions and answers that seem illogical to an outside observer.^[3] These\nencounters may involve dialogues with non-verbal elements as well as\nverbal.^[8] An exchange between combatants will often show disjointed\ncomments, shouting and even slapping.^[3] These encounters, where the\nstudent's flaws in understanding or practice of dharma are exposed, have left\nstudents with a reluctance to enter the room used for combat.^[8]\n\nAs Peter D. Hershock asserts, the term itself provides insight into the risks\nof the encounter between student and master.^[9] Traditionally, Buddhism is\nknown for helping others to attain peace and freedom from affliction.^[9] The\nusage of a martial term to describe enlightenment, he attests, cannot be\naccidental.^[9] The student is in danger of losing the ability to maintain\ntheir prior chosen heading, much the same as in a battle.^[9]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe first known recorded examples of Dharma combat occurred during the\n\"Classical\" period of Zen history. Stretching roughly from 765 to 950 C.E.,\nthis period saw the rise of many Zen masters whose work is still widely\nstudied in modern Zen Buddhism today.^[10]\n\nOne of these masters was L\u00ednj\u00ec Y\u00ecxu\u00e1n (Rinzai Gigen in Japanese). Linji died\nin 866 and was the founder of the Linji school of Zen Buddhism during the Tang\ndynasty in China. Many examples of dharma combat can be found in the\ncollection of sayings by and about L\u00ednj\u00ec.^[11] On occasions the Dharma combat\nof Linji even extended to physical handling, as in the following example:\n\n> From the High Seat, the master said: \"Upon the lump of red flesh there is a\n> True Man of no Status who ceaselessly goes out and in through the gates of\n> your face. Those who have not yet recognized him, look out, look out!\"\n>\n> A monk came forward and asked: \"What is the True Man of no Status?\"\n>\n> The master descended from the meditation cushion, grabbed (the monk) and\n> said: \"Speak, speak!\"\n>\n> The monk hesitated. The master released him and said: \"What a shit-stick\n> this True Man of no Status is!\" Then he withdrew to his quarters.^[12]\n>\n> \u2014 L\u00ednj\u00ec Y\u00ecxu\u00e1n, The Zen Teachings of Rinzai\n\nIn another example, he recounts a question from Ma-yu: \"Of the eyes of the\nthousand-armed bodhisattva of compassion, which is the true eye?\"^[11] L\u00ednj\u00ec\nrepeats the question, adding \"Answer me! Answer me!\"^[11] Then, Ma-yu \"dragged\nthe Master down from the lecture seat and sat in it himself.\"^[11]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Tokush\u014d & Braverman 2002, p. 228\n  2. ^ Preston 1998, p. 140\n  3. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e Baroni 2002, p. 66\n  4. ^ Maezumi & Glassman 2007, p. 155\n  5. ^ Ford 2006, p. 219\n  6. ^ Kennedy 1995, p. 96\n  7. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Weber 2005, p. 80\n  8. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Leighton & Halifax 2003, pp. 283\u2013284\n  9. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Hershock 1996, p. 80\n  10. ^ Ferguson 2009, pp. 4\u20135\n  11. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Flores 2008, p. 123\n  12. ^ Schloegl 1976, pp. 11\u201312\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  * Baroni, Helen Josephine (2002).
