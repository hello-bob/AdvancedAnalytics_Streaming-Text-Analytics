The company also does not have a strong developer community in Africa.\n\nWhen Nigerian edtech startup, Flexisaf, decided to cut costs earlier this\nyear, it realized it needed to reduce its spending on technology.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s biggest costs was the money it paid Google to use its\nWorkspace \u2014 a collection of Google products including Gmail, Drive, Calendar,\nMeet, and Docs. Flexisaf had used Google Workspace since 2010, but with 100\nemployees now, it was becoming too expensive for the small business.\n\nIn March, Flexisaf found a solution to its problem in Zoho, an Indian company\nthat offered similar products as Google, but at a fraction of the price.\nFlexisaf has started the process of migrating to Zoho \u2014 once that is\ncompleted, it will save the company around 8,000,000 naira ($6,960) a year,\nSa\u2019ad Shehu, Flexisaf\u2019s people and talent manager, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is to introduce the mail and meeting tools first,\nand drive adoption of the other features within the coming months,\u201d Shehu\nsaid.\n\nZoho, a lesser-known rival of Google and Microsoft in the enterprise software\nspace, has been stepping up in Africa as an affordable alternative to the\nglobal giants. The company has hired local staff, introduced payment options\nin local currencies, and even sponsored a cricket tournament to dig its heels\ninto the market. But even as it has seen some early success, African tech\nexperts say Zoho needs to strengthen its branding and engage with the local\ntech community to give serious competition to its larger rivals in the future.\n\nThere is a tremendous opportunity for \u201cdigital transformation\u201d in African\ncountries, Praval Singh, vice president of marketing and customer experience\nat Zoho, told Rest of World. \u201cA lot of companies are adopting digital, either\nfor the first time or they\u2019re on that path of making their businesses more\nefficient using technology,\u201d he said. Rest of World spoke to seven startups in\nNigeria, Kenya, and South Africa that have ditched Google and switched to\nZoho\u2019s products over the past year or so.\n\nWhile Zoho launched in India in 1996, it was only in 2019 that it started on-\nthe-ground operations in Africa, with one salesperson each in South Africa and\nNigeria. Now, it has about 60 employees across the continent, Zoho\u2019s regional\nmanager for Africa, Andrew Bourne, told Rest of World. Besides work management\ntools like the equivalent of Gmail or Google Drive, Zoho sells software for\ncustomer relationship management, human resource management, and accounting,\namong other products.\n\nGlobally, Zoho has over 100 million users. Its clients include e-commerce\nmajor Amazon, leading carmaker Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Indian airline\nSpiceJet, and food delivery platform Zomato. Zoho\u2019s advantage over its bigger\nrivals is that it does not run ads or sell customers\u2019 data to third parties,\nSingh said.\n\nIn 2023, Zoho\u2019s user base in Nigeria grew by 50% year-on-year, while its\nrevenue from South Africa rose by 73%, Bourne said. The company refused to\ndisclose how many users it had in Africa or how much revenue it had made from\nthe continent. A Zoho spokesperson told Rest of World its clients include\nKenyan lifestyle app Pesapal, South African fintech Payfast, and events\nticketing portal Quicket. The company\u2019s combined annual revenue has crossed $1\nbillion.\n\nBut despite its initial success, Zoho doesn\u2019t have the same support for the\nlocal developer ecosystem as Google does in Africa, according to Prosper\nOtemuyi, a Nigerian software engineer and co-founder of ForLoop, an African\nnonprofit developer community. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough goodwill yet,\u201d Otemuyi\nsaid. \u201c[Google] has built an ecosystem of tools and support, [and] users are\nlikely going to hesitate before clocking out of [it], just as people would\nrather pay for an Apple product just to remain within that ecosystem of\ntools.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Zoho started allowing African companies to pay for its software in\nlocal currencies. This decision has been a major reason for Zoho\u2019s success in\nAfrica as it allowed customers and potential clients to avoid regulatory\nhurdles around dollar spending, Kehinde Ogundare, country director for\nNigeria, told Rest of World. \u201cWe saw the rise in adoption of Zoho technology\nin Nigeria when we started pricing in local currency and building a local\nsupport team.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, African companies can pay for Google Workspace only in dollars\nand euros, as verified by Rest of World.\n\n\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a naira equivalent for anything that\u2019s coming in dollars,\nZoho will win,\u201d Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of edtech startup AltSchool\nAfrica, told Rest of World. \u201cThey have great products and pricing \u2014 what\u2019s\nleft is to build trust and engage in strong marketing activities to completely\nshake out the big guys.\u201d Yusuf, who has co-founded three startups, said all\nhis companies now use at least one Zoho product.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft did not respond to Rest of World\u2019s queries about offering\nlocalized solutions in Africa, including adding payment options in local\ncurrencies.\n\nZoho has also been aggressive with its pricing in Africa. Zoho One, a bundle\nof more than 45 products, sells for just $6.70 per user in Nigeria, compared\nto $30 in the rest of the world.\n\nUsers in Africa have taken to social media to share their feedback on Zoho's\nproducts. X/@pyjama_ceo\n\n\u201cCost is the biggest driver for me,\u201d Neto Ikpeme, founder and CEO of Nigerian\nhealth-tech startup Wellahealth, told Rest of World. Ikpeme had opted for Zoho\nover Google when he launched his company in 2016. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s difficult\nenough to access dollars, and if you can, you might want to reserve it for\nother services that you can\u2019t pay for locally,\u201d he said. But the low pricing\nmay not be enough for Zoho to dethrone its larger rivals. Users told Rest of\nWorld the company\u2019s products lack sophistication.\n\n\u201cZoho hasn\u2019t done a design upgrade in a while and it is starting to get a\nlittle bit stale. They also need to have better mobile apps,\u201d said Vijay\nAnand, an Indian angel investor and founder whose startups use Zoho. When he\ntested Zoho\u2019s new Slack-like service, Cliq, Anand was disappointed by the lack\nof emojis and GIFs. \u201cIt\u2019s the one happy thing the teams have,\u201d he said.\n\nForLoop\u2019s Otemuyi said Zoho lacks a developer community that can support its\nproducts in Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s no strong community to leverage when you run into\na problem,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle has that in abundance and across the continent in\nterms of developers, startups, and IT professionals generally.\u201d\n\nZoho is partnering with local business communities, incubators, accelerators,\nand venture capital firms to tackle that challenge, Veerakumar Natarajan, the\ncompany\u2019s regional manager for East Africa, told Rest of World. In Kenya and\nSouth Africa, for instance, it has partnered with startup incubator hubs like\nJ-Hub Africa and Silulo Foundation, respectively, Natarajan said.\n\n\u201cGoogle is a lot bigger than we are in terms of size,\u201d Singh said. \u201cBut our\nportfolio, with a spread of 55-plus apps, is the most prolific in the\nindustry, owing to our bullish focus on [research and development].\u201d He said\nsome customers might use only Zoho, while others might use it along with\nGoogle\u2019s products to meet different needs. \u201cIt takes each of a kind to make a\nvillage,\u201d said Singh.\n\nDamilare Dosunmu is a Rest of World reporter based in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAnanya Bhattacharya is a Rest of World reporter based in Mumbai, India.\n\nRead more stories\n\nCreator Economy\n\nIndonesia taps influencers to convince people to move to its new, under-\nconstruction capital\n\nSocial media stars are downplaying fears of deforestation and boredom in\nNusantara.\n\nBy Michelle Anindya\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe regional flavors of labor-on-demand\n\nA new report digs into the social dynamics of gig work.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nAccess & Connectivity\n\nBangladesh built a tech park for 100,000 workers.
