These events, just\nthree days apart, built on damage suffered during another storm during the\nDecember 2023 holidays and another during the previous December.\n\n\u201cExtensive\u201d is the word that Peter Slovinsky, a marine geologist for the Maine\nGeological Survey, chose to describe the most recent damage during an\ninterview with Mongabay. He pointed to an estimate that 60% of Maine\u2019s working\nwaterfronts were severely damaged. \u201cWe saw numerous seawall failures and\nerosion of anywhere between 15 to even up to 30 feet [4.5-9 meters] of coastal\nsand dunes, and massive bluff failures also,\u201d Slovinsky said.\n\nThe common response to busted docks, condemned houses, shrinking shorelines,\ndisappearing dunes and faltering bluffs has been to bolster the shore with\n\u2018hard\u2019 infrastructure like concrete jetties and breakwaters of imported\nboulders. But those interventions are expensive, carbon-intensive, and\nultimately ineffective due to continual sea level rise.\n\nA worker stands on logs pinned down with rebar to hold sediment in place that\nwill be planted with salt tolerant plants for a \u2018living shorelines\u2019 project on\nthe Blue Hill Peninsula in Maine. Image by Erik Hoffner for Mongabay.\n\nIncreasingly, agencies like Slovinsky\u2019s have been experimenting with a more\nnatural and possibly more effective approach called living shorelines. The\nU.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines\nthese as \u201cprojects that connect the land and water to stabilize shorelines,\nreduce erosion, and provide valuable habitat that enhances coastal\nresilience.\u201d\n\nSuch projects often take the shape of phalanxes of buried Christmas trees that\nshore up dunes, mesh bags of shells placed to protect mudflats from erosion,\nand salt-loving grasses and shrubs planted to stabilize nearshore areas.\n\nDevelopment of living shorelines is widely credited to the late Edgar William\nGarbisch Jr., a chemistry professor turned wetland restorationist who piloted\nthe approach\u2019s early methods and philosophy during the early 1970s in\nChesapeake Bay. The aim is to protect coastal ecosystems like marshes and\nbeaches with natural assets that create habitat while anchoring the shore.\nThis method has gained increasing traction along much of the U.S. East Coast,\nfrom Georgia on north, as communities have begun to confront the impacts of\nhuman-caused climate change, including worsening storms and sea level rise,\nwhich is set to increase a further 0.6-1.2 m (2-4 feet) by 2100.\n\nWhile Maine\u2019s official experiments with such interventions at places like\nPopham and Pemaquid beaches have seen varying levels of success among their\ndunes and marshes, one Belfast area entrepreneur is innovating new ways of\nleveraging the living shorelines concept to protect another ubiquitous coastal\nfeature: sandy bluffs.\n\nOn a cold November morning, contractor Paul Bernacki showed a Mongabay\nreporter around his latest project site on the Blue Hill Peninsula in Midcoast\nMaine, where a homeowner had hired him to preserve an eroding bluff along\n2,000 ft (610 m) of shoreline. His vision for shoring it up differed greatly\nfrom others the property\u2019s owner initially approached: \u201cThe engineers and\ntheir contractors wanted to kill all the trees on the shore, move the bank\nback 10 feet [3 m] at the top, and then pile 200 truckloads of rocks all the\nway around,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTheir solution to stabilization is to kill nature. Is that technically\nfeasible for the whole coast of Maine?\u201d Bernacki asked.\n\nDrone image of the erodible bluff (bottom) being stabilized by tiers of logs\npinned to the ground, back-filled with soil, and planted with salt tolerant\ngrasses among erosion-slowing rocks to keep the rising waters at bay (top),\nfor a \u2018living shorelines\u2019 project on the Blue Hill Peninsula in Maine. Image\nby Erik Hoffner for Mongabay.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think so, and his team has been pairing a fresh take on the\nliving shorelines best management practices with power tools to shore up this\ncrumbling cliff and its line of oak trees and house in danger of tipping into\nthe salt pond below.\n\nThe home is perched on one of Maine\u2019s many so-called \u201cerodible bluffs.\u201d\nDespite the rocky shore postcard pictures, 40% of the state\u2019s coast is\nclassified as this mix of sand, rock and vegetation that\u2019s vulnerable to wave\naction and scouring by wind-driven blocks of ice. Bernacki\u2019s team shores up\nland like this not with imported rocks, but with natural and often local\nmaterials.\n\nAmong these are logs (sometimes including drift logs) and salt-tolerant plants\noften germinated from regionally wildcrafted seed stocks, plus imported\nmaterials like coconut fiber-based coir landscape fabric shaped into long\ntubes and filled with a matrix of soil and organics. These tubes,\naffectionately called \u201cTootsie Rolls,\u201d are positioned behind rows of logs\npinned down with rebar to form tiers and planted with salt-loving grasses like\nnorthern sea oats (Chasmanthium latifolium) or broomsedge (Andropogon\nvirginicus).\n\nSeaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), swamp milkweed (Asclepias\nincarnata) and white yarrow (Achillea millefolium) are also planted, and on\nthe bluff above these, perennial shrubs like winter berry (Ilex verticillata),\nVirginia rose (Rosa virginiana) and beach plum (Prunus maritima). Finally,\nrocks are placed among the logs to break up waves and scouring ice, until the\nplants\u2019 roots get established.\n\n  * A worker fills a natural coir fabric roll with soil, sand and organic matter before it's planted with salt tolerant grasses and shrubs for a new 'living shoreline' project in Maine.

NOAA estimates that living shorelines can cost less\nthan hard shorelines, both in terms of installation and maintenance, with\ncosts ranging from less than $1,000 up to $5,000 per linear foot\n($3,300-$16,400/m) of shoreline. Installing hard options, by contrast,\ntypically ranges from $2,000 and up per linear foot ($6,600/m), according to\nThe Maine Monitor. Maintenance of living shorelines costs about $100 per foot\n($330/meter) annually, according to NOAA, while repairing hard shorelines\ncosts from $100 to $250 per linear foot ($330-$820/m).\n\nWhile some say it\u2019s a winner on cost, that\u2019s also likely in terms of carbon if\none considers a life-cycle analysis of living shorelines, which is where\nBernacki stresses the big difference lies. \u201cThe carbon footprint of our work\nis minimal for the dollar,\u201d he says.\n\nFollowing the recent storm trio, he reported that his team\u2019s current project\nwithstood the elements well, with no damage to the newly established\nstructures or the bluff, which was also helped by the site being more\nprotected than if it were right on the bay. Still, some of the less salt-\ntolerant plants higher up on the bluff were inundated by the tide, and may\nneed replacing if they don\u2019t green up in the spring.\n\nPerhaps because Maine has been slower than other states to enact broad\nregulations for the various situations that living shorelines could apply to,\nlike erodible bluffs, such private- and contractor-led efforts are getting\ngreater attention from landowners, said coastal geologist Slovinsky. \u201cI\u2019ve had\nmore people than ever in the last couple of years call and say, \u2018Hey, my bluff\nis eroding, but I don\u2019t want to build a seawall, what do I do?\u2019 So, I point\nthem to our coastal property owner guide that I wrote a couple years ago,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAt Cutts Cove in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, fresh plantings of salt tolerant\nperennials populate the upland portion of a new \u2018living shorelines\u2019 project.\nImage by Erik Hoffner for Mongabay.\n\nIn nearby New Hampshire, which has worked living shorelines into state\nregulations already, there\u2019s a similar level of interest and several projects\nunderway at sites like Cutts Cove in Portsmouth, which also weathered the\nrecent storms well. And, like Bernacki\u2019s team, they\u2019ve made an effort to\nincorporate naturally available and sometimes free resources found onsite in\ntheir construction, like local plants, tree stumps and drift logs.\n\n\u201cThe thinking is that over time, as the tree stumps and drift logs decompose,\nthe near vertical riprap sill will slowly shift into a more gradual and\nnatural slope,\u201d said Grant McKown, a coastal habitat research associate for\nthe Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire, via\nemail. \u201cAdditionally, the use of drift logs and trees in the sill construction\nenhances the physical heterogeneity of the sill, providing additional refuge\nfor nekton (mobile aquatic animals) during high tide and additional surface\narea for macroalgae (like Fucus and Ascophyllum) to colonize,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIs it enough to successfully hold back the rising tides, though?\n\nBack in Maine, results vary. One Freeport-area homeowner reported in January\nthat their $40,000 living shoreline had been washed away. But while Bernacki\u2019s\ncurrent project fared fine, he was philosophical on the question: \u201cSuccess to\nme is restoring this habitat \u2014 instead of destroying more habitat to protect\nproperty,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, you really can\u2019t justify.\u201d\n\nNew York State\u2019s new Living Shorelines Act will require the Department of\nEnvironmental Conservation to encourage the development of projects like this\none, at Cedar Beach in Southold on eastern Long Island, as the preferred\napproach for stabilizing tidal shorelines in its oversight and regulatory\ndecisions. Image by Erik Hoffner for Mongabay.\n\nSo, everything is on the table after the recent spate of storms, including the\nold standby, Slovinsky said: \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m pessimistic about is the\nresponse that we\u2019re seeing thus far from these storms: more rock,\u201d in the form\nof rapidly rebuilt seawalls and breakwaters.\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to take advocacy and many more contractors to push his\nstate to roll out a regulatory regime for naturally protecting its iconic\nshore, both for official and private projects. But momentum is building among\nMaine\u2019s landowners, at least, who are increasingly willing to spend more for\nwaterfront property despite sea level rise: \u201cI\u2019m getting a new call once a\nweek,\u201d Bernacki said.\n\nSo, like the wetland plants sown by his crew, the number of landowners\ninterested to employ natural solutions, rather than piling up yet more rocks\nagainst an ever-rising tide, is also growing.\n\nErik Hoffner is a photojournalist and editor for Mongabay, find his latest\nthoughts and projects on Instagram, here, or at Bluesky.\n\nBanner image: Salt tolerant plants are part of a \u2018living shorelines\u2019 project\non the Blue Hill Peninsula in Maine.
