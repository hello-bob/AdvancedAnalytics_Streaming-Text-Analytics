I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019m Leaving You\u2019 in which\nhe shares his experience switching from Gmail to HEY Email, focused on the\nintentionality of using HEY. I loved the way he described feeling overwhelmed\nby a frictionless, unintentional world of software, and so I finished this\npiece to give my technologist perspective on HEY Email and how I want to see\nmore technology designed with opinionated defaults.\n\nWhen I was running my last company, I had a mountain of emails every day. My\nfriends told me to use Superhuman, an email client built by ex-Runescape\nintern Rahul Vohra, which touted a philosophy of GET TO INBOX ZERO at\nsuperhuman speed. My friends loved it, saying \u201cgetting through my emails is so\nfast!\u201d\n\nWhen I heard that, I thought it was cool but figured I was fine \u201cgetting\nthrough\u201d my inbox already\u2014I didn\u2019t really need a \u2018faster horse\u2019 to help me do\nit quicker.\n\nWhen I wound down my last company and stopped getting as many emails, I\nsuddenly realized that most emails I was receiving now were not from actual\npeople. I\u2019d get notifications on my phone for things like \u2018New StreetEasy\nListings,\u2019 and I\u2019d be disappointed that I broke my focus just to look at that.\n\nBut then one day, I saw a video of Jason Fried (CEO of 37Signals, the company\nthat made HEY) talking about the Screener in HEY Email, which keeps out\nunwanted emails. And instead of Superhuman\u2019s \u2018get to inbox zero ASAP,\u2019 I felt\nthat HEY was saying to me: \u2018just stay at inbox zero in the first place.\u2019 That\nfelt fundamentally different to me. Was it really possible? I tried the HEY\nfree trial and found out it was.\n\nThere are three defaults of HEY that made this a reality for me.\n\nThe core default that changed the fundamental email paradigm for me is the\nScreener. It forces me to make a choice every time I get an email from a new\nemail address. HEY asks if I want to get emails from them. If I say no, none\nof their emails ever touch my inbox. No more new Vercel product updates,\nTurboTax reminders, or political campaign donation requests. I used to have a\nseparate email just for signing up for crap I knew would spam me (you probably\nhave one too!). Now I just screen it out. This is completely different from\nthe current email paradigm of \u2018anyone who has your email address can email\nyou.\u2019 Gmail lets you block senders, but that\u2019s once they\u2019re already in your\ninbox.\n\nThe next default reframes the concept of an inbox. Instead of one inbox, HEY\nhas 3 inboxes already set up for you: Imbox, Feed, Paper Trail. You decide\nwhat goes where. I\u2019m sure Gmail lets you make labels and you can somehow set\nup filters and rules for your emails to go into different buckets but I was\ntoo lazy to do so.\n\nThe first is the Imbox. Not a typo. (The HEY team felt so strongly about\nnaming it this, that they literally made itsnotatypo.com). The Imbox is for\n\u201cIMportant, IMmediate emails.\u201d For me, these are emails from real people that\nI\u2019m conversing with over email. Like my family email thread where my uncle\nshares his photos of baby elephants (pics at end). This makes it really easy\nto track down real conversations I should be participating in.\n\nThe second is The Feed. This is for all my newsletters and \u2018announcements\u2019\n(Young the Giant is dropping a new album!). The Feed is specially designed so\nI can just browse headlines as if I\u2019m scrolling, well, a feed, and click into\nthe ones I want to read. I don\u2019t use the Substack app anymore because I can\njust browse all my newsletters here.\n\nFinally, the most mundane inbox: The Paper Trail. All of my receipts and\nconfirmations are routed here. These are actually the bulk of my email these\ndays. So it\u2019s nice to have them in one spot but not in the way.\n\nThe final default is extremely opinionated: no one should take your attention\naway. HEY does this by not having ANY push notifications for ANY emails by\ndefault.\n\nThis one made a huge difference in my life, and took a lot of adjustment.\nBefore HEY, I was constantly checking my phone because a Gmail notification\nwould pop up. It\u2019d just be a new newsletter post, some confirmation email, or\na promotion. Nothing important, but it broke my focus and split my attention.\nI missed some important emails early on because of this, but because of this\ndefault, I realized almost no emails are actually that urgent. And I\u2019ve since\nturned on notifications from specific senders that are important. Sure, you\ncould turn off notifications in Gmail, but that takes work. Defaults are\npowerful!\n\nThere are a lot of other great features of HEY, but these 3 things are how HEY\nhelps me engage with email differently. It\u2019s an opinionated alternative to\nGmail and Superhuman, focusing on email being a clean, intentional space that\nI come to. It\u2019s clean because it keeps emails out on my terms. It\u2019s\nintentional because I have a goal: \u201cLet me talk to X. Let me catch up on news.\nLet me pull up that receipt.\u201d It\u2019s a space I come to because there are no push\nnotifications; I am consciously choosing to check it. The defaults in HEY all\ndrive this home. Whereas Superhuman seems like the \u2018faster horse\u2019 of the\ncurrent email paradigm with amazing speed and efficiency; HEY has\nfundamentally shifted my experience of email because of its defaults.\n\nEmail used to give me anxiety, new push notifs for every little thing, a heap\nof unsorted outreach from strangers, key info and conversations with my family\nburied in the mess. I now love checking my email, talking with my family,\nseeing if there\u2019s any new goodies in there, choosing what comes in and out,\ncatching up on my newsletters, easily finding my flight confirmations.\n\nA lot of people dunk on HEY because it doesn\u2019t look super minimalist or have\nbuttery smooth animations. People often laud the \u201cclean\u201d feeling in products\nlike Superhuman. This is awesome, and I\u2019m so glad that software can be an\nartisanal craft that inspires beauty and aesthetic.\n\nBut I don\u2019t mind that HEY is a little slow or a little clunky. Because\nphilosophically, it\u2019s redefining my relationship to email in the way that I\nwant. And I think a lot more software can and will be built like this.\n\nI believe people will want to use commodity software (think website builder,\nemail client, todo list) that is 1) opinionated about how to use it, and 2)\naligns with how they want to engage with technology. As Ezra Klein says about\nHEY, it is \u201csoftware that insists that I make choices rather than whispers\nthat none are needed.\u201d I\u2019ve used other great examples of this like mmm.page,\nwhich doesn\u2019t make building a nice professional website easier/faster but\nrather redefines \u2018building a website\u2019 as playing on the internet\u2019s canvas. How\nrefreshing is that? There\u2019s other opinionated tech like Light Phone, a phone\ncompany whose slogan is \u2018designed to be used as little as possible,\u2019 and\nprovides you core phone apps (call, text, maps) on a simple Kindle-like\ndevice. I personally don\u2019t use a Light Phone\u2014and that\u2019s okay! Opinionated tech\nmeans some people won\u2019t align with it and won\u2019t use it. I think this is why\nopinionated tech is rarely funded by venture capitalists / is rarely built by\nventure-backed companies (VCs want your business to appeal to as many people\nas possible, like Gmail does).\n\nJust as music has its top 40 and alt-rock, I believe we should have more\n\u2018alternative\u2019 software. With AI making software smithing even easier, I\u2019m\nexcited to see an emergence of opinionated \u2018alternative\u2019 technology that\nemerges as digital native generations with a highly fragmented culture and\ndiverse set of values builds tools and experiences that align with the way\nthey want to engage with technology.\n\nOne of my uncle's baby elephant photos\n\n", "frontpage": false}
