The inelastic\nscattering events required for 3D chemical imaging are too rare, requiring\nhigh beam exposure that destroys the specimen before an experiment is\ncompleted. Even larger doses are required to achieve high resolution. Thus,\nchemical mapping in 3D has been unachievable except at lower resolution with\nthe most radiation-hard materials. Here, high-resolution 3D chemical imaging\nis achieved near or below one-nanometer resolution in an Au-Fe_3O_4\nmetamaterial within an organic ligand matrix, Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4 core-shell\nnanocrystals, and ZnS-Cu_0.64S_0.36 nanomaterial using fused multi-modal\nelectron tomography. Multi-modal data fusion enables high-resolution chemical\ntomography often with 99% less dose by linking information encoded within both\nelastic (HAADF) and inelastic (EDX/EELS) signals. We thus demonstrate that\nsub-nanometer 3D resolution of chemistry is measurable for a broad class of\ngeometrically and compositionally complex materials.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Imaging atomic-scale chemistry from fused multi-modal electron microscopy\n\nArticle Open access 27 January 2022\n\n### Atom probe tomography\n\nArticle 22 July 2021\n\n### Imaging built-in electric fields and light matter by Fourier-precession\nTEM\n\nArticle Open access 15 January 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nKnowing the complete chemical arrangement of matter in all dimensions is\nfundamental to engineering novel nanomaterials^1. Although electron tomography\nprovides comprehensive 3D structure at resolutions below 1 nm using elastic\nscattering signals^2,3,4, chemical tomography obtained from inelastic\nscattering remains largely out of reach. Several demonstrations of chemical\ntomography using electron energy loss or x-ray energy spectroscopy (EELS/EDX)\naccompanied the introduction of scanning transmission electron microscope\n(STEM) tomography and provide a milestone for 3D imaging^5,6,7,8. However,\nchemical tomography from core-excitation spectroscopy demands high electron\ndoses that almost always exceed the specimen limits (e.g., >10^7\ne/\u00c5^2)^9,10,11. If attempting chemical tomography, researchers must sacrifice\nresolution by collecting few specimen projections (e.g., 5\u201310) and constrain\nthe total dose (e.g., <10^6 e/\u00c5^2). Consequently, 3D resolution is penalized\nfrom undersampling and noisy chemical maps^12. Therefore, a paradigm shift is\nnecessary for high-resolution chemical tomography.\n\nAchieving high-resolution 3D chemistry at lower dose requires fusing both\nelastic and inelastic scattering signals. Typically these detector signals are\nanalyzed separately and correlated^13,14,15,16,17,18. However, correlative\nimaging disregards shared but also complementary information between structure\nand chemistry and misses opportunities to recover useful information^19. Data\nfusion, popularized in satellite imaging, goes further than correlation by\nlinking separate signal modalities to reconstruct new information and improve\nmeasurement accuracy^20,21,22. Early approaches for tomographic data fusion\nshowed noise reduction through joint regularization across modalities^23 and\nlinear models between EDX and elastic signals^24,25,26. Recent developments in\n2D multi-modal data fusion integrate the non-linear physics of Rutherford\nscattering to substantially reduce the dose requirements to acquire an atomic-\nresolution map^27. In alignment with this principle of fused multi-modal\nelectron microscopy, we extend its algorithmic framework into the third\ndimension.\n\nHere we present fused multi-modal electron tomography that offers high-\nresolution recovery of nanomaterial chemistry in 3D with high signal-to-noise\n(SNR) by fusing signals from both elastic high-angle annular dark field\n(HAADF) and inelastic (EDX/EELS) scattering. Multi-modal electron tomography\nreconstructs the volumetric chemical structure of specimens by solving a\nthree-term inverse problem that fuses information from multiple detectors.\nThis approach extends beyond 2D data fusion^27 to offer a 3D framework with\ndistinct sampling strategies that minimize dose and maximize resolution. When\nmany HAADF projections are measured alongside far fewer chemical projections\n100-fold dose reductions are achievable. Although the 3D chemical structure is\nseverely underdetermined, fusing both modalities allows missing chemical\ninformation to become identifiable. This approach demonstrates that\nresearchers can measure 3D chemistry at 1 nm resolution using electron doses\nas low as 10^4 e/\u00c5^2 and as few as nine spectroscopic maps while remaining\nconsistent with original measurements. Multi-modal tomography is validated\nacross multiple material systems, including Au-Fe_3O_4 superlattice clusters,\ncore-shell Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4^28, ZnS-Cu_0.64S_0.36 heterostructures^29, Cu-SiC\nnanoparticles and several simulated specimens. By fusing modalities, chemical\ntomography is possible at sub-nanometer resolution along all three dimensions\nis achievable for a wider class of material systems.\n\n## Results\n\n### Principles of fused multi-modal electron tomography\n\nHigh-resolution 3D chemical imaging is achieved using the multi-modal electron\ntomography framework illustrated in Fig. 1a for a binary Au-Fe_3O_4\nnanoparticle superlattice grafted with thiol end-functionalized polystyrene\nligands. In multi-modal electron tomography, projections of the specimen\nstructure are measured from a HAADF detector and the specimen chemistry is\nextracted from spectroscopy (EELS or EDX). These two detector modalities are\nfused during the reconstruction process to provide the complete 3D chemical\ndistribution of a specimen at high resolution and SNR. Figure 1b shows the 3D\nreconstruction of each individual chemistry: larger 10.2 \u00b1 1.1 nm Fe\nnanoparticles (blue) and smaller Au 3.9 \u00b1 0.4 nm nanoparticles (orange). Both\nchemistries are visualized simultaneously in Fig 1c to show the self-\norganization of the chemical superlattice. The light-element, carbon matrix is\nshown in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1: Nanoscale recovery of Au-Fe_3O_4 nanoparticle superlattice.\n\na Schematic highlighting the linked HAADF and EELS modalities for chemical\ntomography^84. HAADF projection images are collected at every tilt increment\nwhile core-loss EELS spectra are sparsely acquired every few tilts. b The\nfused multi-modal reconstruction for the specimen\u2019s Fe L_2,3 (turquoise), O-K\n(turquoise), and gold M_4,5 edge (yellow). c Chemical overlay of the\nsuperlattice nanoparticles over the entire 115 nm field of view. Scale cubes,\n5 nm^3.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn multi-modal tomography, the number of structural HAADF projections usually\nexceeds the chemical projections. In this first demonstration, only nine\nchemical maps (\u0394\u03b8 = 15 \u00b0) are measured from the Fe-L_2,3 and Au-M_4,5 core-\nexcitation edges in an EELS spectrum whereas 47 HAADF images (\u0394\u03b8 = 3 \u00b0) are\ncollected over a \u00b1 70 \u00b0 specimen tilt range. Linking both modalities into the\nreconstruction enables a clear distinction between Fe_3O_4 and Au\nnanoparticles at high resolution from just a few EELS maps and a total\nelectron dose of 5 \u00d7 10^5 e/\u00c5^2\u2014roughly two orders of magnitude lower total\nelectron dose than an equivalent conventional approach.\n\nFused multi-modal electron tomography reconstructs three-dimensional chemical\nmodels by solving an optimization problem seeking a solution that strongly\nagrees with (1) the HAADF modality containing high SNR, (2) the chemically\nsensitive spectroscopic modality (EELS and/or EDX), and (3) encourages\nsparsity in the gradient domain producing solutions with reduced spatial\nvariation. The overall optimization function is as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}\n{{{{{{\\mathrm{arg}}}}}}\\;{{{{{\\mathrm{min}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}_i\n\\geq 0} \\quad \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} \\left\\| {{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}_h\n\\sum\\limits_{i} (Z_i{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}_{i})^\\gamma -\n{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}_{H} \\right\\|_2^2+\\\\\\ \\lambda_2 \\sum\\limits_{i}\n\\left({{{{{\\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}^T {{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}_c\n{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}_i - {{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}_{i}^T\n\\log({{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}_c {{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}_i+\\varepsilon)\n\\right)+\\lambda_3 \\sum\\limits_{i}\n\\|{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}_i\\|_{{{{{{\\mathrm{TV}}}}}}},\\end{array}$$\n\n(1)\n\nx_i is the reconstructed 3D chemical distributions for element i, b_i is the\nmeasured 2D chemical maps for element i, b_H is the measured HAADF\nmicrographs, A_h and A_c are forward projection operators for HAADF and\nchemical modalities, \u03bb are regularization parameters, \u03b5 herein prevents log(0)\nissues but can also account for background, the \\\\(\\log\\\\) is applied element-\nwise to its arguments, superscript T denotes vector transpose, and 1 denotes\nthe vector of\n\\\\({N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{chem}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}{n}_{y}{n}_{i}\\\\)\nones, where n_y is the number of pixels, n_i is the number of elements\npresent, and \\\\({N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{chem}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}\\\\) is\nthe number of projections for the chemical modality. Pseudo-code for numerical\nimplementation is provided in the Supplementary Materials.\n\nThe three terms in Eq. (1) define our fused multi-modal framework designed to\nsurpass traditional limits for chemical tomography. First, we assume a forward\nmodel where the simultaneous HAADF is a linear combination of the\nreconstructed 3D elemental distributions\n(\\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}^{\\gamma }\\\\) where \u03b3 \u2208 [1.4, 2]). The\nincoherent linear imaging approximation for elastic scattering scales with\natomic number as \\\\({Z}_{i}^{\\gamma }\\\\), where experimentally \u03b3 is typically\naround 1.7^30,31,32. This \u03b3 is bounded between 4 and 3 as described by\nLenz\u2013Wentzel expressions for electrons passing through a screened coulombic\npotential and 2 for Rutherford scattering from bare nuclear potentials^33,34.\nSecond, we ensure the recovered 3D distributions maintain a high degree of\ndata fidelity with the initial measurements by using the log-likelihood for\nspectroscopic measurements dominated by low-count Poisson statistics^22,35. In\na higher count regime, this term can be substituted with a least-squares\ndiscrepancy (\\\\(\\parallel\n{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{Ax}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}{\\parallel\n}_{2}^{2}\\\\))^36. Lastly, we include channel-wise isotropic total variation\n(TV) regularization to enforce a sparse gradient magnitude, which reduces\nnoise by promoting image smoothness while preserving sharp features^37. This\nsparsity constraint, popularized by the field of compressed sensing (CS), is a\npowerful yet modest prior for recovering structured data^38,39. When solving\nEq. (1), each of these three terms should be weighted appropriately by\ndetermining coefficients (\u03bb) that balance their contributions. Ultimately,\noptimization of all three terms is necessary for accurate recovery\n(Supplementary Figs. 2,3).\n\nThe improvement in reconstruction quality with fused multi-modal chemical\ntomography (Fig. 2i) is dramatic when compared to traditional chemical\ntomography (Fig. 2c).\n\nFig. 2: Nanoscale recovery of Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4 core-shell nanoparticles.\n\na\u2013c Raw EELS reconstruction for the Co (blue-green) and Mn (orange) L_2,3\ncore-loss edges. d\u2013f The HAADF tomogram of Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4 nanoparticle tracks\nthe structure of the specimen but fails to describe materials chemistry in 3D.\ng\u2013i The fused multi-modal reconstruction.

For\ntraditional chemical tomography, few chemical projections are collected and\nthe Crowther relation devastates resolution in 3D. This limitation occurs from\nthe high-dose requirements of chemical mapping (i.e., EDX, EELS) where only a\nfew projections can be collected before radiation damage alters the specimen\nstructure.\n\nFigure 2 shows how specimen projections from each modality are superimposed as\nplanes of information in Fourier space. Chemical tomography is sparsely\nsampled in Fourier space (Fig. 2a), which results in a tomographic\nreconstruction containing artifacts and low SNR (Fig. 2b, c). Despite the poor\nquality, traditional chemical tomography tracks the chemical distribution, and\nthe Mn shell (orange) can be seen surrounding the Co core (blue-green). In\ncontrast, elastically scattered electrons collected by the HAADF detector\nprovide high signals at lower doses and allow many projections to be\ncollected\u2014in practice, HAADF sampling is five to ten times more finely spaced\nthan chemical (Fig. 2d)^32. The dose required for a single HAADF projection is\n10^2\u201310^3 times lower than a chemical projection acquired using core-energy\nloss spectroscopy. Thus, it is favorable to acquire more HAADF images and\nachieve higher resolution. Although HAADF tomography permits high-resolution\nand high-SNR reconstructions of structure, it lacks chemical specificity. This\nis seen in Fig. 2e, f where the structure is well defined with low noise but\nthe Co and Mn regions are not identifiable.\n\nExploiting shared information in both modalities, multimodal tomography\nachieves a chemical resolution in 3D comparable to high-resolution HAADF\nreconstructions. Although few chemical measurements pose a severely\nunderdetermined problem, fusing with the HAADF modality fills in missing\nchemical information. This is reflected in Fig. 2g where many HAADF\nprojections (e.g., 50\u2013180) are measured while far fewer chemical projections\n(e.g., 5\u201315) are intermittently measured. In this reconstruction, 9 EELS maps\nand 45 HAADF projections (50\u2013200 mrad detector inner and outer semi-angles)\nwere collected over a \u00b160 \u00b0 tilt range using a 2.4 \u00c5 probe with a 24.3 nm\ndepth of focus (300 keV acceleration voltage, 10 mrad convergence angle).\nHigh-resolution 3D chemistry is visible in the core-shell Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4\nusing multi-modal tomography in Fig. 2h, i.\n\nFused multi-modal electron tomography provides unique insight for studying\nheterostructured nanocrystals with unprecedented geometries. In the case of\nCo_3O_4-Mn_3O_4 nanocrystals, the manganese oxide shell is divided into\nseveral ordered grains that grow on each surface plane for the cobalt oxide\nnanocube core^28. However, the core and shell interface can vary per plane\ndriven by the growth interplay between strain and surface energy, resulting in\nthe formation of grain boundaries^42. The complete 3D distribution of Co and\nMn at the surface and interface is difficult to discern with 2D projected EELS\nmaps or HAADF reconstructions. Fortunately, the fused chemical distributions\nreveal surface coverage of the shell grains and cross-sections quantify the\nshell thickness and interface chemistry (Fig. 2k). To further demonstrate,\nfused multi-modal EELS tomography was used to discern between ZnS and\nCu_0.64S_0.36 phases (Supplementary Fig. 4) in a heterostructured\nnanocrystal^29 and EDX tomography to identify Cu nanoparticles embedded in SiC\ncatalysts (Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nData fusion eliminates noticeable noise in the final 3D chemical\nreconstruction without a loss of resolution. This noise reduction accompanies\na dose reduction of roughly 100 fold. Linking the chemical projections to the\nhigh SNR HAADF signals dose-efficiently boosts the chemical specificity. Even\nat modest HAADF signals (e.g., SNR \u2243 10), multi-modal tomography notably\noutperforms traditional chemical tomography (Supplementary Fig. 21). To\nillustrate, in Fig. 2, matching the resolution of fused multi-modal chemical\ntomography using traditional methods would require 45 EELS maps\u2014a fivefold\ndose increase. However, the SNR of each chemical projection would still fall\nshort (Supplementary Fig. 19) and require roughly 20-times additional dose. In\ntotal, multi-modal chemical tomography performs well at one-hundredth the dose\nrequirement of traditional methods.\n\nReduction of electron beam dose produces irreplaceable advantages for electron\ntomography\u2014both in terms of accessible resolution and the range of materials\nclasses that can be imaged in 3D. Dose requirements for tomography scale\nquickly with higher resolution (resolution \u221d dose^\u22124)^43,44. For 3D chemical\nimaging, multi-modal electron tomography notably improves the sampling and\ndose constraints that limit resolution across a range of radiation-sensitive\nmaterials (See Supplementary Figs. 6, 7).\n\n### Sub-nanometer chemical resolution in 3D\n\n3D resolution of the chemical distribution in Au-Fe_3O_4 nanoparticle\nsuperlattice (Fig. 3a) is demonstrated at or below 1 nm using multi-modal\ntomography. The achieved resolution is quantified in real and reciprocal\nspace. In real space, the resolution limit is verified by visually inspecting\na single 3 nm Au nanoparticle (Fig. 3d). The edge sharpness between the\nreconstructed nanoparticle and vacuum is visibly less than 1 nm. From line\nprofiles, the half-pitch resolution is 0.8 nm \u00d7 0.8 nm \u00d7 1.1 nm along the x,\ny, and z directions, respectively. Along optimal directions (x, y) the\nresolution is comparable to the Nyquist frequency (8.05 \u00c5). The real-space\nresolution is consistent with reciprocal space estimates of the cutoff\nfrequency at which the signal drops to the noise floor^1. Figure 3b highlights\npower spectral density variations projected on three orthogonal planes.\nMeasured power spectral density along the k_x-k_y and k_x-k_z directions show\ninformation transfer roughly occurring at 0.99 nm and 1.02 nm respectively\n(Fig. 3c). These directions conservatively represent the 3D resolution from an\naverage of the high-resolution and low-resolution (z-axis) directions. This 3D\nchemical resolution nearly matches the 3D HAADF resolution 1.00 nm, 1.01 nm in\nFig. 3 (Supplementary Fig. 8). For fused multi-modal chemical tomography, the\nHAADF 3D resolution provides an upper bound to the highest obtainable 3D\nchemical resolution. A reduction of resolution along the z-axis is expected\nfrom the incomplete tilt range that creates a missing wedge of information in\nFourier space^45. Avoiding this anisotropic resolution loss has been\ndemonstrated by acquiring a full tilt range (\u00b190\u00b0) through the preparation of\nneedle wire samples or preparing nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers^46,47.\nHere, we observe approximately a 25% reduction in resolution along the missing\nwedge direction of the multi-modal chemical reconstruction (Fig. 3e, f).\n\nFig. 3: Resolution analysis of Au-Fe_3O_4 superlattice nanoparticles.\n\na Fused EELS tomograms of Au-Fe_3O_4 nanoparticles.

In Fig. 4 synthetic gold decorated CoO/CuO\nnanocubes inspired by real experimental data^47 provide a ground truth\ncomparison to assess the accuracy of fused multi-modal tomography. Simulated\nprojection images are generated from a simple linear incoherent imaging model\nof the 3D chemical composition with added Poisson noise (See Methods). The\nspecimen tilt range is limited to \u00b170\u00b0 to better match typical experimental\nconditions. The advantages of multi-modal tomography are clearly visible in\nthe 2D slices (Fig. 4b) taken from 3D reconstructions obtained by conventional\nchemical tomography \\\\(\\left(\\langle\n\\,{{\\mbox{NRMSE}}}\\,\\rangle=1.301\\right)\\\\) and fused multi-modal tomography\n\\\\(\\left(\\langle \\,{{\\mbox{NRMSE}}}\\,\\rangle=0.33\\right)\\\\). For all\nchemistries (Au, O, Cu, Co) fused multi-modal tomography is more consistent\nwith the ground truth with higher resolution and reduced noise.\n\nFig. 4: Estimating sampling requirements for accurate recovery with synthetic\nCoO/CuO nanocubes.\n\na An normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) map representing the\nreconstruction error as a function of the number of HAADF and chemical tilts.\nBrighter pixels denote results containing incorrect reconstructions from the\nground truth. b Visualization of three points corresponding to conventional\nchemical tomography (reconstruction without the HAADF modality), and low or\nhigh-dose fused multi-modal electron tomography. c The 3D models used for\ngenerating synthetic chemical and ADF projections^85. Scale bar, 75 nm.\n\nFull size image\n\nFor any number of chemical projections acquired, we see a notable reduction in\nNRMSE when HAADF projections are integrated into the chemical reconstruction.\nFigure 4 shows the improved fused multi-modal reconstruction accuracy across a\nwide range of HAADF and chemical projections for the gold-decorated CoO/CuO\nnanocubes. The reconstruction error (average NRMSE) across most of the multi-\nmodal parameter space is less than 0.40 compared to values around 1.2 for\nconventional tomography. Pixel values on the diagram (Fig. 4a) represent the\naverage NRMSE across all elements. This NRMSE map shows data fusion strongly\nbenefits by increasing the HAADF information available. It requires\nsubstantially less dose to increase the HAADF projections (i.e., moving\nvertically on the map) compared to increasing the chemical projections (i.e.,\nmoving horizontally on the map).\n\nConventional chemical tomography does not use HAADF projections (bottom row,\nFig. 4a) resulting in an average reconstruction error larger than the entire\nmulti-modal regime. In practice, fused multi-modal tomography is performed in\nthe regime with equal or more HAADF projections than chemical (i.e., top-left\ntriangle). Multi-modal tomography also performs well when the chemical\nprojections exceed the number of HAADF projections, however, this is not\npractical since HAADF signals can be acquired simultaneously with EDX and\nEELS. Similar trends are observed in a second large-scale simulation performed\non a synthetic composite structure composed of transition metal CoO\nnanoparticles embedded in a NiO support (Supplementary Fig. 10).\n\nFused multi-modal electron tomography can measure 3D stoichiometry without\nknowledge of inelastic cross-sections. The ratio of chemical concentrations\nfor each voxel quantifies local stoichiometry. For the simulated CoO-CuO\nnanocubes, values agree with the ground truth (Supplementary Fig.\n11)\u2014concentrations of Cu, Co, and O are centered at the expected value of\n0.50. Here, stoichiometric precision of multi-modal tomography (\u03c3 = 0.04) is\nfour times better than traditional chemical tomography (\u03c3 = 0.17). For\nexperimental Fe_3O_4 nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 12), multi-modal\ntomography produces an average Fe concentration of 0.46 (0.43 expected) with a\nstandard deviation of 0.15. Note, determining stoichiometry using traditional\nchemical tomography also requires accurate calculation of the inelastic cross-\nsections for each experiment^48.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAlthough this work presents significant advantages for fused multi-modal\nelectron tomography, the technique requires supervision. Convergence should be\nverified and reasonable weights for each term in the cost function (Eq. (1))\nshould be assigned (Supplementary Fig. 13). Error when implementing routine\nspectroscopic pre-processing (e.g., incorrect background subtraction of EELS\nspectra^49 or failure to decouple overlapping characteristic X-ray peaks) will\ncause inaccurate stoichiometric quantification. These errors will amplify when\napplied to multi-modal data fusion. Although lighter elements have smaller\nelastic cross-sections, they tend to have larger inelastic cross-sections\nwhich benefits chemical tomography. For example, the K-shell cross-section\n(chemical spectroscopic signal) of Carbon (Z = 6) is over 20-fold larger than\nGermanium (Z = 32)^50,51. EELS is advantageous for discerning lighter elements\nwhereas overlapping peaks may occur in EDX. In general, electron tomography is\nfavorable for measuring volumes in the range of (10 nm)^3 to (1000 nm)^3 at\nresolutions around 3 to 30 \u00c5^4. Thick specimens with dimensions that far\nexceed the mean free path of the electron can produce inversion contrast that\nwill cause electron tomography to fail^52\u2014also causing failure for multi-modal\nelectron tomography (Supplementary Fig. 14). Electron tomography performs best\nfor thicknesses less than three times the incident electron\u2019s mean free path\n(e.g., < 550 nm for Silicon at 300 keV)^53. In all electron tomography\nexperiments, beam convergence angles should be chosen to match the desired\nresolution and depth of focus^41. As shown for 2D fused multi-modal electron\nmicroscopy^27, fused multi-modal tomography works best when elements have\ndiscernible contributions to the HAADF contrast and all chemical elements have\nbeen imaged. Multi-modal tomography leverages CS (e.g., TV min.) which assumes\nincoherence (i.e., a high level of dissimilarity) between the sensing and\nsparsifying transform^54,55,56\u2014although this assumption typically holds as\ndemonstrated for the datasets presented herein.\n\nIn summary, we present fused multi-modal electron tomography that enables\nchemically-sensitive 3D reconstruction of matter with nanometer resolution at\nhigh SNR. We demonstrate that researchers do not need to choose between\nmeasuring 3D structure without chemical detail or characterizing chemistry\nalong a single viewing direction. By linking signals from elastic (HAADF) and\ninelastic (EDX/EELS) scattering processes, the traditional dose limits of\nchemical tomography are substantially surpassed. In some cases, a one-hundred-\nfold reduction in dose is estimated. When compared to 2D chemical imaging^27,\nwe show the benefits of data fusion in 3D are much greater. To demonstrate,\nthe complete volumetric density of each chemistry was mapped in several\nsystems including Au-Fe_3O_4, Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4, ZnS-Cu_0.64S_0.36, and Cu-SiC\nnanomaterials. In both artificial and experimental datasets, fused multi-modal\nelectron tomography shows significant benefits in the accuracy of 3D chemical\nimaging. This approach enables chemical tomography of a wide range of\npreviously inaccessible materials with moderate radiation sensitivity. At\nchemical resolutions of 1 nm, fused multi-modal electron tomography will\nfacilitate understanding of geometrically complex materials\u2014from 3D\nsemiconductor gate stacks^57, clean energy materials^58,59, or\nphotoluminescence quantum dot nanoparticles^60.\n\nHere, fused multi-modal tomography used commonly available STEM detectors\n(HAADF, EDX, and EELS), however, future approaches can further integrate other\nmodalities\u2014such as 4D-STEM from pixel-array detectors^61, annular bright\nfield^62, ptychography^63, low-loss EELS^64. Furthermore, the tremendous\npotential of multi-modal data fusion as a paradigm readily enhances deep\nlearning to capitalize on the unique advantages from both domains^65.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Specimen synthesis and preparation\n\n#### Au-Fe_3O_4 superlattice nanoparticles\n\nSyntheses of 3.9 nm Au NPs^66 and 10.2 nm Fe_3O_4 NPs^67 were carried out\nunder nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk line techniques according to\nliterature methods. Polystyrene-based ligands were attached to the NP surface\nthrough a ligand exchange process as reported before^68. Thiol-terminated PS\n(PS-SH) was used as the polymeric ligand for Au NPs and was synthesized using\nRadical Addition Fragmentation Transfer polymerization and end-functionalized\nby aminolysis. Amine-terminated polystyrene was used as the polymeric ligand\nfor Fe_3O_4 NPs and was synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization\nand end-group modification^69. Binary superlattice of Au and Fe_3O_4 NPs was\nprepared by nanoparticle co-crystallization at water-air interface. A toluene\nsolution containing two types of NPs with concentration ratio of 2:1 was drop-\ncast onto the water surface in a Teflon well and slowly dried overnight. The\nbinary nanoparticle film was transferred onto a 200-mesh carbon TEM substrate\nand further dried in vacuum oven for 6 h to remove residual solvent.\n\n#### Co_3O_4 nanocubes\n\nA mixture of 0.37 g of cobalt(II) perchlorate (Aldrich) and 2.7 g of\noleylamine (Acros) in 15 mL of 1-octanol (Aldrich) was heated to 120 \u00b0C under\nair and aged for 2 h. During the heating, 0.7 mL of distilled water was added\nbefore the temperature reaches 120 \u00b0C. After the reaction, an excess amount of\nacetone and ethanol was added and Co_3O_4 nanocubes were retrieved by\ncentrifugation.\n\n#### Core-shell Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4 nanoparticles\n\nAn organic/aqueous suspension was prepared by adding 0.080 g of Co_3O_4\nnanocubes into a mixture of oleylamine (5 mmol), oleic acid (0.5 mmol), formic\nacid (3.15 mmol, Aldrich), and 15 mL of xylenes (Aldrich). The as-prepared\nsuspension was heated to 40 \u00b0C under air and aged for 3 h with magnetic\nstirring. And then, 0.7 mL of 0.7 M aqueous solution of manganese (II)\nchloride tetrahydrate was rapidly injected into the suspension at 90 \u00b0C and\naged for 1.5 h under air. After the reaction, the nanocrystals were washed\nwith hexane/ethanol and retrieved by centrifugation. The final product was\nprepared with three iterations of this process.\n\n#### ZnS-Cu_0.64S_0.36 nanocrystals\n\nSynthesis of the ZnS-Cu_0.64S_0.36 Heterostructured NPs was performed as\ndescribed by literature using typical air and water free synthetic\ntechniques^29. Cu_1.81S (roxbyite) nanocrystals are synthesized by first\ndissolving CuCl_2\u22c52H_2O in oleylamine (OLAM) at 200 \u00b0C after thoroughly\ndegassing the solution at high temperature. Tert-butyl-disulfide is then\ninjected at 180 \u00b0C and the reaction continues at this temperature for 40 min.\nAfter cooling to room temperature, the NPs are washed with hexanes and acetone\nthen dried in a vacuum desiccator. The roxbyite NPs are then injected into a\nconcentrated Zn ion solution heated at 50 \u00b0C for 10 min to facilitate the\nreaction. Briefly, ZnCl^2 and OLAM are degassed at high temperature and then\nheated at 180 \u00b0C for 30 min to make a concentrated solution of Zn^2+ for\ncation exchange. After cooling the Zn^2+ solution to 100 \u00b0C, an aliquot of the\nsolution is mixed with toluene and the temperature is adjusted to 50 \u00b0C. The\nsynthesized roxbyite NPs are dissolved in tri-octyl phosphine and then\ninjected into the Zn^2+ solution in and allowed to react for 30 min before\nquenching the reaction with cold acetone.\n\n#### Cu-SiC catalyst\n\nThe Cu/SiC catalyst was prepared on a commercial SiC support purchased from a\ncommercial vendor with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 30 m^2/g and\npore volume of 0.4 cm^3/g. following previously described methods^70. The\ncatalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using a 2M\nCu(NO_3)_2\u22c53H_2O aqueous solution followed by drying (120 \u00b0C for 2 h) and\ncalcination in air (350 \u00b0C for 2 h) at a heating rate of 2 deg/min.\n\n#### Acrylic C-TiO_2 nanoparticles\n\nThe C-TiO_2 sample was prepared by blending commercial TiO_2 particles\n(purchased from Chemours) with an emulsion polymer latex. Before conducting\nthe chemical imaging at room temperature, the blend was pre-treated under the\nelectron beam in a Thermo Fisher T12 TEM at \u221280 \u00b0C to promote cross-linking in\nthe latex and preserve its morphology above the glass transition temperature.\n\n### Electron tomography acquisition\n\nSimultaneously acquired HAADF and EELS tilts series for the Au-Fe_3O_4\nspecimen were collected on a Talos F200X G2 (Thermo Fisher) operated at 200\nkeV with a probe current of 115 pA, probe semi-angle of roughly 10.5 mrad and\ninner collection semi-angle of 50 mrad. The HAADF projections were collected\nfrom \u221260\u00b0 to +60\u00b0 with a 3\u00b0 angular increment using a Model 2021 Fischione\nAnalytical Tomography Holder. At each tilt angle, a STEM image with a 24 \u03bcs\ndwell time at each pixel of a lateral dimension 6.4 \u00c5. Simultaneously acquired\nHAADF and EELS spectrums were acquired at acquired with a 15 \u00b0 angular\nincrement with a dwell time of 3 ms receiving a total electron dose of 4.9 \u00d7\n10^5 e/\u00c5^2 (1.72 \u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2, 4.73 \u00d7 10^5 e/\u00c5^2 for the HAADF and EELS\nmodality, respectively). Refer to Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 to view the raw\ntilt series.\n\nSimultaneously acquired HAADF and EELS tilt series for the Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4\nspecimen were collected on a double aberration-corrected modified FEI Titan\n80\u2013300 microscope (the TEAM I instrument at the National Center for Electron\nMicroscopy within Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) operated at 300 keV\nwith a probe current of 115 pA and semi-angle of roughly 10 mrad. This\nmicroscope is equipped with a Gatan K3 detector and Continuum spectrometer.\nThe HAADF projections were recorded from \u221260\u00b0 to +60\u00b0 with a 3\u00b0 angular\nincrement using a Hummingbird Scientific eucentric Tomography Holder. At each\ntilt angle, a STEM image with a 24 \u03bcs dwell time at each pixel of a lateral\ndimension of 7.79 \u00c5. Simultaneously acquired HAADF and EELS spectrums were\nacquired at acquired with a 15 \u00b0 angular increment with a dwell time of 0.677\nms receiving a total electron dose of 8.37 \u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2 (1.16 \u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2,\n7.21 \u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2 for the HAADF and EELS modality, respectively). Refer to\nSupplementary Figs. 17, 19 to view the raw tilt series.\n\nSimultaneously acquired HAADF and EDX tilt series for the Cu-SiC specimen were\ncollected on a Talos F200X G2 (Thermo Fisher) operated at 200 keV with a probe\ncurrent of 250 pA, probe semi-angle of roughly 10.5 mrad and collection angle\nof 44\u2013200 mrad. The HAADF projections were collected from \u221275 to +70 with a 3\u00b0\nangular increment. At each tilt angle, a STEM image with a 20 \u03bcs at each pixel\nof the lateral dimension of 1.4679 nm. Simultaneously acquired HAADF and EDX\nspectrums were acquired at acquired with a 15 \u00b0 angular increment with a dwell\ntime of 20 \u03bcs dwell time for 25 frames receiving a total electron dose of 4.33\n\u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2 (7.1 \u00d7 10^3 e/\u00c5^2, 3.62 \u00d7 10^4 e/\u00c5^2 for the HAADF and EELS\nmodality, respectively). The initial chemical distributions were generated\nfrom EDX maps using commercial Velox software that produced initial net count\nestimates (however atomic percent estimates are also suitable).\n\n### Multi-modal tilt series alignment\n\nThe EELS signals were obtained by integration over the core loss edges, all of\nwhich were done after background subtraction. The background EELS spectra were\nmodeled using a linear combination of power laws implemented using the open-\nsource Cornell Spectrum Imager software^9.\n\nBefore tilt series alignment, the spectrum images have been drift-corrected\nafter acquisition assuming a time-dependent linear drift model, as illustrated\nin Supplementary Fig. 20. The survey image, which is taken with an identical\ndwell time as the HAADF tilts, is taken as a reference. Iterative image\nregistration between the chemical and HAADF signals seek an optimal\ntranslation and affine transformation. Following registration, the background\nof each projection was removed. For this purpose, the mean gray level in the\nouter regions was calculated for each projection and subtracted. In this way,\nthe signal contribution of the carbon film could be eliminated.\n\nFor the alignment of the tilt series, a coarse alignment is performed with\neither the center of mass (CoM) or cross-correlation method^71. CoM works best\nwhen the total projected volume is fixed across specimen tilts (i.e., the\nobject is isolated)^72. In cases where either of these requirements are not\nmet (e.g., fields of view where multiple particles are visible as demonstrated\nwith the Au-Fe_3O_4 nanoparticles), cross-correlation should be considered.\nFine alignment is performed with custom written projection matching method^73\non the HAADF modality. The measured translation shifts are subsequently\napplied to the corresponding tilts where simultaneously acquired chemical maps\nwere acquired.\n\n### Fused multi-modal tomography recovery\n\nHere, fused multi-modal electron microscopy is framed as an inverse problem\nexpressed in the following form:\n\\\\(\\hat{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}\\,=\\,\\arg \\mathop{\\min\n}\\nolimits_{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}\\ge 0}{\\lambda }_{1}{\\Psi\n}_{1}({{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}})+{\\lambda }_{2}{\\Psi\n}_{2}({{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}})+{\\lambda\n}_{3}{{{{{{{\\rm{TV}}}}}}}}({{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}})\\\\) where\n\\\\(\\hat{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}\\\\) is the final reconstruction, and the\nthree terms are described in the main manuscript (Eq. (1)). When implementing\nan algorithm to solve this problem, we concatenate the multi-element spectral\nvariable (x) as 2D matrices: \\\\({{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}\\in\n\\,{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot {n}_{y}\\cdot {n}_{i}\\times {n}_{x}}\\\\) where\nn_i denotes the total number of reconstructed elements and n_x, n_y represent\nnumber of pixels in the x and y direction and x_i, b_i are the reconstructions\nand chemical maps for element i (\\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}\\in\n\\,{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot {n}_{y}\\times {n}_{x}}\\\\) and\n\\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}}_{i}\\in \\,{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot\n{N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{chem}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}\\times {n}_{x}}\\\\)).\nHere the axis of rotation is along the x-direction (n_x).\n\nThe optimization problem is solved by a combination of gradient descent with\nTV regularization. We minimize this cost function by iteratively descending\nalong the negative gradient directions for the first two terms and\nsubsequently evaluate the isotropic TV proximal operator to denoise the\nchemical volumes^74. The gradients of the first two terms are:\n\n$${\\nabla }_{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}{\\Psi\n}_{1}({{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}})=-\\gamma\n\\,{{\\mbox{diag}}}\\,\\left({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}^{\\gamma\n-1}\\right){{{{{{{{\\mathbf{\\Sigma\n}}}}}}}}}^{T}{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{h}^{T}\\left({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{h}{({{{{{{{\\mathbf{\\Sigma\n}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}^{\\gamma\n})}^{T}-{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}}_{H}\\right)$$\n\n(2)\n\n$${\\nabla }_{{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}}{\\Psi\n}_{2}({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i})={{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{c}^{T}\\left(({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{c}{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}-{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}}_{i})\\oslash\n({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{c}{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}+\\varepsilon\n)\\right),$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2298 denotes point-wise division, \\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}}_{H}\\in\n{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}{N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{HAADF}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}\\times\n{n}_{x}}\\\\) are the HAADF measurements,\n\\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{h}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot\n{N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{HAADF}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}\\times {n}_{y}\\cdot\n{n}_{y}}\\\\) and \\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{c}\\,\\in\n\\,{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot\n{N}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{chem}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{proj}}}}}}}}}\\times {n}_{y}\\cdot\n{n}_{y}}\\\\) are forward projection matrices operating on the chemical and\nHAADF modalities. Here, the first term in the cost function, relating the\nelastic and inelastic modalities, has been equivalently re-written as \\\\({\\Psi\n}_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\parallel\n{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{A}}}}}}}}}_{h}({{{{{{{\\mathbf{\\Sigma\n}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}^{\\gamma\n})-{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}}}_{H}{\\parallel }_{2}^{2}\\\\), where\n\\\\({{{{{{{\\mathbf{\\Sigma }}}}}}}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{y}\\cdot\n{n}_{y}\\times {n}_{y}\\cdot {n}_{y}\\cdot {n}_{i}}\\\\) and \u03a3 x expresses the\nsummation of all chemistries as matrix-vector multiplication. Evaluating the\nTV proximal operator is in itself another iterative algorithm. In addition, we\nimpose a non-negativity constraint since negative concentrations are\nunrealistic. We initialize the first iterate with reconstructions composed\npurely of the raw measured data\n(\\\\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i}^{0}=\\arg \\min {\\Psi }_{2}\\\\)). This is\nan ideal starting point as it is a local minimizer of \u03a8_2.\n\nAppropriate step sizes for convergence of Eq. (1) can be determined estimating\nthe Lipschitz constant of the measurement matrix using the Power method^75.\nConvergence can be confirmed by assessing each term in the cost function as\nthe reconstruction proceeds (Supplementary Fig. 13). Sub-optimal parameters\noften result in slower convergence. Smooth and asymptotic decay of all three\nterms in Eq. (1) is an indicator of reliable reconstruction. We find that the\noptimal weights (\u03bb) in Eq. (1) do not change significantly between datasets\nand even sub-optimal terms outperform traditional tomography methods. However\ncareful selection can also be achieved by selecting values within the\ninflection point of the Pareto front in Eq. (1) (see Supplementary Fig.\n13)^76. The final 3D HAADF and multi-modal chemical volumes were rendered\nusing the Tomviz platform (tomviz.org^77).\n\n### Multi-modal simulations and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization\n\nTo demonstrate the functionality of our fused multi-modal electron tomography\nalgorithm, we created a multi-channel phantom specimen inspired from an\nexperimental system. The phantom consists of four channels, which we attribute\nto the crystal stoichiometry of CuO, CoO, and Au (Fig. 4c) with a volume size\nof 256^3. The HAADF intensity is proportional to \\\\({\\sum\n}_{e}{({Z}_{i}{x}_{i})}^{\\gamma }\\\\) where x_i reflects the element\u2019s\nstoichiometry. To produce chemical maps with realistic noise characteristics,\nwe set the background (vacuum) to roughly 15% of the max intensity and\nsubsequently applied Poisson noise to meet the desired SNR. For a Poisson-\nlimited signal, each synthetic image has an SNR of \\\\(\\frac{{\\mu }_{s}+{\\mu\n}_{s}^{2}}{{\\sigma }_{N}^{2}}\\\\) where \u03bc_s is the mean signal and \\\\({\\sigma\n}_{N}^{2}\\\\) is the variance of noise^41 In the case of Fig. 4, the SNR of the\nCo, Cu, O, Au, and HAADF modalities were 1.92, 2.89, 2.69, 1.96, 2208.67,\nrespectively. Prior to measuring the NRMSE of the reconstructed volumes, the\nchemical distributions were normalized with zero mean and unit standard\ndeviation. The NRMSE expresses a normalized measure of agreement between the\nreconstructed (x) and ground truth (y) : \\\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{{\\sum\n}_{i,j,k}{({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}}}}}}}_{i,j,k}-{{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}}_{i,j,k})}^{2}}{{\\sum\n}_{i,j,k}{({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}}}}}}}_{i,j,k})}^{2}}}\\\\). While the HAADF\nSNR may be high, we found the NRMSE reliably converges when above 50\n(Supplementary Fig. 21).\n\nDetermining optimal regularization parameters for the phase diagram (Fig. 4a)\nis computationally expensive to explore due to its variability across sampling\nconditions. While grid search could find the best parameters by exhaustively\nexploring all possible candidate values, the computation time would be\nexpensive as each map would take ~125 days to complete on a single GPU.\n\nWe efficiently explored the parameter space with Bayesian optimization (BO)\u2014a\nmachine learning framework known for optimizing expensive unknown objective\nfunctions with minimal evaluations^78,79. It works by building a probabilistic\nmodel of the objective function with Gaussian processes (GP) regression. GP\nnot only estimates our function of interest but also provides the uncertainty\nmeasurements to guide future predictions. BO takes into account past\nevaluations when determining future hyperparameter selections via an\nacquisition function^80. For our simulations, we carried out BO with GP in\nPython with the Scikit Optimize library (scikit-optimize.github.io/stable)\nwith the Matern kernel and GP Hedge acquisition strategy^81. By exploiting BO\nwith GP, we are able to provide an atlas of balanced hyperparameters for Eq.\n(1) with the CoNiO and CoCuO synthetic datasets (Supplementary Figs. 22, 23).\nThe estimated parameter landscape is smooth and continuous with a clear global\noptimum.\n\nAsynchronous parallel BO on supercomputing resources allowed us to efficiently\nrun several reconstructions simultaneously on a single node. This form of\nparallel computing resulted in several factors of computational speed up as\nmultiple GPUs received unique experimental parameters (e.g., SNR or sampling)\nto reconstruct concurrently amongst each other. Specifically, the computation\ntime to generate an NRMSE map was reduced by 99.8%\u2014taking less than a day to\ncomplete (18 h). In total, 3452 GPU hours were used to complete these\nsimulations\u20141078 h on Summit - OLCF and 1078 h on ThetaGPU\u2014ALCF for the phase\ndiagrams (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 10). An additional 1296 GPU hours on\nSummit were used to produce the SNR plots (Supplementary Fig. 21).\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe raw and aligned Au-Fe_3O_4, Co_3O_4-Mn_3O_4, and Cu-SiC tilt series with\nreconstructed 3D chemistries are available in a Zenodo repository^82.\n\n## Code availability\n\nAll of the multi-modal electron tomography reconstruction and iterative\nalignment codes are available at github.com/jtschwar/tomo_TV and\ngithub.com/jtschwar/projection_refinement^83.
