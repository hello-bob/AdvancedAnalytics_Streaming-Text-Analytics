This user is used\nby NFS servers when they cannot trust the client-supplied uids and gids, or\nwhen the root-squash option is being used.\n\nSee https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2006/ols2006v2-pages-59-72.pdf and\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/openbook/linag2/book/ch14.html for more information on\nuser nobody.\n\nSome misguided programs or guides suggest that this user should be used for\nuntrusted program execution or handling untrusted data. This is bad advice.\nServices should have their own, dedicated, user account. Even on sites where\nNFS is not being used, processes run as user nobody or files owned by user\nnobody may grant far more privileges than expected, especially if two services\nhave been misconfigured in this fashion.\n\nDo not use the user nobody for anything. It is for NFS.\n\nThe material on this wiki is available under a free license, see Copyright /\nLicense for details.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
