They were going to set aside up to one\nmillion dollars as prize money for the randomly chosen winner.\n\nIn order to participate, readers would have to mail in a postcard with the\nnumber of entries they wished to submit. The winner would be selected randomly\nfrom among these entries. A reader who submitted a postcard with a 2 would be\ntwice as likely to win as one who submitted a 1.\n\nBut there was a catch...\n\nThe amount given to the winner would be calculated with this formula:\n\n    \n    \n    $1,000,000 / (The total number of entries)\n\nSo, say one hundred people sent in postcards each bearing the number 1, each\nwould have a 1% chance of winning $10,000 (a million dollars divided by 100\nentries). Yet if all of those people attempted to increase their chances of\nwinning by submitting the number 2, no one would have raised their odds\n(everyone\u2019s still at a 1% chance), but the winner would now only get $5,000 (a\nmillion dollars divided by 200 entries).\n\nAnd if one of them really tried to game it by submitting the number 1,000,000,\nthen the winner would get less than $1 (since the one million dollars was now\nbeing divided by just over one million entries).\n\nI\u2019m not making this up. This lottery actually took place.\n\n# Defection vs. Cooperation\n\nThe Luring Lottery is a fantastic example of game theory at play. One choice\nis cooperation (a term used in the study of game theory). If everyone\ncooperated by limiting their entries to relatively low numbers, they would\nreduce their own chances of winning but sustain the overall amount paid out.\nTherefore, pure cooperation guarantees that someone can win something of\nmeaning, even if you probably won\u2019t.\n\nBut humans aren\u2019t cooperative. They\u2019re greedy. Their other choice is\ndefection. The Scrooge who submitted 1,000,000 entries in my example above is\na defector. If everyone defects, no one greatly increases their chances of\nwinning relative to anyone else. But the prize money shrinks to zero.\n\nAnd more concerning, if everyone cooperates but a single person defects, it\nhas a significantly detrimental impact on the prize as well.\n\nWhat do you suppose happened when Scientific American ran this test? Shoot me\nan email and let me know what you would have done in this situation. What\nactually occurred is described at the end of this article.\n\n# Get Out The Vote\n\nWe face these types of cooperation versus defection decisions today. A classic\nexample is voting in elections (a timely conversation in the United States).\nSure, the stakes are high. But how much does my vote actually matter? If I sit\nhome on election day (or fail to mail in my ballot ahead of time), it won\u2019t\nchange the outcome. I may as well defect.\n\nYes, but by that logic, everyone else should defect too. And in this case, by\ndefecting, not only are you removing yourself from the equation, but you\u2019re\nactually strengthening the contribution of your political opponents to the\noutcome.\n\nThat\u2019s a double whammy. Failing to vote both hurts your preferred candidate by\nremoving your contribution to the numerator (their share of the vote), and it\nalso hurts your preferred candidate by removing your contribution to the\ndenominator (the total number of votes cast), thus strengthening the\ncontribution of everyone else (including those voting for the other\ncandidate).\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite the same as the Luring Lottery. Here, defecting means\nremoving your entries rather than raising them astronomically. So let\u2019s find a\nbetter analogy.\n\n# Machines Learning From Machines\n\nA more apt parallel comes to my mind, touching on (of course) artificial\nintelligence.\n\nAI is trained on data taken from the internet. (If you missed my article on\n\u201cHow AI Works\u201d for people with no technical background, check it out here.)\nAnd as people write their content more and more using AI, that content is\npublished back on the internet. (This article, for one, was not written using\nAI.)\n\nNow we\u2019ve reached an interesting recursive process. The internet trains AI\nmodels. AI models output content. That content is published on the internet.\nIt\u2019s used to train AI models. And on and on we go.\n\nThis phenomenon is referred to as \"data contamination\" or \"dataset pollution.\"\n\nWhat does that have to do with The Luring Lottery? Everything.\n\nSo long as everyone \u201ccooperates,\u201d using AI to help their creative processes\nand efficiency without polluting the training pool, all is good. The dataset\nremains pure (i.e. human-made). The output remains high quality.\n\nBut again, people are greedy. And they will defect. We\u2019re already seeing\noceans of AI-generated content polluting social media, news, and even academic\npapers.\n\nOver time, the proportion of the training pool made up of genuine human\ncontent goes down. And therefore, the models begin learning off their own\ndata.\n\nYou may think this insignificant, but it\u2019s tremendously important for the\nfuture of not only technology but humankind\u2019s general reliance on it. Large\nLanguage Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) are useful in that they mimic the\nbehavior of human beings. As human beings defect in the way described above,\nthese machines will transition, instead, to mimicking the behavior of\nmachines.\n\nPicture a photocopier. Draw a picture, make a copy, and it will look pretty\ngood. Take that copy and make a copy of it, and the quality will decrease a\nbit. Do that again, and again, and again, and eventually, you\u2019re looking at\ngarbage.\n\nThis is how the game of telephone works. Imperfect translation compounds over\ntime. The output gets worse.\n\nIrony rings loudly as in the case of the Luring Lottery. The more reliant we\nbecome on the technology, the worse it will get. The less reliant we become,\nthe better it will remain.\n\nA classic lose-lose. One that Joseph Heller (the author of Catch-22) would\ncertainly have appreciated (and been saddened by) were he alive today.\n\n\"That's some catch, that Catch-22,\" he observed. \"It's the best there is,\" Doc\nDaneeka agreed.\n\nJoseph Heller\n\n# What About The Lottery?\n\nBack to the 1980s, when Scientific American ran that Luring Lottery\nexperiment...\n\nA few readers submitted numbers that were absurdly and unrealistically large\n(numbers like googol, which is 1 with 100 zeroes after it, or googolplex,\nwhich is 1 with googol zeroes after it). Not only did it become impossible to\ndetermine a winner, but even if a winner had been declared, their winnings\nwould have been microscopically small.\n\nWhat relief the editors of Scientific American must have felt that humans were\ngreedy after all. Otherwise, they would have had to mail off a sizable check.\n\nZ-Axis\n\nThought-provoking articles in your inbox, published weekly, 100% free\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\n\u00a9 2024 Nir Zicherman.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
