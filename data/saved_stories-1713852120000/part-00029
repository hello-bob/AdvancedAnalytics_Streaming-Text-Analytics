This has led to\nusers fleeing sites like Patreon for safer alternatives like SubscribeStar.\n\nNow it seems Pixiv\u2019s latest step is to ban users located in the US or UK.\nLuckily, this ban will only apply to users who self-identify as being in those\nregions and users can presumably just change their location in account\nsettings. Failing that, a proxy is likely to work.\n\n> Starting from April 25th, 2024, a new section (\u201cRestrictions on unacceptable\n> content to comply with regional laws\u201d) has been added to the pixiv Terms of\n> Use.\n>\n> This change only affects users whose Country/Region is set to the US or UK.\n>\n> Other users will not be affected by this change in Terms of Use.\n>\n> Please read more about this change below.\n\nMost recently, Japanese doujin site DLSite announced they would be blocking\nwestern payment processors rather than adopt censorship policies.\n\nPreviously, Pixiv tried adopting new content policies, as well as restricting\nwhat content can be monetized via fanbox; each adjustment has led to stricter\ncontrol from payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard. It\u2019s unclear if\nPixiv\u2019s policy adjustments will stop here.\n\nCensorship, Pixiv\n\n# About Brandon Lyttle\n\nA basement-dwelling ogre, Brandon's a fan of indie games and slice of life\nanime.
