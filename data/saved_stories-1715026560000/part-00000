Credit: Mass Eye and Ear\n\nResults from a clinical trial of CRISPR gene editing in 14 individuals with a\nform of inherited blindness show that the treatment is safe and led to\nmeasurable improvements in 11 of the participants treated. The Phase I/II\ntrial called BRILLIANCE, was led by principal investigator Eric Pierce, MD,\nPh.D., of Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham health care\nsystem. Findings are reported May 6 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"This research demonstrates that CRISPR gene therapy for inherited vision loss\nis worth continued pursuit in research and clinical trials,\" said Pierce,\ndirector of Ocular Genomics Institute and Berman-Gund Laboratory for the Study\nof Retinal Degenerations at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"While more research is needed to determine who may benefit most, we consider\nthe early results promising. To hear from several participants how thrilled\nthey were that they could finally see the food on their plates \u2013that is a big\ndeal. These were individuals who could not read any lines on an eye chart and\nwho had no treatment options, which is the unfortunate reality for most people\nwith inherited retinal disorders.\"\n\nAll 14 trial participants, including 12 adults (ages 17 to 63) and two\nchildren (ages 10 and 14), were born with a form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis\n(LCA) caused by mutations in the centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) gene. They\nunderwent a single injection of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing medicine,\nEDIT-101 in one eye via a specialized surgical procedure. This trial, which\nincluded the first patient to ever receive a CRISPR-based investigational\nmedicine directly inside the body, focused primarily on safety with a\nsecondary analysis for efficacy.\n\nNo serious treatment or procedure-related adverse events were reported, nor\nwere there any dose-limiting toxicities. For efficacy, the researchers looked\nat four measures: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); dark-adapted full-field\nstimulus testing (FST), visual function navigation (VNC, as measured by a maze\nparticipants completed), and vision-related quality of life.\n\nEleven participants demonstrated improvements in at least one of those\noutcomes, while six demonstrated improvement in two or more. Four participants\nhad clinically meaningful improvement in BCVA. Six participants experienced\nmeaningful improvements in cone-mediated vision as indicated by FSTs, five of\nwhom had improvements in at least one of the three other outcomes. Cone\nphotoreceptors are used for daytime and central vision.\n\n\"The results from the BRILLIANCE trial provide proof of concept and important\nlearnings for the development of new and innovative medicines for inherited\nretinal diseases. We've demonstrated that we can safely deliver a CRISPR-based\ngene editing therapeutic to the retina and have clinically meaningful\noutcomes,\" said Baisong Mei, MD, Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Editas\nMedicine.\n\nStudies like this one show the promise of gene therapy for treating incurable\nconditions. Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping\nto translate scientific discoveries made by researchers into first-in-human\nclinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.\n\n## Exploring CRISPR as an inherited retinal disorder treatment\n\nMutations in the CEP290 gene are the leading cause of inherited blindness\ntaking place during the first decade of life. The mutations cause rod and cone\nphotoceptors in the eye's retina to function improperly, which after some time\nwill lead to irreversible vision loss. Pierce compares it to a small part of\nan engine breaking down, which eventually leads the entire engine to falter.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing toolkit that acts as a GPS-guided scissor to cut\na portion of the mutated genome to leave a functional gene. For inherited\nblindness, the goal was to inject CRISPR to reach the eye's retina to restore\nthe ability to produce the gene and protein responsible for light-sensing\ncells.\n\nThe CEP290 gene is larger than what traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV)\nvector gene therapies, including one FDA-approved for a different type of\ninherited vision loss, can accommodate. The genome editing company Editas\nMedicine began exploring how to tackle the CEP290 mutation in 2014, conducting\npreclinical studies to determine whether a gene editing approach like CRISPR-\nCas9 might be feasible to target these large gene mutations. This work led to\nthe BRILLIANCE trial, which began in mid-2019.\n\nThe first patient to receive a CRISPR treatment inside the body (in vivo) took\nplace at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU),\nunder the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, Ph.D.\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat\ninherited retinal degeneration,\" Pennesi said.\n\n\"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient\ndescribe how their vision has improved after a treatment. One of our trial\nparticipants has shared several examples, including being able to find their\nphone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by\nseeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to\nthose who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on\nquality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nJason Comander, MD, Ph.D., performs the procedure to deliver the CRISPR-based\nmedicine as part of the BRILLIANCE trial in September 2020 at Mass Eye and\nEar. Credit: Mass Eye and Ear\n\nThe second patient was treated at Mass Eye and Ear in September 2020,\nfollowing delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional participants were\ntreated across three other trial sites: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, W.K.\nKellogg Eye Center, and Scheie Eye Institute at the Children's Hospital of\nPhiladelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTwo adults received low-dose therapy, five received mid-dose, and another five\nreceived a high-dose treatment. Two children, treated at CHOP under the\nleadership of Tomas S. Aleman, MD, received a mid-dose treatment.\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with\ngene-editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision. Our hope is\nthat the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with\nsimilar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Aleman, the Irene\nHeinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn\nMedicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP\nwho served as a site principal investigator and study co-author.\n\n\"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in\nspecific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment,\nwhen traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an\noption.\"\n\nParticipants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed\nless frequently for two additional years. At visits, they would undergo a\nseries of serum and vision tests to examine safety and efficacy outcome\nmeasures.\n\nIn November 2022, Editas paused enrollment on the BRILLIANCE trial. Pierce and\ncolleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct\nadditional trials, in collaboration with Editas.\n\nThe researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a\ntreatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger\npatients, and include refined endpoints to measure the effects of improved\ncone function on activities of daily living.\n\nMore information: Gene Editing for CEP290- Associated Retinal Degeneration,\nNew England Journal of Medicine (2024).
