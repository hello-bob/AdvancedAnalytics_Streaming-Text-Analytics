In the aorta, the largest artery in the\nabdomen, such an aneurysm is life-threatening, especially when it bursts.\n\nDuring her doctoral research, Esther Maas worked on a reliable way to monitor\naneurysms using ultrasound. She conducted her research at the TU/e PULS/e\ngroup (Photoacoustics & Ultrasound Laboratory Eindhoven) and the Catharina\nHospital in Eindhoven. She defended her thesis at the Department of Biomedical\nEngineering on April 9.\n\nFor such a dangerous vascular condition, an aneurysm is often discovered late\nor even too late. In fact, an aneurysm itself almost never causes any\nsymptoms. It is only when the bulge bursts and bleeding occurs that an\naneurysm is usually discovered afterward. When this happens in our body's most\nvital artery, the aorta, it is life-threatening.\n\nSometimes aneurysms are discovered earlier anyway, usually by chance. For\nexample, during a scan of the abdominal cavity because of other symptoms. In\nthat case, the vascular surgeon can continue to monitor the bulge and\nintervene when the risk of the aneurysm bursting becomes too great.\n\n\"The probability of an aneurysm rupturing is related to its size. Yet we also\nsee differences in patients,\" Maas explains. \"Sometimes relatively small\naneurysms also rupture, while in other patients a relatively large aneurysm\nremains stable.\"\n\n\"The current criteria for operating to eliminate the aneurysm are mainly\nrelated to diameter, which means that sometimes surgery is performed too soon\nand sometimes too late. We wanted to improve that by improving our\nunderstanding of when an aneurysm is at risk of rupturing. To do this, we\nlooked at the three-dimensional shape of the aneurysm and its mechanical\nproperties.\"\n\nCurrently, standard two-dimensional ultrasound is employed to monitor an\naneurysm. The disadvantage of this technique is that a picture can only be\ntaken at one location at a time (\"a slice\"). While MRI and CT allow the entire\nthree-dimensional shape of the aneurysm to be viewed, these techniques are\nexpensive and time-consuming.\n\nSo Maas took up the challenge of using ultrasound to develop a reliable method\nof monitoring aneurysms. So that patients can be monitored safely, health care\ncosts saved and doctors spared the task of operating unnecessarily.\n\n3D ultrasound, especially as moving images (temporal 3D or 3D+t-echography),\nis an excellent method for imaging an aneurysm. It is fast, less stressful for\nthe patient, does not emit radiation, and is also more affordable than the\nalternatives. Maas says, \"It allows us to see the shape and movement of the\naneurysm simultaneously.\"\n\nThe image quality could still be improved to allow the doctor to assess an\naneurysm. \"Processing these ultrasound images is challenging, however, because\nthe images contain a speckled pattern. And, in addition, the gray shades are\nnot directly traceable to a tissue,\" Maas says.\n\n\"Therefore, at the beginning of my research, we mainly worked on a method to\nautomatically and accurately determine the shape of an aneurysm from 3D+t\nultrasound images.\"\n\nThe actual patient images were taken at the Catharina Hospital in Eindhoven.\nAs many as five hundred patients were monitored in this study. Maas states,\n\"When they came for a conventional two-dimensional ultrasound for diameter\ncontrol, we also made a 3D+t-echo.\"\n\n\"We developed a computer algorithm that looked for the vessel wall in the\n3D+t-echo images. We compared the resulting shape to CT (computed tomography)\nimages, the current gold standard for imaging aneurysms. This showed that the\nshape from 3D+t-echo images corresponds well with the shape from CT.\"\n\nBy automatically determining the aneurysm shape on all images of the 3D+t\nultrasound time series, it was also possible to estimate the expansion of the\nvessel wall during the cardiac cycle. Combined with blood pressure, this gives\nan estimate of how elastic the vessel wall is.\n\n\"Using this technique, we found out that a combination of three-dimensional\nshape and elasticity has a better predictive value for aneurysm growth than\nmeasuring diameter alone,\" Maas continues.\n\n\"In the next step, we further improved the shape determination using deep\nlearning. We used over 1,300 available 3D+t ultrasound images to train a model\nthat could even more robustly determine the shape of the aneurysm.\"\n\nBut the researchers wanted to improve imaging even more. By combining multiple\nultrasound images, they wanted to solve some of the shortcomings of\nultrasound, one of which is that only a small area can be viewed at a time.\n\n\"This meant that the ultrasound image did not capture large aneurysms in their\nentirety,\" Maas explains. \"To solve this, we took multiple ultrasound images\nside by side, first synchronizing these in time and then spatially\nsuperimposing and fusing them. This allowed us to image even larger aneurysms\nwith ultrasound.\"\n\nA second disadvantage of ultrasound is directional\u2014the direction in which you\nlook is very decisive. In one direction the image quality is much better than\nin the other direction.\n\nMaas says, \"To solve this, we combined ultrasound images of the aorta from\ndifferent angles, which led to an improvement in contrast in the images and a\nbetter determination of expansion during the cardiac cycle.\"\n\n\"Our research showed how aneurysms can be monitored using 3D+t-echo images,\"\nMaas concludes. \"First, by automatically determining different characteristics\nthat are important for the growth of aneurysms in the abdominal cavity. In\naddition, by demonstrating the added value of combining multiple ultrasound\nimages.\"\n\nThis marks a major step towards being able to use 3D+t ultrasound images to\nmonitor aneurysms in the clinic, ultimately providing more patient-specific\ncare.\n\nMore information: Characterization of abdominal aortic aneurysms using time-\nresolved 3D ultrasound. research.tue.nl/en/publication ... s-using-time-\nresolve\n\nProvided by Eindhoven University of Technology\n\nCitation: Using 3D ultrasound to improve monitoring of dangerous aneurysms\n(2024, April 10) retrieved 23 April 2024 from\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-3d-ultrasound-dangerous-aneurysms.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
