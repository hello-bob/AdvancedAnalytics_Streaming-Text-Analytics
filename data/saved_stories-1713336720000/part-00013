According to\nresearchers from Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, this has given the gold new\nproperties that can make it suitable for use in applications such as carbon\ndioxide conversion, hydrogen production, and production of value-added\nchemicals. Their findings are published in the journal Nature Synthesis.\n\nScientists have long tried to make single-atom-thick sheets of gold but failed\nbecause the metal's tendency to lump together. But researchers from Link\u00f6ping\nUniversity have now succeeded thanks to a hundred-year-old method used by\nJapanese smiths.\n\n\"If you make a material extremely thin, something extraordinary happens\u2014as\nwith graphene. The same thing happens with gold. As you know, gold is usually\na metal, but if single-atom-layer thick, the gold can become a semiconductor\ninstead,\" says Shun Kashiwaya, researcher at the Materials Design Division at\nLink\u00f6ping University.\n\nTo create goldene, the researchers used a three-dimensional base material\nwhere gold is embedded between layers of titanium and carbon. But coming up\nwith goldene proved to be a challenge. According to Lars Hultman, professor of\nthin film physics at Link\u00f6ping University, part of the progress is due to\nserendipity.\n\n\"We had created the base material with completely different applications in\nmind. We started with an electrically conductive ceramics called titanium\nsilicon carbide, where silicon is in thin layers. Then the idea was to coat\nthe material with gold to make a contact. But when we exposed the component to\nhigh temperature, the silicon layer was replaced by gold inside the base\nmaterial,\" says Lars Hultman.\n\nFor the first time, scientists have managed to create sheets of gold only a\nsingle atom layer thick.

For several years, the researchers have\nhad titanium gold carbide without knowing how the gold can be exfoliated or\npanned out, so to speak.\n\nBy chance, Lars Hultman found a method that has been used in Japanese forging\nart for over a hundred years. It is called Murakami's reagent, which etches\naway carbon residue and changes the color of steel in knife making, for\nexample. But it was not possible to use the exact same recipe as the smiths\ndid. Kashiwaya had to look at modifications.\n\n\"I tried different concentrations of Murakami's reagent and different time\nspans for etching. One day, one week, one month, several months. What we\nnoticed was that the lower the concentration and the longer the etching\nprocess, the better. But it still wasn't enough,\" he says.\n\nThe etching must also be carried out in the dark as cyanide develops in the\nreaction when it is struck by light, and it dissolves gold. The last step was\nto get the gold sheets stable. To prevent the exposed two-dimensional sheets\nfrom curling up, a surfactant was added. In this case, a long molecule that\nseparates and stabilizes the sheets, i.e. a tenside.\n\n\"The goldene sheets are in a solution, a bit like cornflakes in milk. Using a\ntype of 'sieve,' we can collect the gold and examine it using an electron\nmicroscope to confirm that we have succeeded. Which we have,\" says Kashiwaya.\n\nThe new properties of goldene are due to the fact that the gold has two free\nbonds when two-dimensional. Thanks to this, future applications could include\ncarbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen-generating catalysis, selective production\nof value-added chemicals, hydrogen production, water purification,\ncommunication, and much more. Moreover, the amount of gold used in\napplications today can be much reduced.\n\nThe next step for the LiU researchers is to investigate whether it is possible\nto do the same with other noble metals and identify additional future\napplications.\n\nMore information: Synthesis of goldene comprising single-atom layer gold,\nNature Synthesis (2024).
