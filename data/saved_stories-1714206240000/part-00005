'Anti-infantry\nhigh-explosive mine') is a scatterable high explosive anti-personnel land mine\nof Soviet and Russian production.^[1] It is also known as a Green Parrot or\nButterfly Mine.^[1] The mines can be deployed from mortars, helicopters and\naeroplanes in large numbers; they glide to the ground without exploding and\nwill explode later upon contact.^[2]\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nThe mine consists of a polyethylene plastic container containing 37 g (1.3 oz)\nof VS-6D or VS-60D liquid explosive.^[1]^[3] The two wings of the PFM-1 allow\nit to glide after being released in the air, then spin, stabilizing it and\nslowing its descent, similar to maple seeds.^[4]^[1] The thick wing contains\nthe liquid explosive.^[4] The two wings together are 120 mm (4.7 in) long.^[5]\nThe plastic body can be produced in a variety of colours for best camouflage.\nAs existing stocks were in European green rather than sand coloured, the first\nexamples used in 1980s Afghanistan were green and easily visible. This led to\ntheir name 'green parrots'.^[4]\n\nThe shape and bright colour is attractive to children, inspiring claims that\nthey were deliberately designed to look like a toy.^[6]^[7]\n\nThe mine comes in two variants: PFM-1 and PFM-1S. The only difference between\nthe two variants is that the PFM-1S comes with a self-destruct mechanism, with\na nominal self destruct time for 85% of all mines of 40 hours.^[8] The self\ndestruct mechanism is designed to activate after 1\u2013 40 hours depending on\nambient temperature.^[9] The PFM-1S self-destruct mechanism is not very\nreliable, and is likely to leave mines in an armed or sensitive state;^[3]\nwith mines known to continue to randomly self-destruct for weeks after\ndeployment.^[8] The mines cannot be laid manually and must be laid only using\nminelaying systems, such as remote mining machine UMZ, portable mining kit -\nPKM (mortar), and those present on multiple rocket launchers, helicopters\n(VSM-1 mine system) or airplanes.^[1]^[10] The remote minelaying systems can\nonly use cluster munition containing PFM-1 mines. The cassettes that contain\nthe PFM-1 mines are KSF-1 (72 PFM-1), KSF-1S (64 PFM-1S) or KSF-1S-0.5 (36\nPFM-1 and 36 PFM-1S).^[11]^[12]\n\nBecause the mine is so light, it can be carried in waterways and move\ndownstream after heavy rains or melting snow. The PFM-1 mines are notorious\nfor attaining good camouflage in the conditions of dense foliage, snow or\nsand.^[1]\n\n## Action[edit]\n\nThe mine is stored with a pin restraining a detonating plunger. Once the\narming pin is removed, the plunger is slowly forced forward by a spring until\nit contacts the detonator, at which point it is armed.^[13]\n\nDeformation of the soft plastic skin of the mine forces the arming plunger to\nstrike the detonator, detonating the mine.^[13] Because the body of the mine\nis a single cumulative pressure primer, it is extremely dangerous to handle\nthe mine: The Imperial War Museum states that \"A pressure in excess of 5kg\nwould activate the mine\".^[1] Holding it between the thumb and forefinger may\nbe enough to make it explode.^[10] The charge is usually nonlethal, although\nsufficient to maim.^[10]\n\n## Disposal[edit]\n\nThe PFM-1(S) mines can be disposed by destruction or activation by mechanical\nor explosive means; they cannot be disarmed. The mines are generally disposed\nof in-situ to prevent unintended initiation while moving. If the mine has to\nbe moved, it is done so with an implement that is at least 3 meters long, made\nof soft materials (for example, plastic) to prevent injury in the event the\nmine detonates in transit. The disposal technician should ideally wear\nsuitable personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and a helmet\nwith a ballistic visor of at least 8\u201310 mm of PMMA.^[11] If the mine is to be\ndestroyed mechanically, then they should be driven on by the tracks of an\narmoured vehicle, or impacted with a load weighing at least 60 kg. Otherwise,\nthe technician must dispose of the mine with at least 200 grams of explosive\nat least 4\u20135m away.^[11] The requirement to use soft materials is due to\nsecondary fragments that may be generated as a result of the mine exploding:\nif the mine is placed on a hard or metallic surface, such as asphalt or steel,\nit could generate secondary fragmentation and potentially wound the disposal\ntechnician, or people around them. As it is almost impossible to tell the\nPFM-1 and PFM-1S versions apart care should be taken when approaching them as\nthe mine's self-destruction mechanism may actuate.\n\n## Compliance with the Ottawa Convention[edit]\n\nIn 2017, the government of Belarus announced that it had destroyed its\nstockpiles of PFM-1 mines.^[14] The last 78 PFM-1 mines held by Belarus were\ndestroyed as the highlight of the closing ceremony marking the elimination of\ntheir landmine stock.^[14]\n\nUkraine stated that its stockpile of PFM-1 mines in 1999 was 6,000,000\nunits.^[15] In a November 2008 presentation, Ukraine indicated that it had\ndestroyed 101,088 PFM-1 mines per the convention in 1999. Following the\nagreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and NATO Support and\nProcurement Agency (NSPA, formerly known as NAMSO) on 1 September 2012, a\nthree-way agreement between Ukraine, NSPA and the EU was signed, which\nfigurated that the EU would provide 3.689 million euros for the destruction of\n3.3 million mines.^[15]^[16] In 2013, the NSPA provided assistance in\ndestruction of 300,000 mines.^[15] In 2014, following the outbreak of war with\nRussia, Ukrainian representatives did not attend in person but submitted a\ndocument to the Mine Ban Treaty Third Review Conference, stating that it had\ndestroyed 568,248 mines since the ratification, with an additional 576 mines\nin 2014, leaving its stockpile at 5,434,672 mines.^[17] After failing to meet\nthe Ottawa Treaty deadline of November 2018 on the destruction of its anti-\npersonnel mines, Ukraine requested the deadline be extended to 1 June 2021,\nlater asking for further extension on 8 June 2020.^[18]^[19] In 2019, 67,236\nmines were destroyed. Amid continuing conflict in the Donbas region, in 2020\nUkraine refused to destroy any PFM-1 mines.^[failed verification]In 2021,\nUkraine's PFM-1 stockpile was reported at 3,363,828 mines.^[20]^[21]\n\nRussia, as well as the United States, China, and several other countries, is\nnot a signatory of the Ottawa Treaty (the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban\nConvention).^[22]^[23]\n\n## Military use[edit]\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\"Butterfly\" mines, OMAR Mine Museum, 2008\n\nPFM-1 was used during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, allegedly resulting\nin a high number of casualties among children from the mine being mistaken for\na toy due to its shape and coloring.^[24]\n\n### Ukraine[edit]\n\nThe Ukrainian government alleged that the Russian Federation deployed PFM-1\nmines during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.^[25]^[26]^[27] At the start\nof the invasion, in March 2022, Deutsche Welle found no evidence to support\nthe accusation.^[28] In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that Russia\nhad used \"at least seven types of antipersonnel mines in at least four regions\nof Ukraine: Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Sumy\", but could not ascertain PFM-1\nuse in its briefing.^[29]^[30]\n\nIn summer 2022, HRW found no credible information about Ukraine using any\nanti-personnel mines,^[29]^[30] but said in January 2023 that its team \"saw\nphysical evidence of PFM antipersonnel mine use in seven of the nine areas\naround Izyum\" in Kharkiv Oblast, and urged the Ukrainian government to\ninvestigate possible PFM use by its forces.^[31]\n\nIn Russian-controlled Donetsk many PFM-1 were widely dispersed, and Russian\nand local sources accused the Ukrainian army of being responsible for their\ndeployment.^[27] There have been reported casualties, the most prominent of\nwhich was the Russian influencer Semfira Sulejmanova.^[32] Another Russian\ninfluencer, Semyon Pegov, reportedly had his leg injured and was hospitalized\nas a result of these mines.^[32]\n\n## Similar weapons[edit]\n\nThe PFM-1 is very similar to the BLU-43 landmine used by the US Army in\nOperation Igloo White in Laos during the Vietnam War.^[33]^[5] According to a\nU.S. military document, the Soviet military created PFM-1 after reverse-\nengineering BLU-43.^[12]\n\n## Specifications (PFM-1 & PFM-1S)[edit]\n\n  * Dimensions: 119 mm \u00d7 64 mm \u00d7 20 mm (4.69 in \u00d7 2.52 in \u00d7 0.79 in) ^[11]\n  * Activation pressure: 5.1\u201325.5 kgf (50\u2013250 N) ^[11]^[13]\n  * Weight:^[11]\n\n    * Mine: 75 g (2.6 oz)\n    * Charge: 37 g (1.3 oz) of VS-6D or VS-60D liquid explosive ^[34]^[35]\n    * KSF-1 cassette: 9.2 kg (20 lb)\n  * Shelf life: 10 years ^[11]^[13]\n  * Temperature range : \u221240 to 50 \u00b0C (\u221240 to 122 \u00b0F)\n  * Fuze: MVDM/VGM-572 (\u041c\u0412\u0412\u0414\u041c \u0412\u0413\u041c\u041c-572)\n  * Self-destruct time (PKM-1S):^[8] 1\u201340 hours (85% nominal self destruction within 40 hours)^[9]\n\n^[11]^[13]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Ottawa Treaty\n  * Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation\n  * Atrocity propaganda \u00a7 Soviet\u2013Afghan War\n  * PMN mine\n  * BLU-43 Dragontooth\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g \"PFM 1 anti-personnel mine (\"Green Parrot\") (British drill/training example)\".
