20241:40 PM EDT\n\nKate Rogers\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Autonomous delivery drone startup Zipline has made 1 million deliveries to customers.\n  * The company said its zero-emission autonomous drones have now flown more than 70 million commercial autonomous miles across four continents.\n  * As the company continues to expand with its drone deliveries, it will bring on Panera Bread in Seattle, Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, and Jet\u2019s Pizza in Detroit.\n\nA drone operator loads a Walmart package into Zipline\u2019s P1 fixed-wing drone\nfor delivery to a customer home in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 30, 2023.\n\nBunee Tomlinson\n\nAutonomous delivery drone startup Zipline said Friday that it hit its 1\nmillionth delivery to customers and that it\u2019s eyeing restaurant partnerships\nin its next phase of growth.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup designs, builds and operates autonomous\ndelivery drones, working with clients that range from more than 4,700\nhospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic, to major brands such as Walmart and\nGNC. It\u2019s raised more than $500 million so far from investors including\nSequoia Capital, a16z and Google Ventures. Zipline is also a CNBC Disruptor 50\ncompany.\n\nThe company said its zero-emission drones have now flown more than 70 million\nautonomous commercial miles across four continents and delivered more than 10\nmillion products.\n\nThe milestone 1 millionth delivery carried two bags of IV fluid from a Zipline\ndistribution center in Ghana to a local health facility.\n\nAs the company continues to expand, it will bring on Panera Bread in Seattle,\nMemorial Hermann Health System in Houston, and Jet\u2019s Pizza in Detroit.\n\nZipline CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton told CNBC that 70% of the company\u2019s\ndeliveries have happened in the past two years and, in the future, the goal is\nto do 1 million deliveries a day.\n\n\u201cThe three areas where the incentive really makes the most sense today are\nhealth care, quick commerce and food, and those are the three main markets\nthat we focus on,\u201d Rinaudo Cliffton said. \u201cOur goal is to work with really the\nbest brands or the best institutions in each of those markets.\u201d\n\nThe push into restaurant partnerships marks an \u201cobvious transition\u201d he said,\ndue to the continuing growth in interest in instant food delivery. Zipline\nalready delivers food from Walmart to customers.\n\n\u201cWe need to start using vehicles that are light, fast, autonomous and zero-\nemission,\u201d Rinaudo Cliffton said. \u201cDelivering in this way is 10 times as fast,\nit\u2019s less expensive ... and relative to the traditional delivery apps that\nmost restaurants will be working with, we triple the service radius, which\nmeans you actually [get] 10 times the number of customers who are reachable\nvia instant delivery.\u201d\n\nZipline deliveries for some Panera locations in Seattle are expected to begin\nnext year, the Panera franchisee\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Ron Bellamy told\nCNBC. Delivery continues to grow for its business, even in an inflationary\nenvironment, he said. Costs with Zipline are anticipated to be on par with\nwhat third-party delivery is now, he added, with the hope of that cost\nlowering over time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged about it, not just even in terms of what I can do for the\nbusiness, but as a consumer, I think at the end of the day, if it is\neconomical, and it delivers a better overall experience, then the consumer\nwill speak,\u201d Bellamy said.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Zoom, JetBlue, BJ\u2019s & more\n  * If you\u2019re worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
