In the first months of the\nconflict, Russian shells hit the Plant Genetic Resources Bank in Kharkiv.\nFounded in 01908, the gene bank preserved the seeds of 160,000 varieties of\ncrops and plant seeds from around the world, and was the repository for many\nunique cultivars of Ukrainian barley, peas, and wheat. Tens of thousands of\nsamples, some of them centuries old, were reduced to ash.\n\n\u201cUnder Hitler\u2019s Germany, when the whole of Ukraine was under occupation, the\nGermans did not destroy this collection,\u201d a lead researcher at the institute\ntold the online newspaper The Insider. \u201cThey knew their descendants might need\nit. After all, every country\u2019s food security depends on such banks of genetic\nresources.\u201d\n\nA similar fate befell one of the world\u2019s most important collections of wheat\nlandraces, as varieties that have adapted to local conditions, often over\nthousands of years of cultivation, are known. Located in Aleppo, the\nInternational Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) kept\ntens of thousands of varieties of wheat and other food plants, from 128\ncountries, in cold storage. When the Syrian civil war began in 02011, staff\nset to work loading 20,000 precious samples of crop varieties, not duplicated\nin other gene banks, across the borders to Turkey and Lebanon.\n\n\u201cIt was looted,\u201d Ahmed Amri, the director of ICARDA, told me on a video call\nfrom the gene bank\u2019s new location in Morocco. \u201cThe latest news is that it was\ncompletely destroyed.\u201d\n\nGenetic samples from Ukraine's Plant Genetic Resources Bank.

They\nprovide back-up specimens of the seeds of the plants, as well as the eggs and\nsemen of the livestock, that nourish humanity. Like public lending libraries,\nthey then distribute these genetic riches free of charge to just anybody who\nasks. There are 1,750 such institutions around the world, safeguarding\neverything from yeasts, to olive cultivars, to pig breeds. (My personal\nfavorite is the Puratos Sourdough Library in St-Vith, Belgium, which keeps\nmore than a hundred sourdough starters from around the world, some of them\nover a century old, bubbling and alive with regular feedings.) But, like\nnuclear power plants, they are vulnerable to natural disaster, and \u2014 as in\nUkraine and Syria \u2014 can become targets in times of war.\n\nThe \u201cBackup of the Backups\u201d is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located on an\nisland halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole. Svalbard\nstores seeds of hundreds of thousands of crop varieties, including 150,000\nsamples of wheat and rice, in a setting where the average winter lows hover\naround -4 degrees Fahrenheit. But Svalbard Island is also one of the most\nrapidly warming places in the world. In 02017, melting permafrost caused the\nvault\u2019s entrance to flood, though fortunately there was no permanent damage to\nthe collection.\n\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

Seeds need to be removed from storage and germinated on a\nregular basis to remain viable. But in our era of soil degradation, rapidly-\nevolving pests and pathogens, and a fast-changing climate, there is no\nguarantee that frozen germplasm will be able to thrive to feed future\ngenerations. That\u2019s why we need to foster living diversity in fields and\nfarms. The best we can do for endangered wildlife, from Bengal tigers to sperm\nwhales, is to give them the space to live \u2014 in other words, to leave them\nalone. The best we can do for ancestral grains and forgotten livestock breeds,\nin contrast, is to cultivate them, and yes, to eat them.\n\nThe background to this is the global biodiversity crisis; the rate of species\nloss, which is hundreds of times faster than it has been in the last 10\nmillion years, has led some to declare we are in the midst of a \u201csixth\nextinction.\u201d But few are aware that agrobiodiversity \u2014 the range of plants and\nlivestock that feed us \u2014 is also in rapid decline. Nearly a tenth of the\nworld\u2019s estimated 8,800 livestock breeds are already extinct. Every month, a\nhalf dozen more are lost forever. The same phenomenon afflicts traditional\ncrop varieties. Since 01900, it is estimated that three-quarters of the\ngenetic diversity once stored in farmers\u2019 fields has been lost. The way we\nfarm today, raising vast acreages of crops, many of them genetically modified\nor scientifically hybridized to maximize yield, leaves them vulnerable to such\ndiseases as wheat rust and corn smut.\n\nWhile researching my book The Lost Supper, I traveled to Puglia, the bootheel\nof Italy, where farmers have come to rely on a few varieties of olive to\nproduce extra virgin oil. But now these trees, some of them over 2,000 years\nold, are succumbing to a bacterium, imported on ornamental coffee plants from\nCosta Rica, known as Xylella fastidiosa. Much of the region is now a spooky\nlandscape of skeleton forests. The most promising cure comes from wild olive\nvarieties found growing in farmers\u2019 fields, which can be grafted onto trees,\nto save them from infection. I\u2019ve been to the Olive World Germplasm Bank in\nC\u00f3rdoba, Spain, and it is a crucial institution, run by dedicated scientists\nand technicians. But Puglia\u2019s olive oil industry is being saved not by\ngermplasm, but by the natural variety preserved in fields, orchards, and\nfarms.\n\nDiversity, simply put, is the key to resiliency. That\u2019s true of the\nmicroorganisms in the soil beneath our feet, in the microbiome in our guts,\nand in the variety of foods we eat. In our 300,000 or so years of existence as\na species, we have nourished ourselves on a minimum of 10,000 distinct plant\nspecies. Today, fewer than 150 are cultivated for consumption. The latest\nscience says that people who consume at least thirty species of plants a week\nin their diet \u2014 most of us get half that number or less \u2014 tend to be as\ndisease-free as those who follow a completely vegan diet. Our monocultures,\nwhich rob us of the polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and other micronutrients\nessential for good health, are making us sick. The antidote is to pursue\ndiversity in our diet, and support those food producers who work hard to keep\nless common varieties alive.\n\n\u201cIn Canada and the United States, diversity is largely gone from the field,\u201d\nsays Colin Khoury, a director at the San Diego Botanic Garden who has\npublished extensively on crop biodiversity. \u201cWhen a farmer grows something,\nsaves the seed, and plants in the next year, you have ongoing evolution. And\nthat gives you the diversity you need for unforeseen issues in the future. The\nhubris of putting everything in a seed bank \u2014 basically freezing diversity \u2014\nis that you believe you have everything you need for the present and the\nfuture.\u201d\n\nIn my research, I\u2019ve encountered many good examples of solutions to our\ndiversity and sustainability crisis, most of them rooted in pre-industrial\nagricultural practices. In Europe and North America, for example, mixed farms\npractice an age-old form of what is now known as regenerative agriculture or\npermaculture: pigs, chickens, cattle and other breeds of heritage livestock\nprovide the manure that boosts soil fertility and replaces synthetic\nfertilizers. An increasing number of farmers in the United States, Canada, and\nBritain are embracing \u201cno-till\u201d farming, a plough-free method which reduces\nthe amount of synthetic fertilizers and water needed to raise crops, while\npreserving biodiversity in the field. In Central America, I saw the milpas, or\ncornfields, where ancient varieties are interplanted with squash and beans,\ninfusing the soil with nitrogen. In Mexico City, chinampas, or \u201cfloating\ngardens,\u201d a form of raised bed agriculture that used to feed millions in Aztec\ntimes, continue to allow for several harvests a year. Indigenous communities\naround the world are storehouses of such traditional ecological knowledge\n(TEK), from the controlled burns once used in the Americas to manage game and\nedible plant populations and limit the fuel for wildfires, to the ancient\nagroforestry methods that have shaped the Amazon basin. All provide startling\namounts of calories on limited acreage, while encouraging, rather than\ndetracting from, biodiversity.\n\nThe Aztec-originating chinampas, or \"floating gardens.\" Photograph by Karl\nWeule, Leitfaden der Voelkerkunde, Leipzig 01912\n\nThere is a happy conclusion to the story of Kharkiv\u2019s gene bank, one summed up\nin a proverb common among my own Ukrainian ancestors: \u201cThey tried to bury us.\nBut they didn\u2019t know we were seeds.\u201d Late last spring, the parts of the\ncollection untouched by the attack were moved to an undisclosed location in\nthe western part of the country, as far as possible from Putin\u2019s reach. This\nis an important win, but the true riches of Ukraine lie in the chernozem, the\nnation\u2019s dark, humus-rich loam, where varieties of beets, barley, potatoes,\nrye, and bread wheat will continue to evolve \u2014 conflict permitting \u2014 in an\never-changing environment.\n\nThe same is true of every other food-producing region in the world. The soil\nbeneath our feet is the ultimate source of agrobiodiversity, nutrition, and\nflavor. That soil is now being impoverished by the chemicals needed to bring\nmonocultures to harvest. Don\u2019t get me wrong: gene banks are an essential\ninsurance policy for future food security. But the real way forward is to take\nthe seeds and eggs out of the cold, and get them into the soil, the farms, and\nthe pastures \u2014 and, in good time, onto our plates.\n\n\u2014\n\nTaras Grescoe is the author of The Lost Supper: Searching for the Future of\nFood in the Flavors of the Past (Greystone, 02023).\n\nEnvironmentGeneticsClimate ChangeArchives\n\n## More from Environment \u2014\n\nThe Big Here\n\n## Seeing the Trees for the Forest\n\nOn Bioregional Futures\n\nBy Gus Mitchell\n\nLong-term Thinking\n\n## How to Dance for Millions of Years\n\nThe dances of the colorful manakins of South America are not just spectacles\nbut monuments to generations of avian society.\n\nBy Liam Taylor\n\nRevive & Restore\n\n## Controlling Nature Might Be in Our Nature\n\nBy Andrew Tighe\n\nScience\n\n## The Three-Century Lifespan of the Modern Bee\n\nBy A'liya Spinner\n\nThe Big Here\n\n## The Commodification of Air\n\nBy Leo Kim\n\nEnvironment\n\n## The Future Of Invasive Species Mitigation\n\nBy Brian Sinclair\n\n## Explore over two decades of long-term thinking\n\n### Concepts\n\n  * Long-term Thinking\n  * The Big Here\n  * Digital Dark Age\n  * Organizational Continuity\n  * Futures\n  * Millennial Precedent\n  * Archives\n  * Long Shorts\n  * Long News\n\n### Projects\n\n  * Announcements\n  * Long Now Talks\n  * The Clock of the Long Now\n  * The Rosetta Project\n  * The Interval\n  * Long Bets\n  * Revive & Restore\n  * PanLex\n  * Manual For Civilization\n\n### Disciplines\n\n  * Art\n  * Business\n  * Cities\n  * Civilization\n  * Climate Change\n  * Computing\n  * Culture\n  * Economics\n  * Energy\n  * Environment\n  * Evolution\n\n  * Genetics\n  * Globalization\n  * Government\n  * History\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Language\n  * Psychology\n  * Science\n  * Science Fiction\n  * Space\n  * Technology\n\n### Year\n\n  * 02022\n  * 02021\n  * 02020\n  * 02019\n  * 02018\n  * 02017\n  * 02016\n  * 02015\n  * 02014\n  * 02013\n\n  * 02012\n  * 02011\n  * 02010\n  * 02009\n  * 02008\n  * 02007\n  * 02006\n  * 02005\n  * 02004\n  * OLDER\n\n## What is the long now?\n\nThe Long Now Foundation is a nonprofit established in 01996 to foster long-\nterm thinking.
