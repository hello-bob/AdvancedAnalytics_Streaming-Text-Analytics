In the market known as the\nblue-chip swap, which is utilized by many investors and companies, the peso\nhas skyrocketed by 25% against the dollar over the last three months. This\nperformance surpasses the gains of all 148 currencies that Bloomberg tracks\nagainst the dollar.\n\nThis development is quite surprising in a country where the currency appears\nto be in a perpetual state of depreciation. (The smallest yearly decline in\nthe past ten years was 15%.) It highlights the extensive measures that Milei\nhas implemented to curb excessive government spending, reduce demand for all\ngoods and services in the economy, including dollars, and control inflation,\nwhich has surged to an annual rate of nearly 300%.\n\n\"The remarkable aspect in Argentina is that the person in charge is not afraid\nof bearing the political consequences associated with austerity \u2014 that's\nuncommon,\" stated Javier Casabal, head of research at AdCap Grupo Financiero\nin Buenos Aires. \"The government's primary objective will remain to curb\ninflation.\"\n\nHowever, this brings us to the next significant risk: the possibility that\ninflation may not decrease as rapidly as Milei's team anticipates. Not only\nwould this disappoint Argentine consumers, but it would also further increase\nthe currency's value in real terms. Since the peso began to stabilize in\nJanuary, it has appreciated by about 72% after adjusting for inflation, a\nmetric closely monitored by Argentine investors as it reflects changes in the\ncurrency's actual buying power.\n\nWhile these gains are advantageous for a country, they can become problematic\nif they discourage companies from exporting goods and deter foreign tourists.\nThere are already indications that this is starting to occur in certain\nsectors.\n\n\"When exporters reduce their sales,\" explained Melina Eidner, an economist at\nPPI, a brokerage in Buenos Aires, \"the parallel peso weakens.\"\n\nLIVE NEWS\n\n  * #### Checkout the unusual options flow happening with FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC (FCX)\n\n4/29/2024\n\n  * #### Blackstone, $BX, has sold 1740 Broadway in New York for $185 million, a $420 million loss\n\n4/29/2024\n\n  * #### BlackRock's, $BLK, assets under management have hit a record of $10.5 trillion\n\n4/29/2024\n\n  * #### Billionaires are racing to buy TikTok after Chinese owners ordered to sell app, with Steve Mnuc...\n\n4/29/2024\n\nTopics and Tags\n\nCrypto\n\nEarnings\n\nOptions Flow\n\nMemes\n\nOptions calculator\n\nTSLA\n\nbid ask\n\nbuy to close\n\nbuy to open\n\nbull call spread\n\ncongress\n\ncovid\n\nenergy\n\nfloor\n\ngovernment\n\nhot tickers\n\ninsider knowledge\n\nnasdaq\n\nnews\n\noverbought\n\noversold\n\nunusual options\n\nweed\n\n+\n\nWith Unusual Whales\n\nGet the best broker for options trading and receive up to $5,000 in cash with\nan eligible account deposit at tastytrade.
