(Image credit: Portal Space Systems)\n\nA spaceflight startup with some serious bona fides has just come out of\nstealth mode.\n\nPortal Space Systems announced its existence today (April 30), revealing that\nit has snagged more than $3 million in funding from the U.S. Department of\nDefense for the development and launch of its new Supernova satellite bus.\n\nPortal's CEO is Jeff Thornburg. He previously served as senior director of\npropulsion engineering at SpaceX, where he led the development of Raptor, the\nbrawny next-gen engine that powers the company's Starship megarocket.\nThornburg was also head of mechanical engineering and manufacturing for\nProject Kuiper, Amazon's planned satellite-internet constellation.\n\nRelated: SpaceX launches giant Starship rocket into space on epic 3rd test\nflight (video)\n\nSupernova will be far more maneuverable than currently operational satellites,\nthanks to its new solar-thermal propulsion technology, company representatives\nsaid.\n\n\"The space industry hasn't fundamentally improved satellite bus technology in\ndecades. Our nation is developing sixth-generation fighter aircraft technology\nbut still uses first-generation satellite buses,\" Thornburg said in a\nstatement.\n\n\"Our novel solar-thermal propulsion system and bus design, combined with our\ncompatibility to support any customer payload, sets us apart,\" he added. \"We\nprovide an over 50x improvement in current spacecraft mobility. For our\ncustomers, that means the ability to have spacecraft on orbit that are able to\nrespond in real time to events in any orbital regime.\"\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Are we really in a new space race with China and Russia?\n\n\u2014 US Space Force has new guidelines for working at and around the moon\n\n\u2014 What is a satellite?\n\nSupernova will be able to move from low Earth orbit (LEO) \u2014 the realm within\n1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) of our planet's surface \u2014 to geostationary\norbit, which lies 22,235 miles (35,786 km) up, in just hours, company\nrepresentatives said. And it will be capable of making the trek from LEO to\nthe region around the moon in a matter of days.\n\nPortal has received \"significant support\" from the U.S. Space Force, the\nSeattle-based startup wrote in the same statement. That's not terribly\nsurprising; the Space Force has repeatedly stressed the importance of boosting\nthe nation's flexibility and responsiveness in the final frontier, all the way\nout to the moon.\n\nSupernova has not flown yet; Portal is currently eyeing late 2025 for the\nspacecraft's debut launch.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
