You\u2019ve\ncurated a fantastic data source. You\u2019re absolutely convinced that within this\ndata lie insights that\u2019ll give your end users ultimate power. All they need to\ndo is load it into a visualization platform to reveal beautiful interconnected\nstructures that blur the boundaries between data science and art.\n\nThis Protein Homology Graph, by Edward Marcotte and Alex Adai, from New York\u2019s\nMuseum of Modern Art (MOMA) 2008 exhibit\n\nSo you evaluate a technology like our powerful graph visualization SDKs, load\nyour data, and wait with bated breath for the results.\n\nAnd when the chart loads, there\u2019s a strong chance you\u2019ll see one of three\nusual suspects:\n\n  1. The hairball \u2013 showing connections that are so dense, they can\u2019t be usefully visualized.\n  2. The snowstorm \u2013 packed with many small, separate components where nothing stands out.\n  3. The starburst \u2013 where almost every connection is between a single central node and every other node.\n\nUsual suspect #1: the hairball, the snowstorm and the starburst\n\nNone of these will help your users uncover threats or find insight. The\ndifference between success and failure hinges on what you do next.\n\nDo you accept that this is the nature of your data, advise your users to boost\ntheir hardware and leave them to it? Or do you spend hours trying to\nunderstand the root causes of the problems in your data and designing a visual\ninvestigation tool that really works? Why do these beasts appear? What aspects\nof the underlying data give rise to them? And what can you do about it when\nthe underlying data is not yours to control?\n\nWe\u2019ll look at snowstorms and starbursts in future blog posts. Now, we\u2019ll focus\non the infamous hairball.\n\nIf you see a tangled mass of nodes and links that are impossible to analyze,\nyou\u2019ve got a hairball\n\n### Where do hairballs come from?\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that the desire to connect information together \u2013 the heart of all\nthings graph \u2013 is of course ultimately responsible for these issues. Let\u2019s see\nhow the hairball problem builds up.\n\nWe\u2019ll take an example from the world of vehicle insurance claims fraud, and\nimagine building a knowledge graph from scratch. We start with a database of\npeople \u2013 our insurance policyholders, named drivers, witnesses, etc.\n\nAs you can see, visualizing the node/link structure is a little uninspiring.\n\nThis visualization shows plenty of people but no connections\n\nNow some of these people own insurance policies, so the next step is to add\nthose policies to our knowledge graph.\n\nAdding policies gives basic structure to the data\n\nThis view tells us something. We\u2019ve done a little bit of custom styling of our\ngraph by color-coding the different node types. It\u2019s easy to spot which people\nhave policies \u2013 but it\u2019s hardly justification for a knowledge graph project,\nso let\u2019s push on.\n\nPeople have phone numbers and addresses; policies cover vehicles and have\nclaims logged against them. Let\u2019s see what happens when we add those details.\n\nConnected components emerge from the chart once we add further details\n\nNotice how our automatic organic graph layout makes it easier to recognize\nstructures. But our quest for knowledge continues.\n\nNext, we add records for the types of damage claimed by policyholders, and the\ndetails of the mechanics who fixed those damages. The visualization starts to\ntake shape.\n\nWe can see definite subnetworks and well-connected nodes\n\nAnd finally we add nodes representing the country where claimants live, or\nwhere their vehicles are registered.\n\nAnd this is where it all goes wrong.\n\nHairball alert: connections are so dense they can\u2019t be usefully visualized\n\nYou can see the problem. This dataset is exactly what you want from an\nunderlying knowledge graph. It\u2019s rich and well connected, and it answers\nquestions like \u201cAre there patterns of insurance fraud that vary by country?\u201d\nand \u201cHow far on average do people travel to have their cars fixed?\u201d. But as a\ngraph visualization, the result is near to useless. Quick and easy analysis is\nimpossible.\n\nWe have a hairball.\n\n### The solution: focus on the workflow, not the data model\n\nSo, of all the insurance claim charts above, which one do you think is the\nbest graph visualization?\n\nIt\u2019s a trick question of course, although most people will pick the one with\nthe most detail just before the hairball appears.\n\nThe smart response is: \u201cNone of these visualizations is useful, because you\nhaven\u2019t told me what the end user is actually trying to do.\u201d\n\nThere are many tricks to removing hairballs, including graph filtering and\nnode and link aggregation, but I\u2019d recommend that you don\u2019t try to literally\nvisualize everything in your underlying knowledge graph. Instead, start\nworking backwards from the job your end users need to get done.\n\nIn this use case, our goal is to identify suspicious individuals with unusual\nlevels of connectivity. All we really care about is the people nodes \u2013\neverything else is metadata that helps to single out some people over others.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if we create a new visual representation that is\nderived from our raw graph as follows:\n\n  * Represent people as nodes.\n  * Put links between two people who are connected via a path that includes an insurance claim (graph databases are really good at this kind of query).\n  * Size the people nodes based on their betweenness centrality \u2013 one of our powerful social network analysis centrality algorithms.\n\nA customized user experience powered by advanced graph algorithms reveals the\ninsight users need\n\nThe result looks much nicer, and we can immediately spot a couple of\ninteresting individuals who would have been impossible to see inside that\noriginal hairball. The user can now do their job by focusing on those people\nand making a decision about whether to investigate further.\n\nBy remodeling the data in this way, we\u2019ve made full use of our efforts to\nbuild a tightly connected graph database. We wouldn\u2019t have known all of those\nlinks existed without first seeing the original hairball, but by paring back\nthe data, we\u2019ve given end users something they can actually use.\n\nOr, in other words, hairballs in your knowledge graph are a good thing; but\njust don\u2019t let them anywhere near your UI.\n\n### Try it for yourself\n\nIf you have the data, we have the visualization toolkits that can bring it to\nlife.\n\nFor more information, take a look at our detailed white papers, case studies\nand webinars.\n\nOr if you\u2019re ready to get started, request a free evaluation of our powerful\nKeyLines and ReGraph toolkits.\n\n#### Browse our blog\n\n  * All posts\n  * KeyLines posts\n  * ReGraph posts\n  * KronoGraph posts\n  * Graph visualization use cases\n  * Database integrations\n  * Graph visualization best practice\n  * Our company news\n\n#### Read next\n\n##### Visualizing OSINT data to support due diligence investiga...\n\n##### Data visualization and AI: Powering the intelligence cycle\n\n##### Visualizing graph data without a graph database\n\n#### Share this blog post\n\n#### How can we help you?\n\n##### Ready to start?\n\nRequest a free trial\n\n##### Want to learn more?\n\nRead our white papers\n\n##### Looking for success stories?\n\nBrowse our case studies\n\n##### Company\n\n  * About us\n  * Our customers\n  * Corporate information\n  * Our partners\n  * Our impact\n  * Connected Insights\n\n##### Careers\n\n  * Opportunities\n  * Graduates\n  * Paid internships\n  * How we work\n  * Meet the team\n  * Company news\n\n##### Products\n\n  * KeyLines\n  * ReGraph\n  * KronoGraph\n  * Pricing\n  * Evaluation FAQs\n  * Procurement FAQs\n\n##### Register for news & updates\n\nRegistered in England and Wales with Company Number 07625370 | VAT Number 113 1740 61 6-8 Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 1JP.
