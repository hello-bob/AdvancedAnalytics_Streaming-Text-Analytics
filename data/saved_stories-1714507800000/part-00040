Three fuel-cell\nbuses made in China that are free to ride ply the city\u2019s roads, refueling at\nmultifuel stations that come with hydrogen bays. Officials travel around in\nToyota\u2019s Mirai, the world\u2019s first mass-produced hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle.\n\nAuthorities in Sarawak \"are in a way world leaders in hydrogen activities,\u201d\nsaid Gniewomir Flis, a senior advisor at Washington-based climate policy\nadvisory firm Kaya Partners specializing in hydrogen. \"They are among the ones\ngetting the ball rolling.\u201d\n\nSarawak, a state the size of England with a population of 2.5 million, is\nblessed with the rivers and heavy rainfall needed to create hydropower that\ncan generate clean electricity needed for emissions-free hydrogen. Kuching,\nmeanwhile, is a city of over half a million people where the fuel can be much\nmore easily adopted. The true test of Sarawak\u2019s potential is whether it can\nhelp hydrogen commercialize on a larger scale overseas.\n\n\"We have the means to help cool down the world,\u201d Sarawak Premier Abang Johari\nTun Openg, who formulated the state\u2019s hydrogen blueprint in 2019, said in an\ninterview.\n\nTaking Sarawak\u2019s hydrogen global, however, remains a costly and complex task.\nFor one, it requires the construction of whole new infrastructure to produce\nthe gas, transport it to customers and then burn it. Hydrogen cannot be\ntransported on its own due to its low density, and needs to be converted into\nanother chemical liquid compound first.\n\nAn electric charging station for hydrogen tram. A planned autonomous, hydrogen-fuel tram line costing 5.59 billion ringgit ($1.17 billion) is slated to start operations as early as next year. | Bloomberg\n\nGlobal hydrogen use rose to 95 million tons in 2022, and less than 1% of the\ntotal was low-emissions fuel, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n\"The fundamental challenge with hydrogen lies in its transportation logistics,\nas most hydrogen currently used is situated near demand centers,\u201d said Minh\nKhoi Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad Energy.\n\nNonetheless, two Asian countries where hydrogen is seen as crucial to the\ngreen transition have already set their sights on Sarawak as a key provider of\nthe fuel.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s private sector has pledged to pour billions of dollars into\ncreating a value chain for the clean fuel, while Japan, which created the\nworld\u2019s first hydrogen strategy in 2017, said in the latest update in June\nthat it aims to increase consumption of the fuel to 20 million tons by 2050\nfrom about 2 million tons now.\n\nThe countries\u2019 biggest energy companies are partnering with Sarawak\u2019s new\nstate-backed entity, SEDC Energy, to build two hydrogen plants in the port\ncity of Bintulu called H2ornbill and H2biscus, named for the state bird and\nMalaysia\u2019s national flower. The Japan-backed plant, H2ornbill, aims to convert\nhydrogen into methylcyclohexane, a chemical also known as MCH, to be exported\nto Japan. H2biscus, meanwhile, plans to convert its hydrogen output into\nammonia for export to South Korea.\n\nThe two projects, slated to start commercial production in 2028 at the\nearliest, together aim to produce 240,000 tons of hydrogen a year. The figure\nrivals the stated output of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom plant, set to be the world\u2019s\nbiggest after announcing last year it would produce roughly 291,000 tons a\nyear from 2026.\n\nMalaysia is attractive mainly because of the low cost of production of green\nhydrogen, expected to be the cheapest among Southeast Asian countries by 2035,\naccording to BloombergNEF forecasts, and roughly 20% less than in South Korea.\n\n\"A stable supply of electricity at a low cost are the most important points\u201d\nfor Japan\u2019s hydrogen goals, said Shohei Yasuda, an official at the hydrogen\npromotion department of Eneos, one of the Sarawak project\u2019s partners.\n\nA hydrogen bus in Kuching. | Bloomberg\n\nDespite Malaysia\u2019s low costs, green hydrogen still faces huge price hurdles\nagainst much cheaper fossil fuels \u2014 natural gas is currently about a quarter\nthe price of green hydrogen produced with Western technology, according to\nBNEF. And that doesn\u2019t include the cost to liquefy the hydrogen or convert it\nfor export.\n\nLiquefying hydrogen also requires vast amounts of energy \u2014 the process is\nexpensive and consumes more than 30% of the energy content of the fuel,\naccording to the U.S. Department of Energy. It\u2019s also less dense than\nliquefied natural gas, so transporting it at scale would require creating new\nfleets of ships, infrastructure and technology.\n\nAnd the technology is still in the midst of proving itself. The world\u2019s\nlargest green hydrogen project, located in western China, is grappling with\nissues around efficiency and flexibility, according to an analysis by BNEF.\nIts electrolyzers \u2014 machines that strip hydrogen from water \u2014 are currently\nthe cheapest in the market but struggle to manage fluctuations in power from\nsources like solar.\n\nSarawak touts its access to unfettered hydropower as the key to prevent such\nproblems.\n\n\"Our advantage is of course hydropower,\u201d said Robert Hardin, chief executive\nofficer at SEDC Energy. \"We don\u2019t have that issue of intermittent supply.\u201d\n\nWhile hydrogen\u2019s practical use still faces many hurdles, Sarawak is powering\nahead at home. Its biggest undertaking yet is a planned autonomous, hydrogen-\nfuel tram line costing 5.59 billion ringgit ($1.17 billion) that is slated to\nstart operations as early as next year. The trackless tram system, built by a\nunit of China\u2019s CRRC Corp., has not been put into commercial operation\nanywhere in the world.\n\nOther plans in the works in Sarawak include hydrogen-powered waste collection\ntrucks and medium-sized boats, which are a common form of commuting in more\nrural areas, said Robert.\n\nWith more than enough water and hydrogen to power these ambitions, Sarawak\ncould end up looking like a model state for hydrogen, but Kaya Partners\u2019 Flis\nsaid there is also a risk of the investments not working out and becoming\nwhite elephant projects.\n\nAbang Johari admits that the stakes are high.\n\n\"It is a risk, but it is a calculated risk,\u201d he said. \"There is no other\noption, we need alternative energy, and hydrogen, ultimately, is the\ncleanest.\u201d\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nhydrogen(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/hydrogen),\nMalaysia(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/malaysia),\nenergy(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/energy),\nBorneo(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/borneo),\nSarawak(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/sarawak)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
