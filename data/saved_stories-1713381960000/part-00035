But although my conscience has\ncontrolled my actions, my opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that\nthere is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by\nthe belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern\nindustrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached.\nEvery one knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars\nlying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to\nthe laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to\nthe twelfth. This traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do\nnot enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great\npublic propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that after reading\nthe following pages the leaders of the Y. M. C. A. will start a campaign to\ninduce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.\n\nBefore advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I\ncannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to\nengage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or\nshe is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people\u2019s mouths,\nand is, therefore, wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be\nnecessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths\nfull of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns\nhe usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man\nspends his income he puts just as much bread into people\u2019s mouths in spending\nas he takes out of other people\u2019s mouths in earning. The real villain, from\nthis point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a\nstocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not\ngive employment. If he invests his savings the matter is less obvious, and\ndifferent cases arise.\n\nOne of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some\ngovernment. In view of the fact that the bulk of the expenditure of most\ncivilized governments consists in payments for past wars and preparation for\nfuture wars, the man who lends his money to a government is in the same\nposition as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of\nthe man\u2019s economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to\nwhich he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the\nmoney, even if he spent it on drink or gambling.\n\nBut, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in\nindustrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed and produce something\nuseful this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that\nmost enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which\nmight have been devoted to producing something which could be enjoyed, was\nexpended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good\nto anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is,\ntherefore, injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in\ngiving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so\nwould all those on whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and\nthe bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for\nsurface cars in some place where surface cars turn out to be not wanted, he\nhas diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one.\nNevertheless, when he becomes poor through the failure of his investment he\nwill be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay\nspendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a\nfool and a frivolous person.\n\nAll this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great\ndeal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the\nvirtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an\norganized diminution of work.\n\n[inline_ad ad=2]First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first,\naltering the position of matter at or near the earth\u2019s surface relatively to\nother such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is\nunpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second\nkind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give\norders but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually\ntwo opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two different bodies\nof men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is\nnot knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of\nthe art of persuasive speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising.\n\nThroughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more\nrespected than either of the classes of workers. These are men who, through\nownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being\nallowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might,\ntherefore, be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is\nrendered possible only by the industry of others; indeed their desire for\ncomfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work.\nThe last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their\nexample.\n\nFrom the beginning of civilization until the industrial revolution a man\ncould, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the\nsubsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as\nhard and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do\nso. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who\nproduced it, but was appropriated by priests and warriors. In times of famine\nthere was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much\nas at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger.\nThis system persisted in Russia until 1917, and still persists in the East; in\nEngland, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force\nthroughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new\nclass of manufacturers acquired power. In America the system came to an end\nwith the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil\nWar. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a\nprofound impression upon men\u2019s thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for\ngranted about the desirability of work is derived from this system and, being\npre-industrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technic has made it\npossible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small\nprivileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community.\nThe morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no\nneed of slavery.\n\nIt is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves,\nwould not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and\npriests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At\nfirst sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus.\nGradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an\nethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of\ntheir work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of\ncompulsion required was lessened, and the expenses were diminished. To this\nday ninety-nine per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if\nit were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working\nman. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by\nthe holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their\nmasters rather than their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this\nfact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical\nwith the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-\nowners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent\ncontribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just\neconomic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times\nleisure for the few was rendered possible only by the labors of the many. But\ntheir labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is\ngood. And with modern technic it would be possible to distribute leisure\njustly without injury to civilization.\n\nModern technic has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor\nnecessary to produce the necessaries of life for every one. This was made\nobvious during the War. At that time all the men in the armed forces, all the\nmen and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women\nengaged in spying, war propaganda, or government offices connected with the\nWar were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general\nlevel of physical well-being among wage-earners on the side of the Allies was\nhigher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by\nfinance; borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present.\nBut that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of\nbread that does not yet exist. The War showed conclusively that by the\nscientific organization of production it is possible to keep modern\npopulations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the\nmodern world. If at the end of the War the scientific organization which had\nbeen created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work had been\npreserved, and the hours of work had been cut down to four, all would have\nbeen well. Instead of that, the old chaos was restored, those whose work was\ndemanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as\nunemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in\nproportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as\nexemplified by his industry.\n\nThis is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally\nunlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let\nus take an illustration. Suppose that at a given moment a certain number of\npeople are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the\nworld needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by\nwhich the same number of men can make twice as many pins as before. But the\nworld does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly\nany more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world everybody\nconcerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead\nof eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world\nthis would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are\ntoo many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously\nconcerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as\nmuch leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while\nhalf are still overworked. In this way it is insured that the unavoidable\nleisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of\nhappiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?\n\nThe idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the\nrich. In England in the early nineteenth century fifteen hours was the\nordinary day\u2019s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very\ncommonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busy-bodies suggested that\nperhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults\nfrom drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban\nworking men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by\nlaw, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old\nDuchess say, \u201cWhat do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.\u201d People\nnowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much\neconomic confusion.\n\nII\n\nLet us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without\nsuperstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes in the course of his\nlife a certain amount of produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that\nlabor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume\nmore than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than\ncommodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something\nin return for his board and lodging. To this extent, the duty of work must be\nadmitted, but to this extent only.\n\nI shall not develop the fact that in all modern societies outside the U. S. S.\nR. many people escape even this minimum of work, namely all those who inherit\nmoney and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people\nare allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are\nexpected to overwork or starve. If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours\na day there would be enough for everybody, and no unemployment \u2014 assuming a\ncertain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the\nwell-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use\nso much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are\nalready well-off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure\nfor wage-earners except as the grim punishment of unemployment, in fact, they\ndislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons\nto work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their\nwives and daughters having no work at all. The snobbish admiration of\nuselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is\nunder a plutocracy confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more\nin agreement with common sense.\n\nThe wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and\neducation. A man who has worked long hours all his life will be bored if he\nbecomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is\ncut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the\nbulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish\nasceticism, usually vicarious, makes us insist on work in excessive quantities\nnow that the need no longer exists.\n\nIn the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much\nthat is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are\nsome things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes,\nand especially of those who control educational propaganda, on the subject of\nthe dignity of labor is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the\nworld have always preached to what were called the \u201chonest poor.\u201d Industry,\nsobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even\nsubmissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover, authority still\nrepresents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called\nby a new name, Dialectical Materialism.\n\nThe victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the\nvictory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages men had conceded\nthe superior saintliness of women and had consoled women for their inferiority\nby maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the\nfeminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them\nbelieved all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue but\nnot what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A\nsimilar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages the rich\nand their sycophants have written in praise of \u201chonest toil,\u201d have praised the\nsimple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much\nmore likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make\nmanual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the\nposition of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they\nderived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia all\nthis teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously,\nwith the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What\nare, in essence, revivalist appeals are made to secure shock workers for\nspecial tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is\nthe basis of all ethical teaching.\n\nFor the present this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural\nresources, awaits development and has to be developed with very little use of\ncredit. In these circumstances hard work is necessary and is likely to bring a\ngreat reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where\neverybody could be comfortable without working long hours?\n\nIn the West we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no\nattempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce\ngoes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all.\nOwing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts\nof things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working\npopulation idle because we can dispense with their labor by making others\noverwork. When all these methods prove inadequate we have a war: we cause a\nnumber of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to\nexplode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a\ncombination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep\nalive the notion that a great deal of manual work must be the lot of the\naverage man.\n\nIn Russia, owing to economic justice and central control over production, the\nproblem will have to be differently solved. The rational solution would be as\nsoon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all to\nreduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at\neach stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But,\nhaving taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the\nauthorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and\nlittle work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh\nschemes by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I\nread recently of an ingenious scheme put forward by Russian engineers for\nmaking the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm by putting a dam\nacross the Kara Straits. An admirable plan, but liable to postpone proletarian\ncomfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid\nthe ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it\nhappens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in\nitself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer\nneeded.\n\nIII\n\nThe fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is\nnecessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life.\nIf it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We\nhave been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping\nthe poor contented, which has led the rich for thousands of years to preach\nthe dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in\nthis respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us\ndelight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth\u2019s\nsurface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker.\nIf you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to\nsay, \u201cI enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man\u2019s\nnoblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his\nplanet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill\nin as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can\nreturn to the toil from which my contentment springs.\u201d I have never heard\nworking men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be\nconsidered, as a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure\nhours that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.\n\nIt will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know\nhow to fill their days if they had only four hours\u2019 work out of the twenty-\nfour. In so far as this is true in the modern world it is a condemnation of\nour civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was\nformerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some\nextent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that\neverything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its\nown sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the\nhabit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into\ncrime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable,\nbecause it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the\ndesirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-\nturvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you\nwith bread are praiseworthy because they are making money but when you enjoy\nthe food they have provided you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to\nget strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is\ngood and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one\ntransaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good but\nkeyholes are bad. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the\nsocial purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is\nthis divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that\nmakes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which\nprofitmaking is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production and\ntoo little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance\nto enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the\npleasure that it gives to the consumer.\n\nWhen I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning\nto imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure\nfrivolity. I mean that four hours\u2019 work a day should entitle a man to the\nnecessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time\nshould be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such\nsocial system that education should be carried farther than it usually is at\npresent, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man\nto use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things\nthat would be considered \u201chigh-brow.\u201d Peasant dances have died out except in\nremote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must\nstill exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become\nmainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the\nradio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are\nfully taken up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy\npleasures in which they took an active part.\n\nIn the past there was a small leisure class and a large working class. The\nleisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social\njustice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and\ncaused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts\ngreatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it\ncontributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the\narts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the\nphilosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the\noppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class\nmankind would never have emerged from barbarism.\n\nThe method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however,\nextraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to\nbe industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It\nmight produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of\ncountry gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-\nhunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to\nprovide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided\naccidentally and as a byproduct. This is a great improvement, but it has\ncertain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at\nlarge that men who live in an academic milieu tend to be unaware of the pre-\noccupations of ordinary men and women; moreover, their ways of expressing\nthemselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that\nthey ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in\nuniversities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original\nline of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions,\ntherefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of\ncivilization in a world where every one outside their walls is too busy for\nunutilitarian pursuits.\n\nIn a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day every\nperson possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every\npainter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures\nmay be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by\nsensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence\nneeded for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will\nhave lost the taste and the capacity. Men who in their professional work have\nbecome interested in some phase of economics or government will be able to\ndevelop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of\nuniversity economists lacking in reality. Medical men will have time to learn\nabout the progress of medicine. Teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling\nto teach by routine things which they learned in their youth, which may, in\nthe interval, have been proved to be untrue.\n\nAbove all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves,\nweariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure\ndelightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired\nin their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive\nand vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in\nprofessional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will\nnot depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be\nunhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by\nelderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the\nadvantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the\nopportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and\nless inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out,\npartly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe\nwork for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world\nneeds most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life\nof arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the\npossibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen instead to have\noverwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be\nas energetic as we were before there were machines. In this we have been\nfoolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.\n\n### Tags\n\n20th century Hours of labor Leisure Social classes Work ethic\n\n### More from Bertrand Russell\n\n### Wraparound\n\n### Wraparound\n\n### Reports\n\nFrom the\n\nOctober 1932 issue\n\n#### From the Archive\n\nTimeless stories from our 173-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of\nthe day.\n\n### Got it!
