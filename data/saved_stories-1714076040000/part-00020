You\nfire up psql to start running queries... but your connection doesn\u2019t work.\nThis post examines the five most common connection errors in PostgreSQL and\nhow you can solve them.\n\n## Sorry, Too Many Clients Already\n\nThis message is a classic, usually followed up with \u201cremaining connection\nslots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections.\u201d\n\nPostgreSQL has a limited number of connections to the database, controlled by\nthe max_connections parameter. This could be set globally, on a role, or in a\ndatabase. When you exceed this number, new connections will get this error,\nalthough superusers may still be able to connect (another parameter controls\nthe limit for them, max_superuser_connections).\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Solution: You need to reduce your connection counts in the short term.\nEither stop some applications that are connected to the database, log in a\nsuperuser, and terminate some of the connections, or, as a last resort,\nrestart the PostgreSQL service to dump all connections (but you\u2019d also lose\nall open transactions).\n\nTo stop hitting this again and again, you have three options:\n\n  1. Audit why you used so many connections, and try reducing that number.\n  2. Increase max_connections (but remember that each connection is a process; ideally, you don\u2019t want to have more than 2x your thread/CPU count actively doing things).\n  3. Add a connection pool in front of PostgreSQL, which will allow a large number of application connections to be efficiently mapped on a smaller number of PostgreSQL connections. PgBouncer is a good option (and even better news, if you\u2019re using Timescale, you can add it with a single click).\n\n## No pg_hba.conf Entry for Host\n\nClient authentication in PostgreSQL is controlled by a file called pg_hba.conf\n(which usually lives in your data directory). The file contains a series of\nmappings between {connection_type, host, username, database} and\nauthentication methods. Each time a connection happens, it will be compared\nagainst the records top-down. The first one that matches will be used to\nhandle the connections. If the connection does not match any records, it will\nbe rejected.\n\nWhen you connect, your host is not matched in the pg_hba.conf file and the\nconnection has been rejected. In this case, you\u2019re trying to connect over a\nnetwork connection (that will match the word host in the first column of\npg_hba.conf).\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Solution: You could add a specific record for your host or a generic record\nto allow all hosts. More information can be found in the\npg_hba.confdocumentation, but a generic record might look like this:\n\n    \n    \n    host all all all scram-sha-256\n\nSo, match a host connection for all databases, for all users, and from all\nhosts, and use scram authentication. Remember that records are read top-down,\nand the first matching one is selected. After making the change, you\u2019d need to\nreload or restart your PostgreSQL server.\n\n## Connection to Server on Socket Failed: No Such File or Directory\n\nThis error is often encountered when attempting to connect to the PostgreSQL\nserver using psql without any hostname (from the -h flag, or the URI). In this\ncase, a local UNIX socket connection will be made, but psql can\u2019t find the\nsocket file. This issue usually arises due to a discrepancy in the expected\nlocation of the socket file or the PostgreSQL server not running.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Solution: Verify that the PostgreSQL server is running. If it\u2019s not, then\nthis could be an easy fix. Start it up and try again.\n\nIf the error persists, one of three situations are possible:\n\n  * The version of psql you\u2019re using isn\u2019t the one that came with the PostgreSQL binary that is running.\n  * The PostgreSQL server is running on a non-standard port.\n  * The unix_socket_directories setting has been changed.\n\nCheck the postgresql.conf file to confirm the port and unix_socket_directories\nsettings. Try to use them in the psql command as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    psql -p <PORT> -h <UNIX_SOCKET_DIRECTORIES>\n\nHopefully, you can connect!\n\nAs a last resort, you could try connecting with psql -h localhost, which will\nconnect via the local network and not a socket.\n\n\ud83d\udd16\n\nForgot how to connect to your Postgres services? See how you can connect with\nthe .pg_service.conf file.\n\n## Connection to Server Failed: Connection Refused\n\nThis error message appears when the PostgreSQL server does not respond to a\nnetwork connection attempt (in fact, it\u2019s the mirror to the previous error\nwhen connecting via the network and not a local socket). It can occur if the\nserver is not running, it is listening on a different port than the one being\nconnected to, or network issues are preventing the connection.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Solution: Ensure the PostgreSQL server is up and check the postgresql.conf\nfile for the listen_addresses and port settings.\n\nTo ensure that PostgreSQL is listening on all interfaces, listen_addresses\nshould be set to *. If this and the port are what you expect, then it\u2019s\npossible that either a firewall or network element is blocking your connection\n(maybe the server is on a private network), or you have the hostname wrong.\n\n## Database \"X\" Does Not Exist\n\nThis error occurs when a user tries to connect to a PostgreSQL database that\ndoes not exist or the database name is incorrectly specified in the connection\nstring. It's common to mistakenly use a username as the database name if not\nspecified properly. In fact, if you specify a user when running psql with the\n-U flag, the database name will default to match the user name. In this case,\nyou could also use -D to specify a database.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Solution: Double-check the database name in your connection command or\nstring to ensure it is spelled correctly and corresponds to one of the\ndatabases on your PostgreSQL server. You can list all databases by connecting\nwith psql and running \\l or using a graphical tool like PGAdmin or PopSQL.\n\nIf the database does not exist, create it with CREATE DATABASE\n[database_name]; or adjust your connection parameters to reference an existing\ndatabase.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn this post, we covered the five most common PostgreSQL connection errors and\nshowed you how to solve them.
