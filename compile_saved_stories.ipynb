Which brings us to Humane.\\n\\nHumane raised $230 Million and spent six years to ship an \"Ai Pin,\" with\\ndisastrous results.\\n\\nThe pin shipped with fraction of the features promised at its unveiling eleven\\nmonths ago, and what features that did ship fail most of the time. It\\'s too\\nheavy, and has atrocious battery life, with users expected to swap batteries\\nevery few hours as the device runs uncomfortably hot. Its projector is useless\\nin daylight, and its input system is awkward and slow. For a device meant to\\nreplace your phone, you expect an experience faster than just whipping out\\nyour phone.\\n\\nIt\\'s safe to say the Ai Pin deserves an exhibit alongside Juicero and Clinkle\\nin the museum of Silicon Valley misfires. It stands out from those flops\\nbecause, unlike your Clinkles, this isn\\'t the story of a young man given too\\nmuch money and power without the maturity to wield it. Humane\\'s founders\\nworked on the first iPhone.\\n\\nI don\\'t have any inside information on what went wrong, but I have theories\\nbased on my experiences with venture backed startups and my understanding of\\nThe Apple Way of doing things.\\n\\n### The Venture Capital Mindset\\n\\nA question that keeps coming up is how Humane raised so much money while\\nlaunching nothing. To get there, we need to break down what Venture Capital\\nis, and how VC firms think about investments.\\n\\nRich people and rich organizations (think pension funds and billion dollar\\ncollege endowments) don\\'t throw all their money in a savings account or the\\nstock market. They have so much money that they can place bets in alternative\\ninvestments. These are hedge funds, real estate, or venture capital a.k.a.\\n\"throw money at a ton of startups.\"\\n\\nInvestment returns always correlate with risk. Back in 2018, a savings account\\nmight earn you a 1% every year, with zero risk that you\\'ll lose money. The\\nstock market might earn you 10%, but carries the risk of a 2007 meltdown. The\\nrisk in Venture Capital is downright absurd, with many if not most of your\\ninvestments losing money. But every so often you find a smash hit that pays\\nback 10,000%.\\n\\nA respected VC once explained that a third of their investments flop and a\\nthird break even, so they need that last one third to be so successful that\\nthey both cancel-out the flops and make big returns for investors. That\\'s all\\nto say they play the opposite of moneyball: they aren\\'t looking for safe bets,\\nbut a few home runs. You only need to pick one Uber-scale success to make up\\nfor picking a dozen Juiceros.\\n\\nWhile a normal person would be insane to put their retirement into startups, a\\nVC fund may pool hundreds of millions of dollar— even upwards of a billion\\ndollars— from people and groups so rich that losing $1m feels like a normal\\nperson losing $20 in the washing machine. The fund casts a wide net, and every\\nonce in a while they find an AirBnB.\\n\\nWhile the people who manage these investment firms like to paint themselves as\\n\"billionaire scouts\" that possess some keen intuition to pick the winners and\\nlosers, in reality there\\'s a handful of checkboxes that any mediocre dude can\\nfollow.\\n\\nOne big signal is whether the startup founder\\'s had prior success. Once you\\nsell your first startup, VCs knock down your door to fund your next one.\\nWhenever you hear about a stupid startup getting a truckload of funding, it\\'s\\nlikely a case of a successful founder\\'s sophomoric follow-up to another\\nwinning startup.\\n\\nWhile Humane\\'s founders never ran their own startup, one of them (Imran\\nChaudhri\\'s) did work on the original iPhone. How big a role is up for debate,\\nand most Apple people I talk to think that he takes far too much credit for\\nother people\\'s work. However, Imran\\'s personal website is titled \"Select\\nPatented Works, Volume 1: 1995-2017,\" and links to a thousand patents, his\\nname alongside Steve Jobs. While it makes a lot of people I know cringe, it\\'s\\nenough to get your startup pitch in front of a VC.\\n\\nWithin the pitch, VCs look for \"moats.\" These are the features of the company\\nthat make it hard for competitors to copy, or otherwise lock your users into\\nthe service. Normal people call these \"monopolies,\" but VCs would rather not\\nsay the quiet part aloud.\\n\\nHumane was pitched as replacing the the phone, so look to the iPhone for the\\nmoats. Once users trust a service with their most precious photos, they never\\nwant to deal with the hassle of switching. Once developers start developing\\nfor your platform, it\\'s hard for even the best competitors (WebOS, Windows\\nPhone) to catch up with that momentum.\\n\\nFinally, VCs look at investments through the lens of, \"Why now?\" In 2012 Uber\\nshowed that gig work could be the future of employment, so VCs rushed to back\\nDoorDash and Instacart and anything else related to gig work. Humane was\\nfounded in 2018, a time when everyone realized screens could be toxic. Within\\nSilicon Valley, parents made nannies sign contracts agreeing to hide their\\nphones from kids. Maybe they imagined phones being stigmatized the same way we\\nstigmatize public smoking.\\n\\nFor all its interesting points, Humane had red flags. Married cofounders are a\\nred flag so big you can see it from outer space. I think VCs cut Humane slack\\nbecause they were desperate to fund anything during the late 2010\\'s.\\n\\nWithout making this whole post about financial theory, just understand that\\nlow interest rates lead to more startup investments. Following the financial\\nmeltdown of 2008, the US saw an unprecedented period of low interest rates,\\nand there\\'s even a meme going around where everything insane during the 2010\\'s\\ntech bubble is labeled a \"Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, there was more money flowing into Silicon Valley than there were\\nquality startups to invest in. That\\'s ok for VCs because they actually make\\nmoney whether or not they pick a winner. They charge \"maintenance fees\" in the\\nrange of 1.5% to 2.5%, so when an endowment writes a VC a check for nine\\nfigures, the firm makes millions a year. This meant that Humane didn\\'t have to\\nbe a knockout, they just had to be the last single person at the bar at\\nclosing time.\\n\\n### Startups Favor Speed\\n\\nDespite all its quirks, Humane might have worked out it followed a traditional\\nVC startup formula. Instead, they tried to follow The Apple Way, where 1.0\\nproducts need to be so insanely polished as to blow everyone people away.\\n\\nThat approach makes sense for Apple. At minimum, they have a reputation to\\nkeep up. Sometimes the Apple Way leads to incredible products, like the first\\niPhone. Sometimes it doesn\\'t work so well, in the case of the Apple Watch,\\nImran\\'s final project at the company.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch wasn\\'t a flop, but it did struggle a bit out of the gate.\\nThat\\'s expected when you try new things. Before you launch, you live in\\nvacuum, and you operate on faith that your theories will pan out. After a\\nlaunch, you find some of your theories were right (\"Apple Watch is a fitness\\ncompanion\"), and some very wrong (\"People will spend $10,000 on a solid gold\\ngadget\").\\n\\nThe Apple Way works best when they take an existing product and make it\\namazing. The best pitch for Apple Watch wasn\\'t \"The Rolex of Tech,\" but\\nrather, \"A very fancy FitBit.\"\\n\\nIt also helps when a product leverages Apple\\'s existing ecosystem, and the\\ngoodwill Apple had earned from customers. The Apple Watch connected to the\\nhealth app, received messages from your phone, played your favorite music,\\netc. Apple has a beautiful moat, I\\'m sure filled with stunning koi fish.\\n\\nHumane spent five years developing their product in a vacuum. They lacked a\\nFitBit to prove their concept. They had little evidence people want to ditch\\ntheir phones. They didn\\'t know what form factors users would tolerate. They\\ndidn\\'t have normal people telling them battery swaps are dumb.\\n\\nBut the most damaging consequence of their delayed launch was missing the\\nchance to strike while the iron was hot. Humane sounded like a decent idea in\\n2018, but that same year the iPhone launched its \"Screen Time,\" which has\\nproven a good enough solution for many to curb their screen addiction. In the\\nfollowing years we\\'ve watched a decline in the use of social media, which\\ngives me a \"nature is healing\" vibe. Phone addiction is still a thing, but it\\nfeels more like pot than fentanyl.\\n\\n### The AI Pivot\\n\\nIt\\'s obvious that Humane pivoted to AI late in the game, and it\\'s obvious how\\nthey got backed into that corner. The formula for a VC backed company goes:\\n\\n  1. Raise a little bit of money\\n  2. Build something\\n  3. Prove it\\'s taking off\\n  4. Go to step 1\\n\\nThe more you can show a VC that your company is taking off, the more generous\\nthe terms of their investment. Being in a position of power means the\\ndifference between giving up 5% or 20% of your company for the exact same\\nmoney.\\n\\nThis was a lesson lost through the 2010\\'s as money flowed freely and\\nentrepreneurs raised way more than they needed. When interest rates went up in\\n2022, startups suddenly found it harder to raise money. Investors were\\nsuddenly interested in— GASP— profitability.\\n\\nAt this point Humane had raised $130m, which sounds like a lost of money, but\\nthey were also growing their headcount to hundreds of employees. This is\\ninsane when you haven\\'t validated your product. Knowing typical tech salaries,\\nI\\'ll guess they were burning $30m per year in salaries alone. On top for this,\\nI\\'m sure they\\'d want to sell their product at a loss, the same way that Sony\\nand Microsoft sell game consoles to grow their user base. Gotta build that\\nmoat.\\n\\nHumane was in a precarious position for raising more money. Normally,\\ninvestors expect startups to find an \"exit\" (IPO or get acquired) somewhere\\nbetween five and eight years from its inception. That\\'s when investors get\\ntheir money back with profit. According to VC schedule, Humane should already\\nhave a product on the market with a growing user base, and at least showing a\\npath to profitability.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, Humane needed an investor to write a big check. One\\nreason you only ask for less money in your early years is that early-stage\\ninvestors are comfortable losing a few million here and there. The late-stage\\ninvestors that write nine figure checks look for safer bets, and they can get\\nby with mere 5× returns.\\n\\nSo Humane needed to ship something to look like a later stage company, but as\\nwe now know, their hardware sucked. They decided to latch on to AI, which was\\nin the midst of a huge hype cycle. They shifted messaging away from the\\nprojector, and in May 2023, Imran delivered a Ted Talk with an obviously\\nrigged demo that focused on AI.\\n\\nI tweeted my theory about an AI pivot in November 2023, and it found its way\\nto the official Humane fan Discord. (Yes, Humane setup a fan Discord before\\nannouncing any sort of product. They also ran a podcast dedicated to how\\nawesome they were.)\\n\\nBethany replied:\\n\\nNow when someone says \"you\\'re wrong\" without telling you how you\\'re wrong,\\nyou\\'re probably more right than wrong. Bethany tries to hand wave things away\\nby mentioning \"the pitch and vision,\" but... come on.\\n\\nI\\'m sure their 2018 pitch was about a post-iPhone device. I\\'m sure it\\nmentioned a Siri-like assistant. There was zero chance that it involved\\nChatGPT in 2018, because ChatGPT launched in 2022.\\n\\nIf it\\'s true they always envisioned an AI-first experience, and they spent six\\nyears of their lives only to ship this, well, that\\'s way more embarrassing\\nthan a last-minute AI pivot.\\n\\n### The Power of Failing Fast\\n\\nThe problems with Humane began at their seed stage. They should have tested\\nthe idea faster, and rejected it right away. I get that hardware is different\\nthan software, and there\\'s no way Humane could have shipped their projector in\\na matter of months, or years, but it should have been obvious from early\\nprototypes that this product had a minuscule chance of working in the real\\nworld. We\\'ve already seen the concept debunked.\\n\\nYet I tried to withhold judgement after that Ted Talk. I thought, \"Maybe they\\nfound a solution to projecting in daylight without getting really hot and\\negregiously depleting the battery.\" They didn\\'t. They patched over it. Short\\nbattery life? Battery swaps! Doesn\\'t work in daylight? Uh... don\\'t use it in\\ndaylight!\\n\\nFor all we know, maybe they did build prototypes but convinced themselves it\\nwould be solved. These are certain types of problems you can solve at the\\nscale of Apple, but intractable at this startup. Scaling a startup is about\\ndeferring those moonshot bets until your company has the momentum to compete\\nat that scale.\\n\\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with pitching one idea to investors and\\ngoing in a totally different direction. There\\'s a saying that early-stage\\ninvestors back the team, not the idea. Twitter started as a podcast platform,\\nand pivoted to social media after getting sherlocked by Apple. Slack started\\nas— I kid you not— an MMORPG.\\n\\nHumane could have kept true to the essence of their product, detaching from\\nour phones, while not having to fight an unwinnable battle. What about an\\ne-ink phone? Imagine a device that gives you weeks of battery life, but too\\nlow-fi to leave you vulnerable to addictive apps. Maybe that idea sucks, but\\nI\\'d try a hundred others before going all in on the doomed laser projector\\n\\nPerhaps we can blame the early commitment on raising too much money, too\\nearly. I wish more entrepreneurs knew that you don\\'t need to raise money right\\naway. The co-founders must have walked away from Apple with enough money to\\ndiddle on silly concepts for a few years without pressure from investors. The\\nmoment they accepted their first check, the clock was ticking. They had eight\\nyears to build the next Apple.\\n\\nIt\\'s that funding that will be Humane\\'s undoing. Before the Ai Pin launch,\\nthey convinced investors the company is worth $850 million. When they go back\\nfor their next round, they need to argue with a straight face that the company\\nis now worth $1.7 Billion. Good luck with that.\\n\\nIt\\'s very likely that the next time Humane raises money, they\\'ll have to value\\nthe company less than what they told their last group of investors. These\\n\"Down Rounds\" screw recent investors and employees, as the stock that they\\nbought is worth less than what they paid for it. It also has a chilling effect\\non longtime employees. Do not be surprised by an exodus.\\n\\n### The Hubris\\n\\nI don\\'t write essays about startups failing because it feels like punching\\ndown. I wouldn\\'t want anyone doing it to me. In fact, my own apps have been\\nplagiarized more than a few times, and I\\'ll usually tongue rather than trash\\ntalk the developers. It\\'s just tacky and a waste of energy.\\n\\nIf I had to give one bit of PR advice to a startup, it\\'s to be humble. I\\nlearned this from Twitter\\'s early early years, when users somehow tolerated\\nweekly service outages. I think users forgave Twitter for all its mistakes\\nbecause Ev Williams is a good guy who cultivated a humble culture. Nobody\\npublicly trash talked Facebook. Even flops like Google Buzz were relegated to\\na few chuckles on internal mailing lists. I didn\\'t know anyone at the company\\ndriven by destroying the other guys.\\n\\nHumane\\'s follies were amplified by overconfidence, as if they thought they\\nwere still working at Apple. When Apple launches a thing, they tell you it\\'s\\nthe best thing in the world. More often than not, they\\'re right. People are\\nattracted to confidence, so I get why it works in Apple\\'s favor, but if you\\ncome for the king you best not miss.\\n\\nIf you aren\\'t 100% confident your product will work (which is to say, every\\nstartup), hype and overconfidence are self sabotage. People forgive of\\nunderdog startup that swings and misses, but when an overconfident dude trash\\ntalks the competition and falls flat on his face, everyone laughs.\\n\\nEarlier that year Humane released a trailer that vaguely teased something like\\na projector system. (Weird choice for an AI centric product?) The trailer felt\\nlike a battle cry in the same vein as Apple\\'s 1984 commercial. Don\\'t get me\\nwrong, Apple\\'s commercial was awesome, but maybe it was that hubris that Steve\\nJobs got fired from Apple a year later?\\n\\nWhen Steve Jobs returned, he pushed a culture where Apple pre-announces\\nnothing. Maybe he knew that if you let your customers imagination run wild,\\nyou have no hope of meeting their expectations.\\n\\nOnly hubris can explain Humane\\'s dumbest product decision: a mandatory $24/mo\\nsubscription that uses a separate phone number. Set aside the money, nobody\\nwants to manage two numbers! I have two email addresses and regret it whenever\\nI fill out a form.\\n\\nI can picture the Humane product meeting in my head. \"When we released the\\niPhone, we didn\\'t design it as an accessory for your current phone. It had to\\nbe so amazing that users will be ready to go all-in. We cannot compromise Ai\\nPin by making it an accessory. We must burn the ships.\"\\n\\nThe flaw in this reasoning is that everything before the iPhone sucked. People\\nwere happy to switch to a smartphone, aside from $600 price tag which was hard\\nto swallow.\\n\\nToday we are so reliant on smart phones that abandoning them would upend our\\nlives. My brokerage account uses a bespoke authentication app, so without my\\nphone and that very specific app, I can\\'t access that money. That would be\\nsolved if my brokerage firm ported their authenticator to the Ai Pin, but that\\nwill never, ever happen.\\n\\nIt\\'s a credit to the ridiculous momentum of the first iPhone that Apple\\nconvinced so many developers to learn a completely new set of skills, and\\nthose developers have now spent 16 years in this ecosystem. Why waste time and\\nenergy learning a new platform when it doesn\\'t look like there\\'s going to be a\\nmarket for their apps?\\n\\nA better strategy for AI Pin 1.0 would have been to release it as an accessory\\nthat pairs with your iPhone. Drop the cell connection to improve battery life\\nand bring down costs. If users bring their own carrier, there\\'s fewer\\ncomplaints about dropped connections.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re cutting features, drop the camera. How many people want to take\\nphotos that they can\\'t frame ahead of time? Save money on parts, and use that\\nspace to fit more battery. Lower costs opens things up to more users, which\\nentice third-party developers to get into the ground floor of the next big\\nthing.\\n\\nInstead, Humane tried to cosplay as Apple, adopting its \"My way or the\\nhighway\" attitude without any of Apple\\'s leverage that makes it work.\\n\\n### The Danger of Nostalgia\\n\\nKen Kocienda is a microcosm of Humane\\'s obsession with the past. Ken worked on\\nthe original iPhone virtual keyboard, and has reminded everyone within earshot\\nfor the last two decades. Since leaving Apple, he decided to make \"Apple is\\nover\" his personal brand with all the angst of a dude who got dumped and\\ninsists, \"I dumped her!\"\\n\\nAfter tweeting so many strong opinions on design, engineering, and product,\\nKen launched the first product of his own in 2020, Upspell. It failed to catch\\nthe world on fire, and the following year he was hired by Humane to lead\\nproduct engineering.\\n\\nI\\'m not here to make fun of UpSpell. It\\'s a perfectly fine game. But Ken made\\na very big deal about how he wrote it with Objective-C, and it\\'s so much\\nbetter than Swift. He published a video about it, which boils down to, \"I\\nalready know Objective-C and Swift is too complicated.\" He presents a false\\ndichotomy where you can either work on Swift or focus on building great user\\nexperiences.\\n\\nKen\\'s opinions fly in the face of most iPhone developers who rejoiced in the\\nmove to Swift. Sure, it requires learning new things, but Swift rewards you\\nwith fewer bugs and greater productivity. I spent eight years writing\\nObjective-C before moving to Swift, and I\\'ve never regretted the switch. I now\\nbuild features in hours instead of days, and that gives me more time to\\ndelivered great user experiences.\\n\\nThere\\'s an irony in Ken\\'s video. He argues that apps are about great\\nexperiences and not technology, but instead of making a video about how\\nawesome UpSpell is, he made a promotional video about technology.\\n\\nThe Humane projection system looks really cool, but the experience sucks. The\\nAI experience sounds cool on paper, but the results suck. For all of Humane\\'s\\ntalk about freeing users from technology, they shipped technology in search of\\na purpose.\\n\\nI blame the team\\'s nostalgia. They clearly wants to recreate the Apple from\\n2007, but that\\'s impossible under a venture capital constraints and without\\nthe momentum of Apple. Contrary to what Imran, Ken, and I\\'m sure many others\\nat Humane believe, the iPhone didn\\'t begin with their work in the 2000\\'s on\\nProject Purple. It began in 1976 with the Apple computer, and the decades of\\ngoodwill it built up in consumers. The project was spearheaded by a guy ready\\nto waste billions in iPod revenue if it helped achieve his vision, and he\\nanswered to nobody. It came together at the perfect point in time, when\\neveryone knew the power of the Internet, but there wasn\\'t a way to carry the\\nwhole experience in your pocket. You can\\'t replicate all these factors in a\\nfew years, no matter how much money a VC throws at you.\\n\\nI love Apple\\'s products, and that\\'s why I build my own products outside the\\nventure capital system. I also advise and invest in companies that are\\ncompatible with venture capital, because it can actually work out fine if\\nyou\\'re prepared for the faustian deal. For my own projects, I\\'m happy building\\npolished products that will never be worth billions of dollars. But what would\\nI do if I wanted to build the next iPhone?\\n\\nImran left Apple in 2017, and his departure email suggested that Apple\\'s best\\ndays were behind it. Seven years later, it launched the Vision Pro, a\\ngargantuan effort on par with the original iPhone. We still don\\'t know where\\nit will go, but the launch itself makes it clear Apple is still full of\\npassionate, brilliant people ready to tackle the next big thing.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a tragic lesson to learn from Humane, it\\'s that if you spend all of\\nyour time dwelling on the past, you\\'ll miss your chance to shape the future\\nsitting right there in front of you.\\n\\n### Subscribe to Sandofsky\\n\\nDon’t miss out on the latest issues.

This blog is to share some personal projects\\nwhich others may find interesting.\\n\\n### The Last Mile\\n\\n  * Get link\\n  * Facebook\\n  * Twitter\\n  * Pinterest\\n  * Email\\n  * Other Apps\\n\\nApril 14, 2024\\n\\n# The Last Mile - The problem with FOSS\\n\\nThis article is about FOSS (free and open-source software). The expression\\n\"The Last Mile\" refers to supply chain or delivery services that get the\\nproducts or packages into people\\'s hands. A larger company or service may\\nproduce it and ship it across the world, but it is usually up to a local\\ncompany/carrier to bring it the last mile. I see FOSS as having a \"Last Mile\"\\nproblem. The problem is that it\\'s missing proper incentives to\\nmaintain/finish/optimize projects which become important to a large set of\\ncomputer users. Occasionally I benefit from this problem - I optimize other\\npeople\\'s software for a living; some of that software starts out as an open\\nsource project.\\n\\n### Problem #1 (lack of upstreamed improvements)\\n\\nA few years ago I optimized a FOSS tool (ETCPACK - Ericsson Texture\\nCompressor) for a large Silicon Valley company. This tool is used for\\ncompressing RGB images into a lossy texture that GPUs can directly decompress.\\nMy optimizations gave a significant speedup and I asked my supervisor to\\nupstream the changes so that others could benefit. The response was typical,\\nbut not surprising - \"The legal department won\\'t approve of this, so forget\\nabout it\". I\\'ve been in similar situations with the same decision when working\\nwith other companies. In this case, I felt quite strongly that this was a\\nshortsighted move because there was no competitive advantage to be lost by\\nsharing the code, it simply makes artists and programmer\\'s jobs go faster.\\n\\n### Problem #2 Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation\\n\\nA great majority of open source projects start out in a similar humble way -\\nthe author had a need or desire to write some software and shared it with the\\ncommunity. The reasons for sharing it can be altruistic or not. This is\\nintrinsic motivation - when you want to get something done because \"reasons\".\\nFor me, I sometimes want to test an idea for making code execute faster, or I\\nneed something for a personal project (e.g. a LCD display library). Maybe the\\nexisting solutions don\\'t quite fit or I want to do it \"My Way TM️\". All of\\nthese reasons are perfectly valid and some great FOSS projects started this\\nway. What comes next? Well, the project will get supported (or exist) as long\\nas the original author wants it to. Perhaps other people join in, fork the\\nproject, and make improvements. Great, this happened with libjpeg. The JPEG\\n(joint photographers expert group) released some reference code in the early\\n1990s to get people started and unfortunately no one improved it (at least\\npublicly) for a long time. Someone was eventually inspired to create the\\nlibjpeg-turbo project. It may have been for personal (intrinsic) reasons or\\nmaybe a company seeded the money to do the work. This is a major flaw in the\\nwhole system - most people on the Earth operate in a capitalist society and\\nneed money as a (extrinsic) motivation to work. The avenues for getting paid\\nto work on open source are mostly non-existent.\\n\\n### Problem #3 The FOSS Checkbox Item\\n\\nAnother aspect of FOSS I\\'ve encountered too many times is when companies\\n\"Support FOSS and the community\" because it serves their business needs (e.g.\\nthey sell hardware and share FOSS projects to support their hardware). When\\npressed to actually support the FOSS community (e.g. financial support for\\nother\\'s code they profit from), crickets. The other frequent situation is the\\nFOSS purist who won\\'t share the code used in the \"binary blob\" in their\\nproducts. They support FOSS as long is they get to keep trade secrets when\\nthey feel like it serves their needs. A good name for some of this behavior\\nmight be \"FINO = FOSS in name only\". Microsoft is a recognizable name in the\\nFINO category.\\n\\n### Problem #4 Theft\\n\\nThe various licenses in use for FOSS (e.g. LGPL, Apache) are there to protect\\nthe rights of the author(s). The truth is that a lot of FOSS ends up in\\ncommercial products with the attribution/copyright notice removed, no\\nroyalties paid and no respect for the original author\\'s rights. There\\'s not\\nmuch that can be done about that. I\\'m confident that this has kept a lot of\\ngreat code from being shared.\\n\\n### Problem #5 The Wasted Cycles\\n\\nThere are billions of computers in use these days - they form \"the internet\"\\nas well as the private machines running in homes and offices. A lot of that\\ncode has been carefully optimized to use as few cycles / gigawatts as\\npossible. You can bet that the most optimized software in use will be the code\\nwhich runs the cloud services of big companies like Google, Amazon and Apple.\\nTheir services and processes need to be efficient because the electricity and\\ntime represent a measurable and significant part of their operating expenses\\n(How much does one search cost?). That\\'s a strong incentive for the big\\ncompanies to use the most efficient processors and optimize their software to\\nthe fullest... but what about the users who pay to rent those machines (aka\\nvirtual machines / cloud services)? Do you think Amazon cares how inefficient\\nyour python scripts running on their machines are? This is the issue that irks\\nme the most. Amazon/Google/Apple actually benefit financially from your\\nprocesses being wasteful. They may provide tools and advice for helping you to\\noptimize your code, but they still benefit from your inefficient use of their\\ncomputer time - the slower your code, the more money they make. This isn\\'t a\\nsurprise for a capitalistic arrangement, but it is detrimental to the\\nenvironment because most electric generation is still not emission free.\\n\\n### The Last Mile\\n\\nAll of these problems with FOSS bring us back to the point of this article -\\nfor someone like me to contribute to the FOSS community purely out of\\nintrinsic motivation is really shortsighted. The lack of extrinsic motivation\\nlimits the possibilities of making significant improvements to popular\\nprojects which could in turn have significant cost savings at scale. Let\\'s use\\nan example that shows my point. The libjpeg project comes with several command\\nline utilities. One of these is jpegtran - a tool to transform JPEG images\\n(rotate/crop/convert/etc). Several of these options are specialized code which\\nuses specific knowledge of JPEG encoding to perform functions like lossless\\ncropping. If you were to decompress a JPEG image, crop it, then recompress it\\nusing the normal JPEG functions, it would suffer additional distortions and\\nloss of quality. The jpegtran CLI is used in many server back-end processes to\\ncleanly extract pieces of larger images without further degrading the quality.\\njpegtran does the lossless cropping by decoding the image only to the point of\\nthe DCT coefficients; it essentially keeps the pixels in the frequency domain\\ninstead of doing the lossy part (converting them back and forth from the\\nspatial domain). This idea also happens to save time since the forward and\\nreverse discrete cosine transforms are skipped. The libjpeg-turbo project\\noptimized this even further. Now we\\'re at the point where things will become\\nclear. The way that jpegtran does lossless crop is reasonable, logical and\\nassumed to be the best/right way to do the job. I thought about this problem\\nand a new idea entered my head. I spent many hours prototyping my idea and it\\nworked. My version of lossless crop is much faster than jpegtran-turbo. When I\\nsay much faster, I don\\'t mean a 25% improvement, I\\'m talking about 300-500%\\nfaster. On my MacBook Air M1 I created a command line utility which takes the\\nsame parameters as jpegtran. I ran it multiple times against jpegtran to\\neliminate and file/memory caching differences. Here are the results when\\nrequesting a 1024x1024 crop from a 7200x5400 image:\\n\\ntime ./jpegtran -crop 1024x1024 ~/Downloads/large.jpg > out.jpg 0.20s user\\n0.03s system 86% cpu 0.268 total\\n\\ntime jpegcrop -crop 1024x1024 ~/Downloads/large.jpg > out.jpg 0.06s user 0.01s\\nsystem 96% cpu 0.069 total\\n\\nThese same speed differences are repeatable with different images and\\ndifferent sized crop areas. The output pixels are identical, but my file\\nheader information is slightly different because I created it differently from\\nlibjpeg. My point in mentioning this is that it would be beneficial for a lot\\nof users/projects if I did a pull request to the libjpeg-turbo Github repo and\\ngave them my idea+code. As I\\'m sure you\\'ve gathered, without extrinsic\\nmotivation I have very little incentive to give away my idea and code for\\nfree. libjpeg-turbo is one of the few open source projects that gets funded on\\na regular basis - not a lot, but enough to keep support active. There are many\\ncontributors to that project, so dividing funding among them isn\\'t an easy\\ntask.\\n\\nYou can see where I\\'m headed with this - there are a lot of popular/important\\nFOSS projects in use on millions of computers (maybe billions) that can be\\noptimized further. Who will carry them the last mile when there\\'s no\\nincentive? I did some testing and saw optimization opportunities in ffmpeg,\\nzlib, libjpeg, libtiff, libpng and others. Will the incentives to contribute\\nto FOSS ever change to allow someone like me to take them from \"functional\" to\\n\"optimal\"?\\n\\n  * Get link\\n  * Facebook\\n  * Twitter\\n  * Pinterest\\n  * Email\\n  * Other Apps\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n#### Post a Comment\\n\\n### Popular posts from this blog\\n\\n### How much current do OLED displays use?\\n\\nJune 30, 2019\\n\\nThose little OLED displays are everywhere, and there\\'s a good reason. They\\'re\\ninexpensive, easy to program and they look good. I wanted to explore how much\\ncurrent they draw so that I can plan better for battery powered projects.\\nQuestions I want answered: How much idle current is drawn when the controller\\nis off versus on (blank display)? What\\'s the minimum current to see text\\nindoors? What\\'s the maximum current when all pixels are on at their brightest?\\nHow does display size affect current draw? How does active data writing affect\\ncurrent draw? It\\'s obvious they use more, but how much current do grayscale\\nand color OLEDs use? How practical are OLED displays compared to common LCDs\\nfor battery powered projects?

The majority of the ones sold expose a two wire\\ninterface (TWI) aka I2C. The default speed for I2C is 100Khz and the \"fast\"\\nmode is 400Khz. These are the 2 standard speeds supported by most AVR\\nArduinos. An I2C clock rate of around 800Khz is also possible on AVR MCUs, but\\nnot supported directly by the Wire library. The I2C standard recently added\\nsome higher speeds (1Mhz and 3.4Mhz). The 3.4Mhz version uses a slightly\\ndifferent protocol. At 400Khz, using the I2C hardware and the Wire library, I\\nwas able to refresh the display around 23.5 frames per second (FPS) with my\\ncode. Why I have already written a SSD1306 library for both Linux and Arduino,\\nbut I wanted to drive the display from an ATtiny85 and learn about the I2C\\nprotocol in the process. The ATtiny85 doesn\\'t have I2C hardware built in, so\\nit needs to be emulated in software using GPIO pins.

I\\'m\\ngoing to stray a little into hardware for this article. At the end of 2022 I\\nmade a promise to myself to learn how to use KiCad so that I could design my\\nown printed circuit boards. I have some experience with electronics and I\\nthought that I could design some relatively simple PCBs for my own use. I\\nfound this 100 minute YouTube tutorial and it provided enough practical info\\nto get me started. This blog post is not about learning KiCad; instead I\\'m\\ngoing to walk through all of the steps and equipment necessary to build my\\nPocket CO2 sensor project.
