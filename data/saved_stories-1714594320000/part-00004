The tech giant also revealed that it blocked about 2.28\nmillion policy-violating apps from being published in 2023.\n\nThese efforts were achieved through new and enhanced security features, policy\nupdates, and advanced machine learning technologies, alongside more stringent\ndeveloper onboarding and review processes.\n\nIn a blog post by the members of Google\u2019s Android Security and Privacy Team,\nand Play Trust and Safety team, the company revealed its new, multifaceted\napproach to improve security and privacy on Google Play Store. The new\nmeasures resulted in identifying and banning about 3,33,000 flagged accounts\nthat were confirmed to spread malware through apps and were involved in other\nsevere policy violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, nearly 200,000 app submissions were rejected for asking for\npermission to access background processes, location data or SMS. Notably, the\nbanned apps also had several AI-based deepfake and AI nude generator\napplications.\n\nTo bolster user privacy, Google collaborated with Software Developer Kit (SDK)\nproviders to restrict sensitive data access and sharing, which benefited over\n31 SDKs and more than 790,000 apps.\n\nFurthermore, Google introduced new Play Store transparency labelling to\nhighlight VPN apps that have undergone an independent security review through\nADA\u2019s Mobile App Security Assessment (MASA). This labelling empowers users to\nmake informed decisions about app security and privacy.\n\nGoogle has also enhanced Google Play Protect\u2019s security capabilities with\nreal-time scanning at the code-level. This measure has already detected over 5\nmillion new malicious off-Play apps, further securing Android users globally.\n\nGoogle also rolled out updates to its Play Store policies concerning\nGenerative AI apps, disruptive notifications, and expanded privacy\nprotections. Additionally, it raised the bar for new personal developer\naccounts by implementing rigorous testing requirements before app deployment.\n\nTo foster trust and transparency, Google has also introduced expanded\ndeveloper verification requirements and enhanced user control over personal\ndata. Apps enabling account creation are now mandated to offer an option for\ninitiating account and data deletion within the app and online.\n\nMoreover, approximately 1.5 million applications that do not associate with\nthe latest APIs are no longer available in the Play Store for new users on\nupdated devices, ensuring compatibility and security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nFind us on YouTube\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Top Shows\n\nAbout Firstpost\n\nMost Searched Categories\n\n  * Web Stories\n  * World\n  * India\n  * Explainers\n  * Opinion\n  * Sports\n  * Cricket\n  * Tech/Auto\n  * Entertainment\n  * IPL 2024\n\nNETWORK18 SITES\n\n  * News18\n  * Money Control\n  * CNBC TV18\n  * Forbes India\n  * Sitemap\n\nis on YouTube\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nCopyright @ 2024.
