While a major achievement, significant hurdles remain to\noperationalizing such a capability, especially when it comes to knowing where\nthe bad guy is at all times in a twisting and turning close-in aerial brawl.\nGiven the complexities involved, if the Air Force can make AI-driven\ndogfighting a reality, other autonomous air combat tasks will follow more\neasily. As one source familiar with the drive to develop autonomous air combat\nsystems previosuly told TWZ \"If you can autonomously dogfight, then you can do\npretty much anything else.\"\n\nReaders can get fully up to speed on the landmark live mock dogfight test in\nThe War Zone's initial reporting here, but to recap quickly here, the X-62A\ntest jet, a heavily modified two-seat F-16D Viper also known as the Variable-\nstability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA), squared off against a\ncrewed F-16 for the first time last September. The X-62A flew the dogfight in\na fully autonomous mode using an AI and machine learning-driven software\npackage, though a pilot was in the cockpit the entire time as a safety\nmeasure. The flight test was conducted as part of a program called Air Combat\nEvolution (ACE), which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\nis leading. The U.S. Air Force, as well as several private contractors and\nacademic institutions, are also participating in ACE.\n\nThe unique X-62A Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA)\nseen here flew in a fully autonomous mode against a crewed F-16 fighter in a\nmilestone mock dogfight in September 2023. USAF\n\n\"We built up in safety [with]... the maneuvers, first defensive, then\noffensive then high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements where we got as close as\n2,000 feet at 1,200 miles per hour,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Maryann Karlen, the\nDeputy Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) said in a\nvideo presentation, seen below, which was released last week.\n\nDespite over a century of military aviation advancements, dogfighting remains\na visual affair where a human pilot's on-the-spot judgment, intuition, and\nstereo vision are critical. An aircraft's sensor suite, including radar,\nelectro-optical and infrared cameras, and electronic warfare and support\nmeasures systems, can provide a wealth of data about enemy contacts. However,\ntheir utility steadily diminishes, if it does not largely collapse, as the\ndistance to the target closes to very close-in maneuvering range. A radar in\nthe nose of an aircraft, for instance, can only 'see' what's in a cone-shaped\narea in front of it. Even existing 360-degree camera systems have two-\ndimensional limitations and can be hampered by environmental conditions.\nDatalinked information from external sources can be extremely valuable for\nbuilding situational awareness or even guiding weapons, but it also has\nlimited in fidelity. External tracks of the enemy and friendly fighters can\nmerge together at very close range.\n\n\"Lose sight, lose the fight\" is a therefore understandably common adage, but\nespecially for an AI-driven jet that needs high-quality telemetry close in to\nknow where it is in relation to the adversary aircraft. A true adversary is\ngoing to very uncooperative in providing that kind of information.\n\nWith all this in mind, as it turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, there are\nmajor caveats to last year's still very significant autonomous dogfighting\nmilestone.\n\n\"From the early days in the ACE program, we always knew that ... perception in\nthe program was going to be a challenge area,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Hefron,\nthe ACE program manager, told The War Zone and other outlets during a press\nroundtable last Friday. \"What the original plan always was in ACE was to use a\ndata link between the two aircraft to pass state information.\"\n\nHefron was responding to a specific question from Aviation Week's Pentagon\neditor Brian Everstine about how the so-called \"autonomy agents\" loaded into\nthe X-62A's mission systems maintained general situational awareness during\nthe dogfight. Everstine also pointed out that the AI-driven algorithms had\ncomplete situational awareness during DARPA's AlphaDogfight Trials, which\nwrapped up in 2020 and fed directly into ACE. The AlphaDogfight Trials took\nplace in entirely simulated environments.\n\n\"We're a research program. We understand that there are limitations in some of\nthe research at times,\" Hefron continued. \"So, we added some flight pods to\nthe F-16, the human-flown F-16, as well as the VISTA aircraft. And we used\nthat to... create a data link between the aircraft so that they were passing\nstate information that would be ingested on the VISTA platform and then made\navailable to the agents as part of what we call their observation space.\"\n\n\"So, that's them [the autonomy agents] having observations about the\nenvironment around them,\" the head of ACE added. \"What I would also like to\nsay is that, you know, while that may sound like, 'Oh, hey, you're just, you\nknow, piping truth data to the to the agent,' there is still noise in that\ndata. ... It's not as clean per se as what you might see in a simulation\nenvironment. So it's kind of the next step along a pathway to being able to\n... sense.\"\n\n\"We really have a lot of basic science and engineering questions to answer.\nAnd so the incremental build-up is really the hallmark of tests, right?\" Air\nForce Col. James Valpiani, the commandant of the USAF TPS, who was also at the\nroundtable last Friday and has been involved in ACE, said. \"We want to isolate\nvariables to understand how the aircraft performs with an understanding of all\nthe other contexts, and then slowly open up the envelope of things that we're\ntesting. So, to have an aircraft that receives perfect state data, ... there\nare [still] many things that we learned, many deviations, many differences\nfrom the simulation environments \u2013 the sim-to-real gap.\"\n\nThis all makes immediate sense from a safety perspective. With so many\nunknowns in this first-of-its-kind dogfight, making sure the X-62A would be\ncapable of performing various tasks autonomously as expected when given as\nmuch situational data as possible is a logical and necessary first step. DARPA\nand the Air Force have repeatedly stressed that the main point of ACE is\nreally about building trust in autonomy and doing so in safe and ethical\nincremental steps. For the reasons outlined earlier on, dogfighting was chosen\nas what officials have described as the core \"challenge problem\" because of\nhow demanding and dangerous it is already with crewed aircraft. Developing the\nrequired technologies and capabilities for an autonomous aircraft to engage in\nsuch maneuvers thereore has much broader implications.\n\nA view from inside the X-62A's cockpit during last year's mock dogfight.\nDARPA/USAF capture\n\n\"If you think about self-driving vehicles, and the early days of developments\nthere, ... you may have had a self-driving vehicle that could perform well, on\na closed-circuit test track that it maybe it was trained on,\" Lt. Col. Hefron\nused as a tangential example of the processes involved. \"But as soon as you\ntake it out of that environment, and you put it into... downtown San Francisco\nthat... autonomous vehicle, it'll fail in that condition.\"\n\n\"It's dangerous, it's challenging, but it's also well characterized \u2013 it's all\nof those things, right? I mean, it's a trifecta in the sense that it's a\nproblem where human trust is acute. We need to trust these platforms when\nwe're putting them within 500 feet and 1,200 miles an hour of closure apart,\"\nCol. Valpiani further explained about the choice to use dogfighting as the\ncentral focus of ACE. \"But it's not a problem that we don't understand. We\nunderstand dogfighting very, very well. We understand the energy management\ncomponent. When it's F-16 versus F-16, we understand the tactics. We\nunderstand what it looks like to win and also what it looks like to lose.\"\n\nValpiani said separately during the roundtable last week that he could not\nspeak as to who won or lost last year's dogfight between the X-62A and the\ncrewed F-16 for \"national security reasons.\"\n\n\"We understand what human errors look like so that we can potentially see how\nthat differs from what [an] AI agent's errors look like. And we have well-\ncodified ethical and safety rules that humans have to comply with,\" Valpiani\nadded. \"When you start to place an AI agent in this space, you can see\ndramatic differences, as well as similarities. And ... those are very\nimportant points of learning.\"\n\nThe video below shows the X-62A flying in formation with an F-16C and an F-22\nRaptor stealth fighter during a test flight in March 2023.\n\nThere is also just a matter of practicality. The X-62A simply does not have\nany kind of organic sensor suite that would give it the uninterrupted\n360-degree situational awareness that truly autonomous dogfighting would\nrequire. This is something that will have to be addressed when it comes to the\ndevelopment of future autonomous platforms. Arrays of small conformal radars,\nelectro-optical or infrared cameras, and other sensors could be utilized to\nprovide the necessary situational and spatial data, in effect working together\nto build telemetry for creating a solid digital three dimensional 'picture' of\nwhat is going on directly around the jet during a fast developing dogfight.\n\nA distributed network of sensors, including on individual drones operating in\na cooperative swarm, as well as on other offboard platforms, could also be\nused to help create a more complete situational picture.\n\nThe commercial aviation sector, as well as the military side of that industry,\nhas made significant advances in automated 'sense and avoid' capabilities over\nthe past couple of decades, including when it comes to uncrewed platforms.\nSome of these technologies could be ported over to help dogfight problem,\nespecially paired with a far more dynamic 'thinking' AI agent backbone that\nbenefits from deep machine learning. Even sensors and software models used for\nself-driving cars could be leveraged to help make better sense of what's\nhappening around a combat drone engaged in this kind of combat.\n\nRegardless, simply installing something like an array of simple cameras around\nan aircraft may not provide the required three-dimensional situational\nawareness to support robust autonomous aerial dogfighting capabilities. Two\ndimensional data does not give range and closure information, although some of\nthis may be able to be emulated in software through machine learning. Still,\nthree dimensional data would be of the greatest value for this application.\n\n\"There is a plan and there is a development pathway in the future to\nincorporate sensing, and the complexity that that [sic] adds to the picture,\"\naccording to Col. Valpiani. However, \"doing this in a safe and responsible way\nis to take it one step at a time to truly understand how each aspect works\nbefore moving on to the next problem.\"\n\n\"The mission environments that you're employing it [in] or deploying in is a\ncritical challenge that we see as kind of that next challenge that we have to\naddress in the air domain,\" Hefron also said. The head of ACE acknowledged\nthat his program is not the only won working to overcome these challenges, as\nwell, and talked specifically about the Air Force's separate Project VENOM\n(Viper Experimentation and Next-Gen Operations Mode). A total of six F-16s are\nbeing modified under Project VENOM to help support further autonomous flight\nresearch and development work. This effort will also allow for more\nexperimentation with multiple autonomous platforms working collaboratively\ntogether, as you can read more about here.\n\nOne of the first F-16s set to be converted into an autonomy testbed under\nProject VENOM arrives at Eglin Air Force Base on April 1, 2024. USAF\n\n\"The VENOM aircraft are the platforms that will have the ability to sense the\nenvironment around them and do some of the things that we presently have some\nlimitations on VISTA with,\" according to Hefron. \"Not to say ... that we won't\ncontinue to work on [ACE using] VISTA, because we absolutely will. There are\ncertain things that the [X-62A] aircraft is capable of performing that won't\nbe, I'll say, well suited on the VENOM birds... They each have their own\nunique place, I'll say, as testbeds.\"\n\nACE and Project VENOM are among a larger array of programs and activities that\nare feeding into the Air Force's larger vision for future autonomous\ncapabilities, particularly the service's Collaborative Combat Aircraft\nadvanced drone program. The rest of the U.S. military is also becoming\nincreasingly interested in new and improving autonomous capabilities, and not\njust limited to the air domain. There could be implications in all of this or\nthe commercial aviation sector, as well.\n\nAltogether, significant challenges clearly remain after the breakthrough\ndogfight last year, particularly when it comes to allowing an AI piloted\nfighter to dogfight successfully with a true enemy opponent. It will be very\ninteresting to see what milestones ACE and these other autonomous research and\ndevelopment efforts reach next and solving this issue will surely be at the\ntop of their to do lists.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com\n\nAir ForcesAmericasAround The GlobeArtificial IntelligenceDronesFlight\nTrainingU.S. Air ForceU.S. HomelandUnmanned\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
