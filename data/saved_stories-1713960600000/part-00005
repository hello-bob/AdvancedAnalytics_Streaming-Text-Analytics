He is expected to sign it.\n\nThe White House-backed legislation was approved as part of a broader national\nsecurity package \u2014 combining Ukraine and Israel aid \u2014 that passed the House in\na bipartisan vote over the weekend. Proponents of the TikTok measure say that\nthe popular video app\u2019s Chinese ownership poses a national security threat.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Senate vote was 79-18.\n\nAD\n\n### Know More\n\nUnder the measure, ByteDance would have up to 360 days to divest TikTok or\nface an effective ban within the US.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson last week characterized the legislation as an assault on\nfree speech, signaling a likely legal challenge on First Amendment grounds.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of\nimportant foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban\nbill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,\ndevastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24\nbillion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAD\n\nBloomberg reported earlier this week that TikTok\u2019s head of public policy told\nemployees in a memo that the company would \u201cmove to the courts for a legal\nchallenge\u201d once the measure is signed into law.\n\nThe legislation represents a rare bipartisan achievement in Congress, where\nthere is intense scrutiny of the Chinese government among members of both\nparties.\n\nAn earlier version of the legislation introduced by the House China select\ncommittee leaders, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher and Democratic Rep.Raja\nKrishnamoorthi, would have forced a sale within 180 days; the adjustment to\nthe bill helped it gain support from a key Democratic senator, Commerce\nCommittee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, who endorsed it last week.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": true}
