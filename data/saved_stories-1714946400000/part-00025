Apple said as long ago as 2021 that 79% of US car buyers \u201conly\nconsider CarPlay-capable vehicles\u201d when making their purchasing decisions. We\nran our own poll, and got exactly the same result.\n\nThings didn\u2019t get any better when GM launched its first post-CarPlay vehicle,\nthe 2024 Chevy Blazer EV. Reviews of its own infotainment system were ... not\nkind.\n\n> The infotainment display completely melted down, stuck in an infinite loop\n> of shutting off, turning on, displaying a map centered in the middle of the\n> Pacific Ocean and turning back off again. It did this until we pulled off\n> the freeway and restarted the car. All was well after the reset, but an hour\n> later, it happened again.\n\n## GM found it hard to work with Apple\n\nA lengthy Bloomberg piece sheds a little light on the company\u2019s reasoning. One\nfactor was that GM found it difficult to work with Apple, which it says didn\u2019t\nrespect the car-maker\u2019s automotive expertise.\n\n> Apple didn\u2019t even seem especially open to feedback on areas CarPlay could\n> improve. A former top GM exec remembers teammates recommending a tweak based\n> on their insights about how screens could be interruptive. \u201cOne of the Apple\n> engineers said, \u2018Look, our system is better. Why can\u2019t you just do what we\n> say to do?\u2019 \u201d this exec recalls, requesting anonymity to avoid professional\n> retaliation. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even any consideration of our decades of\n> experience with driver distraction.\u201d\n\nHowever, that seems to have been mutual, with GM failing to appreciate the\ndepth of Apple\u2019s UI expertise.\n\n> In a meeting with Greg Joswiak, now Apple\u2019s senior vice president for\n> worldwide marketing, one exec tried to impress upon him GM\u2019s deep automotive\n> expertise as if to suggest Apple was out of its depth, emphasizing the\n> complexity of cars and how they can require four years to develop [...]\n> Joswiak replied, \u201cHow long do you think it takes us to build an iPhone?\u201d\n\n## The new CarPlay interface was key\n\nGM was particularly worried about Apple\u2019s plans for the new CarPlay to take\nover the car\u2019s entire dash, in what the company calls \u201ca new instrument\ncluster experience.\u201d\n\n> Apple no longer merely wanted to project a copy of iOS onto the infotainment\n> screen; it wanted the iPhone to oversee the mission-critical cluster behind\n> the steering wheel. This stuff was sacrosanct in Detroit. GM\u2019s Wexler says\n> the next-gen CarPlay, which GM learned of before the announcement, was a\n> \u201cmajor factor\u201d in its ensuing decision to divorce Apple.\n\n## But ultimately it\u2019s about money\n\nFundamentally, however, this is about GM eyeing subscription revenue.\n\n> There\u2019s promise with Super Cruise, a service that enables hands-free driving\n> on freeways. The feature comes with an initial $2,500 price tag, and after\n> three years it costs $25 per month. The company also offers subscriptions\n> for extra safety features, internet connectivity and remote car access, and\n> it envisions premium bespoke apps for specific models, such as trail\n> services for 4\u00d74 off-roaders.\n\nHow it will persuade people to pay for add-on services when it can\u2019t even get\nthe basic infotainment system working properly remains to be seen. One\nfrustrated 2024 Chevy Blazer EV owner who experienced the crashes described in\nreviews said that his car ended up spending a month back at the dealership\nwhile they fixed it \u2013 and he isn\u2019t optimistic that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n> \u201cIf my nav screen bricks again,\u201d he says, \u201cI can at least make it useful by\n> suction-cupping my iPhone to it.\u201d\n\n## 9to5Mac\u2019s Take\n\n## Top comment by Yep\n\nLiked by 14 people\n\nAs far as I'm aware Apple isn't requiring any automakers to adopt their full\nwhole car gauge cluster CarPlay experience. If they are going to require that\nI would expect a lot of pushback from the industry and it will cause more\nautomakers to abandon carplay. As long as the standard carplay experience\nremains an option then it should be supported by every automaker.\n\nView all comments\n\nWe\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019ll say it again: This is an incredibly dumb move.\n\nCar makers may have expertise in a lot of areas, but infotainment UIs is\ndefinitely not one of them. The whole reason for the popularity of CarPlay is\nprecisely because iPhone owners prefer Apple\u2019s UI to those created by car\ncompanies.\n\nThe subscription revenue generated through GM\u2019s own services will be utterly\ndwarfed by the value of the sales they will lose to companies who continue to\noffer CarPlay. The question is not whether GM will make a U-turn on this\nabsurd policy, only how long it will take before doing so.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet\n\nAdd 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
