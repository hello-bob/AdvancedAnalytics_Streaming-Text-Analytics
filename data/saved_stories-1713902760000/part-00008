This new device can connect to\nLTE-M, NB-IoT, and DECT NR+ networks while maintaining long battery life,\nbetter location tracking, and strong connectivity. Additionally, Nordic offers\nsupport through their nRF Connect SDK and the Nordic Developer Academy.\n\nThe nRF9161 SiP is an improved version of the nRF9160 SiP, which has been the\nbasis for various projects like the Actinius Icarus SoM DK, Conexio Stratus,\nnRF9160 Feather LTE IoT and GPS Board, Ruuvi Node, and many other projects.\nFeel free to check those out if interested.\n\nThe press release mentions that this new chip is an update of the nRF9160 and\nincludes features like an Arm Cortex-M33 processor, 1 MB flash, 256 KB RAM,\nalong with SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, and a 12-bit ADC and other features. It also\nincludes a GNSS receiver, LTE modem, RF Front End, and a power management\nsystem.\n\nNow looking at the updates, this new module will add in B65(2100 MHz) and\nB85(700 MHz) LTE bands for wider global coverage and support for DECT NR+ mesh\nnetwork for long-range low-power applications that work at 1.9 GHz and support\nup to one million nodes. It also improves power efficiency with updated\nfirmware while offering a power-saving mode and a sleep mode functionality for\nnetworks that do not support PSM (Power Saving Mode).\n\nKey Features of Nordic Semiconductor\u2019s nRF9161 SiP:\n\n  * System-in-Package (SiP) \u2013 Fully integrated for cellular IoT and DECT NR+.\n  * Processor and Memory \u2013 64 MHz Arm Cortex-M33, 1 MB flash, and 256 KB RAM.\n  * Modem \u2013 Multimode LTE-M/NB-IoT with DECT NR+ support and GNSS.\n  * Frequency Support \u2013 700-2200 MHz LTE band and 1.9 GHz NR+ band.\n  * Connectivity \u2013 Supports global LTE bands without regional limitations.\n  * Security Features \u2013 Arm TrustZone and Arm CryptoCell for enhanced security.\n  * Power Efficiency \u2013 Advanced power-saving features like eDRX, PSM, and AS-RAI.\n  * Firmware Updates: Secure Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) updates.\n  * Location Tracking: Built-in GNSS receiver and support for cellular-based location features.\n  * Interfaces and Peripherals: Includes ADC, RTC, SPI, I2C, I2S, UARTE, PDM, and PWM.\n  * LTE Bands: Covers a wide range of LTE bands for global connectivity.\n  * DECT NR+ Stack: Enables massive mesh applications with reliability and scalability.\n  * Development Tools: nRF Connect SDK and nRF Connect for Desktop for diverse development needs.\n\nThe nRF9161 Development Kit (DK) extends the nRF9161 SiP\u2019s functionality with\nadditional features for development ease. The dev kit is pre-certified meaning\nit has full access to GPIOs and interfaces, the board also comes with Arduino\nUno-style pin headers which you can use to enable WI-Fi 6 capability with\nNordic\u2019s nRF7002EK evaluation kit. Additionally, it has user-programmable LEDs\nand buttons for interactive applications.\n\nnRF9161 DK with nRF7002 EK\n\nThe kit supports both plug-in and soldered (e)SIMs with a nano/4FF SIM slot\nand an MFF2 SIM footprint and comes with a pre-loaded SIM card. A key feature\nis the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger for simplified programming and\ndebugging of both the SiP and external targets.\n\nIn terms of support, the nRF Connect SDK for VS Code gives developers\nessential tools directly in the IDE while the nRF Connect for Desktop offers\nIoT tools for evaluating, monitoring, and debugging network connectivity.\nAdditionally, the Nordic Developer Academy has an online course focused on\nteaching cellular IoT quickly with the nRF9161 DK.\n\nAs of now, both the nRF9161 SiP and the nRF9161 Development Kit can be\npurchased from major distributors like Mouser, Digi-Key, and Avnet. The SiP is\npriced at $26.73(on Mouser) for a single unit, while the Development Kit is\navailable for $128.77(on Avnet)\n\nDebashis Das\n\nDebashis Das is a technical content writer and embedded engineer with over\nfive years of experience in the industry.
