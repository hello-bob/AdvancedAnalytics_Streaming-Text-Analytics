In a decisive move, the now Democrat-controlled FCC\nhas restored net neutrality rules along a 3-2 party-line vote.\n\nAlso: How to see if your internet provider is overcharging you (or delivering\nslower speeds)\n\nThe FCC has reinstated rules ensuring equal treatment for all internet\ntraffic, overseen by FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel and marking a significant\npolicy reversal from the Trump administration's deregulatory stance. The\nrestored rules aim to ensure that broadband internet remains devoid of any\npreferential treatment or restrictions by internet service providers (ISPs).\n\nNet neutrality is the policy that seeks to ensure all internet traffic is\ntreated equally, without discrimination. This approach means that ISPs\nshouldn't be allowed to speed up, slow down, or block access to specific\nwebsites or online services. Neutrality aims to ensure that the internet\nremains a level playing field for everyone.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nNet neutrality has been a vital component of the internet's operation for\ndecades. Indeed, the basic concept of all ISPs sharing bandwidth equally and\nequitably dates back to the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX), which made way\nfor today's internet.\n\nSpecifically, the return of net neutrality in the US means, according to the\nFCC, that ISPs \"will again be prohibited from blocking, throttling, or\nengaging in paid prioritization of lawful content.\" This is the formation of a\nnational policy standard to \"ensure that broadband Internet service is treated\nas an essential service.\"\n\nAccording to the FCC, these changes also mean that the agency can now play an\nactive role \"when workers cannot telework, students cannot study, or\nbusinesses cannot market their products because their Internet service is\nout.\"\n\nRosenworcel also said the FCC can now stop ISPs from selling Americans'\npersonal data or sharing it with tech companies to train artificial\nintelligence (AI) models. That does not mean, however, that the FCC will be\n\"policing online speech. On the contrary, freedom of speech will be enhanced\nby open Internet protections, because they will prevent broadband providers\nfrom blocking or disfavoring any type of online speech.\"\n\nAlso: Net neutrality: What it is and why we're talking about it again\n\nIn an oral dissent, FCC commissioner Brendan Carr called this policy shift\nnothing more than a \"power grab.\" He wasn't the only one. Republican\npoliticians, including House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy\nMcMorris Rodgers and Senator Ted Cruz, also labeled the plan an \"illegal power\ngrab.\" They argue that it subjects the broadband industry to burdensome\nregulations, which could include rate regulations and other restrictive\nmeasures.\n\nOther critics of the return of net neutrality, such as the US Chamber of\nCommerce, agree. The Chamber lambasted the recent FCC decision, claiming it\nre-imposes an antiquated regulatory framework on a modern broadband landscape,\npotentially hampering future technological investments and innovation.\n\nConversely, public interest advocates like Free Press heralded the move as a\npivotal victory for consumers, empowering the FCC to keep major ISPs like\nAT&T, Comcast, and Verizon accountable for any detrimental practices affecting\ninternet users.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for the public interest,\" Free Press said in a\nstatement. \"The agency now has the ability to protect the free and open\nInternet --and to track service outages, protect Internet users from ISPs'\nprivacy invasions, promote broadband competition and deployment, and take\naction against hidden junk fees, data caps, and billing rip-offs.\"\n\nAlso: The best business internet providers\n\nSome tech organizations, such as the Computer & Communications Industry\nAssociation (CCIA), which includes tech giants such as Amazon, Apple,\nAlphabet, and Meta, have voiced support for the restored net neutrality rules.\nThe CCIA's chief of staff and SVP Stephanie Joyce said the \"CCIA applauds and\nthanks the FCC for restoring the light-touch but necessary Open Internet rules\nthat will give broadband Internet access subscribers the protections that\nCongress established for all users of telecommunications.\"\n\nThis issue is far from settled. The battle for net neutrality will now be\nplayed out in the courts and the ballot boxes.\n\n#### Networking\n\nThe best 5G laptops: Samsung, Lenovo, and more lead with 5G connectivity\n\nHow to test your internet speed the quick and easy way\n\nThe top 5 VPN services: How do these VPNs compare?\n\nWhy is my internet so slow? 11 ways to speed up your connection\n\n  * The best 5G laptops: Samsung, Lenovo, and more lead with 5G connectivity\n\n  * How to test your internet speed the quick and easy way\n\n  * The top 5 VPN services: How do these VPNs compare?\n\n  * Why is my internet so slow? 11 ways to speed up your connection\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### Comcast Xfinity is still offering surprise free internet speed boost to\nmillions\n\n### How much you should pay for internet (and how you can lower costs)\n\n### The best internet providers in Charlotte: Top local ISPs compared\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
