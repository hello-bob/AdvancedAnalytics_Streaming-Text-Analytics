In his dream, Rushdie was in an ancient Roman\namphitheater, rolling around on the ground while a gladiator with a spear\nstabbed down at him.\n\n\"It certainly felt very vivid and very actual and very scary,\" Rushdie says.\n\"I was rolling about in bed and thrashing around, and my wife had to wake me\nup.\"\n\nHis immediate impulse was to cancel his upcoming appearance at the Chautauqua\nInstitution in upstate New York, but then he rationalized his fear away:\n\"People have dreams. You don't run your daily life because of having a bad\ndream. And so I decided I would go,\" Rushdie says.\n\nRushdie is no stranger to death threats. After his 1988 novel The Satanic\nVerses was published, Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini, declared the book\nblasphemous in its treatment of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, and issued a\nfatwa calling for Rushdie's death. Faced with the threat, Rushdie, who grew up\nin India in a secular Muslin family, stayed out of public view for years.\n\nBut after years of being surrounded by security, Rushdie had resumed normal\nlife. Then, on Aug. 12, 2022, a 24-year-old man in the audience rushed the\nstage at Chautauqua. In an attack lasting 27 seconds, the man stabbed Rushdie\nmultiple times, severing all the tendons and most of the nerves in one hand\nand wounding his neck, chest, thigh and eye.\n\n### Books\n\n### 5 takeaways from Salman Rushdie's new memoir 'Knife'\n\nLying in a \"lake of blood,\" Rushdie believed he was about to die. He was hit\nwith a feeling of loneliness: \"Dying in the company of strangers \u2014 that was\nwhat was going through my mind,\" he says.\n\nRushdie says he's disinclined to believe in miracles, but he struggles with\nhow else to explain his survival.\n\n\"Many of the doctors who I have been involved with in the last year and a half\nare not only surprised that I survived \u2014 which they are \u2014 but they're\nsurprised that I have recovered to the degree that I have,\" he says. \"Miracles\nare all around me, it seems.\"\n\n### Books\n\n### Why Salman Rushdie's work sparked decades of controversy\n\nIn his new book, Knife, Rushdie writes about the attack, the damage to his\nbody (including the loss of sight in one eye) and more existential questions\nabout facing death and finding his identity in an altered body and state of\nmind. Rushdie says he was initially reluctant write about the Chautauqua\nincident, but he's glad he did.\n\n\"It changed my relationship to the event,\" he says. \"Instead of just being the\nperson who got stabbed, I now see myself as the person who wrote a book about\ngetting stabbed. And so it feels like it's back in my own authorial space, and\nI feel more in charge of it. And that feels good.\"\n\n### Interview highlights\n\nRandom House\n\nRandom House\n\nOn how he had stopped worrying about the fatwa prior to the attack\n\nI'd been living in New York City for close to 24 years, and during that time\nI'd done hundreds of literary events, readings, lectures, festivals, etc., and\nthey had never been the faintest trace of a problem. So I'd kind of told\nmyself that that time had gone, but sadly, I was wrong. All I ever wanted to\ndo, Terry, was to write stories. And if I've got a few more years left to\nwrite a few more good stories, then that'll do for me.\n\nOn not holding onto anger about the attack\n\n### Author Interviews\n\n### Becoming 'Anton,' Or, How Rushdie Survived A Fatwa\n\nOne of the things that I think has been very strange for me is that the\nemotion that I haven't really had in the aftermath of all this is anger. And\nit's as if something in my head tells me that anger would be a way of being\nstuck in the moment. It would be a way of not being able to get past it. And\nso I don't have anger. I guess somewhere deep down I am pretty furious with\nvarious people, notably the gentleman with the knife, but it doesn't seem\nproductive to me to linger on anger.\n\nOn writing about both violence and hatred and healing and love\n\nWhen I started thinking about writing this book, you know, I asked myself,\n\"OK, there's obviously this attack and I want to talk about that. But beyond\nthat, what's the book about?\" And I came to feel that it was about myself\nbeing in between two forces. One is a force of violence and hatred, and the\nother is the force of love and healing. ...\n\nThe first force was obviously embodied in my assailant, and the second force\nwas embodied in my wife, Eliza, the writer Rachel Eliza Griffiths. And I mean,\nsince I didn't die, I'm able to say that the force of love and healing\novercame the force of violence and hatred. But I felt that that triangle was\nwhat the book was about, that the book was about three people. It was about me\nand him and Eliza. And so I wanted to write about love, and in a more open and\ndirect way than maybe that I've ever done before.\n\nOn the hallucinations he experienced while on a ventilator\n\nI was hallucinating palaces made out of alphabets. ... I was seeing\narchitecture, palatial architecture, of which the building blocks were all\nletters.\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nI was hallucinating palaces made out of alphabets. ... I was seeing\narchitecture, palatial architecture, of which the building blocks were all\nletters. ... There were letters floating in the air between me and other\npeople in the room. I remember when the ventilator was taken out I said to\nEliza and her family, I said, \"Why are all these letters on your clothes?\" ...\nIt does indicate to me the extent to which the world of books is the world in\nwhich I live.\n\nOn how being attacked changed his understanding of death\n\nI think what it did is two things that it, first of all, gave me a kind of\nfamiliarity with death. I kind of know how it goes now. I didn't get to the\nfinal note of the music, thank goodness. But I kind of understand how the tune\ngoes. But also what it did, what it has done, is to give me an enormously\nincreased appreciation of life. The reason I quoted, one point, a poem by\nRaymond Carver, written after he was told he had almost no time to live, and\nthen he lived another 10 years and did some of his best work. And he said he\nfelt like all that time that he wasn't supposed to have, he describes it as\ngravy. \"Every day is gravy.\" And I kind of feel like that now. I feel like\nthese are days I wasn't supposed to have, and yet here I am, having them, and\nevery day is a blessing.\n\nSam Briger and Joel Wolfram produced and edited this interview for broadcast.\nBridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Meghan Sullivan adapted it for the web.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 156 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
