Knudson's 'two-hit' paradigm, first proposed in 1971,\nstates that both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be permanently\ninactivated in our cells before cancer can start.\n\nRecent studies found that a mutation in one of a cell's two BRCA2 genes is\nimplicated in various cancers. Interestingly, mice and human cells with this\nmutation don't show the usual signs of genetic instability seen in cells with\nboth copies of the gene mutated.\n\nIn mice, having just one copy of BRCA2 affected doesn't seem to cause major\nissues in organ development or DNA repair in most tissues. But cells with this\nmutation appear more vulnerable to stresses, like exposure to environmental\ntoxins such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, which can reduce their levels of\nBRCA2 protein, leading to functional problems.\n\n\"How such environmental factors increase cancer risk is not yet very clear,\nbut it is vital to understand the connection if we are to take preventive\nmeasures that help us stay healthy longer,\" says oncologist and cancer\nresearcher Ashok Venkitaraman from CSI Singapore.\n\nThe team first examined people who inherited one faulty copy of BRCA2. They\nfound that cells from these people were more sensitive to methylglyoxal (MGO),\nwhich is produced when cells break down glucose for energy in the process of\nglycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis generates over 90 percent of the MGO in cells, which a pair of\nenzymes typically keep to minimal levels. In the event they can't keep up,\nhigh MGO levels can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that damage DNA\nand proteins. In conditions like diabetes, where MGO levels are elevated due\nto high blood sugar, these harmful compounds contribute to disease\ncomplications.\n\nThe researchers discovered that MGO can temporarily disable the tumor-\nsuppressing functions of the BRCA2 protein, resulting in mutations linked to\ncancer development. This effect could be seen in noncancerous cells as well as\npatient-derived tissue samples, in some cases of human breast cancer, and in\nmouse models of pancreatic cancer.\n\nAs the BRCA2 allele isn't permanently inactivated, functional forms of the\nprotein it produces can later return to normal levels. But cells repeatedly\nexposed to MGO may continue to accumulate cancer-causing mutations whenever\nexisting BRCA2 protein production fails.\n\nOverall, this suggests that changes in glucose metabolism can disrupt BRCA2\nfunction via MGO, contributing to the development and progression of cancer.\n\nThese results come from lab tests and small human tissue sample sizes, and the\nresearchers say more studies need to be done using larger clinical studies or\nanimal models to look into possible links between dietary factors, diabetes,\nand other metabolic disorders.\n\nAs MGO can temporarily rob the BRCA2 protein of its ability to repair DNA, it\nmakes sense that a poor diet or uncontrolled diabetes could contribute to a\nhigher risk of cancer over time, even in people with two functional copies of\nthe BRCA2 gene. This new information may lead to strategies for cancer\nprevention or early detection.\n\n\"Methylglyoxal can be easily detected by a blood test for HbA1C, which could\npotentially be used as a marker,\" Venkitaraman says.\n\n\"Furthermore, high methylglyoxal levels can usually be controlled with\nmedicines and a good diet, creating avenues for proactive measures against the\ninitiation of cancer.\"\n\nThe research has been published in Cell.\n\nTrending News\n\nBrain Autopsies Reveal a Potential New Culprit Behind Alzheimer's Disease\nHealth5 days ago\n\nMajor Study Finds 15 Factors Linked to Early Dementia Risk Health3 days ago\n\nScientists Solved a 50-Year Mystery of What Punched The Giant Hole in\nAntarctic Ice Nature4 days ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
