(Source:\nInstagram/@slow.steady.coffee.)\n\nWhen Germ\u00e1n Sierra bought a one-story home in 2020, he anticipated the types\nof headaches and hiccups that accompany every renovation. His dream was to\nconvert the home\u2014already zoned for commercial use\u2014into a coffee shop and\ncommunity space. What he didn\u2019t expect, however, was that regulations dating\nback to 1965 would ultimately thwart his plans to open Graph Coffee.\n\nThree years later, what started out as Graph Coffee has now finally opened as\nSlow and Steady, a reference to his years-long battle with Dallas\u2019 restrictive\nparking mandates and a guiding philosophy for a business that had to battle so\nmuch just to serve a cup of (really good) coffee.\n\n  * Missed the story the first time around? Read \u201cDeath By Parking.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuddenly, you get the green light. You finally get everything that you've\nbeen fighting for so long,\u201d Sierra explained. \u201cAnd in no time, you have to do\neverything that you didn't have the time or energy, you know, to do before.\u201d\n\nWhen Sierra first tried to open his coffee shop, a decades-old Dallas code\nmandating one parking spot for every 100 square feet stood in his way.\nProviding the requisite number of parking spaces would necessitate demolishing\npart of his own recently renovated property or the one next door. Neither of\nthese were options as far as he was concerned and so began a lengthy and\nexpensive process to procure a variance from the Board of Adjustments.\n\nWhen asked to provide community support, he collected dozens of letters from\nlocals. When asked to provide a traffic study, he paid city traffic engineers\nthousands of dollars to perform several. Yet, no matter what Sierra was able\nto prove, the Board of Adjustments refused to budge. He had the support of\nthree on the board of five, a majority, but not enough in a city which\nrequires at least 75% of the board to be in agreement. Three out of five votes\namounts to only 60%.\n\nAs this stalemate waged on, Sierra wasn\u2019t just losing out on revenue his\nfuture coffee shop would generate. He couldn\u2019t even begin preparing for\ninspections, certifications, and all the hurdles a small business owner can\nexpect ahead of a launch. In fact, by the time he was able to invite\ninspectors over, he laughed at how relatively painless it was compared to what\nhe\u2019d endured with the Board of Adjustments.\n\n\u201cOnce I passed [the final inspection], the inspector asked me, \u2018So, when are\nyou planning to open?\u2019\u201d Sierra recalled. \u201cTomorrow!\u201d he replied, in disbelief\nthat he finally had the green light to do so. Months behind schedule, he\nwanted to begin recouping his losses immediately. He also needed to learn the\nropes. He wasn\u2019t able to focus on operations, the daily needs of running a\ncoffee shop, when every day for nearly two years was defined by uncertainty\nover whether his coffee shop would even exist.\n\nAt the tail end of August 2023, all the paperwork, permitting, inspections,\nand certifications were completed. Days later in September, he quietly opened\nhis doors, effectively soft launching the newly rebranded Slow and Steady\nCoffee. Sierra spent the next two months adjusting to life as a coffee shop\nowner and preparing Slow and Steady for a grand opening, which ultimately took\nplace on November 11, 2023.\n\n## A Bittersweet Relief\n\nSlow and Steady didn\u2019t ultimately triumph over Dallas\u2019 arcane parking\nmandates. Despite bottomless community support\u2014\u201cthey really came out to bat\nfor me since the very beginning\u201d\u2014and all the evidence Sierra could muster\ndisproving the demand for parking, those final two members of the Board of\nAdjustments could not be convinced. Sierra was not granted a variance.\n\nOpening Slow and Steady took demolishing his garage, nearly half of the square\nfootage of the one-story structure.\n\nNaturally, Sierra tried whatever he could to preserve the garage. It was a\nmatter of practicality: running a coffee shop demands storage for equipment,\ninventory, and assorted coffee shop paraphernalia. The garage was envisioned\nas a closet, not a space for potential car-driving customers. But that didn\u2019t\nmatter to the Board of Adjustments. What mattered for the parking calculus was\nthe total square footage of the space, and according to the board, he had \u201ctoo\nmuch.\u201d\n\nSacrificing storage wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cRestaurants have some of the strictest\nparking requirements,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhereas splitting the space into\nsomething between an office and a to-go eatery awarded me some leniency when\nit came to parking.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Sierra not only had to slice his property in half, he had to\nreapply under two different uses. At least this time, he was guaranteed the\ngreen light. It also meant he was only liable to provide four parking spaces,\nsomething he could easily accommodate, compared to over a dozen in the earlier\nmandate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy choice, but he couldn\u2019t afford to delay the opening any\nlonger, nor the expenses associated with petitioning for a variance with no\nend in sight.\n\nNow, three months into business since the official launch of Slow and Steady,\nSierra appreciates how many patrons come to caffeinate by foot or bicycle. \u201cI\njust love seeing how many people use the bike rack I put out there,\u201d he told\nme. He even offers 10% off on Saturdays for customers who walk.\n\nIt\u2019s been especially heartwarming to welcome customers cognizant of all the\nhassles Sierra weathered in the last two years. \u201cRemember the inspector who\nasked when I\u2019m going to open?\u201d Sierra recalled. \u201cThe next time I saw him, he\nwas a customer. That was such a cool moment.\u201d\n\n## When You Make Space for Parking, What Do You Lose?\n\nIf\u2014or perhaps, when\u2014Dallas follows suit with dozens of cities across the\ncountry scrapping costly parking mandates, Sierra can entertain restoring the\ngarage. These rules, often dating back to the 1960s, not only restrict how\nbusiness owners and homeowners can improve upon their own property, they\nconfine cities to a future of auto-centric design.\n\nWith the average parking spot measuring nearly 350 square feet, more space\nmust be ceded for asphalt than the actual people whom the business plans to\nserve or the home is designed to house. When a place is designed to prioritize\nthe geometry of cars, rather than the experience of people, the latter\nsuffers.
