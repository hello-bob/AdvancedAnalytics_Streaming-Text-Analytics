Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Intel Core Ultra now powers more than 500 AI models, the company says\n\nNews\n\nBy Jeff Butts\n\npublished 24 hours ago\n\nThe competition has its work cut out for it.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nMore than 500 AI models now run optimized on new Intel Core Ultra processors,\nthe chipmaker announced on May 1, 2024. Intel\u2019s promotion of artificial\nintelligence research and development across various aspects of the technology\nmade the milestone possible.\n\nIntel\u2019s contributions to the AI development community have made the Core Ultra\nprocessor the fastest-growing AI processor to date, the company said. In\nOctober 2023, Intel launched an AI Developer Program.\n\nThen, the company added even more programs in 2024\" to promote building AI\napplications and hardware. Part of that initiative included providing hands-on\nlab time to developers with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra Meteor Lake NUC development\nkit.\n\nThe sheer number of AI models supported by Intel\u2019s Core Ultra matters because\nthey form \"the backbone of AI-enhanced software features like object removal,\nimage super resolution or text summarization,\" the chipmaker said in its press\nrelease. More optimized models means more AI features devs can bring to users.\n\nIntel sold more AI PC processors in a single quarter than its competitors did\nthroughout all of 2023, the company noted.\n\n\"Intel has a rich history of working with the ecosystem to bring AI\napplications to client devices, and today we celebrate another strong chapter\nin the heritage of client AI by surpassing 500 pre-trained AI models running\noptimized on Intel Core Ultra processors,\" said Robert Hallock, vice president\nof AI at Intel. \"This unmatched selection reflects our commitment to building\nnot only the PC industry\u2019s most robust toolchain for AI developers, but a\nrock-solid foundation AI software users can implicitly trust.\"\n\nIntel\u2019s next-gen laptop chip, Lunar Lake, is expected to spur even more\ngrowth. The CPU provides 100+ tera-operations per second (TOPS) of AI workload\nperformance, three times what the current generation can handle. TOPS is used\nspecifically to measure how many computing operations an AI accelerator can\ncomplete in one second at full utilization.\n\nDuring its AI Summit in Taipei, Intel set the bar for next-gen AI PCs at 45\nTOPS of Neural Processing Unit (NPU) performance, which Lunar Lake provides.\nBy way of comparison, Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake chips provide more than 65 TOPS of\nperformance, but only 10 TOPS of that performance come from the NPU. AMD, on\nthe other hand, lags but says it will catch up. Its current-gen Ryzen Hawk\nPoint platform has an NPU with 16 TOPS of performance. However, the company\nsays its next generation will triple that performance. Qualcomm will launch\nits Snapdragon X lineup this year, which will offer 45 TOPS on the NPU.\n\nThe 500 AI models running on Intel Core Ultra processors come from more\nfamilies than just the ChatGPT-like services most folks are familiar with.\nThey include large language models (ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini,\netc.) as well as computer vision, diffusion, image\nclassification/segmentation, object detection, super resolution, and more.\nSome of the industry sources Intel pointed out as using its technology include\nOpenVINO Model Zoo, Hugging Face, ONNX Model Zoo, and PyTorch. These sources\nspan more than 20 categories of AI, encompassing just about anything you might\nwant to do with the technology.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
