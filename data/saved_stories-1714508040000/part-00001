And like all the best business books, it's not merely an\ninstruction manual, but an inspirational guide too. Not since reading Ricardo\nSemler's Maverick in the early 2000s have I been this impressed with the\nforesight, fortitude, and ferocity of a founder. Musk is truly one of a kind.\n\nI know positive statements like that about Musk can trigger some people. Most\nhave already formed their opinion of the man, and, especially in technology,\nit's typically a polarized one. Either the man is the second coming of\ncapitalist christ or he's the devil's conman incarnate. Ironically, like many\nof the most interesting people to ever grace this earth, there are shimmers of\ntruth in both caricatures.\n\nThat's why Isaacson's book is such an enjoyable biography. You could quote a\nhundred passages supporting either position. His entrepreneurial achievements\nare as incontestable as his maniacal, even masochistic, commitment to a\nHARDCORE work ethic. The latter seems as much motivated by escaping personal\ndemons as by moving the needle. But the needle also does move!\n\nThe part of the business book I've enjoyed the most is the countless\nillustrations of how Musk applies his \"algorithm\". A methodology for shipping\neverything from electric cars to Mars rockets to flamethrowers to humanoid\nrobots. Quoted in full:\n\n  1. Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from \"the legal department\" or \"the safety department.\" You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.\n  2. Delete any part or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.\n  3. Simplify and optimize. This should come after step two. common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.\n  4. Accelerate cycle time. Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.\n  5. Automate. That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.\n\nThis is not just a succinct distillation of a practical and powerful work\nmethod but one for a successful company culture too. And this is how Musk runs\nhis companies. Isaacson's book is easily worth the read for the countless case\nstudies illustrating exactly how these points are applied.\n\nThe trick to getting the best out of Musk's method is to realize that you\nneedn't celebrate the madness as much as merely accept that it's part of a\npackage deal. Like it so often is. One of the memorable quotes from the book\nreveals that even Musk himself realizes this: \"Did you think I was just going\nto be a normal, chill dude?\".\n\nYou can absolutely learn from people you wouldn't want to be. Extracting\nwisdom from Musk's success does not oblige you to become his disciple or his\nmirror. Besides, you'd probably fail miserably in an attempt of the latter\nanyway.\n\nA key reason Musk gets away with his madness is that the missions he pursue\ncan motivate people to persevere in spite of him. So unless you're also trying\nto single-handedly accelerate the energy transition of earth or attempting to\ncolonize Mars, you'd best dilute his example accordingly.\n\nThat seems to be a lesson that's currently lost to the ages. The ability to\nappreciate, applaud, and even partly appropriate elements of a character you'd\nnever wish to swallow whole. I can shake my head as much as anyone about some\nof Musk's antics, and yet still be ever-so-pleased that he's here, doing what\nhe does.\n\nMost founders and executives would do well to add at least 10% of Musk's\nintensity to their personal recipe. You can do that and still believe that It\nDoesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work or that REMOTE is a compelling way of work\nand life for many or even most.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
