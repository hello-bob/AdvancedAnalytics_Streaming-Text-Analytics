Blot is a You Ship,\nWe Ship project from Hack Club.\n\n> Everything about Blot is open source. The online editor and drawing library\n> can be freely used by anyone, and we encourage all to submit to the gallery\n> through PRs! However, you must be a teenager or younger to receive a free\n> machine.\n\nA piece of art made for Blot can be the first program you ever write, but it\ncan also be a challenge for a master programmer. Check out some of the art\nmade already in our gallery. Every piece of art you see is actually a program.\nMany of them create unique pieces everytime the art is run. You may be looking\nat an artwork which has never been seen before, even by the creator.\n\nFor a short video introduction to Blot check out our 38 second trailer.\n\n# How It Works\n\n### 1) Create a piece of programatic art in the web editor.\n\nTo learn the Blot drawing library follow our getting started guide. Check out\nthe examples in the gallery and then follow along with some of our guides.\n\n### 2) Submit that art to the public gallery.\n\nThe submission rules to get a Blot for a PR are here. You must be a teenager\n(or younger to qualify for a free machine) but anyone can make art and make a\nPR.\n\n### 3) Receive the parts to build your own Blot that can draw that art in real\nlife.\n\nThe bill of materials can be found here and an assembly guide here.\n\n# Blot is...\n\nA custom CNC drawing machine designed from scratch to introduce you to digital\nfabrication. It's made of 6 unique 3D printed parts with a custom control\nboard and easy to understand firmware, which can be interfaced with through\nJavaScript in the browser. Blot is designed in OnShape. Check out the 3D model\nof the project. You can find the bill of materials here and, if you'd like to\n3D print your Blot, the parts are here. The entire build costs about $150\ndollars. If you're a teen we will give you all the parts for a PR with your an\nart piece you coded yourself.\n\nA web based editor for programmatic art that we designed specifically for pen\nplotting with a custom geometry library. We practiced programmatic pen\nplotting with some amazing artists. There is so much to learn and explore on\nthe programming and the aesthetic side.\n\n# What are People Making with Blot\n\nBlot has been in development since January 2023 and was released April 2024.\nWe've had lots of people use the Blot editor and the Blot machine to create\nvisual art, run workshops and as part of interactive installations. Here's a\nsense of what can be done with Blot.\n\n### Programmatic Art\n\nThere is all sorts of styles of programmatic art. Here are some examples of\ngreat Blot submissions that show a range of styles. This list is by no means\nexhuastive.\n\nThe nautral scene is a common source of artistic inspiration. This could be\ncalled figurative or represenational art when it tries to depict a real thing\nwith some fidelity. One example are these roots by Kai (age 17).\n\nThe geometric pattern is natural avenue to pursue when making art with\ncomputers because code is a great way to describe patterns. Oz's approach of\nclipping overlapping segments creates a wonderful sense of depth.\n\nThe tech demo (with composition) is focusing on a specific technical approach\nlike in Henry's (age 15) ray marcher. The art piece isn't complete though\nuntil the artists uses the technique to make a composition.\n\nThe data transformation can be seen in Kieran's (age 15) self portrait. It\ntakes data from an SVG but modifies it programmtically to produce an art\npiece. This approach could be used to visualize data that may not of been\nvisual to begin with.\n\nThe concept is important with any artwork and can be mixed with any of the\ngenres above. Ultimately an interesting idea can be what elevates something\nthat is visually pretty simple, one example by Ayush is the Blot's own self\nportrait.\n\nFor way more examples check out the gallery.\n\n### Blot as Creative Material\n\nYou ship we ship projects are developed to provide technological creative\nmaterial. The Blot was developed to not just create visual programs on\ncomputers but also to explore robotic and interactive technology. Here are\nsome ways the machine or project has been used to create interactive\ntechnology experiences.\n\nLineflow was developed as an interactive art piece for an MIT Museum event.\nParticipants would create a single line drawing on the computer and would then\nwatch a simulation of a line folding into there drawing. Three frames of that\nsimulation were strung together to create a timeline of the animation that\nwould be drawn by a Blot to be brought home by the participant.\n\nThe infinite gallery at Outernet (Hack Club's 2023 summer hackathon). Leo,\nKai, and Henry constructed a black out box that contained an infinite art\ngallery. Participant's entered a room sized black box with one wall\nilluminated with artwork and a giant joystick in the center. They could\nnavigate the gallery with the joystick and as they explored new (possibly\nnever before seen) art was generated based on their location.\n\nChinese caligraphy workshop was developed for and run at the Hack Club leader\nsummit 2024 by Bright Li (age 15). During it participants learned how to draw\nChinese caligraphy programmatically and then handed ink brushes to Bright's\nBlot robot to put the drawings to the page.\n\n# It's All Open Source\n\nEvery part of Blot is freely available for you to investigate and discover.\nThat includes the editor, the hardware design, the electronics, and even the\nfinances around the project. We think people deserve tools they can take\nownership of. That's why we give away the source for free.\n\nOur projects at Hack Club have hundreds of teenage contributors from all over\nthe world. If you want to learn how to program, we invite you to jump in and\nstart building tools used by thousands.\n\nYou're also welcome to participate and use our tools if you aren't a teen\n(like making art or building your own blot), but our online community is for\nteens only.\n\n# You Ship, We Ship\n\nAt Hack Club we're reimagining a new type of public education for technology.\nWe believe people learn best by creating things they care about and sharing\nthem with others. We build open source creative tools with young people all\naround the world. These tools are gateways to new subjects in technology like\nembedded systems, circuits or digital fabrication robotics. When teenagers\nbuild things with our tools we send them more creative materials for free.\n\nOur goal is to build a new type of library online that offers learners not\njust media to consume but tools to create. And it is free and open source to\nall. We're just getting started...\n\n# Development\n\nJoin the #blot channel on the Hack Club Slack.\n\nThe Blot editor is run with an Express server.\n\nAfter installing Git, Node.js, and Yarn, clone the repo.\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/hackclub/blot/ yarn install\n\nTo run the development server:\n\n    \n    \n    yarn dev\n\n# License\n\nThe Hack Club Blot is open source and licensed under the MIT License.
