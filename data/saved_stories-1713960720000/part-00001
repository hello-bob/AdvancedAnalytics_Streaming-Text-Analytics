Dubbed as one of\nthe \u201cmost dramatic tire developments in the history of the industry,\u201d these\ntires were made of a synthetic rubber known as Neothane. Goodyear used the\ntranslucent material, dying it various colors\u2013bright green, yellow, blue, and\nred, just to name a few. Then, the company put 18 small light bulbs, which\nwere essentially dash lights, inside the tires, giving them the glowing effect\nseen in the photo below.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Evan Ackerman\u2019s \u201cGoodyear\u2019s Illuminated Tires Promised a\nWhole New Frontier in Car Fashion\u201d\n\nWhile the synthetic Neothane was durable and quite simple to make, as it\ncombined plastic and rubber characteristics, there were several detractors\nthat made the fad fade a bit more quickly than Goodyear may have wanted. For\none, the material was too expensive for tire production. The tires also\nperformed poorly in wet conditions and tended to melt when drivers braked too\nheavily\u2013talk about safety hazards! There were also reports, such as the quote\nbelow, that the peculiar glowing tires fascinated passers-by and other\ndrivers, even causing them to keep on driving...right through red lights.\n\n> Street tests were causing some confusion. \u201cOther motorists have been so\n> enthralled by the pretty colors that they have gone through red lights or\n> just stopped to stare,\u201d [. . .] Traffic halted in the streets. Pedestrians\n> gaped in awe [. . .]\n>\n> Mark J. Price, Akron Beacon Journal\n\nDue to those serious issues with the Neothane\u2013and a seemingly passionate team\nof engineers\u2013Goodyear worked for a decade on trying to fix the shortcomings,\nbut to no avail. Eventually they were forced to scrap the project.\n\nYou were sure to be noticed on the street with tires like these!\n\nWhile the technology of the time might not have been able to implement\nilluminated tires, perhaps a contemporary designer may bring the notion into\ndiscussion for today\u2019s audience. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want light-up wheels\nfor all those late-evening cruises?\n\nYou can see the tires in action for yourself in the video below, which focuses\non the recently recovered Golden Sahara. Perhaps we\u2019ll do a blog post about\nthis car sometime in the future, considering it went for over $300,000 at the\nMecum Auction last year, and it is honestly one of the oddest, coolest looking\ncars we\u2019ve ever come across.\n\nExternal Links:\n\n  * \u201cGoodyear\u2019s Illuminated Tires Promised a Whole New Frontier in Car Fashion\u201d\n  * \u201cThe Mystery Of The Illuminated Goodyears\u201d\n  * \u201cAh yes, the short-lived 1950s fad of illuminated tires\u201d\n\nFiled Under: Uncategorized\n\n## Reader Interactions\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n## Footer\n\n### Contact info\n\n3600 East HWY 30, Suite B Kearney, NE 68847 (308) 234-1964\n\n### Come on, Be Social.\n\nView Classic Car CollectionKearney\u2019s profile on Facebook View CCCKearneyNe\u2019s\nprofile on TwitterView classiccarcollection\u2019s profile on InstagramView\nClassicCarKearney\u2019s profile on YouTube\n\n### Follow us on Facebook \u2192\n\n### TripAdvisor\n\n223\n\n### Meet Bernie Taulborg: The man who donated 131 cars\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Website by Luke Decker\n\nHandcrafted with on the Genesis Framework\n\n", "frontpage": false}
