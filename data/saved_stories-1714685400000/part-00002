The latter have been\nrepeatedly linked to deforestation in South America.\n\nHe also claims that the firm's insect-based feed has a carbon footprint that\nis \"100 times lower than that of soymeal\".\n\nStudies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon\nfootprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the\ninsects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that\nsoybean-based feed produces less carbon.\n\nMr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein,\ncompared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed\nmore filling and nutritious.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBlack soldier fly larvae are a good source of protein\n\nFounded in 2019, Full Circle now employs 14 people, and supplies 49 farms\nacross Thailand. It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based\nfeed is currently substantially cheaper.\n\nSoybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; \u00a3400) per tonne, compared\nwith \u20ac1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier\nthis year.\n\nTo try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to\nhelp maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI\nsystem to study all available past and present data on insect farming to\ndetermine and then continuously fine tune the best methods.\n\nThis can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum\nspace that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of\nflies, and whether to introduce new strains or species.\n\n\"AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome\nobstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production,\nto be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,\" says Mr Collins.\n\n\"AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming\nto date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every\ntime we grow one.\"\n\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\n\nSome 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is\nalso working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software\nthat automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will\nenable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for\nitself.\n\nCogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to\nlaunch it commercially in the next three years.\n\nIts founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of\ncompanies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily\navailable. \"We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of\nsoftware, and we have been here already for five years.\n\nCogastro\n\nMante Sidlauskaite worries that some firms exaggerate their use of AI\n\n\"It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to\nunderstand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we\nwould be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs.\nSo we now have a baseline to build an AI solution.\n\n\"But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that\nthey have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model\nbefore they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data,\nand to have data you need to have some customers first.\"\n\nShe adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without\nfirms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBlack soldier flies are territorial when they are breeding\n\nBack at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based\nexpert in the field called Simon Christofides.\n\nMr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed\ncommercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn,\nand that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process.\n\n\"Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years\nof passed down generational learning,\" he says. \"Black soldier fly larvae have\nbeen farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in\nour current understanding.\"\n\nMr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights\n\"no human could ever achieve\", by using multiple sensors and crunching\nmillions of data points.\n\nYet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with\nthings on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate\non green ribbons laid out in such a way as to account for their territorial\ntendencies.\n\n\"You need to consider their social and behavioural dynamics as animals,\" says\nMr Collins.\n\nInternational Business\n\nThailand\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nRelated\n\n## Uber faces \u00a3250m London black cab drivers case\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## J&J hopes for deal with third talc settlement\n\n20 hrs ago\n\n## Beijing tightens grip on China social media giants\n\n1 day ago\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n## Investment firm buys former Britishvolt site\n\nNorthumberland County Council has negotiated a buy-back deal in the event the\nproject is not built.\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n1 day ago\n\n## How AI is testing the boundaries of the human mind\n\nThe BBC is launching a new series to explore the limits of artificial\nintelligence by pitting it against the most powerful thinking machines on the\nplanet \u2013 the human brain.\n\n1 day ago\n\nFuture\n\n1 day ago\n\n## AI v The Mind: Who has the edge?\n\nIn a new series, we will test the limits of the latest AI technology by\npitting it against human experts.\n\n1 day ago\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n1 day ago\n\n## FKA Twigs uses AI to create deepfake of herself\n\nThe musician tells a US Senate committee her digital clone will interact with\nfans and journalists.\n\n1 day ago\n\n1 day ago\n\n## AI catches 114 drivers on mobiles in one week\n\nA police force says the technology is \"sadly\" showing how commonly drivers use\nphones at the wheel.\n\n1 day ago\n\nNorthampton\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
