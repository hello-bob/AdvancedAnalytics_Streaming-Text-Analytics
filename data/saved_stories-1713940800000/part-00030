And the tension between these\nestranged twins seems to be escalating toward an inevitable showdown, a second\nAmerican Civil War.\n\nAt least, this is the impression you\u2019d get if you follow mainstream discourse.\n2022 has seen several popular books\u2014such as Barbara F Walter's How Civil Wars\nStart and Stephen Marche's The Next Civil War\u2014warn that social media has\npolarized the US to such an extent that war is a distinct possibility. Such\nfears have been echoed by the corporate media; an analysis by the New York\nTimes found that online use of the term \"civil war\" has exploded. The Times\nhas played its own part in the explosion, regularly talking up the threat of\ncivil war, such as here and here and here. Meanwhile, a recent Time opinion\npiece declared that civil war is coming, while another for the Guardian\nclaimed it's already happening. And in a UC Davis poll of over 8000 Americans,\nhalf of them said they expect a civil war in the next couple of years.\n\nShould we be concerned? Yes, but not because any of these people are correct.\nSocial media is having a much stranger effect on people than merely pushing\nthem toward war; it's convincing them they\u2019re headed for war when in fact they\naren't. And among the victims of this corrosive delusion are countless\ninfluential opinion-makers, as well as everyone influenced by them.\n\nI first felt the creeping dread of civil war shortly after I started tweeting\nin 2016. That year was a tumultuous one online, with the rise of Trump fueling\na bitter culture war. Despite not even being American, it became impossible\nfor me to avoid the verbal crossfire between #MAGA advocates and\n#TheResistance. Soon, the conflict was dominating my feed, and filling me with\na crippling sense of hopelessness. I pictured a world of frothing, wild-eyed\nlunatics finger-stabbing their keyboards in ALL CAPS, and I feared they\u2019d soon\nswitch their keyboards for guns. The more online conflict I witnessed, the\nmore I\u2019d feel a gnawing hatred, not just for those I deemed my political\nenemies, but for humanity generally. And, despite the fact that most of the\nbickering was between Americans, I developed a sense that my own home, the UK,\nwas polarized beyond hope.\n\nThis exhausting feeling of division, despair, and doom\u2014which I\u2019ve since dubbed\n\u201cdramageddon\u201d\u2014would be strongest in the aftermath of lengthy sessions on\nTwitter, but would fade whenever I went outside and interacted with locals,\nwho\u2019d invariably remind me that in the real world most people were calm,\nfriendly, and largely united.\n\nIndeed, a 2021 Pew survey of 10,000 US social media users found that only 9%\nof people shared or posted political content online. \u201cBashing the fash\u201d or\n\u201cowning the libs\u201d simply wasn\u2019t something the average person cared about.\n\nSo why, then, did Twitter make me feel like civil war was inevitable? What was\nthis toxic sense of dread and hopelessness that began to overwhelm me after a\nfew hours of doomscrolling?\n\nTo understand dramageddon, we must consider the nature of social media\ntoxicity. The original thinking was that online interactions are frequently\nmuch nastier than real world conversations because anonymity and distance\nreduce people\u2019s inhibitions and make them more likely to lash out, much like\nroad rage.\n\nCertainly, the format of social media, and particularly of Twitter, can bring\nout the worst in people. But this isn\u2019t the main reason that online discourse\nis so often toxic. The truth is that social media applies two distorting\nfilters to our vision: it attracts toxic people and it amplifies them. Let\u2019s\nconsider each of these in turn.\n\nThe nature of social media as a realm of pure appearance, in which one can\neasily deceive others, makes it highly attractive to narcissists. Narcissism\nis pathological self-centeredness, and it\u2019s characterized by a strong sense of\nentitlement, a need for attention and social validation, and a lack of concern\nfor the needs of others. In order to get maximum attention, narcissists will\noften engage in histrionics (theatrical behavior), catastrophizing\n(exaggerating) threats against them. They are therefore frequently surrounded\nby an aura of drama.\n\nResearch suggests narcissists are more likely to be political activists.\nFurther, the narcissistic trait of entitlement is linked to political\ncorrectness and alt-right attitudes, and may therefore help explain both the\nwoke and the red-pilled, manifesting as either a victim-complex (\u201cLook at me,\nI\u2019m being censored/discriminated against!\u201d) or a savior-complex (\u201cLook at me,\nI\u2019m standing up to the groomers/bigots!\u201d)\n\nNow, here's the thing: research suggests that people with narcissistic traits\nare more likely to use social media, and more likely to have social media\nclout. A meta-analysis of 62 studies (N = 13,430) found that narcissism was\npositively correlated with time spent on social media, frequency of tweets,\nand number of followers. Narcissists likely find social media a useful (and\naddictive) way of acquiring the social validation they so deeply crave.\n\nIt appears that it\u2019s this small group of needy narcissists who drive the\nmajority of toxicity online. According to a meta-analysis of eight studies (N\n= 8,434), online political discussions attract superficial, status-driven\npeople who act as horridly online as they do offline. This finding was\ncorroborated by a large study of 36,000 communities on Reddit, which found\nthat less than 1% of communities start 74% of conflicts.\n\nTo understand how a minority of people can drive the majority of online\ntoxicity, we must consider social media\u2019s second visual filter. Not only does\nit attract narcissists, but it also amplifies them.\n\nBack in 2017, I noticed that tweets in which I viciously attacked others\nreceived more engagement than ones in which I tried to be reasonable:\n\nGurwinder @G_S_Bhogal\n\nTweets in which I mean-spiritedly attack others get 10 times more likes and\nretweets than ones in which I'm reasonable and nuanced. That means that you,\ndear followers, are bloodthirsty bastards.\n\n11:00 PM \u2219 Nov 30, 2017\n\n56Likes7Retweets\n\nMy suspicions have since been confirmed by research. A 2021 study analyzed 2.7\nmillion tweets and Facebook posts, and found that social media posts that\nattack the opposing political tribe receive twice as many shares as posts that\nchampion one\u2019s own tribe. Furthermore, each additional word referencing a\nrival idea or person (e.g. \u2018Biden\u2019 or \u2018Liberal\u2019 if coming from a Republican\nsource) increased the likelihood of a post being shared by an average of 67%.\n\nThe high engagement that online belligerence receives has a double effect: it\nmeans that toxic posts are more widely circulated, but it also means that\npeople who act toxically are rewarded. Rewards are incentives, and an analysis\nof 12.7 million tweets found that people who received high engagement for\nonline nastinesss tended to repeat the behavior. Now combine this with the\nfact that everyone, narcissist or otherwise, is most motivated to post when\nthey are aggrieved, panicked, or enraged, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nSocial media both attracts and amplifies dramatic, narcissistic people, making\nthem seem far more representative of humanity than they really are. Just as a\nmagnifying glass focuses diffuse sunlight into a blistering beam, so Twitter\nfocuses background chatter into the clamor of war. What we see on our feeds\nand in our replies is not reality but a dramatization of it, a tragic tale\nplayed by a cast of keyboard warriors and perpetual victims that eventually\nleaves us hopeless and exhausted.\n\nThis is dramageddon, and it\u2019s why so many cultural elites are obsessed with a\nfictional civil war; they've been fooled by Twitter's reality-filters to\nbelieve that theatrical online conflict is indicative of real-world sentiment.\n\nNone of this would be problem if it were inconsequential, but the consequence\nof believing that people are extremer than they are is that it makes you\nextreme. In a longitudinal study incorporating over 16 million comments on\nCNN.com, researchers found that people who saw antisocial \u201ctroll\u201d posts from\nothers became embittered and were then more likely to act antisocially\nthemselves.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that, even though people as a whole have not\nbecome significantly more polarized, those who routinely engage in politics on\nTwitter have. A longitudinal study of 679,000 Twitter users over 8 years found\nthat they\u2019d steadily become more prone to retweeting only their own side's\ntweets, and following only their own side's accounts.\n\nTwitter's political users are a minority of a minority\u2014but they\u2019re a highly\ninfluential one. Many of them are opinion-makers and policymakers. And so when\nthey become convinced of impending civil war, their sense of peril seeps out\nfrom Twitter into the world at large, poisoning others.\n\nIf fears of civil war were transmitted far enough, they could theoretically\nspark an actual civil war, but it's highly unlikely. Dramageddon spreads\nquickly among terminally online political pundits, but let\u2019s face it: most\npolarized intellectuals are too cowardly to fight for real, having\nhistorically relied on the common people to shed blood on their behalf. And\nthe common people, living their lives far from Twitter in the real world, show\nno indication of being polarized or even interested in politics outside of\nwhat impacts them directly.\n\nThe more credible threat posed by dramageddon is much simpler than civil war:\nit is, to put it frankly, turning our brains to shit. By presenting us with a\npantomime of reality performed by trolls and narcissists, and by convincing us\nthat this pantomime is based on a true story, social media is afflicting us\nwith a chronic paranoia that dements logic, destroys goodwill, and obstructs\ndialogue.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\nAny hope that Elon could solve this problem died shortly after his takeover of\nTwitter, when he revealed, through his wild online behavior, that he\u2019s a\nvictim of dramageddon:\n\nElon Musk @elonmusk\n\nThe woke mind virus is either defeated or nothing else matters\n\n12:25 PM \u2219 Dec 12, 2022\n\n661,809Likes90,208Retweets\n\nSure, wokeness is a problem. But \u201cnothing else matters\u201d? Really? This is the\nkind of thing one might tweet after a week of viewing nothing but Libs of\nTikTok, and it\u2019s just as histrionic as the liberal media\u2019s alarm about Civil\nWar 2.\n\nGiven Elon\u2019s business record, I was willing to give him the benefit of the\ndoubt, but it\u2019s increasingly clear that he\u2019s easily influenced by culture war\nnonsense, and, given the carelessness with which he tweets (and apparently\nthinks), it\u2019s not crazy to fear that he may one day go full-Kanye. Sadly,\nthen, we can\u2019t depend on the Chief Twit to fix this, because he\u2019s part of the\nproblem that needs the fix.\n\nSo if we can\u2019t rely on Twitter to fix Twitter, should we just leave? Many have\nalready done so. Among them are Claire Lehmann and Sam Harris, who both closed\ntheir Twitter accounts the day before I decided to return to Twitter. Sam gave\nhis reasons in a video, describing the early symptoms of dramageddon: \u201cIt was\nshowing me the worst of other people, in a way that was ... distorting my\nperception of humanity.\u201d Claire gave her own reasons in an article for The\nAustralian, and also on Twitter itself before she left, where she mentioned\nthe attacks on Sam and questioned whether any of it was really worth it.\n\nDisclaimer: I like Sam and Claire. I\u2019ve valued Sam\u2019s takes for nearly two\ndecades, and I respect Claire\u2019s thoughtfulness and integrity (I also like\nClaire personally for believing in my writing when I was still unsure of it,\nwhich helped convince me to be a writer).\n\nSince I\u2019ve followed Sam and Claire closely on Twitter, I\u2019ve seen the kind of\nvitriol they\u2019re routinely subject to, and it\u2019s substantially more than most.\nThey\u2019re among the few members of the IDW who never succumbed to audience\ncapture, but unfortunately, their refusal to become part of a tribe has made\nlife on Twitter hard for them, as they\u2019re now frequently attacked by both left\nand right, and they don\u2019t typically have an angry mob of their own to defend\nthem.\n\nSo I understand their reasons for leaving Twitter. But I think the path they\nchose is the second-best solution.\n\nSee, Twitter, for all its faults, is an unparalleled snapshot of the world.\nIt\u2019s often the first place news breaks, and it\u2019s the best way to hear directly\nwhat important people are saying instead of what journalists are saying\nthey\u2019re saying. Being able to read thoughts and follow events in real time\nacross the world is a power past generations would've considered magic.\nTwitter, at its best, is clairvoyance and telepathy.\n\nSure, a minority of narcissists are disproportionately amplified by the\nplatform, which can be maddening, but here\u2019s the thing: since they\u2019re a\nminority, they can be largely filtered out with just a little curation.\n\nThe most important consideration is who you follow. There are so many\nreasonable and informative people on Twitter: @Ayishat_Akanbi, @david_perell,\n@DegenRolf, @ethanmollick, @IonaItalia, @JuliaGalef, @Kpaxs, @mmay3r,\n@rainmaker1973, @SarahTheHaider, @SalomeSibonex, @SteveStuWill,\n@TheStoicEmperor, to name just a few.\n\nBut just following the right accounts isn\u2019t enough. You must also make heavy\nuse of the mute and block buttons. Bad information is not just useless, it\nalso muscles out good information from your field of vision\u2014noise displaces\nsignal. Therefore, by not blocking bad tweeters you are blocking better\ntweeters.\n\nMute those who peddle lies or trivialities. Block those who contribute to\ndramageddon: the trolls, narcissists, and rageaholics. Use block lists to\nsilence those who post toxic tweets and those who like and retweet them. Above\nall, never allow yourself to be guilt-tripped into thinking blocking is\ncensorship; no one is entitled to your attention. The cost of an uncensored\ninternet is that you must take responsibility for what you see. By not\ncurating your feed you become a prisoner of other people as surely as if your\nfeed was censored. A poorly curated Twitter feed is among the worst possible\nsources of information, but a well-curated feed is among the very best.\n\nI hope Sam and Claire will consider returning to Twitter, partly for their own\nsake but mostly for the public square\u2019s, because amid the surge in online\npolarization we need calm and sane voices more than ever. There won\u2019t be a\ncivil war in the West any time soon, but there is a hysteria around civil war\nthat could prove just as troublesome.\n\nTwitter, the home of narcissists, will always be divisive theater, but with a\nlittle curation it can be its own solution, for ultimately we\u2019ll beat those\nwho wish to divide us not by fleeing into seclusion but by connecting with\nthose still willing to talk.\n\n136 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n136\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Dramageddon: The Virtual Civil War\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n33\n\nShare\n\n33 Comments\n\nAdam WattsDec 15, 2022Liked by GurwinderExcellent article, the advice on\nmanaging your feed is also excellent and can be applied to other social media\nand news sources as well.Expand full commentLike (9)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nFRANCIS AARONFRANCIS AARONDec 16, 2022Liked by GurwinderOn my entire time on\nTwitter I've blocked precisely zero people. There's only been one instance of\nsome creepy little stalker where I considered it. I think it's a waste of time\neven to bother blocking people. If you add up the amount of time you spend\nblocking people I'm not sure what it would come to, but whatever it is it's\nprobably not even worth giving to these people even to block them. The best\nway to curate a feed is to forget the main feed and just build lists of\naccounts who you want to hear from on various topics. I have about 20 of these\nlists. You can also now have 5 of them on the dashboard at the top, and flick\nbetween the best ones. I've barely posted on Twitter recently for some of the\nreasons you cite, but I check the lists everyday, and everyday there's some\ninteresting info or a book recommendation or a thread or something to weave\ninto a song or piece of writing or something to research in future. Hence me\nbeing here writing this now. If I click onto the main feed I see something\nthat pisses me off within a few mins, because it's as you say, geared for\ndrama and wired to induce aggravation \u2013 and I am not innocent here! Anyway, I\nmeant to say this was a good piece so well done.Ironically, Foucault had an\ninteresting perspective on 'civil war'. A bit like Hobbes, he suggested that\nit is the natural condition of society. It's strange that we call the American\nor Spanish or English civil wars 'civil' \u2013 they were anything but! Foucault's\nconception of civil war was closer to the concept of 'culture war': typically\nregarded as inconsequential nonsense but in fact the lifeblood of any society.\nA constant, ever-raging war of ideologies \u2013 it remains 'civil' on the surface,\nthat is to say non-violent. But deeply tied to society's conception of\npunishment, whatever it may be at any one time, whatever it believes needs to\nbe punished. This stuff is in his lecture book 'The Punitive Society', quite a\nstrong analysis of this concept in there, and despite the woke being his\nspiritual 'successors', most of his statements are applicable to them. Twitter\nis sort of a digital punishment machine where everyone gets to inflict blows\non their enemy.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n31 more comments...\n\nThe Perils of Audience Capture\n\nHow influencers become brainwashed by their audiences\n\nJun 30, 2022 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n941\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Perils of Audience Capture\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n125\n\nTikTok is a Time Bomb\n\nThe ultimate weapon of mass distraction\n\nJan 21, 2023 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n1,096\n\nShare this post\n\n#### TikTok is a Time Bomb\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n76\n\nWhy Smart People Believe Stupid Things\n\nIntelligence is not rationality\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nGurwinder\n\n1,022\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things\n\nwww.gurwinder.blog\n\n244\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Gurwinder\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
