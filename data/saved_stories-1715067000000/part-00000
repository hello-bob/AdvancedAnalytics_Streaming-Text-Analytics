The rating for Fortran did slip a bit,\nfrom 1.47% last month to 1.24% this month. But before April, Fortran\u2019s last\nappearance in the Tiobe top 10 was April 2002.\n\nPaul Jansen, CEO of Tiobe, a provider of tools for measuring software quality,\nattributed Fortran\u2019s recent rise to the language\u2019s advantages for\nnumerical/mathematical computing. \u201cDespite lots of competitors in this field,\nFortran has its reason for existence,\u201d Jansen said. He noted shortcomings in\nthe competition: Python, while the top choice, is slow; MATLAB comes with\nexpensive licensing; C/C++, while mainstream and fast, has no native\ncomputation support; R is slow; Julia, while rising, is not mature yet. \u201cAnd\nin this jungle of languages, Fortran appears to be fast, having native\nmathematical computation support, mature, and free of charge. Silently, slowly\nbut surely, Fortran gains ground. It is surprising but undeniable.\u201d\n\n#### [ Keep up with the latest developments in software development.

The\nratings are calculated using Google, Bing, Wikipedia, and more than 20 other\nwebsites.\n\nThe Tiobe index top 10 for May 2024:\n\n  1. Python, with a rating of 16.3%\n  2. C, 9.98%\n  3.
