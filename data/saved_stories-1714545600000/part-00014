Lawrence Kozak, 51, was charged Thursday with theft and related\ncrimes, according to the affidavit of probable cause for his arrest. He was\nreleased after posting $250,000 bail.\n\nHis attorney, Joseph Poluka, said he was reviewing the charges and planned to\ncontact prosecutors about the case in the coming days.\n\nKozak was removed from his position at St. Thomas More Church in Pottstown and\nplaced on administrative leave in November 2022, according to Ken Gavin, a\nspokesperson for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. That decision was made,\nGavin said, after an investigation into the priest\u2019s spending by the\narchdiocese\u2019s Office of Parish Services and Support.\n\nInvestigators said an accountant working for St. Thomas More discovered \u201can\nastronomical amount of Apple transactions\u201d on credit card statements for the\nchurch while reviewing their finances in 2022. The purchases began in\nSeptember 2019, not long after Kozak joined the parish, and ended in July\n2022, they said. The Apple ID used to make those purchases was registered to\nKozak.\n\nDetectives continued to probe those financial records, and found that an\nAmazon account belonging to Kozak had used the parish credit card to buy a\nbackpack, Amazon Fire tablet, and children\u2019s chemistry set, all of which were\nsent to an address in Bensalem, where Kozak\u2019s goddaughter lives, the affidavit\nsaid. The packages included a note signed by \u201cUncle Larry.\u201d\n\nOther financial records showed that Kozak had used his personal bank account\nto pay $10,000 of the balance on the parish credit card, the affidavit said.\n\nWhen interviewed by detectives in 2022, Kozak said he was seeking counseling\nfor his addiction to playing and spending money on online games, according to\nthe affidavit. He said the money was not spent on gambling, but rather to\n\u201cpower up\u201d \u2014 gain an advantage in the games he was playing.\n\nHe denied intentionally using the parish credit cards for those purchases,\nsaying the cards were already connected to his cell phone because he used them\nto pay for church-authorized streaming services and Microsoft Office software.\nBut he conceded that it was possible he had used the cards accidentally,\nsaying he was not \u201ca details guy,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nDetectives said the priest told them he was \u201cdisappointed that he had let it\nget to this point\u201d and said there was \u201cno excuse, except that he wasn\u2019t paying\nattention and should have been.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later learned Kozak had sent a check for $8,000 labeled \u201cparish\nreimbursements\u201d to his successor at St. Thomas More after his removal as\nleader of the church.\n\nIn a note included with the check, Kozak apologized to the new priest, saying\nhe was sorry he \u201cmade this mistake\u201d and had been paying back the money he owed\nthe church, the affidavit said.\n\nSt. Thomas More\u2019s business manager told investigators she believed Kozak knew\nthe parish card was being used for his gaming habit. She said she had\npreviously asked the priest about unexplained credit card purchases on the\naccount\u2019s statements and had warned him about the dangers of mixing business\nand personal expenses.\n\nIn those warnings, she said, she made specific reference to Msgr. Joseph\nMcLoone, an archdiocesan priest who was sentenced to five years of probation\nin 2021 after pleading guilty to embezzling money from St. Joseph Parish in\nDowningtown. McLoone admitted to using the money to augment his salary, fund\nvacations to the Jersey Shore, and finance his secret romances.\n\nCatholics4Change, an advocacy group that pushes for accountability for priests\naccused of sex abuse and other crimes, have been working with some\nparishioners at St. Thomas More since 2022, when the allegations against Kozak\nfirst were revealed, according to Kathy Kane, the group\u2019s co-founder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time at that parish, and this is a crime that needs to\nbe prosecuted,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that it\u2019s in the hands of the court and\nnot just the archdiocese.\u201d\n\nAbout Us\n\nAbout The InquirerDiversity & InclusionAdvertiseContact UsLicensing &\nPermissionsPhoto ReprintsNewspapers in EducationJobs & InternshipsInquirer\nEventsAcel Moore WorkshopsNewsroom StaffHelp and Feedback\n\nNews & Info\n\nNewsSportsSports BettingEntertainmentBusiness\n\nHealthFoodLifeOpinionArchivesSpecial ReportsSite Map\n\nMarketplace\n\nSubscribeInquirer StoreJob ListingsAll Classifieds\n\nDeath NoticesLegal NoticesGift Subscriptions\n\ne-Editions\n\nThe InquirerThe Daily NewsSubscriber Services\n\nMobile Apps\n\nApple iOSGoogle Android\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC\n\nTerms of Use/Privacy Policy/Cancellation Policy/California Notice/\n\nCalifornia residents do not sell my data request\n\n", "frontpage": false}
