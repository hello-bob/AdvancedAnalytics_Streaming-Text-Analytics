So there is\nalmost no UI. Text navigation and the editor interactions are strictly\ndesigned for keyboard use (since I hate moving my hand during typing and using\nthe mouse); however, some basic mouse support was added after some time\n(mostly for cases like a quick presentation of code to colleagues and similar\nthings).\n\nI mostly use C/C++ at work so the editor is designed to be used with those\nlanguages.\n\nI used Emacs a lot so my Ctrl key is remapped to CapsLock. I think such\nControl key position is way better and ergonomic, so consider do the same.\nDefault Tine keybinding is a lot about pressing Control. Also right hand\ntouch-type home position is used as a base for the cursor movement (arrows can\nbe used too).\n\nMy default working OS is Windows, so the editor was designed according to it.\nHowever, porting to other platforms might be possible since the language API\nused for the editor supports also Linux and Mac. I just didn't spend too much\ntime implementing features like hot-load and process execution there.\n\n# Authors\n\n  * Martin Dorazil (travis)\n  * bovacu\n\n# First Run\n\n## Windows\n\nThe editor is distributed as a single small executable containing all the data\nneeded. I recommend putting the executable into a separate directory because\nthe default configuration file default.proj and projects directory will be\nautomatically generated for you next to the executable.\n\n## MacOS\n\nDefault configuration file default.proj will be created in ~/.tine directory\ntogether with projects folder.\n\n## Linux\n\nDefault configuration file default.proj will be created in ~/.tine directory\ntogether with projects folder.\n\n# Configuration\n\nThe default configuration of the editor can be found in default.proj file.\nThis file is created automatically on the first run. Use open-default-config\ncommand to open it.\n\n# Projects\n\nTo enable some advanced features as \"grep search\" you need to create a new\nproject file located in projects directory (use open-projects-directory to\nopen the disk location in your file explorer). Each project is represented as\na single configuration file with .proj extension. In general, a project file\nshould contain at least ;include section with a project root directory path\nand ;include_file_extensions section. You also might need to override some\nsettings from the default.proj configuration. For more details see\ndocumentation in the default.proj file (open-default-config command).\n\nTo open projects from the projects directory use Ctrl+Shift+O or open-project-\ncommand.\n\n# Buffers\n\nEach file open in the editor is represented as a single unique buffer. There\nare some special buffer kinds like Messages (containing log of all\nnotifications and errors) or Build (containing output of the last compilation)\nexisting without any actual file on the disk.\n\n# Modes\n\nVarious editor features are implemented as \"modes\".\n\n### Run Command\n\nCommand: run-command Shortcut: Ctrl+X\n\nThe most fundamental mode serving as an entry point to all editor features.\nAll possible interactions with the editor are build as commands. You can\nexecute any command you want by choosing one from the command list.\n\nUse fuzzy-search for a quick lookup.\n\n### Goto Line\n\nCommand: goto-line Shortcut: Alt+G\n\nMove the cursor in current editor to the line number.\n\n### Open File\n\nCommand: open-file Shortcut: Ctrl+O\n\nOpen the file from disk.\n\n### Open Project\n\nCommand: open-project Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+O\n\nOpen project from projects directory.\n\n### Quick Open\n\nCommand: quick-open Shortcut: Ctrl+P\n\nList recursively all files in the project directories specified in project\nconfig ;include section. Only editable project files (with extensions listed\nin ;include_file_extension section) will be present in the list.\n\nUse fuzzy-search for a quick lookup.\n\n### Search\n\nCommand: search-file Shortcut: Ctrl+S\n\nSearch in the current focused file buffer. All matching locations are\ndynamically highlighted as you type. Use Ctrl+K or Ctrl+L (or arrows) no jump\nbetween resuts, Enter to jump back to the editor at the found match location\nor Escape to cancel the search.\n\nThe search currently does not support regex and match detection is not case\nsensitive.\n\nUse Ctrl+Enter to show search results in split buffer.\n\nTo replace found results use Ctrl+R shortcut.\n\n### Search In Project\n\nCommand: search-in-project Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+S\n\nSearch text recursively in all files included in the projec as you type.\n\nUse Ctrl+Enter to show search results in split buffer.\n\n## Build\n\nCommand: build Shortcut: F4\n\nCurrently Windows only.\n\nWhen the build command is executed Tine will try to execute build.bat file in\nthe project directory, result is presented in a read-only buffer. In case the\noutput contains errors or warning in a known format (currently CL and Clang\ncompiler outputs are supported), you can jump between reported source\nlocations by pressing Ctrl+. and Ctrl+, shortcuts (next-error and prev-error\ncommands).\n\n# Developer\n\nTine text editor is written in a custom language called Biscuit\n(https://github.com/travisdoor/bl).
