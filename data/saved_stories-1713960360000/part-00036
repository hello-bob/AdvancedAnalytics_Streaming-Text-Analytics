Looking ahead, the\ncompany realized that it had to rethink its infrastructure to accommodate the\nhuge influx of new people and data, and also control costs and energy\nconsumption.\n\nThat\u2019s when Facebook started a project to design the world\u2019s most energy\nefficient data center, one that could handle unprecedented scale at the lowest\npossible cost. A small team of engineers spent the next two years designing\nand building one from the ground up: software, servers, racks, power supplies,\nand cooling. The result now stands in Prineville, Oregon.\n\nIt was 38% more energy efficient to build and 24% less expensive to run than\nthe company\u2019s previous facilities\u2014and has led to even greater innovation.\n\nThe Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP) was initiated in 2011 with a mission\nto apply the benefits of open source and open collaboration to hardware and\nrapidly increase the pace of innovation in, near and around the data center\u2019s\nnetworking equipment, general purpose and GPU servers, storage devices and\nappliances, and scalable rack designs. OCP\u2019s collaboration model is being\napplied beyond the data center, helping to advance the telecom industry & EDGE\ninfrastructure.\n\n## Our mission:\n\nSpurring rapid innovation\n\nThe Open Compute Project Foundation is a rapidly growing, global community\nwhose mission is to design, use, and enable mainstream delivery of the most\nefficient designs for scalable computing.\n\nWe believe that openly sharing ideas, specifications, and other intellectual\nproperty is the key to maximizing innovation and reducing complexity in tech\ncomponents.\n\nThe Open Compute Project Foundation provides a structure in which individuals\nand organizations can share their intellectual property with others and\nencourage the IT industry to evolve.\n\nIn designing commodity hardware that is more efficient, flexible, and\nscalable, we\u2019re redefining tech infrastructure. Together, we\u2019re throwing off\nthe shackles of proprietary, one-size-fits-all gear.\n\n## Our vision:\n\nToday's innovation is tomorrow's standard\n\nAs technologists across industries participate in this community, we are\ncreating and refining more designs, making it possible for more companies to\ntransition from their old, proprietary solutions to OCP gear.\n\nIn response, hardware manufacturers are changing their offerings to keep up\nwith our innovations and meet the market\u2019s changing needs and expectations.\n\nWe know that as we move more services to the cloud, handle more data, and\nbring connectivity to the world, we must do it in the most efficient,\neconomical, and sustainable way. Hardware must become a commoditized and\nevolving set of products optimized for these challenges.\n\nWe believe open collaboration is the best way to get there.\n\n## Our tenets:\n\nA consistent drive for excellence\n\nTo ensure a level of consistency in our contributions, OCP requires that all\ncontributions meet three out of the five core OCP tenets below:\n\n  * Efficiency\n  * Impact\n  * Openness\n  * Scalability\n  * Sustainability\n\nThis commitment to excellence keeps OCP at the forefront of the open source\ncompute movement. A full explanation of the OCP core tenets can be seen here.\n\n#### OCP Accepted and OCP Inspired\n\nLook for products that have an OCP Accepted or OCP Inspired icon.\n\nProducts that carry the OCP Accepted recognition comply 100% with an OCP\napproved specification and the design files are open sourced and available.\n\nOCP Accepted or OCP Inspired products have been demonstrated and meet 3 or\nmore of the OCP tenets-efficiency, openness, impact & scale. They can only be\nsold with warranty and support.\n\n#### OCP Ready\n\nThe OCP Facility Recognition program is intended to brand your facilities to\nbe OCP Ready. Guidelines were created by our Data Center Facility Project Team\nand serve as a reference for data center operators and tenants who want to\nunderstand the fundamental facility requirements to deploy this gear into\ntheir IT space. Facilities that meet these guidelines and approved by the OCP\nDC Facilities Project receive the certification as an OCP Ready facility.\n\nLearn More\n\n##### About\n\n  * History & Mission\n  * Foundation Staff\n  * Board\n  * Advisory Board\n  * Steering Committee\n  * Project Leads\n  * Alliance Partners\n  * Media and Press Guidelines\n  * OCP Policies\n  * OCP Adoption\n\n##### Marketplace\n\n  * Integrated Solutions\n  * Facilities & Services\n  * Telecom & Edge\n  * Products\n\n##### Solution Providers\n\n  * Solution Provider Programs & Fees\n  * Solution Provider Agreements\n  * Solution Providers Directory\n  * How to Become a Solution Provider\n  * Product Recognition Program\n  * Facility Recognition Program\n  * SP Portal\n\n##### Projects\n\n  * Overview\n  * Cooling Environments\n  * Data Center Facility\n  * Hardware Management\n  * Networking\n  * Open System Firmware\n  * Rack & Power\n  * Security\n  * Server\n  * Storage\n  * Sustainability\n  * Telco\n  * Time Appliances Project (TAP)\n  * OCP Strategic Initiatives\n  * Future Technologies Initiative\n  * Regional Project Community - APAC\n  * Regional Project Community - China Mainland\n  * Regional Project Community - EMEA\n  * Regional Project Community - Japan\n  * Regional Project Community - Korea\n  * Regional Project Community - Taiwan\n\n##### Events\n\n  * 2024 OCP Global Summit\n  * 2024 OCP Regional Summit\n  * OCP Future Technologies Symposium\n  * OCP Educational Webinar Program\n  * Upcoming Events\n  * Past Events\n\n##### Membership\n\n  * Overview & Fees\n  * Membership Directory\n  * Startup Program\n  * Startup Directory\n  * How to Join\n  * Membership Agreements\n\n##### Blog\n\nThe Open Compute Project was first initiated by Facebook, now Meta, in 2011.\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * OCP Policies\n\nThanks to Rackspace for hosting.
