Salesforce's potential acquisition of Informatica is aimed at significantly bolstering its data capabilities, particularly in areas such as data integration, quality assurance and customer insights. This move is part of a broader trend of consolidation in the software industry, aiming to enhance Salesforce's competitive edge in data analytics and management.\n  * Broadening Salesforce's data ecosystem. The integration of Informatica will enhance Salesforce's existing generative AI systems and Mulesoft infrastructure, providing more comprehensive data cataloging and advanced data management tools like master data management and data governance.\n  * Implications for CMOs and CX professionals. The acquisition signals a shift toward more accelerated innovation in customer experience management. By integrating robust data capabilities, Salesforce aims to empower CMOs and CX professionals to make faster, more informed decisions, enhancing customer experiences and potentially leading to higher revenue growth and better competitive positioning.\n\nSalesforce's potential acquisition of Informatica signals a significant move\nto bolster its data capabilities, reflecting an ongoing consolidation trend in\nthe software industry. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the\npotential Salesforce-Informatica acquisition Friday, April 12. Informatica's\nmarket cap was more than $11 billion as of Saturday, April 13. Salesforce is\nvalued at about $285 billion.\n\nThis development comes amidst speculation that Thoma Bravo is considering a\npublic offering for Qlik, Talend, and possibly Alation, highlighting a broader\naggregation of similar functionalities within the tech landscape. The reported\nprice, below Informatica's current share value of $38.48, underscores the\nstrategic maneuvering underway.\n\nInformatica, which offers AI-powered cloud data management, boasts a clientele\nof 5,000 customers and recent advancements in artificial intelligence tools.\nThat presents an enticing opportunity for Salesforce. If the deal\nmaterializes, it will mark one of Salesforce's largest acquisitions since its\n$28 billion purchase of Slack Technologies in 2021, amplifying its competitive\nedge in data and analytics domain. As the industry continues to evolve, such\nstrategic moves are poised to reshape the landscape, setting the stage for\nheightened innovation and market consolidation.\n\nRelated Article: Will Alphabet Acquire HubSpot?\n\n## Informatica Experience: Data Portfolio Strength\n\nIn full transparency, this author joined Informatica in 2014 during a period\nof steady 9% annual growth, surrounded by a cadre of exceptionally talented\nindividuals. Our industry-leading data portfolio positioned us well, but like\nmany legacy software vendors; our Achilles' heel was our lack of an integrated\ncloud portfolio.\n\nAdmittedly, the industry-wide shift toward cloud computing posed a significant\nchallenge for many organizations, especially considering the changing\npurchasing models. The transition to private equity, albeit resulting in some\npersonnel changes including me, ultimately facilitated Informatica\u2019s\ntransformation to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery model, aligning\nInformatica with modern industry standards.\n\n> Salesforce will then become a data company... No longer a CRM company, it\n> will become a data management company if they acquire Informatica.\n>\n> Data needs governance, data needs to be clean, data needs to be accurate,\n> data needs to be available, and today's data is everywhere....\n> https://t.co/afTuDAwj0x\n>\n> \u2014 Jes\u00fas Hoyos #cx2advisory #martech #crm (@jesus_hoyos) April 13, 2024\n\n## What Would Salesforce Get With Informatica?\n\nIn acquiring Informatica, Salesforce would gain a strategic pathway to enrich\nits generative AI systems, fueling Einstein with robust APIs and advanced data\nintegration capabilities. This portion of the integration will merge existing\nMulesoft infrastructure, bridging the gap between business and data\nintegration realms. Salesforce acquired Mulesoft in 2018 for $6.5 billion.\n\nHowever, to be fair, Mulesoft has been more about system integration,\nElectronic Data Interchange (EDI) replacement and less about data integration.\n\nPredrag (PJ) Jakovljevic, principal industry analyst for Technology Evaluation\nCenters, told CMSWire on Saturday, \"MuleSoft is good for APIs and data\ntransfers. Informatica is much more about ETL and data quality for data\nwarehouses and data lakes. Tableau on top for visualizations. But even more,\nthe critical piece for Salesforce\u2019s AI strategy is Data Cloud and metadata\nframework. Informatica would play the role as an ETL for Databricks,\nSnowflake, etc. That Data Cloud normalizes data so that marketers, CX agents,\nsales, etc. all look at the same data but relevant for them.\"\n\nThe acquisition also promises a more comprehensive data catalog than what's\ncurrently native to Tableau (another Salesforce acquisition), empowering users\nwith enhanced data discovery, quality assurance and observability tools.\nMoreover, Informatica brings to the table vital components like master data\nmanagement, 360-degree customer insights, data governance, privacy features\nand the potential for a data marketplace, fortifying Salesforce's data-centric\nofferings.\n\n## Learning Opportunities\n\nWebinar\n\nApr\n\n18\n\nRedefining Social CX: Drive Growth and Foster Loyalty at Every Touchpoint\n\nTransform social interactions into a competitive edge.

Additionally, the synergy between Einstein Copilot for Tableau and\nSalesforce's CRM platform holds promise for streamlined data analysis and\nmanagement, potentially resolving data quality issues and facilitating native\nintegrations.\n\nRelated Article: The Salesforce Data Fiasco: Some Public Sites Exposing\nSensitive Information\n\nIn acquiring Informatica, Salesforce would gain a strategic pathway to enrich\nits generative AI systems, fueling Einstein with robust APIs and advanced data\nintegration capabilities.JHVEPhoto\n\n## Salesforce's Move to Master Data Integration\n\nUltimately, Salesforce's strategic move positions it to offer comprehensive,\nend-to-end data solutions, addressing the critical need for consistent\ncustomer data and empowering organizations to make faster, more informed\ndecisions.\n\nHoward Dresner, the founder and chief research officer for Dresner Advisory\nServices, said, \u201cwhile I understand the business rationale for this move\nincluding bringing accretive revenue to the bottom line, these kinds of moves\nare highly disruptive for customers and employees. Without question,\nInformatica is a prize to be acquired because they are the best at what they\ndo with one of the strongest portfolios in the business.\"\n\nDresner said he anticipates further mergers and acquisitions in the upcoming\nyear, largely driven by economic conditions rather than Salesforce's actions.\nTo fully capitalize on this, Salesforce and Tableau must integrate their\ncapabilities effectively, thereby improving customer insights and analysis.\n\n## What Does This Mean for CMOs and CX Professionals?\n\nFor CMOs and CX professionals, the acquisition of Informatica by Salesforce\nsignals a potential acceleration in innovation crucial for enhancing customer\nexperiences. By integrating robust data capabilities, leaders gain the agility\nfor self-service analysis, empowering them to make data-driven decisions\nswiftly.\n\nHowever, as highlighted by the authors of Future Ready, achieving\nindustrialized data and optimizing customer experience are paramount,\ncorrelating with significantly higher revenue growth and net margins.\nNeglecting data industrialization risks escalating costs and exacerbating\nfragmentation, ultimately compromising service quality.\n\nTherefore, smart marketing and CX leaders prioritize industrialization efforts\nto mitigate these risks and maintain competitiveness against rivals like\nAdobe. By harnessing Salesforce's consolidated offerings effectively,\norganizations can maximize business value and elevate customer satisfaction,\nunderscoring the significance of this development for CMOs and CX leaders\nalike. Put simply, the competitive advantage for CMOs and marketing leaders is\nto industrialize and eliminate the tech debt that has limited exceptional\ncustomer experience. Getting this right will therefore offer significant\nbusiness value.\n\n## Parting Thoughts on Potential Salesforce-Informatica Deal\n\nThe pending acquisition of Informatica by Salesforce marks a strategic move to\nbolster data capabilities and streamline data integration within the tech\nlandscape. This consolidation not only promises to accelerate innovation for\nCMOs and CX professionals, enabling swift decision-making and enhanced\ncustomer experiences, but also underscores the critical need for\nindustrialized data.\n\nAs highlighted by industry experts, organizations that prioritize data\nindustrialization alongside customer experience optimization stand to achieve\nsubstantially higher revenue growth and net margins. By leveraging\nSalesforce's comprehensive offerings effectively, companies can mitigate\nrisks, reduce costs and ultimately drive business value, positioning\nthemselves competitively in the ever-evolving market for customer experience\nsolutions.\n\n## About the Author\n\nMyles Suer is the leading influencer of CIOs, according to Leadtail.
