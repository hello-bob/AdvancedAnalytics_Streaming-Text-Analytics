Kathy Hochul speaks about cracking down on unlicensed cannabis shops,\nJune 22, 2023. Credit: Don Pollard/Office of Governor Kathy Hochul\n\nLast June, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that a much anticipated deal had\nfinally been reached to fund a $200 million public-private fund that would\nfinance cannabis dispensaries run by the people who have been the most\nimpacted by the war on drugs.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement reinforces New York\u2019s commitment to building\npartnerships that benefit New Yorkers and setting right the wrongs of the\npast,\u201d Hochul said at the time.\n\nBut an investigation by THE CITY \u2014 based on a cache of documents including a\nnear-final, 84-page draft of the agreement, internal agency emails and\nfinancial projections \u2014 reveals that New York state instead signed off on a\nlopsided deal that undermines its commitment to social equity goals while\nguaranteeing substantial returns to its partner, private equity firm Chicago\nAtlantic Group.\n\nThe state\u2019s own Office of Cannabis Management later questioned whether the\nfund had overstated the potential revenue and profit potential, internal\ndocuments from the agency revealed.\n\nState officials reached the agreement after they failed to attract a private\nequity partner to invest in the fund as planned. Instead, Chicago Atlantic\nwill loan the fund $50 million at a 15% interest rate, all of it guaranteed by\nthe state should retailers default, the terms reviewed by THE CITY reveal. The\nloan is further secured by the leases of the dispensaries as well as a $10\nmillion pool of cash that the state is responsible for replenishing and which\nChicago Atlantic can draw from in the case of late payments.\n\nThe location of a state-licensed cannabis dispensary on Steinway Street in\nAstoria failed to open, April 15, 2024. Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\n\u201cThe state is taking on all of the risk,\u201d said Rachael Fauss, a senior policy\nadvisor with Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group. \u201cThe private entity\nhere is the one benefiting the most, though the goal of public policy is to\nbenefit the state and to benefit the dispensary owners.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to detailed questions about the decision\nto approve the deal with Chicago Atlantic and the specifics of the agreement\nthat guarantee the investment firm\u2019s return on its loan.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hochul is committed to strengthening New York\u2019s legal cannabis\nmarket, protecting operators and consumers while supporting new entrepreneurs\nin this sector. The Office of Cannabis Management and DASNY [Dormitory\nAuthority of the State of New York] will continue their efforts to set up the\nnation\u2019s most equitable adult-use cannabis market,\u201d said John Lindsey, a\nspokesperson for Hochul, in a statement.\n\nTHE CITY reviewed the terms of the agreement with a dozen lawyers and\nconsultants with expertise in private lending and the cannabis industry,\nnearly all of them agreed that the terms of the deal were poor for the state\nand the licensees that some even likened the agreement to the junk bonds of\nthe 1980s or distressed debt lending. The difference, however, is that those\nloans were not also guaranteed with taxpayer dollars.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no wiggle room for the borrower,\u201d said Neil Kaufman, a cannabis and\nsecurities lawyer based in Long Island. \u201cIt\u2019s tightly structured to protect\nthe investor on the downside \u2014 which is exactly what you would expect for this\ntype of speculative lending,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bears a lot of resemblance to\ndistressed debt lending.\u201d\n\nBoth Chicago Atlantic and the New York Social Equity Cannabis Investment Fund\ndisputed this characterization in statements provided to THE CITY.\n\n\u201cThe interest rates offered by the Fund are far below the rates typically\navailable to start-ups, let alone start-ups in the cannabis industry,\u201d said a\nstatement from the social equity fund, describing the loans as offering\n\u201cborrower-friendly terms that are virtually unheard of in the private debt\nmarket.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe terms are not akin to distressed debt or junk bonds, but standard in\ncommercial lending. These terms compare well to the non-cannabis lending\nmarket for start-up businesses and are, to the best of our knowledge,\nunmatched in the market for cannabis debt financing,\u201d said Alise Edgcomb, the\nmanaging director of public relations for Chicago Atlantic in a statement.\n\nThe correspondence reviewed by THE CITY reflects concerns over financial\nprojections shown to licensees considering taking a loan from the fund that\nincluded extremely optimistic projections about how much their stores would\nearn. Previously, THE CITY revealed how licensees who accept loans from the\nsocial equity fund are burdened with high construction costs that they don\u2019t\ncontrol and with interest rates that exceed the state\u2019s initial estimates.\n\n\u201cEveryone is worried about defaulting because of the rules and regulations of\nthis loan,\u201d said Roland Conner, a Queens native who runs the legal cannabis\ndispensary Smacked on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village who previously has\nbeen supportive of the state program.\n\n## Sign up for THE SCOOP!\n\nGet the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to your inbox each morning.\nCancel anytime.\n\nA papered-over storefront of a one-time women\u2019s health club on Steinway Street\nin Astoria, Queens, is visible evidence of the troubled rollout. The expansive\nspace was leased by the fund from a landlord, built out by an approved\ncontractor at a price of $1.6 million dollars, and offered to a retail\nlicensee, Keith Dalessio, who owns a pet store down the block. Dalessio ran\nthe numbers, decided the loan didn\u2019t come close to adding up, and, after some\nagonizing, walked away.\n\nAstoria pet shop owner Keith Dalessio says he decided against opening a state-\nsanctioned cannabis dispensary because the costs were too high, April 19,\n2024. Credit: Alex Krales/THE CITY\n\nTwo years after signing the lease, the fund hasn\u2019t attracted another licensee\nto the location. The build out costs and monthly rent have already cost it at\nleast $2 million and continue to climb.\n\n## High Hopes\n\nThe $200 million public-private social equity fund was touted by Hochul as the\ncannabis program kicked off. She allocated $50 million for the fund in her\n2022 budget proposal, and signed legislation that specified the fund would\nfinance the construction costs of dispensaries for retail licensees who had\nbeen most affected by the war on drugs.\n\nThe legislation charged the state\u2019s Dormitory Authority, which finances public\nconstruction projects like hospitals and dorms, with finding private fund\nmanagers for what was named the New York Social Equity Cannabis Investment\nFund. The Dormitory Authority was tasked with working with the fund to\nidentify retail locations and supervise the construction of the dispensaries.\nA newly-established Office of Cannabis Management, in charge of licensing and\nregulation, would work with the Dormitory Authority and the social equity fund\nto support the launch of the dispensaries.\n\nThe state aimed to match licensees with ready-to-open dispensaries, built out\nand designed by state contractors using financing from the social equity\ninvestment fund. The fund would in turn offer loans to the licensees that they\ncould pay back over 10 years to cover the related costs.\n\nFrom its conception, sources told THE CITY they had warned state officials\nthat the premise of the social equity fund was flawed. Cannabis is a risky\ninvestment. Since the industry is federally illegal, business owners are\nbarred from deducting their expenses when filing taxes. That drives up costs\nand eats away at profit margins. Access to capital for any cannabis venture is\ndifficult to obtain, let alone for a class of licensees most impacted by the\nstate\u2019s drug laws launching start-up businesses in a new market.\n\n\u201cThe original plan of the social equity fund was just uninvestable. No one was\ngoing to give them any money,\u201d said Kaufman, the cannabis and securities\nlawyer. \u201cI told them from the beginning it was a bad idea.\u201d\n\nThe fund forged ahead anyway.\n\nIn May 2022, the Dormitory Authority chose a company led by the former New\nYork City comptroller William Thompson; Lavetta Willis, a former sneaker\nentrepreneur; and the former NBA star Chris Webber to run the cannabis\ninvestment fund. It was set up as a private company, with the state Dormitory\nAuthority as a minority partner.\n\nThe state estimated that fund managers would be able to attract $150 million\nin private capital by the end of that summer. The deadline came and went. In\nSeptember, Reuben McDaniel, the president of the Dormitory Authority, remained\noptimistic that the fund would open as many as 20 stores by the end of the\nyear, he told the board. That didn\u2019t happen either.\n\nIn January 2023, the first fund-supported dispensary, Smacked, opened a\ntemporary pop-up dispensary on Bleecker Street to begin generating sales. Run\nby Conner, who had been busted for selling weed as a teen, Smacked became a\nsymbol of the hopes attached to the social equity plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to open a business with my son and wife at\nmy side and build generational wealth, working together, right here in New\nYork,\u201d Conner said in a statement at the time.\n\nRoland Conner commemorated the opening of the city\u2019s second state-licensed\ncannabis store on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, Jan. 23, 2023. Credit:\nBen Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\nBut a year after Hochul announced the fund, it still had not secured a private\npartner, despite McDaniel and the fund\u2019s efforts. Through a public records\nrequest, THE CITY obtained a copy of five months of McDaniel\u2019s calendar\nbeginning in January 2023 which delineate months of daily meetings with the\nsocial equity fund managers.\n\nBeginning last January, McDaniel and Willis met with four possible partners\nbefore sitting down with Chicago Atlantic Group. By March, the pace of\nmeetings between McDaniel, Willis and Peter Sack, a fund manager at Chicago\nAtlantic, began to accelerate.\n\n## \u2018You Guys Are Robbing Me\u2019\n\nIn January 2023, the fund held a three day information session with the\nlicensees about what to expect and the Dormitory Authority posted frequently\nasked questions about the fund. Officials told them at the time that interest\nrates would likely be 10% and the loans to cover the design, construction and\nfees would range from $800,000 to $1.1 million, according to a report of the\nmeeting.\n\nDalessio, from Astoria, was among the first people to be awarded a retail\nlicense designated for people impacted by past drug convictions. In January,\nhe was elated when he learned that he had been chosen to operate one of the\nfund\u2019s first sites on Steinway Street.\n\nBut in March, he learned the estimated cost of the build out for the 4,500\nsquare foot retail space was $1.6 million, an invoice shows \u2014 much higher than\nstate officials originally projected.\n\n\u201cI told them they were out of their minds,\u201d Dalessio told THE CITY in an\ninterview, recalling his reaction when he saw the invoice. \u201cI know you guys\nare robbing me.\u201d\n\nNegotiations were still ongoing between the social equity fund and Chicago\nAtlantic to secure the rest of the financing. Until the deal was complete, the\nfund didn\u2019t know what terms they could offer Dalessio and other the licensees\non their own loans.\n\nThe fund chose Grow American Builders to construct Dalessio\u2019s Steinway Street\nlocation, one of the 10 firms the Dormitory Authority chose after posting a\nrequest for proposals to design and build out the fund-supported dispensaries.\n\nThe authority\u2019s request differed from a typical state project bidding process\nwhere contractors are awarded a contract for government work based on a\nproposal and estimated costs. Instead, the state did not seek specifics from\nthe firms of how much a dispensary build out might cost \u2014 they only had to\nshow the financial viability of their companies. The fund decided how to\nallocate the firms to each dispensary site based on their locations.\n\nSmack LLC on Bleecker Street was the city\u2019s second state-sanctioned cannabis\nstore to open, Jan. 23, 2022. Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\nAfter the build out of the Steinway Street site was done, Dalessio learned\nthat Grow America Builders had subcontracted the work to a local company. He\nwas shocked to learn of the cost difference between the two jobs. The\nsubcontractor shared a project proposal with him which THE CITY reviewed\nshowing the costs of the work came to about $250,000 \u2014 less than a sixth of\nwhat Grow America Builders planned to charge Dalessio.\n\nThe build out itself is not the only cost that makes up the loan. According to\na breakdown of a loan dated March 2024 and obtained by THE CITY of another\ndispensary site, the construction and design costs came to about $1.7 million\nbut with additional fees and other expenses, the total loan came to $2.1\nmillion \u2014 about double the high end of the range that the Dormitory Authority\nand the fund had told licensees to expect back in January 2023.\n\nWhen reached by phone, the local subcontractor of the Astoria dispensary\nconfirmed he completed work at the location but said he could not discuss\nspecifics.\n\nDavid Fettner, one of the owners of Grow America Builders, told THE CITY that\nhe had signed a nondisclosure agreement and could not discuss the costs of the\nbuild out.\n\n## \u2018Fantasy Projections\u2019\n\nAs the Dormitory Authority and the social equity fund continued their meetings\nin 2023 with Chicago Atlantic to hammer out an agreement, the fund also\nstarted to share with the licensees revenue projections that had been\ndeveloped by Sean Kennedy of Palomino Consulting.\n\nTHE CITY reviewed copies of the financial projections for multiple Manhattan\ndispensary sites that were shown to licensees, including Smacked on Bleecker\nStreet. Each of them showed identical sales revenue, predicting about $13\nmillion for the first year, rising steadily to nearly $30 million in year\nfour. When the cost of the monthly loan, rent and other expenses were\nconsidered against those sales projections, the models showed that the stores\nwould post huge profits from year one.\n\nThe Palomino figures were beyond ambitious. A dispensary making nearly $30\nmillion in a year would place it among the country\u2019s top performing cannabis\nstores. The projections showed revenues climbing every year without factoring\nin how the market might develop over time, amid developments like increased\ncompetition that could depress prices.\n\nWilliam Thompson, Lavetta Willis and Chris Webber attend the pre-opening press\nconference for a \u201csocial equity\u201d cannabis shop on Bleecker Street, Jan. 23,\n2023. Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\nThe city\u2019s Independent Budget Office, by comparison, predicted the average\nlegal dispensary in New York City will make about $8 million in sales\nannually, according to a report last August.\n\nIn an interview, Kennedy, who runs Palomino Consulting, told THE CITY that the\nfigures were based on data from his own cannabis business in Nevada. When\nasked if his stores made $30 million, Kennedy said that he was party to a non-\ndisclosure agreement and couldn\u2019t discuss it. And when pressed on how the\nnumbers were generated for New York dispensaries, Kennedy said that it\nrepresented the top end of the range of what a store could make and some would\nfall below that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a general model. It\u2019s more of a way to analyze risks so that you can\nmake money,\u201d said Kennedy, who denied that the estimates of sales revenues on\nthe documents offered any sort of projections.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, we don\u2019t know what numbers the stores will do,\u201d Kennedy said,\nnoting that there are a lot of different variables that impact revenues. \u201cYou\ncan try and model them but I think what we\u2019re trying to do is create something\nthat\u2019s easily understood.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to THE CITY, the New York Social Equity Cannabis Investment\nFund echoed this, describing the document Kennedy produced as a \u201cgeneral\nframework and a teaching tool, not meant to predict any individual store\u2019s\nactual performance.\u201d\n\nThe statement added \u201cit assumed a scalable retail revenue range based on\nexperience in other limited license markets.\u201d\n\nMentors advising hopeful licensees grew concerned when licensees shared the\nprojections with them and alerted the Office of Cannabis Management, emails\nobtained by THE CITY show. The projections set off alarm bells inside the\nagency, according to records and interviews with current and former agency\nemployees.\n\n\u201cThe Fund is materially overstating the potential revenue and profitability\npotential of the Fund\u2019s flagship locations,\u201d an internal OCM assessment of the\nsocial equity fund\u2019s projections asserts.\n\nThe internal document pointed out that only 20 to 30 stores nationally pull in\n$30 million in annual sales. Smacked, the first fund-supported dispensary, was\non track to make $5 million in 2023, and two other fund-supported\ndispensaries, Dazed, in Manhattan, and William Jane, in Ithaca, were on track\nfor less than $5 million in sales.\n\nThe Office of Cannabis Management was concerned that by using the Palomino\nfigures store owners would take on the expensive build outs and high monthly\nrents and be unwittingly headed to defaults, the document said.\n\nAnd that, the document stated, could leave the state in a position where it\nhad \u201cto backstop potential losses on the loan, bail out licensees in locations\nthat are extremely difficult to run profitably, or assume payments for vacant\nproperties from which licensees have been removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it looks like is that the fund baited people into believing a fantasy,\u201d\nsaid David Feder, a cannabis lawyer in New York.\n\n## Looking Under the Hood\n\nA year and a half after Hochul first announced the social equity fund,\nlicensees began to lose patience. In May 2023, some of them sent a grievance\nletter to state officials expressing their frustration with the lack of\ninformation available about the loan terms, the high quotes for the build out\ncosts and the pricey rents at the only options for locations.\n\nAt the end of that month, officials of the Dormitory Authority and the social\nequity fund reached a tentative deal that would allow Chicago Atlantic to come\nin through a loan agreement rather than as an equity partner.\n\n\u201cThe state was desperate, they took the deal that they could get,\u201d said\nJeffrey Hoffman, a cannabis lawyer who represents licensees with fund-\nsupported sites. He added that a deal was still better than no deal,\nespecially for licensees with so few or even no other financing options.\n\nThe details of the agreement remained secret until now, with the state, the\nDormitory Authority, and the Office of Cannabis Management declining Freedom\nof Information Law requests from THE CITY. The state even denied to THE CITY\nthat it had a copy of the agreement. It also said the information law did not\napply because the fund \u2014 which was founded by the state and counts the\nDormitory Authority as a minority partner \u2014 is not a public entity.\n\nThe state comptroller\u2019s office, which oversees contracts and state spending\nand has the authority to review the fund\u2019s books, said it had never reviewed\nany documents related to the deal. Sen. Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester), the chair\nof the Senate cannabis subcommittee, also said that he had never reviewed the\ndocuments and was not made aware of the terms.\n\n\u201cAs with every step in our state\u2019s cannabis rollout, our applicants deserve\ntransparency,\u201d Cooney said in a statement to THE CITY.\n\nAccording to the draft document obtained by THE CITY, the agreement outlined a\nstrict repayment schedule \u2014 payments more than five days late could trigger a\ndefault. Notably, the agreement requires that the fund create a $10-million\nreserve fund that Chicago Atlantic may draw from to cover any late payments.\n\nA two-page draft addendum to the loan agreement titled \u201cRe: Funding of Payment\nReserve\u201d signed by McDaniel and Thompson outlines that the payment reserve\nwill be replenished by the Dormitory Authority and or other sources such as\nthe Division of the Budget.\n\nThen, along with the state guarantee on Chicago Atlantic\u2019s $50 million, and\nits 15% interest rate, came the provision further securing its loans through\nthe dispensary leases themselves. Since it\u2019s difficult to find locations that\nmeet the state regulations for cannabis dispensary locations, industry experts\nsaid, there is a particular bonus to Chicago Atlantic in having the right to\nforeclose on those sites.\n\nFinally, the firm committed $100 million to develop properties and lease them\nto the fund, Peter Sack, a partner of Chicago Atlantic, said in an interview\nwith THE CITY. Just like the current leases the fund is signing, a license\nholder will be a tenant and then reimburse the fund for the cost of the\nimprovements over time. He added the firm has not yet begun this part of the\nfinancing deal.\n\nAll together, the terms of the agreement add up to a particularly good deal\nfor Chicago Atlantic, according to people who reviewed the documents for THE\nCITY.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a handout to private equity,\u201d said Eli Northrup, a lawyer for the Bronx\nDefenders and Director of The Bronx Cannabis Hub, which advises people\napplying for licenses. He is running for office for a State Assembly district\nin Manhattan.\n\n\u201cThe state essentially wrote a blank check to a firm that will profit off of\npeople who were previously exploited and who were already struggling.\u201d\n\nAlthough the leases are part of the collateral for the loan, Chicago Atlantic\ndenied that it had any intention of entering the New York market and said it\u2019s\ninvested in the success of the licensees.\n\nWhen officials from the Office of Cannabis Management reviewed a draft of the\nloan agreement in early June, they raised concerns about how heavily the deal\nfavored Chicago Atlantic, according to internal emails. The terms of the loan\nalong with the inflated financial projections only increased their concerns of\nlicensees defaulting.\n\nSo far, the social equity fund has signed 24 leases \u2014 far short of the 150\nthat the state anticipated when the fund was announced. So far, eleven have\nopened.\n\nThe financial pressures of the loans are already starting to mount, according\nto interviews with the dispensary owners of the fund-supported stores.\nMultiple operators, including Conner, told THE CITY that they were concerned\nabout defaulting on their loans with the fund.\n\nIn February, Dalessio finally decided not to accept the Steinway Street\nlocation within hailing distance of his pet shop. After a year of back and\nforth with the fund, he backed away from the deal, the terms of the loan and\nhigh building costs looming large.\n\n\u201cIt just left such a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d he said, referring to the fund\u2019s\nloan program. \u201cI warned everyone I could to stay away from this deal.\u201d\n\n### Related Headlines\n\nTHE CITY is an independent nonprofit newsroom dedicated to serving the people\nof New York.\n\nQuestions? info@thecity.nyc\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS Feed\n\n### ABOUT\n\n### TEAM\n\n### FUNDERS\n\n### ETHICS\n\n### DIVERSITY\n\n### DONATE\n\n### CONTACT\n\n### REPUBLISH\n\n### CAREERS\n\n## Subscribe to THE SCOOP\n\nSign up and get everything you need to know to be an active New Yorker\ndelivered to your inbox each morning.
