Hyzon\u2019s high-performance hydrogen\nfuel cells are tough enough to provide consistent power over 125 miles,\nincluding up to 1,200 cart lifts and trips to the transfer station. Combine\nthat with the strength and durability of New Way\u2019s most-requested automated\nside loader \u2013 the Sidewinder XTRTM -- with smooth arm operation, up to a\n12-foot reach and large 6-cubic-yard hopper for an unstoppable, sustainable\nrefuse collection powerhouse. Another feature in the booth is a 200kw fuel\ncell display, along with an animation that showcases how hydrogen fuel cell\ntechnology works and a fact sheet on the New Way and Hyzon Fuel Cell Electric\nVehicle (FCEV) and vehicle specifications.\n\nBoth New Way and Hyzon look forward to further technology and performance\ndevelopment with the Class 8 FCEV as more information is gathered during\ncustomer demonstrations occurring throughout the rest of 2024. After Waste\nExpo, the truck will test on routes in California starting with Recology, the\nSan Francisco-based hauler. Recology is an employee-owned solid waste and\nrecycling collection and processing company with a commitment to sustainable\noperations at its core.\n\nRecology has long shown its commitment to sustainable transportation \u2014 the\ncompany recently achieved its goal to power its fleet with more than 90\npercent renewable or alternative fuels \u2014 and now sees the demo of this first-\nof-its-kind hydrogen-powered truck as an opportunity to be on the forefront of\nhelping decarbonize the industry.\n\n\u201cAs a leader in fleet sustainability, we're proud to partner with New Way and\nHyzon to bring the first hydrogen fuel cell electric collection vehicle to\ntest in our communities in California,\u201d said Recology CEO Sal Coniglio.\n\u201cRecology has been preparing to transition our fleet to zero emission vehicles\nfor nearly six years, and we've yet to see a hydrogen fuel cell powered refuse\ntruck on the market during that time. This development is a major milestone,\nand we're thrilled to be the first to demo this technology to help move our\nbusiness and the industry forward.\u201d\n\nAbout Hyzon\n\nHyzon is a global supplier of high-performance hydrogen fuel cell technology\nfocused on providing zero-emission power to decarbonize demanding industries.\nWith agile, high-power technology designed for heavy-duty applications, Hyzon\nis at the center of a new industrial revolution fueled by hydrogen, an\nabundant and clean energy source.
