But with the exception of Tesla\u2019s Supercharger, that\nisn\u2019t true. They\u2019re actually quite simple \u2014 basically just glorified switches.\nAll of the nitty gritty charging details are the responsibility of the car\u2019s\nonboard circuitry. With that in mind, EV owners may want to follow Pedro\nNeves\u2019 guide on building an affordable Arduino-based charging station.\n\nBecause the car deals with all of the particulars of charging, the only\npurpose of the \u201ccharger\u201d is to provide a connection to the electrical grid.\n\u201cCharger\u201d isn\u2019t even the right word, as this is more accurately EVSE (electric\nvehicle supply equipment). For safety reasons, the car and the EVSE\ncommunicate with each other. The car can tell the EVSE when it is safe to\nprovide power and the EVSE will then connect a switch between the charging\nplug and the electrical grid. It really isn\u2019t any more complex than a $15\nsmart outlet and most of the cost of an EVSE is the heavy-gauge wiring.\n\nHere, Neves proves that with a DIY EVSE designed around an Arduino UNO Rev3\nboard. It has a custom shield with relays for switching power and to power the\nArduino itself with mains voltage. A few LEDs act as status indicators. EVSE\nprotocols are standardized, so Neves was able to program the Arduino to\ncommunicate with any connected car. Once the Arduino receives permission from\nthe car, it switches the relays to provide mains voltage. A heavy-duty\n3D-printed enclosure contains those components, with a breaker switch and\nweatherproofing.\n\nBoards:Uno\n\nCategories:Arduino\n\nBack to top\n\nTrademark\n\nContact Us\n\nDistributors\n\nCareers\n\nHelp Center\n\nWhistleblowing\n\n#### Newsletter\n\nPlease insert a valid email\n\n#### FOLLOW US\n\nTrademark\n\nContact Us\n\nDistributors\n\nCareers\n\nHelp Center\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nTerms Of Service\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSecurity\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arduino\n\nTerms Of Service\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSecurity\n\nCookie Settings\n\nHelp\n\n## Title\n\n## Arduino Newsletter\n\nWe care about the privacy and personal data of our users.
