Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# German government wants games like Baldur's Gate 3 to 'also go on to be\ndeveloped in Germany'\n\nNews\n\nBy Tyler Wilde\n\npublished yesterday\n\nGermany started giving out federal grants in 2020 to \"achieve international\ncompetitiveness\" in game development.\n\nLarian CEO Swen Vincke in 2023, with an armful of Golden Joystick Awards.\n(Image credit: Michael Douse)\n\nLast year, we were slightly surprised to learn that not only does the German\ngovernment sponsor a videogame award ceremony, it gives serious cash prizes to\nmost of the winners. At the 2023 German Computer Game Awards\u2014aka the Deutscher\nComputerspielpreis (DCP)\u2014retro RPG Chained Echoes won Best German Game and a\n\u20ac100,000 endowment, and at this year's ceremony on April 18, the same honor\nand cash prize went to Everspace 2 and Hamburg-based developer Rockfish Games.\n\nOne award that doesn't come with a cash prize is Best International Game,\nwhich\u2014surprise surprise\u2014went to Baldur's Gate 3 and Larian this year. It would\nbe a little weird if the German government wrote Swen Vincke and the Belgian\nstudio a check just to say, hey, loved the RPG, so another trophy for the\ntrophy pile will have to do.\n\nThe point of the cash prizes is of course to support and encourage German game\ndevelopment, and Michael Kellner, Parliamentary State Secretary at Germany's\nFederal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, says he wants to\nensure that German studios produce games like Baldur's Gate 3 in the future.\n(And also do some climate action, I assume.)\n\nThe \"wide range and creativity of games developed in Germany\" demonstrated at\nthis year's German Computer Game Awards \"must be expanded further, and the\npotential of the industry must be utilized even more,\" said Kellner. \"As the\nfederal government, we want to make an important contribution to this through\nour new games funding. The funding is to help ensure that games such as this\nyear's best international game also go on to be developed in Germany.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nThe funding Kellner refers to is a grant program launched by the German\ngovernment in 2020 \"to promote the development of computer and video games in\nGermany in order to achieve international competitiveness.\" The German Games\nIndustry Association noted that Canada, the UK, and France have established\nmore substantial game development industries than Germany with the help of\nsimilar federal funding programs.\n\n\"Once again, we can see the huge potential of Germany as a location for the\ngames industry, especially as this year there were more games made possible by\nfederal funding than ever before,\" said Felix Falk, managing director of the\nGerman Games Industry Association, of this year's awards.\n\nWith his comment about ensuring that \"games such as this year's best\ninternational game also go on to be developed in Germany,\" Kellner clearly\nmeant that he wants to see German games rival Baldur's Gate 3's enormous\nsuccess, but since Larian has decided not to continue making D&D games, maybe\na German studio could literally have a shot at Baldur's Gate 4?
