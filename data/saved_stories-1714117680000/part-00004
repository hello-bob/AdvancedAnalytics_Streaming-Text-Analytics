Canonical Ubuntu Confidential VMs are now generally\navailable on Microsoft Azure\n\n### ijlal-loutfi\n\non 28 July 2022\n\n  * Share on:\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\nTags: confidential computing , confidential VM , Trusted Execution Environment\n, Trusted execution environments\n\nOn behalf of all Canonical teams, I am happy to announce the general\navailability of Ubuntu Confidential VMs (CVMs) on Microsoft Azure! They are\npart of the Microsoft Azure DCasv5/ECasv5 series, and only take a few clicks\nto enable and use. Ubuntu 20.04 is the first and only Linux distribution to\nsupport Confidential VMs on Azure.\n\n## What are Ubuntu CVMs?\n\nUbuntu CVMs use the latest security extensions of the third generation of AMD\nCPUs, Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). As such,\nthey bring about a fundamental shift in the traditional threat model of public\nclouds. Traditionally, any vulnerability within the millions of lines of code\nin the cloud\u2019s privileged system software (OS, hypervisor, firmware) would\nsystematically compromise the confidentiality and integrity of your running\ncode and data. The same could be said for any undue access to your VM and/or\nits platform by a malicious cloud administrator.\n\nUbuntu CVMs are here to give you back control over the security guarantees of\nyour VMs. They do this by allowing you to run your workload within a logically\nisolated hardware-rooted execution environment. Your trusted computing base is\ndramatically reduced to your application and the platform\u2019s underlying\nhardware CPU, and nothing else. In other words, a compromised host OS or an\nangry cloud administrator can no longer access your data nor alter your code\u2019s\nexecution.\n\nPhoto by Fidel Fernando on Unsplash\n\n## How do Ubuntu confidential VMs work?\n\nUbuntu CVMs achieve such strong security guarantees by securing your VMs\nthroughout their entire lifecycle:\n\n1.At run-time Using AMD SEV-SNP, your VM\u2019s code and data are encrypted when\nthey are being operated on in the system memory. The encryption leverages the\nnewest AES-128 hardware encryption engine embedded in the CPU\u2019s memory\ncontroller. The encryption key is further protected and managed by the AMD\nSecure Processor.\n\n2\\. At rest Your entire workload is encrypted using Ubuntu-enhanced full disk\nencryption capabilities. The encryption key is itself stored encrypted in your\nVM\u2019s virtual disk. It\u2019s then bound to the virtual TPM (vTPM) associated with\nyour instance. Finally, the vTPM is itself part of the guest VM address space,\nand enjoys the same run-time security guarantees provided by the AMD SEV-SNP\nextensions to the entire VM instance.\n\n3\\. At boot time Before booting the VM, the platform provides a hardware-\nrooted signed attestation which can be used to verify the OS, firmware and\nplatform boot measurements.\n\n## Part of Canonical\u2019s security commitment\n\nWith Ubuntu CVMs, Canonical continues its strong commitment to security. This\nis yet another reason for which developers, end-users and enterprises across\nthe world continue to choose Ubuntu on all major public clouds. With Azure\nCVM, Ubuntu customers can continue using its extended security maintenance of\n10 years, certified and hardened images and kernel livepatch capabilities,\nwhile enjoying the Ubuntu user experience they have come to love and expect.\n\n## Stay tuned for more news on confidential computing\n\nAzure Confidential VMs only mark the beginning of Ubuntu\u2019s confidential\ncomputing capabilities across various public clouds and compute classes. We\nlook forward to sharing more news about our expanding portfolio and learning\nabout the novel ways you are leveraging confidential computing.\n\n### More resources\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Watch our webinar to learn more about confidential computing\n  * Take a deep dive into how we enabled CVMs on Azure\n  * Start creating and using Ubuntu CVMs on Azure\n\n### Talk to us today\n\nInterested in running Ubuntu in your organisation?\n\n##### Newsletter signup\n\n### Related posts\n\n#### Build the foundation for your zero trust strategy with Ubuntu\nconfidential computing\n\nWhy do we want to eliminate trust?
