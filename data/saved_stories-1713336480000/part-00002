Its website is organized into dozens of categories: WOMEN,\nCURVE, HOME, KIDS, MEN, and BEAUTY, among others, though the women\u2019s clothing\nsection anchors the site. There are hundreds of thousands of products\navailable, and many of them are sorted into SHEIN\u2019s collections. There\u2019s SHEIN\nEZwear, which is solid-color knitwear and sweatpants with cutouts, and SHEIN\nFRENCHY, which means delicate floral prints, lace, and bows. SHEIN Modesty\nshows conservative, long-sleeve dresses worn by Middle Eastern\u2013looking models,\nand SHEIN SXY, which is indistinguishable from SHEIN VCAY and SHEIN ICON,\nfeatures garments so skimpy they\u2019re closer to napkins than clothes. SHEIN\nBelle, the copy at the top of the page tells me, \u201coffers the best dress for\nyour best memory.\u201d It\u2019s incoherent to me at first, but the collection begins\nto make sense as I scroll: it\u2019s clothing for wedding guests and promgoers, who\ncan buy a velvet dress in the collection for $5.49.\n\nIn the SHEIN EZWear collection, I find a crewneck sweater, slightly oversize,\nwith a swirling cotton-candyish pattern of light blues, pinks, and whites laid\nover a lavender base. It\u2019s $22.00, or $21.85 if I\u2019m in the SHEIN Club. The\nfabric looks waffle-knit, thin, slightly fuzzy; it\u2019s 100 percent polyester, or\nplastic. In reviewers\u2019 pictures, I notice the fabric\u2019s wrinkles hold their\nshape where the top has been folded. At the shoulder seams the swirls clash in\ndifferent directions. The neck, waist, and armbands are wide, made from\nseveral inches of striped knit binding, and the shoulders are dropped, giving\nthe garment a childlike, too-big quality.\n\nA few clicks away is a super-short plunging V-neck dress split vertically from\nthe waist to the hem with ruching. Long straps crisscross in a double X on the\nopen back and cinch the waist in the front. The fabric looks like cotton\njersey; it\u2019s 91 percent polyester and 9 percent elastane (100 percent\nplastic). There are five colors available: black and brown, which are both,\napparently, \u201cHOT\u201d; bright pink; royal blue; and emerald green. The photos for\neach variant are identical, except that the dress\u2019s color changes. The model\nis photoshopped into Jessica Rabbit proportions, with a tiny waist, wide hips,\nand enormous breasts, her collarbones jutting out several inches. She is tan\nand hairless, and she is headless. She poses in front of a bedroom set,\ncrumpled white sheets, ivory macram\u00e9 pillowcases, and drawings of flowers\nframed in gold. We see her as she sees herself in the mirror, angled to get a\nlook at her whole outfit. She wears white sneakers, a miniature pink handbag,\nand a gold necklace with a tiny red cherry charm. Below, under Customers Also\nViewed, a sea of identical headless models in black dresses reads like a\nCAPTCHA image.\n\nI began to fall in love with clothes in 2005, when I was 8. I wanted to wear\nbright colors and bold patterns that could make people smile or be drawn to my\notherwise shy self. I was learning, rapidly, that clothing could do the work\nof personality. I went shopping with my mom at stores like the Gap and Banana\nRepublic, but their offerings were stoic and muted. Zara, which opened its\nfirst LA store that year, was different: its enormous glass windows were full\nof trendy, fun pieces and teenage looks I dreamed of wearing.\n\nWhen the Swedish brand H&M opened its first LA store the next year, I was\nprimed for it. Here were the brilliant Zara clothes at child-allowance prices.\nI could take a $20 bill and come back from the mall beaming with a new outfit.\nI never thought about why the clothes were so cheap. I just loved that they\ncould be mine.\n\nAnd then I started to read more about clothes. I was enthralled by Style\nRookie, Tavi Gevinson\u2019s fashion blog. Tavi was my age and clothing-obsessed:\nher careful outfits were brilliant, multilayered collages of hand-me-downs,\nvintage finds, and even nonapparel objects like guitar straps and children\u2019s\ntoys. I checked her blog daily, hoping for a new after-school dispatch of her\nOutfit of the Day, an ensemble I often took inspiration from when getting\ndressed the following morning. Style Rookie linked me to other blogs, and\nthose blogs linked me to even more blogs: an ecosystem of fashion-loving young\nwomen, all posting elaborate, outlandish outfits. The fashion bloggers taught\nme about designers and runway collections, both contemporary and historical. I\nlearned about styling, and the many, many ways a single piece can be reworn\nand recombined. I learned about thrifting and the endless bounty of Goodwill\nbins. There was a history and context to the clothes I liked \u2014 movies, books,\nand even political movements were references for different shapes and\ntextiles. My favorite bloggers didn\u2019t wear things you could buy off the rack.\nTheir looks were wholly one of a kind, and I wanted to wear one-of-a-kind\nthings, too.\n\n> It was time-consuming, I learned, to make something, and much more time-\n> consuming to make something well.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nIn an attempt to wear clothes like those I\u2019d seen on niche blogs, and with the\nhelp of even more niche blogs, I learned to sew. I coveted things I couldn\u2019t\nafford \u2014 designer pieces I\u2019d learned about on the blogs and rare 1960s vintage\ndresses with frilly hems \u2014 so I constructed analogues. I bought bolts of\nfabric for a few dollars a yard and started paying attention to materials in\nnew ways: natural fabrics like linens and cottons were soft and durable;\npolyesters felt itchy and made me sweat. Thick fibers made resilient garments\nand thin ones lost their shape after a few cycles in the wash. Small details\nlike proper stitch tension and enclosed seams made pieces look cleaner and\nfeel more comfortable to wear. It was time-consuming, I learned, to make\nsomething, and much more time-consuming to make something well.\n\nBy the early 2010s, the phrase fast fashion had been in circulation for a\ncouple of decades but had yet to acquire a widespread pejorative connotation.\nThough the 1990s saw the rise of a robust anti-sweatshop movement, the public\nconsensus a few decades later was that fast-fashion stores were a different\nkind of retail experience, but not necessarily an evil one. H&M and Target\nwere producing highly coveted designer collaborations with Alexander McQueen,\nRodarte, and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Cheap clothing chains were\nexploding all over the country. News articles about the industry\u2019s growth were\npositive, or at least neutral: accessible, stylish clothes were seen as a\ncommon good. The rare hesitations \u2014 like a 2008 New York Times article that\nconsidered \u201ca feeling of unease at how the ultra-cheap clothes can be\nmanufactured\u201d \u2014 were afforded significantly less space.\n\nThe sewing bloggers, however, were already voicing their concerns. They called\nout the chains who ripped off styles by independent designers to a comically\nexact degree (clothing isn\u2019t copyrightable under current laws, so the chains\ngot away with it) and cited Overdressed, a 2012 Fast Food Nation\u2013style expos\u00e9\nabout the fast-fashion industry that brought the horrors of speedy garment\nproduction to light. I learned that any new clothing I could ever afford would\nbe far from a fair price for all the skill and labor involved in its creation.\nGarment workers were toiling in bleak conditions, working sixteen-hour days,\nseven days per week for pennies in crumbling factories full of toxic chemicals\nin China, India, and Vietnam; cheaper price tags pointed to worse conditions\nand, unimaginably, even worse pay. I also learned about the environmental\ncosts \u2014 the oil to run the equipment, the factory pollution spewed into the\nair, the energy required to fly and ship garments around the globe, and the\nbillions of pounds of fabric waste destined for landfills, never to decompose.\n\nIn 2013, the Rana Plaza Garment Factory collapsed, killing nearly twelve\nhundred low-wage garment workers. The eight-floor Bangladeshi factory complex\nhad manufactured clothing for Walmart, JCPenney, Primark, and Mango, among\nothers. The collapse was a tragedy, a Triangle Shirtwaist Factory disaster at\neight times the scale \u2014 and a media tipping point. For a while it really felt\nlike the realities of fast-fashion production were reaching the masses. How\ncould anyone read about the deaths of those workers and stomach walking into a\nPrimark again? Wasn\u2019t it clear that the conditions and exploitations at Rana\nPlaza were endemic to the entire fast-fashion industry?\n\nFor years I remained a loyal reader of the blogs. Then the bloggers moved to\nInstagram. The internet was changing, consolidating; social media had become\nthe dominant mode. I followed the bloggers across platforms, but their content\nwas more muted: carousels of photos whose sparse captions offered only an\noccasional glimpse of the charm of the old blogs. Their outfits became harder\nto distinguish from one another as their focus moved toward trending looks and\nstores. The fashion girls I loved were becoming more like advertisers, tagging\nthe brands in their outfits in every post and occasionally doing sponcon.\nInstagram itself became like a shopping mall, adding features that allowed you\nto buy clothes straight from the app. I missed the uniqueness and idiosyncrasy\nof the blogging era. The fashion subcultures I loved became harder and harder\nto see, subsumed by the logic of algorithms.\n\nThen, around 2019, the fashion internet moved to TikTok. I found some of the\nold bloggers there, but most had already disappeared without fanfare, lost\nsomewhere in the shuffle from platform to platform. There were new faces on\nTikTok: younger women more adept at producing videos than their older\ncounterparts. They had ring lights and smooth, cherubic faces seemingly made\nfor the camera. When I joined TikTok in late 2020, the algorithm quickly\ndirected me to them. Every day I opened the app and watched \u201cGet Ready With\nMe\u201d (or GRWM) videos, the contemporary iteration of the bloggers\u2019 Outfit of\nthe Day (OOTD) posts. I watched \u201ccontent creators\u201d review jewelry brands and\nmakeup looks, or pose cheekily on a New York sidewalk for a quick \u201cfit check\u201d\n(always kicking up a heel to show off their shoes). Other fashion girls showed\noff their closets or waxed poetic about their favorite skirt for a couple of\nminutes straight to the camera. All the media I watched about clothes came\nstraight from the app.\n\nTikTok was where I learned about SHEIN. For a while my For You page, which had\naccurately identified my interest in fashion\u2019s more material impacts, served\nme videos of sustainable fashion influencers decrying SHEIN\u2019s wretched labor\nand environmental practices. The textile industry is the second-largest\npolluter in the world, they said, and of all the fast-fashion producers, SHEIN\nis by far the worst offender. SHEIN uses toxic chemicals in their clothing\nproduction; SHEIN mass-produces fabrics like spandex that never decompose (at\nthis point an image would flash across the screen: an overflowing clothing\nlandfill, or a mountain of discarded clothes in the Chilean desert so large it\nis visible from space); SHEIN exploits and endangers its factory workers.\nEmployees earn $556 a month to make five hundred pieces of clothing every day,\nwork eighteen-hour days, and use their lunch breaks to wash their hair \u2014 a\nschedule they repeat seven days per week with only one day off per month. A\nmore nuanced TikToker might point out, briefly, that conditions in SHEIN\nfactories are not necessarily unique, or that focusing on suppliers \u2014 rather\nthan the larger systems of Western consumption and capitalism that create\nthese conditions \u2014 is a fool\u2019s errand, but the platform isn\u2019t built for that\nkind of dialogue. I clicked on the comments and invariably read ones with\nseveral dozen likes saying, \u201cI\u2019m so willing to die in shein clothes.\u201d\n\n> SHEIN was different. One day I\u2019d never heard of the retailer and the next it\n> was inescapable: in thousands of outfit videos, on millions of social media\n> feeds.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nBefore long I was watching SHEIN hauls. There are millions of them \u2014 the tag\n#sheinhaul has been viewed a collective 14.2 billion times on TikTok. In each\nhaul, a woman rips open a plastic bag filled with smaller plastic bags filled\nwith small plastic clothing. Sometimes the woman holds up each garment and\nnarrates its merits, but often the clothes are disembodied, laid flat on a\nfloor or a bed in an accidental stop-motion animation. A stretchy red skirt on\na furry white carpet is replaced by a strapless watercolor bustier with a\ndeep-V neckline. A zebra-print skirt is followed by a matching pink two-piece\nset, with a short-sleeve cardigan and miniskirt constructed from a fabric that\nlooks like bubble wrap. Sometimes a haul is five pieces, and sometimes it is\ntoo many pieces to count. The garments appear and disappear in seconds, edited\nto the beat of a trending song. Rarely do we see the clothing on a body.\n\nUsually brand familiarity accrues in a slow drip, building from obscurity to\ninstant recognizability over the course of months or years as a designer\u2019s\nwork intersects with the zeitgeist and gains traction on social media. SHEIN\nwas different. One day I\u2019d never heard of the retailer and the next it was\ninescapable: in thousands of outfit videos, on millions of social media feeds.\nThe clothes weren\u2019t distinct or cohesive; what united them wasn\u2019t style but\nprice. All those SHEIN hauls entered my feeds with such ubiquity that they\nbegan to feel like they\u2019d always been there. I\u2019d opened a door to a new part\nof the fashion internet: a place where girls bragged about their ultra-fast-\nfashion purchases, delighting in the cheapness of the garments. Here, SHEIN\nwas the obvious choice for new clothes. Why not, when you could buy on-trend\npieces at lightning speed for less than the price of a cup of coffee?\n\nIt was uncanny to bounce between videos: here was a girl showing off her new\nhalter, here was another girl giving a litany of reasons why it was\nunconscionable to buy clothes for so little money. Didn\u2019t these TikTokers hear\none another? But then again, how could they? \u201cThis is what we keep missing\nhere in the whole conversation about sustainability in the industry,\u201d Nick\nAnguelov, a professor of public policy from UMass Dartmouth, said to a Slate\njournalist writing about SHEIN in June. \u201cWe keep failing to understand that\nour customers are kids and they don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d\n\nIn 1963, Amancio Ortega Gaona started a business making housecoats and robes\nin the small Spanish city of A Coru\u00f1a, where he grew up. As a teenager he\ndropped out of school and went to work for a local luxury shirtmaker, where\nover the next fourteen years he learned to make clothes by hand, purchase\nfabrics and other supplies for apparel manufacturing, and interact with\ncustomers. When Ortega set out on his own, he predicted that rather than\ndesigning new clothing styles, a better way to make money was to ascertain\nprecisely what high-end designs people wanted, copy those designs with\ninexpensive materials, and sell them at lower prices.\n\nBy then ready-to-wear brands were already outsourcing manufacturing to\nfactories in Asia, where labor was cheap. At the top of each season, those\nfactories would send large batches of completed orders to stores. It was a way\nto save costs, Ortega knew, but it meant inventory was at the mercy of\nmanufacturers thousands of miles away. Ortega wanted to be nimble \u2014 so he\ndecided to manufacture locally. Labor was more expensive in Spain, but keeping\nthe process nearby meant shorter production lead times, much greater agility,\nand easier communication with factories. Everything was localized: he trucked\nin textiles from Barcelona and organized thousands of women into sewing\ncooperatives to manufacture his wares, keeping control of both supply and\nlabor chains.\n\nWhen in 1975 Ortega opened his first store, he called it Zara. From the start,\nit was an enormous success. Zara designed all its own clothing, placed small\ninventory orders at its local factories, and shipped products to stores within\nfive weeks \u2014 significantly faster than the traditional design-to-retail\ntimeline of six months. Smaller production runs meant that there was little\nleftover stock, but store managers could still place rapid requests for\nproducts that sold well. The managers reported sales data and more amorphous\ninformation like \u201cbuzz\u201d around particular products or other in-store customer\nreactions. Limited stock also created powerful demand: customers learned to\nbuy clothes when they first saw them because they might not be available in a\ncouple of weeks. On the flip side, there\u2019d be a whole new range of limited-\nedition clothes to buy in a few weeks \u2014 encouraging shoppers to quickly return\nto Zara\u2019s stores. Fashion, for the first time, became fast.\n\nZara was a colossal, world-altering success. The retailer\u2019s first\ninternational store opened in Portugal in 1988, followed quickly by stores in\nFrance and New York. By 2011, Zara had stores on every populated continent.\nToday Zara produces 450 million garments a year, generating an annual revenue\nof $35 billion. The twenty thousand garment styles Zara produces every year\ncan move from concept to product-for-purchase in one of the company\u2019s three\nthousand retail stores in as few as fifteen days.\n\nZara arguably set the blueprint for every major fast-fashion brand, which\nplace small, frequent orders of new products instead of ordering in bulk at\nthe top of each season. But unlike Zara, brands such as H&M, Forever 21,\nBoohoo, and ASOS do most of their production in China, Bangladesh, and India,\nwhere labor is wildly cheap and the factories are far from their headquarters.\nTheir production timelines are still speedy \u2014 just a couple of weeks from\ndesign to production \u2014 but those brands are also notorious for sending\npayments to factories and workers late, a practice so common it\u2019s become the\nindustry standard.\n\nThe rise of SHEIN marks a new era in the fast-fashion industry. The company\nproduces garments at a rate incomprehensible to its predecessors, all of which\nwere already producing a world-historical quantity of products at an\nincredible clip. In a recent twelve-month period in which former fast-fashion\ngiants Gap, H&M, and Zara listed twelve to thirty-five thousand new products\non their websites, SHEIN listed 1.3 million. Last year, the company brought in\n$22 billion in revenue, a staggering statistic for a corporation that\u2019s been\naround in its current form for less than a decade.\n\nSHEIN launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China. Its founder, Xu\nYangtian, had no experience in fashion. He was a specialist in search engine\noptimization. SheInside started out selling wedding and evening dresses to US-\nbased and English-speaking shoppers and soon expanded into general womenswear.\nThis early iteration worked much like a drop-shipping business, in that it\ndidn\u2019t actually stock any of the products it sold but acted as an intermediary\nfor local wholesalers. The company selected designs from Guangzhou\u2019s\nShisanhang Garment Wholesale Market, posted images on their website, and then\npurchased goods to meet each order that came in. Those goods were shipped\ndirectly from the wholesaler to the buyer. SheInside made money by charging\ncustomers an inflated price, and the wholesalers made money by reaching a\nlarger audience through SheInside. In 2014, SheInside started to design and\nmanufacture products, and shortly thereafter the company began establishing\nits own supply chain in Guangzhou and later Panyu. It transformed itself from\nan e-commerce website into a clothing brand and, within a year, changed its\nname to SHEIN.\n\nSHEIN spent years cultivating relationships with producers. At first factories\nwere reluctant to take orders from the company \u2014 like Zara, SHEIN wanted to\nplace orders of just one hundred pieces and scale up or down depending on\ndemand for each style, which was risky because it\u2019s more profitable for\nfactories to produce in bulk; typical orders from clothing companies number in\nthe thousands per style. But SHEIN rapidly developed a reputation for paying\nfactories on time, an industry rarity that generated powerful goodwill and a\nwillingness on the part of factories to take the risk. SHEIN quickly developed\nthe high-tech version of Zara\u2019s small-order, quick-response production method,\nin which store managers collect data about sales and customer preferences and\nreport it back to the factories to adjust production runs. The company\u2019s\ncustom-built production software identifies which products are selling well on\nthe SHEIN website and reorders them from manufacturers automatically.\nSimilarly, the software reportedly halts production automatically for any\nproducts selling poorly. It\u2019s a flexible system built for the internet\u2019s\nmicroscopic attention span: all products are tested on SHEIN\u2019s website and app\nin real time. Garments go from concept to finished product in less than two\nweeks, allowing SHEIN to be the first retail company to market on every trend,\neven the most micro ones. The system has proven massively successful.\n\nSHEIN works both with \u201coriginal design manufacturers\u201d that design and produce\nthe clothes on the SHEIN website, and \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers\u201d that\nmake SHEIN-designed clothing under the watchful eye of the brand. By some\nreports the company has close to six thousand factories making its clothes,\nmany of which are centralized in a single geographic area. The company puts an\nunusual amount of money and trust into its suppliers, providing them access to\nthe brand\u2019s data and IT systems and requiring very little to start doing\nbusiness: no deposits or entry fees, just an agreement that the factory will\nprovide stable and reliable delivery. Meanwhile SHEIN has invested nearly $1\nmillion making \u201cstandardized factory buildings\u201d designed by SHEIN for the\nmaximally efficient production of SHEIN clothing, with plans to invest nearly\n$14 million more.\n\n> SHEIN is a microcosm of the internet and a sibling of the internet\u2019s other\n> most powerful retailer: weird, clunky, and seemingly thrown together.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nSHEIN has made unorthodox choices on the marketing side, too. The company was\nearly to the influencer game, sending promotional products to bloggers as far\nback as 2012. SHEIN advertised on social media and relied on digital word of\nmouth to move merchandise \u2014 obvious strategies a decade later, but novel ones\nat the time. Today, SHEIN contracts thousands of influencers around the globe,\nsending them enormous amounts of free product in exchange for social media\nposts. In turn, influencers earn commissions on the SHEIN products sold with\ntheir unique discount codes; some earn a flat-rate fee from the company, too.\nAs a result SHEIN is the most talked-about brand on TikTok, Instagram, and\nYouTube, the centers of the Gen Z internet. More posts beget more attention\nbeget more posts, from influencers and regular consumers alike. SHEIN even\nfigured out how to maximally capitalize on that attention beyond social media\nby gamifying the shopping experience. The more you buy, the more SHEIN points\nyou receive, and the more you save on future purchases. It\u2019s purposefully\naddictive. You can get points by just opening the app, watching live streams,\nor playing mini games on the SHEIN website. In one game, the user moves a\nshopping basket from left to right, collecting an abundance of shoes, dresses,\nand sunglasses falling like magic from the top of the screen while avoiding\nincreasingly fast sobbing emojis.\n\nIn some respects, SHEIN resembles Amazon more than a fast-fashion retailer:\nits catalog of merchandise is so expansive that it functions more like a\nsearch engine than a clothing store. It maintains no permanent physical\nstorefronts, and as such is unconstrained by square footage, retail labor, or\nrent. Low overhead means low prices, and in the same way Amazon always offers\nthe cheapest available option for any product, SHEIN is the place for the\ncheapest clothes in the industry. Shirts at Forever 21 are scandalously\ninexpensive \u2014 easily less than $20, though generally more than $10 \u2014 but\ncomparable shirts at SHEIN sell for loose change. Even the user experience is\nsimilar, in the way that both Amazon and SHEIN feel junkified: pages are\nunpolished, with varying product listings and completely unpredictable product\nqualities. For all the environmental and labor horrors of H&M, at least\nshopping at hm.com feels like shopping at a real clothing store. SHEIN,\nconversely, is a microcosm of the internet and a sibling of the internet\u2019s\nother most powerful retailer: weird, clunky, and seemingly thrown together.\n\nI learn, watching dozens of #sheinhauls, that some TikTokers include the SKU\nnumbers for their purchases in their videos. It\u2019s the only way to direct their\nfollowers to that exact garment: SHEIN\u2019s clothes don\u2019t have especially unique\ntitles to search by. They\u2019re also not accompanied by little paragraph\ndescriptions, like they would be at most other clothing retailers, just a\nseries of categories and tags, fill-in-the-blank forms easily standardized\nacross factories, languages, and fashions. A skintight, long-sleeve, shiny\ngreen bodysuit with a mock-neck collar and coordinating ruched, side-slit\nskirt is designated as \u201cStyle: Sexy,\u201d \u201cSleeve Type: Regular Sleeve,\u201d \u201cFabric:\nSlight Stretch,\u201d with \u201cDetails: Backless, Asymmetrical, Split, Twist.\u201d (It\u2019s\n$15.49.) I click from the bodysuit into the Denim category, where I find jorts\nfor $7.68, and from there to CURVE activewear, where I encounter an $8.00\nAmerican flag muscle tank.\n\nA friend texts me screenshots of a SHEIN sweater vest she ordered last year.\nIt\u2019s cropped, with bands of cream-colored ribbing around the neck, armholes,\nand waist, and patterned with brown argyle diamonds. On the website, the\nsweater is placed into a scene with black loafers and a paper with text in\nFrench, evoking an unimaginative fantasy of European life. It casts a fake\nshadow. \u201cIt was not a real garment,\u201d my friend says. She discarded the vest as\nsoon as it arrived. \u201cThe pattern was printed on. You could not wear it in\npublic.\u201d\n\nI search for the vest on the SHEIN website \u2014 it takes me a few tries to find\nthe right listing among dozens of similar products \u2014 and look at the reviews.\nThousands of customers leave five stars for the vest. \u201cThe item is exactly\nlike in the photo and the material is a bit thin but I like it,\u201d writes one\ngirl. In her three attached photos, she covers her face with her phone. On\nscreen, at a half-inch wide, the sweater looks cute and comfortable, a thing\ndesigned to be worn in photos, sold on the basis of a largely computer-\ngenerated image.\n\n> A reviewer docks a star on a hideous lilac off-the-shoulder bodysuit for the\n> item\u2019s shipping condition: \u201cVERY WRINKLED ON ARRIVAL.\u201d\n>\n> Tweet\n\nThe reviews are typical for a SHEIN item. Customers add photos of themselves,\nholding phone cameras to mirrors to capture their outfits. Every image is a\nselfie. \u201cOBSESSED!!!!\u201d they write, adding, \u201c(likes are appreciated <3).\u201d Likes\nare a currency, convertible into SHEIN points. Posting a review earns five\npoints, a review with pictures earns ten, and a review with size information\nearns an additional two. Every dollar spent on SHEIN earns a point, and every\none hundred points turns back into a dollar. The economy flourishes: \u201cPlease\nlike I need points to buy this in a different color.\u201d \u201cPlease LIKE MY REVIEW\nand help your broke girl out. (Sorry I can\u2019t post wearing the items- broke\nshoulder- thanks for understanding!)\u201d \u201cAbsolutely in love with these pants\nwearing them right now super cute please like I\u2019m broke LOL.\u201d \u201c(pls like I\nneed points).\u201d\n\nOther customers focus on the quality of the garments. Pieces are \u201csurprisingly\ngood,\u201d \u201creally well made,\u201d \u201cnot see through.\u201d Texture points to quality:\n\u201cFeels nice for the price.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t feel cheap.\u201d \u201cIm autistic and i hve\nsensory issues and if actually doesn\u2019t itch at all.\u201d They read like preemptive\ndefenses, or maybe expressions of genuine surprise.\n\nOnly occasionally are customer reviews critical. A reviewer docks a star on a\nhideous lilac off-the-shoulder bodysuit for the item\u2019s shipping condition:\n\u201cVERY WRINKLED ON ARRIVAL.\u201d A cardigan review reports, distressingly, \u201ctexture\nwas surprising.\u201d But nearly every one, regardless of tone, is five stars.\nMaybe the five-star ratings are a way to circumvent SHEIN\u2019s censorship, as\ncustomers all over the internet claim the company deletes or never approves\ntheir negative reviews. A perfect rating for a \u201cfairycore\u201d black ruffled dress\nsays, \u201cThe material kinda sucks. . . . And it kind of makes a lot of noise\nwhen you move. Almost immediately the top Lacey pattern snapped off.\u201d I read a\nfive-star review of black leggings: \u201cThe pants small are to big but I like\nthem.\u201d A pink dress is \u201ccute but looks kind of cheap, and idk where I would\nwear it to.\u201d\n\nTaken en masse, there\u2019s a feeling of camaraderie found in the reviews, of\npeople sharing tips, suggestions, and advice. But sometimes, the advice is bot\nto person. A comment on a mint-green dress: \u201cNice one and beautiful size size\nand beautiful dress size size and beautiful beautiful size and beautiful dress\nsize size and beautiful dress nice size and beautiful dress size size and\nbeautiful dress dress and dress dress size size and beautiful dress.\u201d Deep in\nthe product reviews for a pair of $15 gray sweatpants, one commenter writes,\nbafflingly: \u201cI love these grey sweatpants ever since i received them out of\nthe shein package. They go with almost everything and nice and baggy on my\nbody. The color is easy to wash and can go with coloreds and whites which is\nvery helpful in laundry.\u201d Below, three photos are attached. They show three\ndifferent women in three different pairs of pants, none of which match the\nproduct listing.\n\n> Once a day, like clockwork, SHEIN emails me.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nOther reviewers seem somewhere between human and machine. A commenter copies\nthe entire first verse of Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry\u201d into a review for a multi-\ncolored midi skirt with a thigh slit. (No information about the skirt; five\nstars.) One customer appears to paste a high school English paper (strained\npoetry analysis) into the comments of a raglan-sleeve letter jacket tagged as\n\u201cgorpcore.\u201d Another describes the smell of her new jeans as \u201cnormal.\u201d I read\nthree sets of five-star reviews posted by the same woman under a listing for\nlong-sleeve crop tops in a variety of colors: \u201cI absolutely love these Shein\ntops!! Very short though!!!!!\u201d \u201cI absolutely love these Shein tops! Very short\nthough!!\u201d \u201cI absolutely love these Shein tops!!!!\u201d In one of them, the shirt\nin the photograph is not the product being reviewed. Seven hundred and eighty-\neight customers mark her reviews as helpful.\n\nAway from the computer, I began to look more closely at strangers\u2019 outfits,\ntrying to imagine where they\u2019d come from. That checkerboard-patterned pair of\npleated trousers on the straphanger across from me \u2014 were they from SHEIN?\nWhat about those pink hair clips in the shape of flowers, or that national\npark\u2013themed T-shirt? Was the company already manufacturing garments with\nBrooklyn-specific references and knockoff New Yorker tote bags? The neon-green\nbikini my friend from high school wore once on Instagram, never to be seen\nagain \u2014 SHEIN? (OK, almost definitely.) But that sweater, which looked\nsuspiciously like a minor designer piece I saved up for months to purchase for\nmyself \u2014 was that SHEIN, too? Was the whole world shopping at SHEIN?\n\nI started reading more about the accusations against the company.\nInvestigative journalists with UK\u2019s Channel 4 found employees at SHEIN\nfactories working eighteen-hour days, making poverty wages at less than four\ncents per garment. But wasn\u2019t that the case at fast-fashion factories all over\nthe world? Last fall, Bloomberg News commissioned laboratory tests of SHEIN\nclothing and found that some of it had been made from cotton sourced from the\nChinese region of Xinjiang, where Uighurs and other ethnic minorities pick\ncotton under conditions of forced labor. The US has banned imports of all\ngoods produced in the region, which would in theory subject SHEIN shipments to\ndetention \u2014 but because of de minimis shipping loopholes, which exempt\nshipments of a nominal value from US fees, tariffs, and inspections, most\nSHEIN packages slip past customs regulators. Still, SHEIN has claimed it does\nnot contract with manufacturers in Xinjiang, and their own analyses show most\nof their cotton is sourced from elsewhere, but perhaps it\u2019s all a moot point:\nonly 4 percent of SHEIN\u2019s products sold in the US are made of cotton anyway.\n\nWhen I started to feel sanctimonious about not shopping at SHEIN, I remembered\nthat the \u201cbetter\u201d ready-to-wear stores, like Uniqlo and the Gap or even\nMadewell and Urban Outfitters, where I sometimes buy socks and T-shirts,\naren\u2019t offering products at a much higher quality \u2014 and their factories aren\u2019t\nnecessarily more ethical, either. Even luxury brands like Dior and Yves Saint\nLaurent rely on deeply exploited workers to produce their extraordinarily\nexpensive clothes. Overconsumption exists across the price spectrum: Americans\nbuy an average of sixty-eight garments per year and wear each an average of\nseven times before discarding. We have less money to spend on clothing and\nquality is more expensive than ever, but clothing prices have stayed the same,\nthanks to more exploitative labor practices and lower-quality materials\nmasquerading as efficiency and innovation. I can\u2019t justify the desire to\nconsume and collect more dirt-cheap garments than one could ever sustainably\nwear, but I know the desire to wear just the perfect outfit and the rush of\nserotonin that comes from buying an exciting new piece of clothing. Many\npeople think of fast fashion as their only option. I don\u2019t know how to\ncircumvent these desires when they are so strong and so ubiquitous and so\nseemingly beyond our control.\n\n> SHEIN\u2019s predicted $60 billion annual revenue is the equivalent of selling\n> seven black sweetheart neck long sleeve shirts to all 7.8 billion people on\n> Earth.\n>\n> Tweet\n\nSHEIN didn\u2019t invent the market or the cultural context for fast fashion, and\nsome believe it is unfairly maligned as its worst offender. At least some of\nSHEIN\u2019s reputation as exceptionally bad is rooted in anti-China sentiment, as\nthe fashion scholar Minh-Ha T. Pham has argued. While we shouldn\u2019t make the\nclaim that SHEIN is ethical in any way, Pham says, it\u2019s likely that the\ncompany would be celebrated as an innovator if it were based in the United\nStates; that our prejudice against the brand is related to the fact that SHEIN\nis Asian-owned, like Forever 21 before it. Evidence of American jealousy and\nparanoia is not hard to find. The clearly Sinophobic group Shut Down SHEIN has\nbeen lobbying lawmakers in Washington since March 2023, describing SHEIN as a\n\u201cCCP controlled fast-fashion company\u201d and \u201cTHE BIGGEST NATIONAL SECURITY\nTHREAT YOU\u2019VE NEVER HEARD OF.\u201d (It also claims that America\u2019s \u201ckids and young\nwomen [are] unwitting accomplices to all of it.\u201d Another declaration on the\nsite: \u201cTIKTOK IS THE NEEDLE, SHEIN IS THE DRUG.\u201d) Citing \u201cnational security,\u201d\nthe Biden Administration has restricted exports to Chinese semiconductor\ncompanies, and bipartisan congressional committees have initiated\ninvestigations into a wide variety of Asian companies\u2019 supply chains,\nincluding SHEIN\u2019s.\n\nBut both things can be true. SHEIN might be singled out as the worst fast-\nfashion retailer because the United States fears and envies China and has a\nparticular interest in denigrating its successes, and it might be singled out\nbecause it is, in fact, the worst: the greatest polluter, the most flagrant IP\nthief, the largest violator of human rights, and \u2014 arguably worst of all \u2014 the\nmost profitable. SHEIN has shown the world that unsustainability pays.\nTogether with the companies that will follow its example of ultra-fast\nfashion, SHEIN will accelerate the already-rapid acceleration toward global\ncatastrophe.\n\nSHEIN is now eyeing an IPO in the United States and has hired its own\nWashington lobbyists to push back against the forced labor claims. It has also\ngone on a media blitz: the past year has seen a New York Times story about\nSHEIN X, the company\u2019s independent designer collaboration initiative, and\ndozens of articles about the company\u2019s new Singapore-based headquarters that\nseek to distance SHEIN from its Chinese associations. SHEIN even sent a\nhandful of TikTok influencers to what they claimed was \u201cone of the main supply\nmanufacturers for SHEIN,\u201d only to have the campaign backfire massively when\none self-described TikTok \u201cconfidence activist\u2019s\u201d video tour of a clearly fake\nmanufacturing center went viral. On-screen was a spotless and sparse warehouse\nwhere fabric was being cut in single layers and workers stood beaming in rows\nbehind ironing boards. It\u2019s as if SHEIN is seeking a rebrand, though not one\naimed at its customer base. Browsing going-out tops on shein.com, you\u2019d never\nknow. I search black sweetheart neck long sleeve shirt and get forty pages of\nresults. My cheapest available option is $2.75. SHEIN\u2019s predicted $60 billion\nannual revenue is the equivalent of selling seven black sweetheart neck long\nsleeve shirts to all 7.8 billion people on Earth.\n\nI can\u2019t wonder any longer what the clothes are like in the abstract. I need to\nexperience SHEIN for myself. After what feels like an hour on the site, I\nsettle on two garments I could envision myself actually wearing, if not\nbuying, under normal circumstances: a long-sleeve black mesh shirt for $6.37\nand a strappy light-green summer dress for $8.50. My shipping is free, and I\nspend a grand total of $14.87. My package will arrive in two weeks. Everything\nabout SHEIN moves so quickly that I\u2019m surprised by the relatively long\nshipping time until I remember that my package is being sent eight thousand\nmiles from SHEIN\u2019s distribution centers in Asia.\n\nOnce a day, like clockwork, SHEIN emails me. The first email comes forty-eight\nhours after I receive notice that my order has shipped. The preview line tells\nme SHEIN is \u201cHonoring Black History Month\u201d by showcasing three \u201cSHEIN X\nartists.\u201d I scroll and find a picture of two white influencers in wedding\ngear: \u201c#SayidoinSHEIN.\u201d The next day\u2019s email highlights a sale on bodycon\ndresses in neon colors, because it\u2019s \u201cFRI-YAY.\u201d Soon I\u2019m sent a notice that\n\u201cBOGO 99% OFF has Entered the Chat.\u201d Seemingly every email has flashing text\nand dancing graphics.\n\nNine days after placing my order and four days ahead of schedule, my shipment\narrives. I\u2019d expected the package to be covered in SHEIN branding, but it\u2019s\nsurprisingly discreet: the return address is listed, simply, as S RETURN in\nCarteret, New Jersey; the white plastic shipping bag is punctured but\notherwise plain. Under the USPS sticker, I spy the mysterious outlines of\nanother barcode and shipping label \u2014 the original international mailing\ninformation? \u2014 but I can\u2019t peel the top label off the bag.\n\nInside the shipping bag are two smaller frosted ziplock bags with black\nzippers and a large SHEIN logo printed across the bottom, familiar to me from\nTikTok haul videos. There\u2019s an order receipt with my \u201ccommodity details\u201d and a\nthorough flowchart outlining the SHEIN return process in English and Spanish.\nThere\u2019s also a wrinkled flyer for something called SHEIN Exchange adorned with\npictures of smiling women and a closet stocked exclusively with beige\nsweaters. SHEIN Exchange is \u201cWhere pre-loved gets re-loved\u201d: \u201ca community\nwhere you can give your pre-loved clothing a new life while making others\u2019\npre-loved pieces your own.\u201d Below, an orange QR code links me to the SHEIN\napp. I\u2019m so distracted by the bizarre idea of ordering somebody\u2019s used and\ndiscarded SHEIN clothing that I nearly miss the back of the flyer advertising\n\u201cevoluSHEIN\u201d: SHEIN\u2019s new collection made from \u201crecycled polyester . . . and\nother responsibly sourced materials that reduce the impact on the planet.\u201d\nThis side of the flyer is green, for recycling.\n\nI start with the SHEIN BAE Glitter Sheer Mesh Top Without Bra. The shirt looks\nlike the pictures: long sleeved and made of stretchy black mesh, with tiny\nglittery flecks embedded in the fabric. I\u2019ve bought a size large, and it\u2019s too\nbig: the armscyes form wide gaping triangles at my armpits and the shoulder\nseams droop sadly off my collarbones. The elastic seams are puckered. Staring\nat myself in the mirror, I wonder if the shoulders have been sewn unevenly.\nIt\u2019s less itchy than anticipated, and the fabric is slinky and cold against my\nskin. I feel like a different version of myself, like the kind of girl who\ncaptions her Instagram posts with the sparkle emoji. I imagine wearing my new\nSHEIN BAE Glitter Sheer Mesh Top with a bra and black jeans, drinking with\nfriends. I imagine looking across the room and seeing a girl dressed nearly\nexactly like me, but she\u2019s wearing the SHEIN BAE Lettuce Edge Glitter Mesh Top\nWithout Bra, instead.\n\nMy other new SHEIN garment is both uglier and more distinctive. It\u2019s the SHEIN\nUnity Tie Shoulder Split Thigh Cami in lime green, though the color in real\nlife is more of a sage. The garment inside the ziplock bag is crumpled around\na small square of tissue paper, which serves no discernable purpose. I\u2019m\nsurprised to see that neither the dress nor the shirt has any paper price tags\nattached: there\u2019s nothing to cut off, and nothing to indicate that the clothes\nare brand new beyond their intense chemical smells. I ordered this dress in a\nmedium, and it barely pulls over my hips. The fabric is a medium-thick stretch\nknit similar to a heavy T-shirt. Thin, wavy folds have been stitched into the\nmaterial, creating a ruched effect. The texture is unusual, but almost a nice\ndetail. (My friend takes one look at the dress and describes it as having both\nthe look and feel of a ribbed condom.) I struggle to tie the long thin\nshoulder ties myself and eventually settle for lopsided bows. I have to tie\nthem tight to hold the bodice of the dress over my chest, and they dig\npainfully into my skin. Fully on, the dress barely covers my chest \u2014 I can\u2019t\nlean, bend, or jump without flashing my reflection, and any large steps cause\nthe super-high thigh slit to rise dangerously close to my ass. Standing still,\nthough, I look good: sexy, trendy, youthful. But I quickly discover that the\ndress is too tight to pull over my head. How did I get in here? I shimmy and\ncurse until I\u2019m able to wrench the dress off me, where it springs back,\ntauntingly, to its original shape. Laid flat on the floor, the form is like a\ncartoon body: a perfect hourglass, smooth and dramatically curving.\n\nMy new SHEIN clothes lie in a crumpled pile on my living room floor for a\nweek. I can\u2019t figure out what to do with them. Neither garment is particularly\nwearable, but the hassle of returning the pieces (or donating them, or selling\nthem to a thrift store) seems absurd when they cumulatively cost me less than\n$15 to begin with. The idea of folding them up and placing them in my dresser\nalongside my other clothing feels defeating. I think briefly about trying to\nsew them into something new, but again, the hassle. Mostly I don\u2019t think about\nthem at all. The garments cost so little that I don\u2019t feel pressure to make\nthem fit my wardrobe, or my life. I\u2019ve already forgotten why I wanted these\nparticular clothes in the first place.\n\nIf you like this article, please subscribe or leave a tax-deductible tip below\nto support n+1.\n\n### More from Issue 47\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nWe are not used to this \u2014 not to the gruesomeness, the ceaselessness, the\ndirect address.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Who Sees Gaza?\n  * The Editors\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * No Human Being Can Exist\n  * Saree Makdisi\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nThe anti-trans panic builds wide-ranging suspicion of teachers, who are cast\nas the villains in a baroque drama.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Inventing the Crisis\n  * Kay Gabriel\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nI was an extraterrestrial taking notes on the problems of Earth.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * An Age of Hyperabundance\n  * Laura Preston\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Arnie Robles Jr.\n  * Paul Soto\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-article-featured\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * On Delivery\n  * Mitchell Morgan Johnson\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Traces of Enayat\n  * Iman Mersal\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nI liked being enveloped in a language I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * No Man\u2019s Land\n  * Nicholas Hamburger\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Death in the Luberon\n  * Nausicaa Renner\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIf you want to understand the dreams and dilemmas of acid communism, few\ncities offer a better case study than Detroit.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Acid Rhythms\n  * William Harris\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nNot to get too scientific about it, but I think the vibes are counter-\nreformatory.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Success?\n  * David Wingrave\n\ncard-default flavor-issue type-magazine term-issue-47 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I did once really like playing The Sims.\n\nIssue 47 Passage\n\n  * Not Only \u201cNot Only,\u201d but Also \u201cBut Also\u201d\n  * The Editors\n\n### More by this Author\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-online-only term-online-only format-with_image\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nOnline Only\n\n  * My Lanyarded Brethren\n  * Lisa Borst, Sarah Gale, Nicole Lipman\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-magazine term-issue-44 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nThe red-pilled among us might argue that the Pleats themselves made me trans.\n\nIssue 44 Middlemen\n\n  * Miyake\u2019s Layers\n  * Hannah Baer, Nicole Lipman, Haley Mlotek, Su Wu\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-online-only term-online-only format-pullquote\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nI can\u2019t help but hope for some other, better New York.\n\nOnline Only\n\n  * 68 Jay St. #405, Part I\n  * Lisa Borst, A.
