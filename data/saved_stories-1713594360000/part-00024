We created Borderlands\nScience (BLS), a citizen science activity that is seamlessly integrated within\na popular commercial video game played by tens of millions of gamers. This\nintegration is facilitated by a novel game-first design of citizen science\ngames, in which the game design aspect has the highest priority, and a\nsuitable task is then mapped to the game design. BLS crowdsources a multiple\nalignment task of 1 million 16S ribosomal RNA sequences obtained from human\nmicrobiome studies. Since its initial release on 7 April 2020, over 4 million\nplayers have solved more than 135 million science puzzles, a task unsolvable\nby a single individual. Leveraging these results, we show that our multiple\nsequence alignment simultaneously improves microbial phylogeny estimations and\nUniFrac effect sizes compared to state-of-the-art computational methods. This\nachievement demonstrates that hyper-gamified scientific tasks attract massive\ncrowds of contributors and offers invaluable resources to the scientific\ncommunity.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Song lyrics have become simpler and more repetitive over the last five\ndecades\n\nArticle Open access 28 March 2024\n\nEmilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Maximilian Mayerl, ...

Palm\n\n## Main\n\nIn 2022, more than 3 billion people played video games worldwide^1. The growth\nof this community is expected to continue in upcoming years. The size and\ndiversity of the gamer community show that video games are a universal\nentertainment activity that transcends generations, gender and cultures^2.\n\nThe ubiquity of video games created new opportunities to communicate and teach\nscientific concepts^3,4,5,6,7, and one of the most remarkable applications of\nthis media is the development of citizen science games (CSGs) that engage\nparticipants in the analysis of real scientific data. Introduced with Foldit\nin 2008, which recruited online citizen scientists to help with the prediction\nof the structure of proteins^8, CSGs have been subsequently applied to\ncomparative genomics^9, RNA folding^10, neuron segmentation^11 and quantum\nphysics^12,13. In the last decade, CSGs had a dramatic impact on the practice\nof citizen science, lowering the barrier to entry of scientific activities and\nbringing hundreds of thousands of new participants into the community.\nHowever, successful implementation of this concept also comes with its own\nchallenges, such as reaching potential participants and maintaining player\nengagement^14,15.\n\nThe classical approach to design CSGs relies on gamification\u2014that is, the\nintroduction of game design elements that facilitate the acquisition of the\nexpertise needed to complete the activity and increase engagement^16,17,18.\nThe design of these CSGs is strongly rooted in the canonical presentation of\nthe scientific task, which may hinder its entertainment value and, therefore,\nparticipation of the general public. Hence, their target audience focuses on\nusers with prior interest in science^15, which eventually amplifies the\ndemographic skew observed in citizen science projects^19.\n\nTo answer to the challenge of user acquisition and engagement in citizen\nscience, in 2015, Massively Multiplayer Online Science (MMOS) proposed to\nembed citizen science activities into commercial video games played by massive\nestablished gamer communities^20, relying on the leadership of game designers\nto ensure a seamless integration of the citizen science activity in the host\nvideo game user experience. The first incarnation of this concept was Project\nDiscovery in the massively multiplayer online game EVE Online in 2016 (ref.\n^21). EVE Online has a user base with a welcoming stance toward scientific\nnarratives, and it had not yet been shown that citizen science can work in any\ntype of video game, specifically gamer communities not familiar with\nscientific narratives.\n\nIn the present work, we reinforce the primacy of game design to overcome the\nchallenges of integration of citizen science in commercial games. We also\nleverage our previous experience with Phylo^9,22,23 to develop a CSG for\nmicrobiome data analysis that follows \u2018game-first design\u2019 principles. This\napproach aims to create a pure game that integrates scientific computation\nmechanisms in its core gameplay rather than adapting existing scientific\nresearch modus operandi (Supplementary Information, section 6). Eventually,\nthis methodology can lead to fundamental alterations in the canonical\npresentation of the data that will prevent the complexity of the scientific\ntask from obfuscating the accessibility or altering the user experience. We\nfound that this approach of redesigning the original task with a fresh\n\u2018untrained\u2019 eye can bring valuable improvements from these other disciplines\nof game or narrative design.\n\nThis approach results in massive gains in public participation without\nsacrificing the relevance of the collected answers. More importantly, it\nprovides access to new human computation resources capable of executing\ncomplex computational tasks on large scientific datasets, which would\notherwise be unfeasible with classical CSGs.\n\nWe showcase this concept with Borderlands Science (BLS; Fig. 1)^24, a tile-\nmatching mini game released on 7 April 2020 as a free downloadable content for\nBorderlands 3 (the most recent release of a video game franchise that sold\nover 77 million copies worldwide). BLS is designed to improve a reference\nmultiple alignment of 1 million 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences from The\nMicrosetta Initiative\u2019s (TMI) American Gut Project (AGP)^25, a citizen science\ninitiative collecting gut microbial genomic data.\n\nFig. 1: The BLS game.\n\nIn a, we present the BLS gameplay. Players are tasked with aligning the\ncolored bricks, representing nucleobases, to the guides on the left, by\ninserting yellow gap bricks. They receive a bonus for full rows and must reach\nthe par score to progress to the next puzzle. In b, we show the BLS pipeline\nfrom data collection to alignment output, in particular how data flow from the\ninitial alignment of 1 million sequences to the analysis results featured in\nthis paper. The Supplementary Information provides details pertaining to each\nstep, regarding game design, puzzle generation, filtering and realignment.\n\nFull size image\n\nSince its launch, more than 4 million gamers have played BLS and solved more\nthan 135 million puzzles. Our results show that the multiple sequence\nalignment (MSA) obtained from BLS (Fig. 1b and Methods) improves microbial\nphylogeny inference compared to other alignment methods and enables improved\nUniFrac^26 effect size estimation for many variables known to be important to\nhuman digestive health. Beyond these results, BLS demonstrates that commercial\nvideo games can provide massive human processing resources for the manual\ncuration and analysis of large-scale genomic datasets that could not be\ncompleted otherwise.\n\n## Results\n\n### Task and data\n\nThe data featured in this article come from a set of 953,000 rRNA fragments\nsequenced from stool samples submitted by participants in the AGP^25, powered\nby TMI (https://microsetta.ucsd.edu/). The fragments are 150 nucleotides long\nand come from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.\n\nIn the BLS mini game (Fig. 1a), the player sees 7\u201320 sequences of 4\u201310\nnucleotides. Each sequence is displayed as a vertical pile of bricks, each\ncolor representing a nucleotide (through a random mapping between colors and\nnucleotides). The bricks are collapsed (all gaps are removed), and the player\nis asked to insert a finite number of gaps to improve a score determined by\nthe number of bricks correctly aligned to the guides. These targets, located\non the left, display the most common nucleotides in the corresponding\nalignment column. By inserting gap tokens, the player is using their natural\nknack for pattern matching to realign a region of the scaffold alignment. The\nlimited number of tokens, set by a naive greedy artificial intelligence (AI)\nplayer based on how easily it could improve the alignment, forces the player\nto make tough choices. This greedy player also sets a target score that the\nplayer must beat to progress to the next puzzle, enforcing a minimal effort.\n\nDuring the first year of the initiative, we collected approximately 75 million\npuzzle solutions (mean, 43 per puzzle). The solutions were used as \u2018votes\u2019 by\nplayers on potential errors in the scaffold alignment, and a corrected\nalignment was generated. Here we report results for our BLS alignment and\nbenchmark alignments produced by several state-of-the-art de novo multiple\nalignment programs (PASTA, MUSCLE and MAFFT) as well as an alignment produced\nby a greedy algorithm (Methods and Supplementary Information, sections 12\u201315).\n\n### Complex citizen science tasks can be embedded in video games\n\nIntegrating a scientific task in a commercial video game from a franchise that\nsells millions of copies constitutes a risk. The scientific mini game must not\nlook out of place in the broader game as it could break immersion, an\nimportant component of role-playing games. This is especially true when\nintegrating a puzzle game into a shooter\u2013looter role-playing game such as\nBorderlands 3, in which the player expects to face fast-paced action and\nhumor. BLS was specifically designed to address this potential issue by\nintegrating dialogues with characters from the Borderlands universe. The\nvirtual arcade booth was located in a virtual laboratory within the game\nuniverse and is presented as belonging to the resident scientist. The gameplay\nwas simplified to make sure that the pace matched a shooter\u2013looter game, and\nall the visuals were specifically designed to make sense in-universe.\n\nAs of May 2023, 3 years after launch, 4.45 million players had visited the\narcade booth. Of these players, over 4 million completed the 10-min tutorial\nand at least one real task. This represents an engagement rate of 90%, which\nis a substantial improvement over Phylo, the previous sequence alignment CSG,\nwhich has reported an engagement rate of around 10%. This level of player\nengagement demonstrates that the ultra-gamification of the task worked and\nthat its integration into the commercial game was seamless.\n\n### BLS outputs a high-quality MSA\n\nThe evaluation of the BLS alignment output is complicated by the absence of a\nuniversal ground truth to benchmark against. Nevertheless, there are several\nqualities typically expected from a high-quality alignment that we can\ninvestigate. Indeed, a high-quality alignment of homologous genomic sequences\ntends to:\n\n  1. a.\n\nHave a high sum-of-pairs score\n\n  2. b.\n\nHave a gap frequency compatible with that RNA family\u2019s indel frequency\n\n  3. c.\n\nAllow the inference of phylogenetic trees that resemble the state of the art\nfor that family\n\n  4. d.\n\nAppropriately separate taxa associated with different illnesses, behaviors and\nprofiles in the host\n\n  5. e.\n\nBe compatible with the structural signature of the family\n\nWe assert that the BLS alignment satisfies all these criteria and, thus,\nconstitutes a high-quality MSA.\n\nIn Table 1 (top), we show that BLS improves the sum-of-pairs score compared to\nall benchmarks when excluding heavily gapped columns from the scoring, thus\nsatisfying a.\n\nTable 1 Phylogeny and alignment information\n\nFull size table\n\nIn Fig. 2b, we show the gap frequency sampled from sub-alignments (we sample\nsub-alignments to account for differences in number of sequences among\nGreengenes, Rfam and BLS) for BLS and benchmarks. These benchmarks include\nPASTA^27, MUSCLE^28 and MAFFT^29, the pyNAST^30 and SSU-ALIGN^31 alignments\nfrom the Greengenes^32 database and the structural Rfam^33 alignment. We\nobserved that all alignments had a gap frequency in the same order of\nmagnitude as PASTA, Rfam and pyNAST. This low gap frequency is consistent with\nthe strongly structured nature of the V4 region, which varies in length by\nonly a few base pairs between microbes. Thus, the BLS alignment shows a gap\nfrequency that is compatible with our state-of-the-art knowledge of the V4\nregion, and criterion b is satisfied.\n\nFig. 2: Evaluation of the alignment.\n\na, Here the gap density by column is shown for six different alignment\nmethods. The x axis corresponds to the alignment position, and the color\ncorresponds to the log gap frequency at this position. Highly gapped columns\nwere excluded so all alignments could be of the same length. b, Gap\nfrequencies observed in BLS and other methods, averaged from sampled sub-\nalignments of 50 sequences. The box plot shows an overview of the\ndistribution. The three horizontal lines in the box, from top to bottom, show,\nrespectively, the boundaries for the upper quartile, the middle quartile and\nthe lower quartile. The total height of the box represents the interquartile\nrange (IQR). The whiskers are located 1.5 times the IQR from the ends of the\nbox. The dots outside the whiskers are the outliers. Note: one outlier point\nfor the right-most distribution, pyNAST, with a value of 124, is not shown on\nthe plot but is considered in the statistics shown. c, Compound distance to\nthe reference Greengenes tree. That compound metric was obtained as a scaled\naverage of the Kendall\u2013Colijn and Triplet distance. More detail is provided in\nSupplementary Information, sections 12a,b and 13c. GG, Greengenes.\n\nFull size image\n\nOur results in Table 1 and Fig. 2 indicate that the additional gaps inserted\nby BLS compared to PASTA, MAFFT, MUSCLE and the greedy algorithm led to a\nimprovement of the tree structure.\n\nWe present our investigation of criteria c, d and e in the following\nsubsections.\n\n### The BLS alignment improves de novo phylogeny\n\nA central objective of improving alignments of microbial genomic sequences was\nto better understand their phylogeny. To assess whether this goal was\nachieved, we inferred phylogenetic trees from our alignments with FastTree^34\nand then assessed their similarity to a reference tree built by placing our\nsequences into the Greengenes 13.5 (ref. ^32) phylogeny with SEPP^35.\nGreengenes has been previously benchmarked for fragment insertion, and SEPP\nwith Greengenes has been shown to outperform de novo phylogeny inference, when\na high-quality tree and alignment are already available^36.\n\nOur phylogenetic similarity results, shown in Table 1 for two distance\nmetrics, Kendall\u2013Colijn^37 and Triplet^38 distance, indicate that the BLS\nphylogenies are closer to the reference than standard MSA approaches. This\nresult shows that the BLS alignment outperforms alternatives for the task of\ninferring a reliable phylogeny, thus satisfying criterion c.\n\n### The BLS phylogeny leads to improved UniFrac effect sizes\n\nWe also formulated the hypothesis that improved alignments (and, by extension,\nde novo phylogenies) would lead to some improvement in the separation of taxa\nassociated with different behaviors, profiles and diseases. To confirm this,\nwe measured effect sizes on UniFrac^26 distances over 74 non-technical\nvariables available in the AGP metadata associated with the samples used for\nsequencing. These variables relate to the host\u2019s lifestyle, health condition,\nfood or general profile.\n\nThe strongest effect sizes that we observed were for teeth brushing frequency\nand prior Clostridium difficile infection (full list in Fig. 3 and\nSupplementary Information, section 14). We report the average pairwise effect\nsizes between BLS and Greengenes + SEPP in Fig. 3. We observed that BLS\noutperforms SEPP on many variables, including several that have been linked to\ngut microbe diversity and human health^25,39,40,41,42. The top five variables\nwith highest delta are, respectively, teeth brushing frequency, diabetes,\nnumber of types of plants, antibiotic history and alcohol frequency.\n\nFig. 3: Effect sizes.\n\nDelta means pairwise effect sizes between BLS and SEPP for each variable.\nSignificance, indicated with the transparency, refers to the P value obtained\nfrom a two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U-test against shuffled metadata. More detail\nis provided in Supplementary Information, section 14.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe backed up this analysis by assessing whether the effect sizes obtained were\nsignificantly different than what could be observed in a random assignment of\ncategories to samples. We annotated Fig. 3 with the P values associated with\nthe null hypothesis that our results are compatible with a random outcome. We\nobserved an enrichment of significant outcomes in the variables with high\neffect sizes and, in particular, 13 variables for which BLS achieves a higher\nsignificance category than SEPP, whereas the opposite occurs 10 times,\ngenerally on variables with lower effect sizes.\n\nThese improvements observed on most variables confirm that the previously\nreported improvements to phylogeny can be perceived in meta-analyses. Although\noverall improvement over SEPP is limited as SEPP still outperforms BLS on\nimportant variables, such as age category, BLS does outperform SEPP, and the\ntwo approaches lead to distinct solutions that are complementary in improving\nunderstanding of gut microbe phylogeny and its impact on human health, thus\nsatisfying criterion d.\n\n### The BLS alignment improves support for 16S rRNA structure\n\nAs stated previously, the structure is an important component of a high-\nquality MSA of a strongly structured RNA region. Given that the BLS alignment\ncontains about 99% of bacterial sequences, it is possible to map its columns\nto the bases of the state-of-the-art structural model of the 16S bacterial\nrRNA defined on the Comparative RNA Web^43.\n\nTo estimate the quality of such mapping, we report the proportion of non-gap\nnucleotides that cannot be mapped to the structure (see Table 1, bottom). It\nturns out that alignments such as BLS and PASTA map rather easily, whereas\nMUSCLE and MAFFT lose substantially more information.\n\nTo deepen our evaluation of the structural quality of the two alignments that\nmap well, we investigated column by column whether the differences between BLS\nand PASTA alignments tend to agree or disagree with the model. In Fig. 4, we\nshow that the changes added by human players tend to agree with the 16S\nstructural model, especially in regions linked to important functional sites,\nsuch as S8 and S15 binding sites, and a region that undergoes conformational\nreadjustment during 30S assembly^44,45,46,47,48,49. This agreement is a strong\nargument in favor of the BLS alignment as the CRW model considers long-range\nbase pairs, a context that is not available to the players solving small\npuzzles. This is important because, as shown in Fig. 2a, the region of the\nalignment with the most gaps and the most variation between methods is the top\nof the V4 stem, a region with considerable mapping improvements for BLS in\nthis analysis.\n\nFig. 4: Agreement with 16S rRNA structural model.\n\nAfter mapping the BLS and PASTA alignments to the 16S structural model, we\nobserved a higher conservation for BLS, especially near important functional\nsites. The figure shows an annotated 16S secondary structure where only the V4\nregion and its vicinity are shown. Colored bases form a continuous backbone.\nCRW, Comparative RNA Web.\n\nFull size image\n\nThis demonstrates that the modifications to the PASTA scaffold added by BLS\nled to an improvement of the structural and functional signal of the\nalignment, thus satisfying criterion e.\n\nAdditionally, in Fig. 2a, we show the gap frequency per column (excluding\nhighly gapped columns) of different alignment methods, including BLS and our\nbenchmarks PASTA^27, MUSCLE^28 and MAFFT^29. These gap frequencies help reveal\nthe differences between BLS alignments and alternatives, on top of satisfying\ncriteria a\u2013e.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSince the release of Foldit in 2008, many high-impact CSGs have been released,\nsuch as EteRNA^10, Project Discovery, EyeWire, Phylo and Sea Hero Quest (Fig.\n5).\n\nFig. 5: Player engagement.\n\nThis figure provides context on player engagement. a, We show the number of\nsolutions received from player per month after the release of the game,\nshowing continuous engagement after the end of the initial rush. b, We compare\nthe number of participants in BLS to some notable recent CSGs, over the first\n3 years of existence, showing the impact of the integration into a mass-market\ngame (Sea Hero Quest and BLS) compared to more traditional CSGs. See\nSupplementary Information, section 11, for sources for the numbers presented\nin b.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo this day, a CSG that would reach 500,000 players would be considered a\nmassive success. This evaluation is made in context of the relative difficulty\nfor a scientific team to reach people who are likely to be interested in\nplaying a game for science.\n\nGalaxy Zoo^50 was the first initiative of this type to break 1 million\nparticipants after 10 years in activity. Sea Hero Quest was the first to\nachieve the feat in less than 1 year, by working with Deutsche Telecom, a\ncompany with 300 million customers^51. BLS built on this idea of improving\nreach through collaboration with non-scientific companies and went to the next\nlevel by reaching gamers directly where they are, within the virtual universe\nof high-profile video games.\n\nNow that we have shown that puzzle-style CSGs can be seamlessly integrated\ninto a high-profile game and engage players, we expect other projects to take\nadvantage of this opportunity to enter an era where million-players CSGs are\nno longer an exception.\n\nPhylo struggled to retain players for more than a couple puzzles, with an\naverage of 5.7 tasks completed by users, and a median of two. Thus, Phylo\nrelies heavily on expert players. Indeed, in Phylo, the experts can\ncollectively outperform casual gamers by up to 40% depending on the alignment,\ndespite being a small group completing a tiny fraction of the tasks solved by\ncasual players. On the other hand, BLS players complete an average of 35\ntasks, with a median of 12. Unlike in Phylo, where experts achieving high\nscores form the backbone of the scientific contribution, BLS filters tasks\nbased on consensus between players and provides rewards for just reaching a\ntarget score. Therefore, BLS does not rely on experts to the same degree.\nIndeed, removing all contributions of the 10% most active players represents\nonly a 14% drop in evaluation metrics compared to removing the same amount of\ndata at random.\n\nThis lack of reliance on experts marks a change of paradigm from lightly\ngamified CSGs that rely on experts to a new category of CSGs to which everyone\ncan contribute.\n\nTwo core objectives guide the design of CSGs: maximizing player engagement and\nmaximizing the scientific relevance of the game. Unfortunately, these two\nobjectives often conflict with one another; a game with optimal scientific\nrelevance would be a pure crowdsourced scientific task with no gaming\nelements, such as image annotation in Stardust@home. Gamification of the task,\nby design, will make mapping player solutions to scientific contributions more\ndifficult. However, the more gamified the task, the higher the potential for\nit to play like a real game and be fun enough to stimulate player engagement\nand retention. In the present study, we pushed the envelope on gamification,\nand our observations match the conundrum: BLS achieved a very high level of\nplayer engagement, but the average scientific contribution of one task was\nlower than in Phylo, where a few hundreds of puzzles are sufficient to improve\na small alignment. Here, millions of tasks are combined to improve alignments.\nNevertheless, the ultra-gamification of BLS led to a much higher player\nengagement and retention than in Phylo, which strongly alleviates that\ndownside.\n\nAnother aspect that we think indicates potential for growth in CSGs is the\nfeedback that we received from the players. Through our exchanges with gamers\nin the form of quality assurance testing feedback, blog posts, email and\nsocial media (Supplementary Information, section 11.5), the most common\nresponse that we received was enthusiasm and curiosity about science. Although\nquantifying this attitude would be its own study and, thus, left for future\nwork, our experience in this project leads us to think that player engagement\nwas driven by a combination of game-first design and genuine interest in\nscience from the public.\n\nMoreover, beyond the optimization of the tradeoff described above, the\ninherent benefits of participating in a citizen science initiative, such as\nimprovements in science literacy and increased connectedness of the public to\nthe scientific world, further justifies the exploration of the extra\ngamification region of that tradeoff: reaching more participants is a valid\nobjective in its own right (Supplementary Information, section 11.4).\n\nIn the present study, we focused on phase 1 of BLS, which includes data from\nthe first year, and over two-thirds of the total amount of data. There are,\nthus, 2 years of data remaining to analyze. These data include different types\nof puzzles aimed at studying how sequence alignment CSGs can be made more\nefficient. After phase 1, we started producing puzzles with alternative\nscaffolds, and, as such, the analysis presented here does not apply to them,\nwhich is why they are not included in this study (Supplementary Information,\nsection 5).\n\nAdditionally, we included a guide offset in some of the puzzles sent to users\n(Supplementary Information, section 5.2.6). Along with presenting more\nstimulating gameplay, these guide offsets allow the user to correct potential\nerrors in the scaffold alignments at a larger scale. As a result, they are\nmore noisy than regular puzzles (Supplementary Information, section 8.5.4).\nBLS alignments built with offset puzzles show potential, as they outperform\nBLS on some important effect size variables, such as age category.\nNevertheless, because they require a different type of analysis, their\ninvestigation is left for future work.\n\nAnother consideration for future work is the integration of synthetic data in\nthe game. Indeed, in the present study, we relied on the Greengenes phylogeny\nas a proxy for a ground truth. Although this phylogeny is well understood and\nstate of the art in the field, it is not perfect. In future projects of this\ntype, we will endeavor to integrate synthetic data into the design of the\ngame, to complement our proxy for the ground truth. Nevertheless, it must be\nmentioned that synthetic data often embed assumptions that match the true\nevolutionary process poorly, especially under heterogeneous substitution\nmodels in different parts of the tree and when RNA secondary structure is\npresent, both of which we know are the case in this situation.\n\nFinally, we have been working in parallel on strategies to extend the impact\nof player participation by training reinforcement learning agents to reproduce\nplayer strategies, and, recently, we published two studies on the matter. In\nthe first study^52, we established that it is possible for reinforcement\nlearning agents to learn player strategies for solving BLS puzzles, unlocking\npotential for propagating these player strategies to data outside of the game.\nIn the second study^53, we demonstrated that injecting human solutions into a\nQ-learning algorithm outperforms pure AI. Combined with the aggregation\ntechniques presented in the present study, these results suggest promising\navenues to design an automated pipeline for massive alignment of 16S rRNA\nsequences.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the present study, we present BLS, a sequence alignment game aiming to open\na path for gaming-focused CSGs targeting large-scale problems with large-scale\naudiences. The project achieved player engagement unseen before for a game of\nits category and reached its goal of pooling gamers together to solve a large-\nscale collective task while also serving as a large-scale science outreach\ninitiative. We showed that, despite being gamified to a degree beyond that of\nprevious efforts, the contributions of the players led to clear improvements\nover state-of-the-art sequence alignment methods, unlocking the potential for\na new generation of gaming-focused CSGs.\n\n## Methods\n\nThe data featured in this article come from a set of 953,000 rRNA fragments\nsequenced from stool samples submitted by participants in the AGP^25, powered\nby TMI (https://microsetta.ucsd.edu/). The fragments are 150 nucleotides long\nand come from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.\n\nThe 953,000 150-nucleotide V4 fragments were first clustered with CD-HIT^54\ninto 10,200 clusters. Very dissimilar clusters representing a small minority\nof sequences (about 5,000) were removed, and a final set of 9,667 cluster\nrepresentative sequences was obtained, which accounts for 946,740 sequences of\nthe initial dataset.\n\nThese 9,667 sequences were then aligned with PASTA 1.9 (ref. ^27), generating\na very tight (183 columns) initial alignment, which served as a scaffold for\nthe creation of CSG puzzles.\n\n### Game design\n\nIn the BLS mini game, the player sees 7\u201320 sequences of 4\u201310 nucleotides (the\nsize of the grid changes with the difficulty level). Each sequence is\ndisplayed as a vertical pile of bricks, each color representing a random base.\nThe bricks are collapsed (all gaps are removed), and the player is then asked\nto insert a finite number of gaps to improve a score determined by the number\nof bricks correctly aligned to the guides. These targets, located on the left,\ndisplay the most common nucleotides in the corresponding alignment column. By\ninserting gap tokens, the player is using their natural knack for pattern\nmatching to realign a region of the scaffold alignment. The limited number of\ntokens, set by a naive greedy AI player based on how easily it could improve\nthe alignment, forces the player to make tough choices. This greedy player\nalso sets a par score that the player must beat to progress to the next\npuzzle, enforcing a minimal effort. The game is displayed in Fig. 1, and more\ndetails on game design can be found in the Supplementary Information (section\n6).\n\n### Building puzzles\n\nPuzzles were added to the game on a regular basis. The results presented in\nthis paper use the solutions of the first 1.4 million puzzles (a total of\nabout 75 million player tasks), submitted to the players between April 2020\nand July 2021. To get a wide enough distribution of solutions, each puzzle was\nreleased in three different versions, each with a slightly different number of\ngap tokens available. Each different version was aimed to be played by about\n15 players, for a total of 45 per puzzle.\n\nFor each alignment region (a sequence of alignment columns of variable\nlength), sequences are sampled from the PASTA alignment. To compensate for the\nbias that comes from the vertical orientation, puzzles are built both from\nleft to right and from right to left. Additionally, each sequence in each\npuzzle has a small probability (~0.15) to be shortened or elongated to show\npuzzle sequences of different lengths, allowing the player to simulate\ndeletions.\n\nFinally, an offset was sometimes introduced between the guides and the puzzle\nsequences. An offset of 1 would mean that puzzles using sequences from the\nalignment columns 10\u201314 would have the guides from columns 9\u201313, to enhance\nthe user\u2019s action space; they would then have to push up many bricks just to\nget back to the initial PASTA configuration. Through these variations in the\npuzzles, the players are given opportunities to re-evaluate alignment\ndecisions made by the PASTA algorithm.\n\n### Puzzle and solution filtering\n\nPuzzles are discarded if they offer little incentive to move bricks because\nthe starting gravity effect already yields a local optimum. This led to some\nalignment regions being overrepresented in the puzzles due to a higher\nacceptance rate, which we interpreted as these regions presenting more room\nfor improvement via puzzles.\n\nFor each puzzle, the 20\u201360 (objective, 45; real mean, 43.4) user solutions\nwere filtered by their similarity to the distribution of gap positions from\nall submitted solutions to that puzzle. The player solutions were filtered\nusing two criteria: (1) how far from optimality the solution was and (2) how\nfar from the player consensus the solution was. The distance from optimality\nin (1) was defined as the score difference against the solution with the\nhighest score using the same number of gaps for that puzzle. The player\nconsensus in (2) was defined as the centroid of the distribution of solutions.\nSolutions that were too far from this combined objective were excluded, and\nthe exclusion threshold was set to exclude about two-thirds of the solutions,\nto keep a subset that was most representative of the ensemble of high-quality\nplayer solutions. This threshold was selected experimentally based on visual\nexploration of rejected solutions: we selected a threshold for which no\nobvious outliers were included, and all excluded solutions were clear\noutliers.\n\n### Alignment improvement\n\nThe puzzle solutions are converted to positional sequence annotations, which\nare normalized to account for variance in coverage, and unannotated positions\nare filled with PASTA and/or Rfam version 14 (ref. ^33) alignment information.\n\nWe consider each high-quality annotation from one puzzle solved by one player\nas a vote. Our algorithm leverages dynamic programming through a compromise\nbetween Needleman\u2013Wunsch^55 and the voting system, in which we align a\nsequence to the array of votes.\n\n### Validation\n\nBecause the alignments produced by BLS are very different from the ones\nproduced by state-of-the-art software, such as MUSCLE version 5.1 (ref. ^28)\nor MAFFT version 7.490 (ref. ^29), it is difficult to fairly compare them as\nalignments. Thus, the validation process for our methods is centered around\nthe comparison of phylogenetic trees estimated from the alignment with\nFastTree 2.1 (ref. ^34).\n\n#### Small alignment benchmark\n\nAlong with the PASTA alignment that we computed as the scaffold for the\npuzzles, we ran MAFFT and MUSCLE on the same 9,667 sequences using both the\nstandard and slowest settings. We then generated phylogenies for all with\nFastTree\u2019s standard settings. These trees were then re-rooted using sequences\nclassified by naive Bayes with QIIME version 2\u2019s q2-feature-classifier^56\nagainst Greengenes 13.8 (ref. ^32) with Archaea as the outgroup.\n\n#### Comparison to SEPP\n\nThe state-of-the-art method for building phylogenetic trees from alignments\nhas been shown to be outperformed on gut microbiome data by the placement of\nthe sequences into an existing tree with SEPP^35,36, which, when sufficient\ndata are available, outperforms de novo phylogeny estimation from\nalignments^36. To build a reference phylogeny, we placed 9,667 sequence\ncluster representatives into the Greengenes 13.5 phylogenetic tree with SEPP\nand then removed all the other tips and re-rooted the tree to Archaea. We\nrefer to this tree as the Greengenes-SEPP reference tree.\n\nWe compare the de novo alignment methods to this Greengenes-SEPP reference\ntree by computing distances between randomly sampled subtrees of the de novo\nand reference trees, using two distance metrics:\n\nKendall\u2013Colijn metric^37, which compares the placement of the most recent\ncommon ancestor of each pair of tips, specifically designed for assessing\nsimilarity in evolutionary patterns and specifically designed for situations\nwhere the Robinson\u2013Foulds distance is not sensitive enough.\n\nTriplet distance^38, a metric that measures the structural dissimilarity of\ntwo phylogenetic trees by counting the number of rooted trees with exactly\nthree leaves that occur in one but not both trees.\n\nWhen comparing large trees, because these distances are very computationally\nexpensive, we sample 400 nodes for Kendall\u2013Colijn and 100 nodes for Triplet.\nThis process is repeated, respectively, 100 and five times. We performed these\nevaluations with the R treeDist^57 library, version 2.7.0. Trees were resized\nand sheared in Python 3.8 with scikit-bio version 0.5.\n\n#### Application to meta-analyses\n\nTo assess the impact of the BLS alignment on meta-analyses involving gut\nmicrobiome, the alignment results were propagated from cluster representatives\nto other sequences to build an alignment of 946,740 sequences, for which a\nphylogenetic tree was estimated with FastTree. To assess effect sizes, a\nfeature table representing the AGP data was obtained from redbiom version\n0.3.5 (ref. ^58), filtered for blooms and rarefied to 1,000 sequences per\nsample, and unweighted UniFrac^26 distances were computed for each tree (for\nexample, the BLS trees, de novo trees and the SEPP fragment insertion tree).\nPairwise effect sizes were then calculated with Evident version 0.4.0 (ref.\n^59) on the distance matrix using Cohen\u2019s d distributions for each tree. The\npairwise effect sizes of 74 non-technical variables were investigated (all\nvariables available on QIIME 2 meeting a minimum of two categories including\n50 samples). We reproduced these experiments with shuffled metadata to assess\nsignificance. We also examined two technical variables\u2014the sample plates and\nthe liquid handling robot\u2014and observed no significant change.\n\nIt should be noted that the aggregation of player solutions and the production\nof an alignment were not optimized for performance on effect sizes. This\nchoice aims to avoid overfitting by training to optimize for a phenotype, due\nto the relatively small size of those data. Furthermore, it was established in\nprevious work that there is a relationship between the quality of the tree and\nthe observed phenotype (effect sizes)^36. Thus, alignments were optimized on\ntree metrics, and effect sizes were kept as an independent evaluation. As\nexpected from previous work, the BLS alignment with the best tree metrics\n(listed in Table 1) also had the best effect sizes.\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nParticipation in the project was done entirely virtually, through the\nBorderlands 3 game. It was fully optional. No participants were recruited, and\npotential participants were informed of how and why the data would be used\nthrough a presentation video played before gameplay. Only gameplay data were\ncollected. No identifying or personal information about the participants was\ncollected, and participants were fully anonymous to the research team.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll the data discussed in this paper are publicly available for scientists and\nindividuals at https://games.cs.mcgill.ca/bls/.

R.S.-G. also designed and implemented the validation process and\ncomputed most of the results, authored most of the figures and wrote most of\nthe paper. P.G.G. designed and implemented much of the final version of the\nalignment improvement pipeline. A.B. designed and implemented much of the\ndatabase systems, managed the data and hardware systems and prepared the data\nrelease. T.K. contributed to the puzzle generation and alignment improvement\npipelines and improved the implementation of much of the project codebase.\nE.C. designed and implemented much of the final version of the solution\nfiltering pipeline. J.Z., R.M., J.M., Y.Z., E.N. and C.D. are the other\nmembers of the scientific team who contributed to the design and/or the\nimplementation of specific scripts and figures. This group performed this work\nunder the supervision of J.W. and M.B. at the School of Computer Science at\nMcGill University. M.B. contributed to the analysis of the results and\nreviewed the paper. J.W. contributed to the design of the game and methods,\nanalysis of the results, writing of the manuscript and the acquisition of\nfunding. The Borderlands Science mini game was developed by the Gearbox\nEntertainment Borderlands Science development team. The game design was\nperformed as a team under the supervision of G.R. The overall development and\nintegration of Borderlands Science into Borderlands 3 was coordinated by A.B.,\nunder the leadership of S.C. and R.P. Data collection and sequencing were\nperformed by The Microsetta Initiative, led by D.M. and R.K. They contributed\nto the scientific aspects of the project on aspects related to data,\nphylogeny, effect size computations and validation and reviewed the paper.\nA.Sz. presented the initial idea of the Borderlands Science concept and\ncontributed to the writing of the paper.
