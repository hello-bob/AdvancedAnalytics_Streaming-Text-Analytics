The first of these landings, on NASA's Artemis III mission, is currently\ntargeted for 2026, although this is widely viewed as an ambitious schedule.\n\nLast year, NASA awarded a contract to Blue Origin to develop its own human-\nrated Blue Moon lunar lander, giving Artemis managers two options for follow-\non missions.\n\nDesigners of both landers were future-minded. They designed Starship and Blue\nMoon for refueling in space. This means they can eventually be reused for\nmultiple missions, and ultimately, could take advantage of propellants\nproduced from resources on the Moon or Mars.\n\nAmit Kshatriya, who leads the \"Moon to Mars\" program within NASA's exploration\ndivision, outlined SpaceX's plan to do this in a meeting with a committee of\nthe NASA Advisory Council on Friday. He said the Starship test program is\ngaining momentum, with the next test flight from SpaceX's Starbase launch site\nin South Texas expected by the end of May.\n\n\"Production is not the issue,\" Kshatriya said. \"They're rolling cores out. The\nengines are flowing into the factory. That is not the issue. The issue is it\nis a significant development challenge to do what they\u2019re trying to do ... We\nhave to get on top of this propellant transfer problem. It is the right\nproblem to try and solve. We're trying to build a blueprint for deep space\nexploration.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Road map to refueling\n\nBefore getting to the Moon, SpaceX and Blue Origin must master the\ntechnologies and techniques required for in-space refueling. Right now, SpaceX\nis scheduled to attempt the first demonstration of a large-scale propellant\ntransfer between two Starships in orbit next year.\n\nThere will be at least several more Starship test flights before then. During\nthe most recent Starship test flight in March, SpaceX conducted a cryogenic\npropellant transfer test between two tanks inside the vehicle. This tank-to-\ntank transfer of liquid oxygen was part of a demonstration supported with NASA\nfunding. Agency officials said this demonstration would allow engineers to\nlearn more about how the fluid behaves in a low-gravity environment.\n\nKshatriya said that while engineers are still analyzing the results of the\ncryogenic transfer demonstration, the test on the March Starship flight \"was\nsuccessful by all accounts.\"\n\n\"That milestone is behind them,\" he said Friday. Now, SpaceX will move out\nwith more Starship test flights. The next launch will try to check off a few\nmore capabilities SpaceX didn't demonstrate on the March test flight.\n\nThese will include a precise landing of Starship's Super Heavy booster in the\nGulf of Mexico, which is necessary before SpaceX tries to land the booster\nback at its launch pad in Texas. Another objective will likely be the restart\nof a single Raptor engine on Starship in flight, which SpaceX didn't\naccomplish on the March flight due to unexpected roll rates on the vehicle as\nit coasted through space. Achieving an in-orbit engine restart\u2014necessary to\nguide Starship toward a controlled reentry\u2014is a prerequisite for future\nlaunches into a stable higher orbit, where the ship could loiter for hours,\ndays, or weeks to deploy satellites and attempt refueling.\n\nIn the long run, SpaceX wants to ramp up the Starship launch cadence to many\ndaily flights from multiple launch sites. To achieve that goal, SpaceX plans\nto recover and rapidly reuse Starships and Super Heavy boosters, building on\nexpertise from the partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX's\nfounder and CEO, is keen on reusing ships and boosters as soon as possible.\nEarlier this month, Musk said he is optimistic SpaceX can recover a Super\nHeavy booster in Texas later this year and land a Starship back in Texas\nsometime next year.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n105\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
