The satellite has reached low Earth orbit to\nbegin its mission to test next-generation technology that uses the power of\nsunlight as propulsion.\n\nNext, the solar sail satellite will power up and attempt initial contact with\nthe ground; a process that may occur overnight or in the next several days.\n\nFor updates, follow us on social media:\n\nTwitter: @NASAAmes, @NASA Facebook: NASA Ames, NASA Instagram: @NASAAmes,\n@NASA\n\nNASA Ames manages the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System project and\ndesigned and built the onboard camera diagnostic system. NASA Langley designed\nand built the deployable composite booms and solar sail system. NASA\u2019s Small\nSpacecraft Technology (SST) program office based at NASA Ames and led by the\nagency\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), funds and manages the\nmission. NASA STMD\u2019s Game Changing Development program developed the\ndeployable composite boom technology. Rocket Lab USA, Inc of Long Beach,\nCalifornia is providing launch services. NanoAvionics is providing the\nspacecraft bus.\n\nAuthor Arezu SarvestaniPosted on April 23, 2024April 24, 2024Categories Ames\nResearch Center, UncategorizedTags Advanced Composite Solar Sail System\n(ACS3), CubeSat, CubeSats, Electron, Rocket Lab\n\n## Archives\n\n## Categories\n\n## Meta\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n## Recent Comments\n\nSmall Satellite Missions National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA\nOfficial: Brian Dunbar\n\n  * No Fear Act\n  * FOIA\n  * Privacy\n  * Office of Inspector General\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n", "frontpage": false}
