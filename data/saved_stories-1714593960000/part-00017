Credit: SES\n\nUpdated 5:30 a.m. Eastern with comments from SES earnings call.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 SES is acquiring rival satellite operator Intelsat for $3.1\nbillion, a deal that would bring together two of the major GEO satellite\noperators in a market facing increased competition from LEO constellations.\n\nThe companies announced April 30 that they had agreed on the deal, subject to\nregulatory approvals. SES will pay $3.1 billion in cash along with certain\ncontingent value rights for 100% of Intelsat. The transaction is not expected\nto close until the second half of 2025.\n\nSES said it will fund the deal through existing cash on hand, which it\nestimates to be $2.6 billion at the end of March, along with debt. The\ncombined company would have about $4.1 billion in annual revenues and\nestimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (EBITDA) of $1.9 billion this year. The combined company will\nremain headquartered in Luxembourg, where SES is based, but will maintain a\n\u201csignificant presence\u201d at Intelsat\u2019s home in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\n\u201cIn a fast-moving and competitive satellite communication industry, this\ntransaction expands our multi-orbit space network, spectrum portfolio, ground\ninfrastructure around the world, go-to-market capabilities, managed service\nsolutions, and financial profile,\u201d Adel Al-Saleh, chief executive of SES, said\nin a statement.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, the Intelsat team has executed a remarkable\nstrategic reset,\u201d said David Wajsgras, chief executive of Intelsat, in that\nstatement, a reference to the company\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nreorganization. \u201cBy combining our financial strength and world-class team with\nthat of SES, we create a more competitive, growth-oriented solutions provider\nin an industry going through disruptive change.\u201d\n\nThe deal brings together operators of two of the largest operators of\ncommercial GEO communications satellites, a sector that once was the most\nlucrative part of the space industry but has been under increased pressure\nbecause of reduced demand from conventional television services and the rise\nof LEO constellations, like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, offering connectivity services.\nThe two companies have more than 100 GEO satellites combined, along with the\nmedium Earth orbit O3b constellation from SES.\n\nThe two companies have 13 satellites on order: four GEO satellites by Intelsat\nand two GEO satellites by SES, as well as seven O3b mPOWER satellites by SES.\nAl-Saleh said in an April 30 earnings call that the acquisition would result\nin capital expenditure savings, particularly in any future non-GEO satellite\nsystems. Intelsat had been studying its own MEO constellation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about optimizing the future of multi-orbit satellite investments and\nfleets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t need to spend as much money as we were\nspending separately. The combination will give us the opportunity to reduce\nthat.\u201d\n\nThe deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the satellite communications\nsector that in recent years has included Viasat\u2019s acquisition of Inmarsat and\nEutelsat\u2019s acquisition of OneWeb. There had been rumors in the last two years\nthat SES and Intelsat would combine, and SES confirmed in March 2023 the two\ncompanies had been in talks. However, three months later Intelsat walked away\nfrom those discussions after the companies couldn\u2019t resolve differences.\n\nAl-Saleh, who started at SES in February, said on the earnings call that\nnegotiations on the Intelsat deal were already underway when he became CEO.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t something that I kicked off,\u201d he said, stating that SES was\nlooking at \u201cmultiple\u201d merger and acquisition opportunities as well as returns\nto shareholders from its FCC C-band clearing proceeds. \u201cIt was clear to us\nthat this particular transaction, if we\u2019re able to successfully close it with\nthe right type of value, is the most compelling proposition we had on the\ntable.\u201d\n\nThe timing for a deal now was better than last year, he said, citing\nIntelsat\u2019s growth since its emergence from Chapter 11 among other factors.\n\u201cBoth companies have gone through quite a significant evolution in a very\nshort period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cDave and I saw real value here and worked\nvery hard together to figure out how to make this thing happen.\u201d He added that\nthe structure of the deal \u2014 an acquisition of Intelsat by SES, rather than a\nmerger of the two companies \u2014 is easier.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing was the desire of both companies to build something unique\nhere,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe both the opportunity to create something valuable to\nour clients and to the market.\u201d\n\nAl-Saleh said he did not think the acquisition would raise any antitrust\nconcerns, including in the United States given that both companies provide\nservices to the U.S. military. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be a significant, overarching\nshare of U.S. government spend. It will be spread across several, many\nplayers.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n#### Intelsat expands OneWeb LEO partnership\n\nGeostationary satellite operator Intelsat has bought at least five times more\ncapacity from Eutelsat\u2019s OneWeb low Earth orbit constellation to strengthen\nits multi-orbit broadband strategy.\n\n#### Army exploring new options to tap commercial satellite networks\n\nThe Army wants seamless access to satellites in various orbits, so if one\nnetwork goes down, others instantly take over.\n\n#### US government could help fund Intelsat\u2019s MEO plans\n\nIntelsat is in talks with the U.S. government to help fund 17 medium Earth\norbit satellites to expand the operator\u2019s multi-orbit broadband network.\n\nTagged: Intelsat, SES\n\n## Jeff Foust\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.
