This is a big deal since we are a small team, competing with giants\nwho are already the de-facto defaults on their devices. Let\u2019s have a look...\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\nFirst, there is an exciting boost in performance with the switch to a\nChromium-based backend as you can see in the demo below:\n\nChromium backend vs Gecko Backend WebGL Performance (2.6MB MP4, no audio)\n\n## Additional APIs/Active Support\n\nBecause of when work stopped on Wolvic\u2019s predecessor, and the fact that there\nweren\u2019t other active downstream products funding development, the Gecko\nimplementation also trailed feature-wise. Because many parties who are\nbuilding XR have been investing in Chromium, it has a lot of work upstream and\nadds support for the WebXR AR module, WebXR layers, hand tracking, and there\nis even more as under active development.\n\nAll of this means that Wolvic can be more competitive, more efficiently.\n\n### Engine Diversity and Future Plans\n\nWe know that while this is very exciting and planned since our first\nannouncement, many will have questions. We wanted to offer a little more than\njust our excitement to help answer some of them.\n\nThis beta release is not a complete picture of our plans with Chromium. It\ndoes not, for example, support extensions or sync. It will as it matures.\n\nWe\u2019re not immediately abandoning the Gecko version, we\u2019ll continue to release\nGecko-based APKs for some time. That said, over time, its maintenance will\nslowly give way to maintenance of the Chromium version, unless we can find\nfunding to specifically keep the Gecko version going (and make it competitive)\nlong-term.\n\nWe do currently plan to ultimately switch to the Chromium build as our primary\noffering in stores in the near- to mid-term future as it matures.\n\nThe main reason for this is that Chromium is (currently) very advantaged, and\ndoubly so in AOS-based devices. Gecko simply does not have the same level of\nmaintenance or development of its WebXR implementation. It doesn\u2019t integrate\nwell with the engine\u2019s GPU process, nor does it currently receive development\npriority from Mozilla, which means no new features. Further, there is\n(currently, at least) no viable WebKit for Android competitor on which to\nbuild.\n\nThat said, Igalia remains committed to engine diversity, as exemplified by our\nwork advancing Servo and WPE-WebKit, as well as our long track record of\nmerging improvements and new web features to WebKit, Gecko, and Chromium. We\nalso remain committed to using the best available solution for a given\ncontext, and in this context, Chromium is currently the best choice. If that\nchanges over time, we will be able to switch engines without breaking the\nWolvic experience for our users, thanks to our work to make Wolvic engine-\nagnostic.\n\nLegal terms Privacy\n\n2024 Igalia SL\n\n", "frontpage": false}
