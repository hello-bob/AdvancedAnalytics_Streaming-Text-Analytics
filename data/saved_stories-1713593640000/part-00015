This online portal aims to empower the public to\nreport potential violations, thereby bolstering regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\n\nUnveiled on April 18, HealthyCompetition.gov provides a crucial channel for\nindividuals to voice concerns about practices that could harm consumers and\nworkers alike. FTC Chair Lina Khan emphasized the significance of this\ninitiative, stating that it will enable agencies to identify and address\nillegal business tactics effectively.\n\n\u201cThe launch of HealthyCompetition.gov marks a significant step in our ongoing\nefforts to safeguard fair competition in healthcare,\u201d said Khan. \u201cBy\nsoliciting input from the public, we aim to root out monopolistic behaviors\nthat undermine the delivery of essential healthcare services.\u201d\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra echoed Khan\u2019s sentiments, underlining the Biden-\nHarris Administration\u2019s commitment to promoting competitive healthcare markets\nand reducing costs for patients and providers. \u201cIt is our responsibility to\ncombat monopolistic and anti-competitive practices that hinder Americans\u2019\naccess to quality healthcare,\u201d said Becerra. \u201cThe insights provided by the\npublic will play a vital role in identifying and addressing these harmful\nbehaviors.\u201d\n\nThe online portal enables individuals to report potentially unfair practices\ndirectly to the FTC and the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.\nComplaints will undergo preliminary review by agency staff, with a focus on\nidentifying those that raise significant concerns under antitrust laws or fall\nwithin the purview of HHS authorities. Selected complaints will then undergo\nfurther investigation, potentially leading to the initiation of formal probes.\n\nThe launch of HealthyCompetition.gov aligns with broader efforts by the Biden-\nHarris Administration to promote transparency, accountability, and fairness in\nhealthcare markets. By empowering individuals to report questionable\npractices, the portal seeks to create a more level playing field that benefits\npatients, providers, payers, and workers alike.\n\nAs concerns about healthcare costs and access continue to mount, the launch of\nHealthyCompetition.gov signals a proactive approach by federal agencies to\naddress systemic issues and ensure that healthcare remains affordable and\naccessible for all Americans.\n\nSource: FTC\n\n#### Featured News\n\nDOJ and FTC Introduce Website for Reporting Anti-Competitive Healthcare\nPractices Apr 18, 2024 by CPI\n\nUS Congress Advances Legislation to Compel TikTok Sale Apr 18, 2024 by CPI\n\nUK Financial Sector Advocates Enhanced Regulatory Accountability Apr 18, 2024\nby CPI\n\nGoogle and All 50 States Defend $700 Million Consumer Settlement Apr 18, 2024\nby CPI\n\nColorado Enacts First Law to Protect Consumer Brainwave Data Apr 18, 2024 by\nCPI\n\n#### Antitrust Mix by CPI\n\nAntitrust Chronicle\u00ae \u2013 Economics of Criminal Antitrust Apr 19, 2024 by CPI\n\nNavigating Economic Expert Work in Criminal Antitrust Litigation Apr 19, 2024\nby CPI\n\nThe Increased Importance of Economics in Cartel Cases Apr 19, 2024 by CPI\n\nA Law and Economics Analysis of the Antitrust Treatment of Physician\nCollective Price Agreements Apr 19, 2024 by CPI\n\nInformation Exchange In Criminal Antitrust Cases: How Economic Testimony Can\nTip The Scales Apr 19, 2024 by CPI\n\nCPI TV | Subscribe\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Editorial Policy\n  * Editorial Advisory Board\n\n#### Getting Started\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Partnerships\n  * Newsletters\n\n#### Follow CPI\n\n\u00a9 Competition Policy International 2024\n\nPrivacy Policy | Terms & Conditions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
