DOI: 10.1038/s41560-024-01476-z\n\nReliably monitoring the amount of lithium (Li) present in rechargeable\nbatteries, specifically in the so-called cathode active material (CAM), is key\nto understanding the condition of batteries from the time when it is\nfabricated to the end of its operation. However, a reliable methodology to\ndirectly track the active Li in batteries without damaging them does not exist\nyet.\n\nExisting methods to estimate the amount of Li in batteries rely on capacity\nmeasurements, describing how much charge a battery can hold, and coulombic\nefficiency values, which indicate how much charge a battery retains during\ncycles. Yet these measurements are not always accurate, as they do not account\nfor unpredictable side reactions, self-discharge, and other effects affecting\na battery's performance.\n\nResearchers at Idaho National Laboratory and Binghamton University recently\nset out to test the performance of Li-battery cells with different\nformulations and underlying configurations under different conditions. Based\non their findings, published in Nature Energy, the team devised a new\nframework that could help to reliably compare data collected when testing\nrechargeable batteries to results obtained during their real-world operation\nin different conditions.\n\n\"The primary objective of our study was to find a reliable methodology to\ncompare battery testing data and operating results from various sources and\nconditions, as this could help to advance battery technology and development,\"\nBoryann Liaw, co-author of the paper, told Tech Xplore.\n\n\"The conventional battery capacity analysis is empirical, heavily relying on\ntest protocols and conditions, lacking a reliable framework for comparison.\nThis work provides a thermodynamic framework and methodology that can compare\ndata from across the board consistently.\"\n\nLeveraging the theoretical capacity of a transition metal oxide, the\nresearchers were able to reliable estimate how much Li was in a battery's\nelectrode. This allowed them to monitor small changes in the composition at\nthe interface between a battery's electrode and electrolyte.\n\nAs part of their study, Liaw and his colleagues used a total of 12 Li-NMC\n(layered transition metal oxide cathode material) cells with various chemical\nformulations and structural configurations, under a wide range of conditions.\nThe results they collected were used to demonstrate a matrix that is\ntraditionally difficult to perform, outlining a quantitative comparison among\nthese cells.\n\n\"We introduced a reliable fundamental thermodynamic framework and methodology\nthat can compare various battery test data from across the board in a\nrationalized quantitative manner,\" Liaw said. \"This approach can substantially\nreduce resources for battery testing and time to market, enable effective and\nreliable battery manufacturing, operating, and management strategies, and\nprovide a secured and safe supply chain.\"\n\nThe recent framework devised by Liaw and his collaborators sheds further light\non variables affecting the performance of battery cells and their electrodes\nover time. In the future, it could help other research groups to optimize\ntheir battery technologies, improving their performance and reliability. This\ncould in turn prompt to the introduction of new promising rechargeable Li\nbatteries with higher storage capacities and longer lifespans.\n\n\"We now plan to work with academia and industry partners to broaden the\napplications of this approach to help battery research and development\nefforts,\" Liaw added.\n\nMore information: Meng Li et al, Lithium inventory tracking as a non-\ndestructive battery evaluation and monitoring method, Nature Energy (2024).\nDOI: 10.1038/s41560-024-01476-z.\n\nJournal information: Nature Energy\n\n\u00a9 2024 Science X Network\n\nCitation: A framework to compare lithium battery testing data and results\nduring operation (2024, April 26) retrieved 29 April 2024 from\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-framework-lithium-battery-results.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
