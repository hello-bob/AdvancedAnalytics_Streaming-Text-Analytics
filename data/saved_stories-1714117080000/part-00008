Now that the edition has launched, fans are not happy with the\nbonus it gives and the massive $250 price tag.\n\nThe first issue that fans have is that the player versus environment mode for\nTarkov is exclusive to those who buy the new edition. This is despite the fact\nthat anyone who purchased the old Edge of Darkness edition was promised all\nfuture DLC content as part of the season pass, which you would think would\ninclude this new mode.\n\nA lot of fans who have the EoD edition are, rightfully, very annoyed that they\nnow have to upgrade from the EoD edition, which costs $100, in order to play\nit. However, some posts on the official Discord have tried to explain why BSG\nthinks this is not DLC.\n\n\u201cIt ain't DLC, its unique feature of the new edition added,\u201d said Discord user\nappl3z0r, who is the Lead Community Manager at Battlestate Games for Escape\nfrom Tarkov.\n\n\u201cDLC means additional downloadable content. PvE is a feature and a gamemode,\u201d\nthey added in another message. \u201cJust because you all want it to become a DLC\nit wouldn't mean it is one. It\u2019s featured game mode for the new edition of the\ngame.\u201d\n\nThe other major issue that fans have been complaining about is the big in-game\nbonuses players with the new edition will get. While other editions of the\ngame give some bonuses, so far none have been major factors when on the map\nand fighting with other players, the closest is extra loot that they get at\nthe start of a wipe. However, this new edition includes more space to store\nloot when on the map, improved skills at the start of a wipe and a bonus where\nAI scavs will not shoot at them if they have over six reputation levels with\nFence.\n\nForbes VettedFor You\n\n### The Best Gaming Mouse That\u2019ll Improve Your Aim\n\nBy\n\nJon Martindale\n\nContributor\n\nThese, along with some of the other bonuses, have led to the edition being\nlabelled pay to win, with players who buy it expected to have a big advantage\nover those who do not have it, especially at the start of a wipe.\n\nThe reaction to the new edition has been so negative that all but three\nchannels in the official Escape From Tarkov Discord server have been silenced,\nwith users not able to post in them. Moderators on the game\u2019s sub-Reddit are\nalso waiving the rule that prevents multiple posts about the same topic,\nsaying that they are \u201cjust as livid about this situation as you.\u201d\n\nBattlestate Games did not respond to my request for comment prior to\npublication.\n\nBattlestate Games is yet to officially comment on the backlash from fans,\nhowever, with pressure mounting from fans and some even looking into legal\naction, you would expect them to do so sooner rather than later.\n\nThe move also comes at a very bad time given that Gray Zone Warfare, a game\nmany see as a competitor to Tarkov, has just wrapped up its first public\nstreamer test which has gone down incredibly well with fans. With public\nsentiment towards Tarkov very low, many fans are hoping they can get hands-on\nwith GZW sooner rather than later.\n\nUpdate 8:15 pm BST:\n\nThe official Escape From Tarkov X account has posted a statement that seems to\nsuggest Battlestate Games has no plans to make the new mode available to\nanyone who does not buy the new edition.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
