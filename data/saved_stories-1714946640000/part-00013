The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase.

The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

She has written about open\nmarriages, treatment for menopause and the efficacy of therapy.\n\n  * May 5, 2024\n\nThis spring, Barbara and Joe, a retired couple in their 60s, sat down with me\nat a bistro in suburban Connecticut to talk about their relationship. That\nthey were sitting there together at all was something of a triumph. In the\npast few days, they had hurled at each other the kinds of accusations that\ncouples make when they are on the brink of mutual destruction. They were\nbruised from the words that had been exchanged, and although they sat close to\neach other, their energy was quiet and heavy.\n\n### Listen to this article, read by Kirsten Potter\n\nListen 17:38\n\nBarbara and Joe met 13 years ago, two divorced people who had relentlessly\nclimbed their way up from working-class backgrounds. Barbara rose to be the\nvice president of a wholesale apparel business before moving into retail, then\nwinding down her career; to keep herself busy, she sells clothing online a few\nhours a day. Joe co-founded a delivery business that he sold in 2021 for an\namount that meant he would never have to work again; he retired in January\nlast year. He and Barbara had time; they had money; they had leisure. They\nalso had a problem: They were driving each other mad.\n\nBarbara briefed me on her experience before we met in person. Since\nretirement, she reported, Joe had found himself untethered. He was underfoot,\nalways around and not exactly occupied. It was bad enough that he was spending\nhours on his phone scrolling through Instagram, bad enough that he was doing\nso on a couch in the living room, a space that had always been hers and hers\nalone throughout the day. Now he also wanted her to look at the funny dog\nvideos that made him laugh, and yes, funny pig videos too. She did not find\nthis particularly sexy, but he also wanted more sex than when he was working,\none of many ways she felt the burden of keeping him entertained. \u201cLove him\nvery much,\u201d she texted. \u201cBut I\u2019m going crazy or going back to work, whichever\ncomes first.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt lunch that day, Joe wore a pink flannel shirt that suited him and had\nclearly been picked out by someone with a tasteful eye. He seemed nervous\nabout discussing his relationship, which reflected just one of the many\ndifferences the couple had to negotiate: Barbara was frank and open by nature;\nJoe was more private (which is why they\u2019ve requested that only their first\nnames be used).\n\nFor years, Joe said, he had been monomaniacally focused on his exit \u2014 on\nselling the business. He had given almost no thought to what his life would\nlook like once he finally did. \u201cI had visions of going to the gym,\u201d he said.\nThat turned out to take up no more than an hour of his day. Then what? He was\nat something of a loss. \u201cIt\u2019s been a kind of transition trying to move away\nfrom people that were like my second family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little\nenlightening that once you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nA life transition as significant as marrying or having children, retirement is\na stage that many couples anticipate with little of the trepidation those\nearlier choices inspired. They look forward to it as a reward for years of\nhard work \u2014 a long vacation, full of agency and freedom, to enjoy as long as\ntheir bodies hold up. Yet retirement, like any major transition, often entails\ndestabilizing shifts that take many people by surprise. Although it\u2019s still\nrare for married couples over 60 to break up, the divorce rate is rising\nfaster in that age group than in any other, as baby boomers accustomed to\nself-actualization reach retirement age and evaluate their lives anew.\n\n\u201cThe relationship can have an identity crisis,\u201d says Allison Howe, a therapist\nwho works primarily with couples in New York. Howe says retirement is a time\nwhen the issues that couples have been avoiding \u2014 aided by the distractions of\nwork or child rearing or both \u2014 come roaring to the forefront. \u201cThere are\ndisagreements now about how to envision this new stage of life,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe retirement phase amplifies everything, actually \u2014 the absence of true\ncollaboration, whether they were really friends, whether they had a shared\nnarrative. All of these things get heightened now because we have less time.\u201d\n\nCouples have less time on a grand scale while contending, suddenly, with more\nfree time in their waking hours. Many disagree on how to spend it. \u201cI can do\nanything I want, but lack an activity partner,\u201d reported Danny Steiner, a\nrecently retired 70-year-old high school teacher whose wife does not share his\npassion for travel \u2014 a difference that really manifested only once it was an\noption. More time can lay bare the reality that some couples did better with\nless of it. \u201cBeing together just does not feel as special as it once did,\u201d\nsaid Martha Battie, a retired college administrator in Hanover, N.H. \u201cWhatever\nconversations or sharing we have seems to be forgotten, or not really heard\nfrom the start.\u201d And more time means more exposure to whatever irritating\nhabits were easily endured in smaller doses. Among the things that grated on\nher, Barbara had texted, was that Joe \u201cmansplains everything.\u201d He had always\nbeen that way, she knew, but now she had to deal with so much more of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter some 50 years of marriage, decades during which she often wished her\nhusband worked fewer hours, Yvonne McCracken, at age 73, found herself hoping\nthat the office might reclaim him. When her husband, Richard McCracken,\nretired from the business he built, Yvonne was still working from their home\nin Charlotte, N.C., as a quality-assurance specialist for a network of\nresearch sites, and she could feel him hovering near her desk off the kitchen\nas he did busy work on his laptop.\n\nHaving left her largely in charge, for most of their marriage, of raising two\ndaughters, dealing with the home and managing her own career, Richard now\nseemed to have had some late-in-life revelation that his wife could clearly\nbenefit from his input. He had ideas about how she should manage her team,\nwhich he sometimes shared after she completed Zoom calls: She should have told\nthem to solve a problem a certain way, or given them more direction. The\nadvice irritated Yvonne, who is not a fan of micromanagement (of herself or\nothers). \u201cI\u2019m a very private person,\u201d Yvonne said, \u201cand the fact that he was\neven listening to my phone calls was, my God, it was like: I can\u2019t believe\nyou\u2019re doing this. What? Why are you here?\u201d Sometimes he walked past her\ncomputer and waved and smiled and mugged for her co-workers, which annoyed her\njust as much as his unsolicited counsel.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nYvonne and Richard McCracken.Credit...David Hilliard for The New York Times\n\nShe wondered: Was this what he was like as a boss at the business he ran? She\nsupposed so. She had never given her husband\u2019s work persona much thought. That\npart of his life was separate from her own, but instead of receding now that\nhe was retired, it seemed to be taking up even more space. When Richard\nstarted picking up consulting work to stave off his own restlessness, he took\nover their kitchen, spreading papers and folders on various surfaces and\nleaving half-filled coffee cups and laptop chargers lying around. \u201cIt destroys\nthe energy in the house,\u201d Yvonne said. She told me they had agreed that he\ncould no longer work in the kitchen; Richard seemed to have the impression\nthat he had simply promised to clean up at the end of each day. He told me\nthat his wife was becoming a minimalist. \u201cI\u2019m kind of the opposite,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI always tend to spread out \u2014 like mold.\u201d\n\nThe couple had coexisted on separate tracks for many years, so much so that\neven the sweet moments of retirement, like weekends with their grandchildren,\nto whom Richard was devoted, kicked up feelings of regret and loss for Yvonne.\nAs a working mother, she had done the large part of the child rearing on her\nown, without a fully invested partner. \u201cHe\u2019ll say to me about the\ngrandchildren, Wow, they\u2019re so bright and interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll\nsay, You know, your own children were very bright and interesting, too.\u201d\nRegrets about the past were colliding with the minutiae of how they would\ncoexist as they faced aging together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYvonne and Richard shared, at least, a similar vision of how to approach their\nfinances, which can be a source of tension for many retired couples. Financial\ntroubles can rob them of their peace of mind, and even those who are well\nprepared are often surprised to find that they have different instincts about\nhow to manage their savings.\n\nFrances and Tito Sisnett, pharmacists from California, had saved carefully for\nyears. After they retired \u2014 Frances in 2016, Tito in 2017 \u2014 Frances was\ndetermined to hold on tight to the money they worked so hard to earn. Tito\nwanted to travel frequently to Panama and Barbados, where he had family. He\nhad done the calculations and knew that with their savings and investments,\nthey could afford it. But fear was baked into Frances\u2019s decision-making\nprocess; at age 12, she experienced the precipitous collapse of her family\u2019s\nfinancial security when her father died unexpectedly and her mother fell ill.\nNo matter how many times Tito explained the math, she worried that they would\nrun out of funds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change the way you think,\u201d Tito recalled\ntelling her. \u201cThat was many hours of discussion.\u201d\n\nEventually, they hired a financial adviser, who delivered the same assurance\nthat Tito was already providing; Frances could accept it from a professional,\nand she was able to move on from what seemed like an unshakable stance.\n\nIn 2020, Frances and Tito, who felt ready to live outside the United States,\nmoved to Panama near his family. Now they faced the question of travel in\nreverse: How much time were they going to spend with their grandchildren back\nin Maryland? Having been more reluctant to leave for Panama in the first\nplace, Frances was now trying to build a life in their new home, which meant\nmaking a fierce commitment to spending time there. Tito, who already had\nstrong connections in Panama, was much more eager to spend extended periods\nwith the grandchildren.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nTito and Frances Sisnett.Credit...David Hilliard for The New York Times\n\nNot long after moving to Panama, Frances and Tito became friendly with\nCharlotte Van Horn, a fellow retiree who left a career as a legal assistant\nand has since built a business helping Black couples make homes there. Frances\nand Tito have found a way to negotiate their different preferences about\ntravel, but sometimes, Van Horn says, the issue of how much time to spend\nwhere, and with whom, is the thing that ultimately divides previously happy\ncouples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou have one person who says, I\u2019m not leaving the grandchildren,\u201d she told\nme. \u201cAnd the other says: I\u2019ve spent my whole life staying in certain places\nand doing certain things because I was raising my own kids. I\u2019m not going to\nlet someone else\u2019s kids keep me from doing what I really want to do in life.\u201d\nVan Horn has seen some couples decide that they will be apart for months of\nthe year while visiting back and forth. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worked,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cThey\u2019re breaking up, but they\u2019re not admitting it. It\u2019s too painful. So\nthey just ... let it go by the wayside.\u201d\n\nEarly in his career, John Gottman, a founder of the Gottman Institute, a\ncenter devoted to the study of successful marriages, believed that the best\npredictor of happiness in retirement would be a robust \u201csecond identity\u201d for\none or both members of the couple outside of work. \u201cSo if you were a mechanic\nbut you also sang in the choir, in church on weekends, or you flew hang\ngliders or something like that, and it was important to you,\u201d Gottman thought,\nthen the pain of the loss of one identity would be dulled by the full\nemergence of the second.\n\nBut research over the years has found only a limited effect of a second\nidentity on happiness in that phase of life. The much more important factor,\nGottman told me, is the quality of the marriage before retirement. The Health\nand Retirement Study, a sweeping national research project now in its 32nd\nyear, found that an unhappy marriage predicts unhappiness in retirement more\nthan declines in wealth or even health, says Mo Wang, a professor at the\nUniversity of Florida who studies the retirement adjustment.\n\nWhether couples are able to help each other stretch, a concept that social\nscientists call \u201cself-expansion,\u201d also matters. Strong self-expansion skills \u2014\nthe ability to make new friends or pick up new interests that require\ndedicated learning \u2014 are correlated with everything from general well-being to\neven weight loss and cognitive health. Not surprising, researchers in 2020\nfound that couples who reported high levels of that kind of reinforcement \u2014\nencouraging each other to try something new, for example \u2014 were happier and\nwere weathering the transition much better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBarbara told me that she had been encouraging Joe to try new things. At the\nsame time, she clearly didn\u2019t see it as her job to figure out for him what\nthose things might be. She frustrated easily. She snapped often, by her own\nadmission. Her irritation was a function of how perilously close she was to\nlosing touch with what she admired in this tremendously industrious and\ncompetent partner. \u201cMy friends tell me I\u2019m going to lose him,\u201d Barbara said.\n\u201cThey tell me, You have to be nicer. But ... I just can\u2019t. I am who I am.\nAfter all these years, I can\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nAt lunch, Joe said that there were, in fact, things he would like to be doing\nwith his time, if he could only get motivated to focus on them. \u201cI always\nwanted to play guitar,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like a music banana.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Barbara confirmed. (She seemed to know that this meant he was a music\nenthusiast.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried a few times,\u201d he said, \u201cand I never could make it stick.\u201d He had\nlooked at a few guitar classes online, to no avail, even though he said that\nonce he commits to a project, he really commits. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m pretty good\nonce I get going,\u201d he said. (\u201cHe is,\u201d Barbara confirmed.) \u201cIt\u2019s just, now I\ndon\u2019t.\u201d And that was where they had left it: Joe paralyzed. Barbara annoyed,\nfor months now.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nJoe and Barbara.Credit...David Hilliard for The New York Times\n\nCouldn\u2019t a guitar instructor visit the house one day a week? Provide some\nfocus, some company, some structure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBarbara and Joe seemed to brighten at the thought. That was something he could\ndo. Maybe there were other things they could do too, like rethink how they\nused space if they were always in each other\u2019s way. Barbara had complained\nthat when she was online in their living room, trying to post garments on\neBay, she could feel Joe\u2019s presence in a way that was unnerving, even when he\nwas ignoring her.\n\nWasn\u2019t his office upstairs empty? What if she worked there for a few discrete\nhours a day, so that expectations all around were clear?\n\n\u201cIf I go up there,\u201d Barbara said, \u201cit\u2019s almost like saying, OK, you want me to\nbe away.\u201d She thought this over. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the only one who needed the\nspace. Maybe Joe wanted some, too. \u201cI do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Barbara said, \u201cwell, we never really discussed this.\u201d She suddenly saw\nnot just her perception of Joe but his perception of her. She was overcome\nwith remorse about how she had been talking to him. \u201cI tell people stories\nabout what\u2019s going on between us, expecting sympathy, and they\u2019re like, What\u2019s\nwrong with you?\u201d she admitted.\n\nAs they spoke, it became clear that they were each struggling with the reality\nthat Joe was feeling something close to depression. He had taken it very hard\nwhen he had lunch with some former colleagues, people still working long hours\nat the business, and had the sense that once they said their farewells after\nthe meal, they would rarely give him another thought. Seeing that\nvulnerability moved Barbara. For Joe, retirement meant looking back on the\ntotality of his life and trying to weigh what all that effort had added up to.\nWhat did it mean?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the weeks after our conversation, Joe and Barbara seemed to pull themselves\nback from the brink. It took him some time, but Joe had, on his own, found a\nguitar instructor. He spent hours on the phone with Barbara\u2019s ex-husband, an\navid musician, talking about how to tune and clamp the instrument. After the\ninstructor came and gave Joe his first lesson, he was even more enthusiastic.\nSince then, he had been working for hours on the song he was learning, Pearl\nJam\u2019s cover of \u201cLast Kiss.\u201d\n\nBarbara loved hearing it. She was reflecting on how she had always prided\nherself on being strong, on being independent, her response to a hardscrabble\nchildhood in which she was overlooked. \u201cYou know, I just want to do what I\nwant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s going to feel tremendous guilt\nabout not doing something I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d But she was moving away from\nher insistence that she couldn\u2019t change, that she wouldn\u2019t change, to a\nrecognition that maybe she could and should, even if it took effort. \u201cThe\nthought of him not being around, of being with someone else, makes me think:\nWhat are these big sacrifices I\u2019m making? The big sacrifice would be if we\nweren\u2019t together.\u201d\n\nRead by Kirsten Potter\n\nNarration produced by Anna Diamond\n\nEngineered by Ted Blaisdell\n\nDavid Hilliard is an artist and educator from Boston.
