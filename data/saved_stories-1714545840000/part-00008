And I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\"\n\nThe House committee called Witty to explain himself as it is this week probing\nthe Change Healthcare cyberattack. The US Senate Finance Committee is holding\na hearing Wednesday along the same lines, and Witty will testify at both\ninquiries.\n\nPlus, three US Senators on Monday sent a letter [PDF] to the US government's\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) asking the infosec\nbody to provide details about how it's helping Change Healthcare recover from\nthe February IT breach, as well as the larger risk from ransomware.\n\n### Crims spent nine days snooping around\n\nOn February 12, ALPHV ransomware affiliates gained access to the healthcare\norg's IT systems using \"compromised credentials to remotely access a Change\nHealthcare Citrix portal, an application used to enable remote access to\ndesktops,\" according to Witty's upcoming testimony.\n\n\"The portal did not have multi-factor authentication,\" Witty will testify\nduring the House committee hearing. \"Once the threat actor gained access, they\nmoved laterally within the systems in more sophisticated ways and exfiltrated\ndata. Ransomware was deployed nine days later.\"\n\nALPHV criminals activated its malware on February 21, \"encrypting Change's\nsystems so we could not access them,\" according to the written testimony.\n\nAnd that's when hospitals and pharmacies across the US that use Change's\ninsurance and billing services ground to a screeching halt, preventing\npatients from receiving much-needed medications and medical services under\ntheir health plans.\n\nIt took weeks for UnitedHealth, which owns Change Healthcare and Optum, to\nbegin bringing electronic prescriptions back online in early March.\n\nThe healthcare giant has said the ransomware infection has cost it $870\nmillion so far, and that figure could hit $1.6 billion for the year.\n\n### More ransomware crews pile on\n\nUpon discovering the ransomware infection, UnitedHealth \"immediately severed\nconnectivity with Change's datacenters\" to prevent the malware from spreading,\nthe testimony tells us. But by then, the crooks had already stolen a ton of\nprotected health data and personally identifiable information covering \"a\nsubstantial proportion of people in America.\"\n\nIn addition to the ALPHV affiliate, another criminal crew RansomHub later\nreleased alleged personal patient data from the break-in and also demanded a\nransom.\n\nAnd just last week, a third ransomware group \u2014 Medusa \u2014 claimed to have\ncracked servers belonging to healthcare services network Northeast Ohio\nNeighborhood Health, and stolen almost 51GB of data.\n\nAccording to SuspectFile, which first reported this intrusion, many of the\nstolen records belong to patients associated with health insurance contracts\nat UnitedHealth.\n\nUnitedHealth contacted the FBI \"within hours\" of the ransomware attack,\naccording to Witty, and by the afternoon of February 21 it had a whole team of\nheavy-hitters working to secure the perimeter and rebuild Change's IT systems.\nThis included incident responders from Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks, along\nwith experts from Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon, and others.\n\n\"The team replaced thousands of laptops, rotated credentials, rebuilt Change\nHealthcare's data center network and core services, and added new server\ncapacity,\" Witty's testimony reads. \"The team delivered a new technology\nenvironment in just weeks \u2014 an undertaking that would have taken many months\nunder normal circumstances.\"\n\n  * UnitedHealth admits IT security breach could 'cover substantial proportion of people in America'\n  * Change Healthcare's ransomware attack costs edge toward $1B so far\n  * Change Healthcare faces second ransomware dilemma weeks after ALPHV attack\n  * US to probe Change Healthcare's data protection standards as lawsuits mount\n\nAlso according to Witty, this ransomware attack wasn't an isolated event.\nUnitedHealth wards off attempted digital break-ins every 70 seconds,\n\"thwarting more than 450,000 intrusions per year,\" he claimed. It really does\ndepend on how you measure an intrusion, attempt or otherwise.\n\nIn light of these escalating attacks targeting hospitals and other critical\ninfrastructure, Witty says he supports policy changes to mandate better\ncybersecurity practices among healthcare organizations.\n\n\"We support mandatory minimum security standards \u2014 developed collaboratively\nby the government and private sector \u2014 for the health-care industry,\" his\ntestimony reads. \"Importantly, these efforts must include funding and training\nfor institutions that need help in making that transition, such as hospitals\nin rural communities.\"\n\nUnitedHealth also supports other efforts to improve US cybersecurity including\n\"greater notification to law enforcement and standardized and nationalized\ncybersecurity event reporting,\" Witty will tell lawmakers on Wednesday. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Healthcare\n  * Security\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Healthcare\n  * Security\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Firewall\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Kenna Security\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Pfizer\n  * Phishing\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Zero trust\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Healthcare\n  * Security\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Healthcare\n  * Security\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Firewall\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Kenna Security\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Pfizer\n  * Phishing\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Zero trust\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Governments issue alerts after 'sophisticated' state-backed actor found\nexploiting flaws in Cisco security boxes\n\nDon't get too comfortable: 'Line Dancer' malware may be targeting other\nvendors, too\n\nSecurity6 days | 10\n\n#### Ransomware feared as IT 'issues' force Octapharma Plasma to close 150+\ncenters\n\nUpdated Source blames BlackSuit infection \u2013 as separately ISP Frontier\nconfirms cyberattack\n\nCyber-crime12 days | 9\n\n#### London Drugs closes all of its pharmacies following 'cybersecurity\nincident'\n\nUpdated Canadian stores shuttered 'until further notice'\n\nCSO1 day | 15\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### 185K people's sensitive data in the pits after ransomware raid on Cherry\nHealth\n\nExtent of information seized will be a concern for those affected\n\nCyber-crime12 days | 6\n\n#### Crooks exploit OpenMetadata holes to mine crypto \u2013 and leave a sob story\nfor victims\n\n'I want to buy a car.
