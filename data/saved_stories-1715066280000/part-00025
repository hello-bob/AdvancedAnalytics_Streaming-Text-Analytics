Gone are the days of horse-drawn combines\u2014today\u2019s\ncombines steer automatically, produce reports on crop yields, and coordinate\nwith drones and weather stations to determine how and when to fertilize.\nTogether, these technologies are enabled by a new wave of machines that are\nbeing marketed to farmers to solve their biggest problems.\n\nIf its parts won\u2019t talk to each other, a fancy new tractor isn\u2019t really any\nsmarter than the old ones in this junkyard.\n\nBut as anyone who\u2019s ever struggled to get a computer to recognize a printer\nknows, \u201csmart\u201d products can look pretty stupid when they won\u2019t talk to each\nother. Indeed, farmers have run into lots of problems with the\ninteroperability of software-driven agriculture equipment. That\u2019s why Canadian\nfarmers have been pushing for a law that would require that interoperability\nis at least possible.\n\nBig companies are using software to lock down their systems in the same way\nthat companies like Apple do, making it hard for anyone else to fix or upgrade\nthe machines that provide them their livelihoods. The Canadian\ninteroperability bill has received a lot of support from the farming\ncommunity, but it is currently stuck in the Senate.\n\nAs farming gets more and more complex and technology-dependent, we need common\nsense protections for interoperability, troubleshooting, and repair of that\nequipment. It\u2019s important for farmers, for rural communities\u2014and really, for\nany of us who eat.\n\n### More News\n\n  * New Zealand wants to extend the lifespan of products: A country well known for its sustainability efforts is seeking to reduce waste through a proposed right to repair law.
