Image includes combined content which\nmay include AI-generated content.\n\nAd\n\nFTX investors may drop claims against the company\u2019s co-founder and former CEO,\nSam Bankman-Fried, in return for his support.\n\nBloomberg reported on April 19 that, under a proposed settlement, Bankman-\nFried would cooperate against celebrity promoters named as defendants in a\n$1.3 million civil lawsuit.\n\nThe civil case currently names celebrities as defendants, including former NFL\nquarterback Tom Brady, former NBA player Shaquille O\u2019Neal, and supermodel\nGisele Bundchen.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the celebrities brought them into a Ponzi scheme by\npromoting FTX.\n\n## SBF would provide information\n\nTo cooperate, Bankman-Fried would need to provide plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers with\ndetails about entities related to FTX, including venture capital firms that\ninvested in the exchange and accountants and lawyers that worked with the\ncompany during its operations.\n\nHe would also provide nonprivileged documents outlining his investments in the\nAI company Anthropic and an affidavit proving his negative net worth.\n\nIn exchange for Bankman-Fried\u2019s cooperation, plaintiffs would drop current and\nfuture claims against him. Bloomberg said that plaintiffs acknowledged\nBankman-Fried\u2019s participation as \u201cvaluable\u201d but recognized that the shift in\nfocus could make their case\u2019s outcome uncertain.\n\nThe judge must decide whether to approve the proposal.\n\n## Past developments\n\nThe relevant case, currently proceeding in the Southern District of Florida,\nbrings together several civil lawsuits against various FTX promoters and\ninsiders.\n\nSeveral other defendants previously approached a settlement. A March 27 filing\nnamed FTX insiders Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, former FTX\nlawyer Daniel Friedberg, several internet personalities, and AFL quarterback\nWilliam Trevor Lawrence as proposed settling defendants. The current status of\nthe proposal is unclear.\n\nMuch earlier, in April 2023, some celebrity promoters \u2014 including but not\nlimited to Brady and Bundchen \u2014 asked the court to dismiss claims. The\nrelevant case, Garrison v. Bankman-Fried et al., became part of the\nconsolidated case by June 2023.\n\nAll civil cases are distinct from the high-profile criminal case against\nBankman-Fried, which has concluded. Bankman-Fried was convicted on criminal\ncharges in November 2023 and received a 24-year prison sentence in March.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\nFTX Anthropic Sam Bankman-Fried\n\nPosted In: Featured, Legal\n\nAuthor\n\n#### Mike Dalton\n\nJournalist at CryptoSlate\n\nBefore transitioning to crypto writing in 2018, Mike studied library and\ninformation sciences.
