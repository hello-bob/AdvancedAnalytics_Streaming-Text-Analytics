Her past work has focused on immigration\npolitics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right.\n\nPhotography by Amelia Holowaty Krales\n\nApr 26, 2024, 4:45 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nThe troubles on Columbia University\u2019s campus began over six months ago, long\nbefore last week\u2019s protests. Shortly after Hamas\u2019 October 7th attack on\nIsrael, a box truck covered in LED screens displaying the names and photos of\ndozens of Columbia students started circling a pro-Palestine protest near the\nuniversity\u2019s Morningside Heights campus. The truck, paid for by the\nconservative nonprofit Accuracy in Media, called the students \u201cColumbia\u2019s\nLeading Antisemites.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally did not leave my apartment the days my friends told me about it,\u201d\na computer science undergraduate, whose name was listed on the truck, told me\noutside the Columbia encampment on Tuesday afternoon. The student, who did not\nwish to be identified for fairly obvious reasons, said her name was listed on\nthe truck because a club she was no longer a part of had signed onto an open\nletter urging Columbia to cut ties with Israel. It was a traumatizing\nexperience for her. \u201cI completely wiped as much as I could of my online\npresence and stayed in my apartment as much as I could,\u201d the student said. \u201cI\nfelt like I couldn\u2019t go to classes.\u201d\n\nLike most of the other people who filtered in and out of the encampment, the\nstudent stayed masked as we spoke. Students covered their faces with surgical\nmasks, sunglasses, and kaffiyehs, both to prevent spreading covid-19 in close\nquarters and to shield themselves from the prying eyes of outsiders who they\nfeared would target them over their involvement in the encampment.\n\nAt Columbia and elsewhere, pro-Palestine protesters have attempted to balance\ntheir public-facing activism with increasingly dire concerns over their\nprivacy and safety. People who have attended marches or rallies, organized\nfundraisers for displaced Palestinians, or belonged to certain campus clubs\nhave found themselves and even their families on the receiving end of\nrelentless online harassment after their names were publicized by anonymous\naccounts that claim to combat antisemitism. In some cases, they have even lost\ntheir jobs.\n\nFor the students targeted by the \u201cdoxxing truck,\u201d the intent was clear: they\nwere being intimidated for supporting Palestinians and, in some cases, for\ntheir race or religion. (One student whose name and photo were displayed on\nthe truck sued Accuracy in Media in November for \u201cdefaming and stigmatizing\u201d\nhim. The student was the former president of an Arab cultural group on campus\nand says he did not sign onto the letter.) The harassment of student activists\nat Columbia and elsewhere has only intensified since then, often spilling over\ninto the physical world.\n\nIn the enclosed environs of a college campus, a student\u2019s first and last name\nis not exactly top secret sensitive information. But when placed into a\ncertain context and disseminated through certain media streams outside the\nconfines of the university, a name becomes a liability \u2014 and for bad-faith\nactors, a weapon that can be wielded against students.\n\n\u201cEarly on, in October, I tried to speak with administrators to help them\nunderstand the gravity of the target they were placing on their students by\nallowing this doxxing to continue,\u201d Darializa Avila Chevalier, a Columbia alum\nwho was involved with Students for Justice in Palestine as an undergraduate,\ntold me on Wednesday. Columbia announced a \u201cdoxxing resource group\u201d last\nNovember, a response Avila Chevalier and other students described as\ninsufficient. (Columbia University did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAvila Chevalier, who graduated from Columbia in 2016, was among the first\nstudents to be featured on Canary Mission, a database that describes itself as\ndedicated to exposing antisemitism. Since its inception, Canary Mission has\nconflated antisemitic hate speech with pro-Palestinian activism; Avila\nChevalier was posted on the database for her involvement in the BDS (Boycott,\nDivestment, and Sanctions) movement. The Israeli government has used Canary\nMission to bar political activists from entering the country, Haaretz reported\nin 2018. Since October 7th, Canary Mission has doxxed protesters across the\ncountry.\n\nA graduate student involved in the encampment pushed back at the notion that\nprotesting Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians is antisemitic. \u201cA lot of the\norganizing is run by Jewish students,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a seder here, there\nwas a passover celebration here, and all of that is neglected.\u201d The graduate\nstudent was previously doxxed by Canary Mission over his undergraduate\nactivism at a different university.\n\nThe quad of Columbia University on April 25th, 2024.\n\nThe week before, police officers in riot gear descended upon Columbia\nUniversity\u2019s campus to break up an encampment set up by student protesters.\nMoments later, university president Minouche Shafik claimed she sent the\nofficers in for students\u2019 safety. \u201cI took this extraordinary step because\nthese are extraordinary circumstances,\u201d Shafik wrote in a statement published\nlast Thursday afternoon. \u201cThe current encampment violates all of the new\npolicies, severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and\nintimidating environment for many of our students.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested more than 100 students who had occupied Columbia\u2019s south lawn\nto demand that the university divest its $13 billion endowment from companies\nthat support Israel. Officers tore down the tents students had set up the\nprevious morning around 4AM and trampled on signs declaring the encampment a\n\u201cliberated zone,\u201d an echo of the anti-war protests that swept college campuses\nacross the country, including Columbia\u2019s, in 1968. Less than a day later, the\ntents were back, with hundreds of new students taking the place of their\nclassmates who had been arrested and barred from campus.\n\nVisitors to the encampment are greeted by a tall sign announcing its community\nguidelines \u2014 no littering, no drugs or alcohol, no engaging with\ncounterprotesters, no talking to cops \u2014 and a handful of volunteers in yellow\nvests who control the incoming flow of people. The lawn is a maze of green and\nblue tents, some of which are decorated with Palestinian flags. The\narrangement appears to shift from day to day; tents go up and come down,\ntables are rearranged, but the sense of organized chaos persists. The\nliberated zone, as the students have taken to calling the quad, is a hive of\nactivity. Students flit around unpacking boxes of snacks and making signs.\nInside, I spot two obviously DIYed shirts that read \u201cMinouche Sha-fuck you.\u201d\nAlmost all the students are masked; the reporters among us are identifiable by\nboth our press badges and our bare faces.\n\n\u201cYou see people trying to make themselves almost unrecognizable out of fear of\nlosing jobs, fear of being attacked by this administration,\u201d Dalia, a first-\nyear student at Columbia, told me. Dalia, who is Palestinian, said she\nenrolled at Columbia because of the legacy of professors like postcolonial\nscholar Edward Said. She has now begun to see the campus as a hostile place\nfor Muslim and Arab students. Three days before Dalia and I spoke, Shai\nDavidai, an adjunct professor at Columbia\u2019s business school, posted a video on\nX of Muslim students praying. The caption: \u201cThis is Columbia University, right\nnow. Please share to let the world know.\u201d\n\nAfter months of doxxings, student demonstrators at Columbia University obscure\ntheir faces.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that such open anti-Palestinian rhetoric, anti-Islam\nrhetoric is able to proliferate by members of this community \u2014 by certain\nfaculty \u2014 without any single response or utterance from the administration is\ncrazy,\u201d Dalia said. (Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) asked Shafik about Davidai by name\nduring a congressional hearing last week. Shafik said that he was under\ninvestigation for harassment and added that \u201cattacking our students is\nunacceptable.\u201d On Monday, Davidai was denied entry to Columbia\u2019s main campus,\nthough he was still allowed to access the business school.)\n\nDalia and I spoke in a cordoned-off press area of the encampment on Monday. In\nthe days since the university sent in the NYPD to arrest the first wave of\nprotesters, the students who took over the quad had set up a media operation\nof sorts. They let reporters in a few at a time, or sometimes not at all, and\nasked us not to photograph students without their consent. Instead of\napproaching protesters for interviews, reporters were asked to wait in the\npress area until liaisons \u2014 other students \u2014 brought over people who were\ninterested in being interviewed. Critics in the media have accused the student\nprotesters of illiberally trying to stifle the free press. The students,\nmeanwhile, maintain that they\u2019re trying to protect the most vulnerable among\nthem while ensuring that their message \u2014 the desire for Columbia to divest\nfrom business interests in Israel \u2014 remains at the forefront.\n\nA protest\u2019s power lies in its numbers. In singling demonstrators out and\ntargeting them one by one, the people going after students aren\u2019t just\ntargeting individuals; they\u2019re trying to hobble a broader movement.\n\nSeveral students told me they were harassed after speaking to the press.\nJonathan Ben-Menachem, a PhD candidate in Columbia\u2019s sociology department,\nsaid he received a flood of emails accusing him of being a \u201cself-hating Jew\u201d\nafter writing an essay about how he feels safe on campus. Jared, a graduate\nstudent at Columbia, said he and other Jewish students have been called\n\u201cJudenrat\u201d and \u201ckapos\u201d for supporting the encampment. \u201cI had previously been\ngiving interviews with my last name, and a family member of mine was left a\nvoicemail asking if he was a self-hating Jew just like me,\u201d said Jared, adding\nthat Arab and Muslim students are bearing the brunt of the harassment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of threats from the outside, but this is not a\nthreatening mob,\u201d he said of the encampment.\n\nA graduate student described the student encampment as \u201cbasically just a bunch\nof nerds.\u201d\n\nThe encampment, all things considered, is extremely chill. When I walked\naround on Monday, I saw students lounging in their tents, doing homework, and\ngenerally hanging out. There was a craft corner where people could make pro-\nPalestine signs: among them were pieces of cardboard and cloth that read\n\u201cAnti-imperialism is feminist\u201d and \u201cEnd the blockade.\u201d In the middle of the\nquad, students had set up a snack table \u2014 complete with a \u201cnut zone\u201d to\naccommodate their peers with allergies \u2014 that also had sunscreen, water\nbottles, and ibuprofen available.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically just a bunch of nerds,\u201d Jared told me on Wednesday. \u201cAnd then\nI go home, check Twitter, and I hear like, \u2018Pro-Hamas mob has taken over\nColumbia.\u2019 There\u2019s a huge disparity between what\u2019s going on here and how it\u2019s\nbeen portrayed by the media.\u201d\n\nThe most tense hours I\u2019ve witnessed at the encampment occur like clockwork,\nduring the university\u2019s designated media hours of 2 to 4PM. The encampment and\nits surrounding areas are at their most chaotic during the brief media window:\nreporters mill about looking for students to talk to, student volunteers\nscramble to coordinate interviews, and right-wing agitators roam around,\nhoping to lure undergrads into giving them an inflammatory quote. By 5:30 or\n6PM, once the camera crews are mostly gone and the media frenzy has died down,\ncampus life \u2014 the encampment included \u2014 regains a sense of normalcy.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, hundreds of Columbia faculty held a walkout in support of\nthe arrested students, demanding that Columbia lift their suspensions and\nreinstate their access to campus. \u201cTo send riot police to pick up peaceful\nprotesters on our campus was unprecedented, unjustified, disproportionate,\ndivisive, and dangerous,\u201d Christopher Brown, a professor of history, told the\ncrowd of a hundred or so people who assembled on the university steps. \u201cThat\nshow of force was a sign of weakness. In trying to show that they meant\nbusiness, what they showed was their incompetence.\u201d\n\nBrown suggested that Shafik\u2019s crackdown on protesters was an affront to their\nsafety and to the notion of academic freedom. Other professors expressed\nconcern that even innocuous statements in support of their students would get\nthem into trouble with the university. One faculty member who has been the\nvictim of online harassment described a \u201cculture of fear around speaking up\nfor Palestine\u201d at the university.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is that many faculty are afraid to speak up for\ntheir students who have faced harassment, doxxing, arrest, or even eviction\nover the past several months because their employment at the school is so\nunprotected and precarious,\u201d the faculty member, who wished to remain\nanonymous, told me. More than half of Columbia instructors are so-called\n\u201ccontingent\u201d faculty. Over 160 untenured Columbia professors have signed an\nopen letter in support of the arrested, suspended, and protesting students;\nnearly half the signatories were anonymous.\n\nStudents lounge in their tents, do homework, and hang out.\n\nAt a Tuesday afternoon press conference on the edge of Morningside Park,\nMarianne Hirsch, a literature professor who specializes in Holocaust studies,\nsaid the university had fostered \u201can atmosphere of fear and intimidation in\nwhich some people are afraid to tell you their names.\u201d\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student who has been involved in the\nnegotiations with Shafik\u2019s office, also spoke, saying international students\nwere especially at risk. \u201cI am here on a foreign visa. That\u2019s why for the past\nsix months, I\u2019ve barely appeared on the media,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m\nnot suspended. I did not participate, fearing that I will be arrested and\nultimately deported from this country.\u201d\n\nLater that day, around 10PM, Shafik announced a midnight deadline to reach an\nagreement with students on \u201cclearing the West Lawn and restoring calm to\ncampus.\u201d Amid negotiations with student representatives from Columbia\nUniversity Apartheid Divest \u2014 the group behind the encampment \u2014 Shafik\nthreatened to call both the National Guard and the NYPD, the student group\nsaid in a statement. The few hundred students who stayed on the lawn started\npreparing for arrests, according to the Columbia Daily Spectator. In the end,\nneither the police nor the National Guard were called: instead, Shafik\nextended the deadline until the early hours of Friday.\n\nBy Wednesday, the media circus was in full swing. As I spoke off the record\nwith two members of the encampment whose faces were covered by sunglasses and\nscarves, a man approached us and asked why we weren\u2019t in class; off to the\nside, I noticed provocateur and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. A few hours\nlater, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) held a press conference on the other\nside of the quad. \u201cThis is dangerous. This is not the First Amendment. This is\nnot free expression,\u201d Johnson said amid boos and chants of \u201cMike, you suck.\u201d\nThen he urged President Joe Biden to call in the National Guard.\n\nThe press scrum at the university gates is only slightly more chaotic than the\nmedia frenzy inside.\n\nRep. Omar made her own visit on Thursday. Omar\u2019s daughter was one of the\nstudents suspended when the encampment was cleared last week. Shafik\u2019s early\nFriday deadline was swiftly approaching. That night, Shafik said there would\nbe no arrests. \u201cThere is a rumor that the NYPD has been invited to campus this\nevening,\u201d she wrote in an email sent to students at 11:08PM. \u201cThis rumor is\nfalse.\u201d\n\nFor Sofia, an undergraduate student who declined to give her last name, the\nuniversity\u2019s willingness to facilitate the arrest of its own students in the\nfirst place suggests that Shafik\u2019s concerns about safety are largely\nrhetorical. The arrests, she told me on Monday, are \u201cin and of themselves a\ndoxxing event, because all of that becomes public record.\u201d After the first\nwave of arrests on April 18th, some publications, including the New York Post,\npublished the full names and other identifying information of some students.\n\nIf, at a future point, Columbia chooses to send in the NYPD again, after a\nweek of elected officials suggesting that an encampment full of undergraduates\nmaking signs at their crafts corner and hosting Passover seders amounts to a\nnational security emergency, the students who find themselves in handcuffs and\nzip ties will end up with targets on their backs. According to the NYPD\u2019s own\nchief of patrol, the students arrested on April 18th \u201cwere peaceful, offered\nno resistance whatsoever.\u201d Reports suggesting that the students pose a danger\nto their classmates only serve to inflame the harassment they\u2019ve been victims\nof for months.\n\nDalia, the first-year student, lamented the outsize attention she and her\npeers have received compared to the war they\u2019re protesting in the first place.\n\u201cAs Palestinians, as Arabs, we have been inherently at risk,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHowever, I also think that there really is no comparison to the horrors that\nare happening in Gaza, the horrors that are happening in Palestine. No amount\nof student repression \u2014 no amount of doxxing \u2014 can be equated to that.\u201d\n\nThroughout the week, the students I speak to redirect the conversation back to\nthe war. They ask why their chants are considered violent while\ncounterprotesters seem to get away with spraying students with hazardous\nchemicals and sending death threats to students who have lost relatives in\nGaza. Thursday night, hours before Shafik\u2019s deadline was set to expire, a\ngroup of Christian nationalists rallied in support of Israel outside\nColumbia\u2019s locked-down campus. \u201cShow your face! Show your face!\u201d the\ndemonstrators chanted at students on the other side of the fence. Then some of\nthem tried to storm the gates.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## This self-transforming Megatron is as badass as it is expensive\n\n  2. ## Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving linked to hundreds of crashes, dozens of deaths\n\n  3. ## BlizzCon 2024 has been canceled\n\n  4. ## What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  5. ## I traded in my MacBook and now I\u2019m a desktop convert\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Policy\n\n  * ### DJI might get banned next in the US\n\n  * ### Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is under investigation again following \u2018recall\u2019 software update\n\n  * ### New EU regulations target Shein\u2019s counterfeit fashion problem\n\n  * ### Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving linked to hundreds of crashes, dozens of deaths\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
