The most obvious of these may\nbe the discovery in the 16th century that the Earth and other planets orbit\nthe sun. An unpopular idea when it was first proposed, today it is so\nfundamental to basic astronomy it is practically taken for granted. But our\nmost brilliant scientists have also floated some wild ideas that were not only\nunpopular at the time\u2014they also turned out to be incredibly wrong. Some of\nthese wrong ideas led to other important discoveries, however, that were very\nright. Here are a few of astronomy\u2019s fallen angels for your enjoyment.\n\n1\\. Kepler\u2019s planets\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe pioneering 16th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler proposed in his\nbook Mysterium Cosmographicum, published in 1596, that the gaps between the\nplanets could be explained in terms of the five \u201cPlatonic\u201d solids: These were\n\u201cregular\u201d polyhedrons with four, six, eight, 12, and 20 faces that Plato\nhypothesized could describe the shapes of all of the elements on Earth.\nAccording to Kepler\u2019s theory, the planets\u2019 orbits were dictated by these five\ndifferent shapes: The orbit of Venus, for example, fit within a 20-sided\nicosahedron, the orbit of the Earth fit within a 12-faced dodecahedron, the\norbit of Mars within a 4-faced tetrahedron, and so on. This scheme produced\nsix layers, each nested inside the other, which Kepler claimed corresponded to\nthe orbits of the six known planets at the time.\n\nLater observations showed his proposal was entirely wrong, but the idea\nbrought Kepler to the attention of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Tycho\nwas then working in Prague for the Holy Roman Emperor and invited Kepler to\nbecome his assistant. When Tycho died about 18 months later, Kepler became his\nsuccessor as Imperial Mathematician. The appointment gave Kepler access to\nTycho\u2019s observations, which he eventually used to formulate his laws of\nplanetary motion.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

The luminiferous aether\n\nMany physicists in the 19th century thought the universe was filled with an\nunseen medium called the \u201cluminiferous aether\u201d (or ether) that allowed light\nto propagate as waves. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 finally\nproved this wrong, by determining the aether didn\u2019t make any difference to the\nspeed of light when the Earth was at different points in its orbit. As a\nresult, physicists sought new explanations for the behavior of light, which\nled to Albert Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity in 1905.\n\n3\\. A triple Saturn\n\nThe Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei didn\u2019t know what he was seeing when he\nfirst observed Saturn through a telescope: \u201cThe star of Saturn is not a single\nstar,\u201d he wrote in 1610 \u201cbut is a composite of three, which almost touch each\nother.\u201d What he was seeing was Saturn\u2019s rings, but nobody expected planets to\nhave rings back then. Galileo\u2019s idea that Saturn consisted of a single planet\nwith two large moons that almost touched it on either side\u2014something never\nbefore imagined\u2014lasted until 1659, when the Dutch astronomer Christiaan\nHuygens proposed that the observed changes in Saturn\u2019s shape were caused by\nEarth\u2019s view of its rings as the planet slowly changed its tilt.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Binary stars\n\nEarly sky-watchers like the German-British astronomer William Herschel\nexplained their many observations of \u201cdouble\u201d or \u201cbinary\u201d stars as tricks of\nalignment, supposing that one of the stars was much farther behind the other.\nBut in 1767, the English scientist John Mitchell\u2014a friend of Herschel\u2014showed\nmathematically that there were far too many observations of double stars for\nsuch alignments to occur at random; instead, he reasoned, the stars must be\nrelatively close and bound together by their gravitational pull. Mitchell\nasserted that stellar clusters, too, couldn\u2019t be the result of random\nalignments, and calculated that there was only about one in half-a-million\nchance that the Pleiades cluster, made of more than 1,000 stars and sometimes\nknown as the Seven Sisters, could have formed randomly. Mitchell\u2019s work was\nthe first application of statistics to astronomy.\n\n> \u201cThe star of Saturn is not a single star,\u201d Galileo wrote in 1610 \u201cbut is a\n> composite of three.\u201d\n\n5\\. The planet Ceres\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAfter Ceres was discovered in 1801 by the Italian priest Giuseppe Piazzi,\nastronomers around the world hailed it as a new planet\u2014the first detected\ninside the orbit of Jupiter since antiquity. Ceres occupied a gap in the solar\nsystem where the 18th-century Titus-Bode law suggested a planet should reside.\nPiazzi initially declared that Ceres was only a comet, but admitted in a\nletter to a friend that he thought it might be a planet instead; later\nobservation suggested his suspicions were correct. But the discovery of\nPallas\u2014the third-largest asteroid in the solar system\u2014and other objects in\nroughly the same orbit soon established that Ceres was one of many\n\u201casteroids\u201d\u2014a term coined by Herschel. It is now classified as the only \u201cdwarf\nplanet\u201d in the inner solar system.\n\n6\\. The canals of Mars\n\nOne of the first to see lines on the surface of Mars was the Italian\nastronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, who in 1877 said he\u2019d observed seas and\ncontinents connected by linear structures, which he called canali.\nSchiaparelli seems to have thought the lines were natural\u2014the word canali\nmeans \u201cchannels\u201d in Italian. But the idea that they were artificial canals\nbecame widespread and culminated in three books written by the pioneering\nAmerican astronomer Percival Lowell. Lowell proposed there was a vast network\nof irrigation canals on Mars that could only have been built by intelligent\nMartians. But observations by NASA\u2019s Mariner space probes in the 1960s showed\nno such features, and it now seems the Martian canals were an optical\nillusion.\n\n7\\. The steady-state theory\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAlmost all cosmologists now subscribe to the Big Bang theory, which proposes\nthe universe began with the sudden expansion of a \u201ccosmic egg\u201d about 13.8\nbillion years ago. But many 20th-century theorists\u2014including the eminent\nEnglish astronomer Fred Hoyle, who developed the theory of stellar\nnucleosynthesis\u2014preferred the steady-state theory, which proposed that the\nuniverse had no beginning and no end. Under the steady-state theory, new\nmatter was continually being created in voids between stars and galaxies,\nthereby maintaining the density of matter in the expanding universe. But it\nwas at odds with observation that found only newer galaxies at the edges of\nthe universe; and it fell from favor after the 1964 discovery of the cosmic\nmicrowave background, which had been predicted by the Big Bang theory.\n\n8\\. Alien radio\n\nThe discovery of the first pulsar\u2014a \u201cpulsating radio source\u201d\u2014by the Northern\nIrish astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was a perplexing development: No one\ncould imagine how such a powerful radio source could repeat every one-and-a-\nthird seconds. Bell\u2019s discovery of a second pulsar a few weeks later quashed\nthe notion that this was a radio signal from an alien intelligence; but the\nidea seems to have been taken seriously, at least for a day or two, and the\nfirst pulsar was given the name \u201cLGM-1,\u201d for \u201clittle green men.\u201d Astronomers\nsoon identified pulsars as rapidly rotating neutron stars.\n\n9\\. A planet for Barnard\u2019s Star\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Piet van de Kamp announced he\u2019d detected\nthe first planet beyond our solar system around Barnard\u2019s Star\u2014a red dwarf\nrelatively close to Earth and the fastest-moving star in our sky. Van de Kamp\nbased his idea on wobbles in the star\u2019s path, which he proposed showed the tug\nof an orbiting planet at least three times larger than Earth. Van de Kamp\u2019s\nmethod had some similarities to the radial velocity method now often used to\ndetect exoplanets. Radial velocity is measured by observing the gravitational\nwobbles on a star caused by their orbits. But astronomers determined that van\nde Kamp\u2019s claims were in error; and while later observations have suggested\nthere might indeed be an exoplanet around Barnard\u2019s Star, it would have been\ntoo small for van de Kamp to have detected it.\n\nLead image: Sergey Nivens / Shutterstock\n\n  * ###### Tom Metcalfe\n\nPosted on April 17, 2024\n\nTom Metcalfe is a science journalist based in London, where he writes mainly\nabout space, energy, archaeology, Earth, and the oceans.
