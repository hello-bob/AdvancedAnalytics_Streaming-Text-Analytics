In it,\nBorges imagines a bizarre and whimsical fictional Chinese taxonomy later\nquoted by Michel Foucault, David Byrne, and others.^[5]^[6]\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\nBorges begins by noting John Wilkins's absence from the 14th edition of the\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and makes the case for Wilkins's significance,\nhighlighting in particular the universal language scheme detailed in his An\nEssay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668). Wilkins's\nsystem decomposes the entire universe of \"things and notions\" into\nsuccessively smaller divisions and subdivisions, assigning at each step of\nthis decomposition a syllable, consonant, or vowel. Wilkins intended for these\nconceptual building blocks to be recombined to represent anything on earth or\nin heaven. The basic example Borges gives is \"de, which means an element; deb,\nthe first of the elements, fire; deba, a part of the element of fire, a\nflame.\"^[7]\n\nBorges in 1951 (photo by Grete Stern)\n\nExamining this and other second-hand examples from Wilkins's scheme\u2014he did not\nhave access to Wilkins's actual work, but based his comments on others'\ncomments on it\u2014Borges believes he finds \"ambiguities, redundancies and\ndeficiencies\", concluding \"it is clear that there is no classification of the\nUniverse not being arbitrary and full of conjectures.\"^[7] He fancifully\nlikens Wilkins's classification scheme to a \"certain Chinese encyclopedia,\"\none of his own fabrication but attributed to translator Franz Kuhn, called the\nCelestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge, said to divide animals into \"(a)\nthose that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are\ntrained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs,\n(h) those that are included in the present classification, (i) those that\ntremble as if they are mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very\nfine camelhair brush, (l) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower\nvase, (n) those that look like flies from a long way off.\" Borges's point is\nthe arbitrary nature of such taxonomies, regardless of whether they form a\nlanguage or just a way of understanding and ordering the world. He challenges\nthe idea of the universe as something we can understand at all\u2014\"we do not know\nwhat thing the universe is\"^[7]\u2014much less describe using language.\n\nWhile considering Wilkins's effort na\u00efve, Borges ultimately praises the\nambition of a universal language and admits that Wilkins's word for salmon,\nzana, could (for someone well-versed in Wilkins's language) hold more meaning\nthan the corresponding words in conventional languages, which are arbitrary\nand carry no intrinsic meaning. He says that, \"Theoretically, it is not\nimpossible to think of a language where the name of each thing says all the\ndetails of its destiny, past and future.\"\n\nFrontispiece of John Wilkins's An Essay Towards a Real Character, And a\nPhilosophical Language (1668)\n\n## Commentary and uses by others[edit]\n\nMichel Foucault attributes the inspiration for his The Order of Things to\nBorges' \"Celestial Emporium\" passage and \"the laughter that shattered, as I\nread the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my thought ... breaking up all\nthe ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame\nthe wild profusion of existing things...\"^[8] Foucault is disturbed less by\nthe Emporium's arbitrariness than by the idea that such a classification might\nbe intelligible to someone or some culture,^[9] then discusses the ways\ncultures make sense of the world by drawing relationships between things,\nexpressed through language. What Borges did, according to Foucault, was to\nhighlight the importance of the \"site\" of order by taking it away, asking in\nwhat context the Celestial Emporium might make sense.^[8]\n\nThe Emporium has often been used as a shorthand for the subversion of\ntraditional, rational notions of order.^[10]^[11] The artist and musician\nDavid Byrne has created an art work, \"The Evolution of Category\", that shows a\nhierarchical tree based on this mythical taxonomy.^[5]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Artificial language\n  * Characteristica universalis\n  * Episteme\n  * George Dalgarno\n  * Rene Descartes, whom Borges mentions as someone else who had worked on a universal language.\n  * International Federation for Information and Documentation, mentioned by Borges in the novel as the \"Institute of Bibliography\" in Brussels\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"1942 | Borges Center\". www.borges.pitt.edu.
