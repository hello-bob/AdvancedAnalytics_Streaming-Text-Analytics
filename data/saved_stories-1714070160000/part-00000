My pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, I call \"Five Fingers on My\nRight Hand\":\n\nYes, this is high art. Please try to hold your applause, if you have hands!\n\nTo be fair, AI generators mostly get fingers right these days. But even with\nthese advances, imagery generated by DALL*E, the zillion offshoots of Stable\nDiffusion, and even Midjourney are often easily detectable. They have a look\nto them!\n\n## A Chance Meeting\n\nThis morning, I saw a Steam game pop up on We \u2764 Every Game's fancy-pants Fire\nHose hub. It kinda looked like it used art created with Midjourney:\n\nThe Beasts in the Shadows shots all bear some of the tool\u2019s hallmarks, with\noccasional strands of hair disconnected from the rest of the head hair as well\nas some artifacts you get when you upscale from MJ's 1456x816 to 1920x1080. I\nmean, it kinda has a Midjourney graphic novel look to it. Here\u2019s a Midjourney\nimage from the prompt, \u201ca gritty graphic novel illustration of a woman\u201c:\n\nNow, fair game\u2014the developer makes it clear right on their Steam Store Page\nthat they use GenAI:\n\n### AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE\n\nThe developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:\nThis game and associated materials uses AI generated audio and visual graphics\ncontent. All AI generated content is commercially licensed from the industries\nleading AI generation platforms.\n\nThese shiny new disclosures are the result of Valve\u2019s evolving stance on games\nthat use GenAI. They initially pumped the brakes on games generated with AI,\nthen, earlier this year, came up with a policy:\n\n> \u201c[We] are updating the Content Survey that developers fill out when\n> submitting to Steam. The survey now includes a new AI disclosure section,\n> where you\u2019ll need to describe how you are using AI in the development and\n> execution of your game.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steamworks Developer Announcement\n\nThis allows devs to use GenAI pretty broadly, so long as they disclose how\nit\u2019s used.\n\n## So, What All Uses GenAI?\n\nI was curious how many games used any of the tech (or, at least disclosed such\nusage). It\u2019s pretty straightforward to figure that out, as any game whose\nContent Survey discloses GenAI use will have it in the About section:\n\nSo, I ran a script to snag all of those, and I asked it a question:\n\n## Me: Hey, Computer, how many games on Steam use GenAI?\n\nAnd, being a Python script, it answered dutifully if gradually:\n\n# Script: ONE THOUSAND.\n\nWow! This was an order of magnitude more than I expected! Here are some\nexamples:\n\nThe Great Rebellion (99% positive of 280 reviews):\n\n> \u201cSome of the backgrounds in a few levels are based on images created with\n> AI, as well as a few props in the levels. They were only used as a basis to\n> start from and have been heavily edited manually afterwards to make them fit\n> with the rest of the game's pixel art artstyle.\u201d\n\nAtman: Rebel Flame (90% positive of 188 reviews):\n\n> During the game design process, we used advanced AI tools to generate some\n> pictures as creative references and sources of inspiration, and\n> professionals performed artistic processing on this basis to show the unique\n> art style of \"Atman: Rebel Flame\". At the same time, we also attach great\n> importance to player feedback and suggestions. If you have any suggestions\n> on the artistic performance of the game, please feel free to communicate\n> with us through the community.\n\nHere\u2019s a smattering more:\n\n> Girls of The Tower: \u201cTo better focus on the core design of the game, some of\n> our item icons and a few NPC portraits, excluding the main characters, were\n> produced through a process involving drafts by artists, AI-assisted\n> rendering, and adjustments by artists. Moreover, to ensure the final\n> artistic presentation, all AI-generated assets have been manually refined by\n> the artists.\u201d\n\n> ARC TCG: \u201cAll card concept are made by Leonardo.Ai through Leonardo\n> Diffusion XL model.However, the generation of this content was done with\n> complex prompts to provide more unique images, in addition, each image was\n> further reviewed to provide more detail and alternatives than the basic\n> model.This approach to AI was used to initially bring down development\n> costs, which otherwise would have been too high to get the game out.In the\n> future, depending on the economic game performance, we will gradually\n> replace the AI-generated images with those created by a dedicated artist.\u201d\n\n> RetroMaze: \u201cGenerative AI (DALL\u00b7E 3) was used in Steam community \"resources.\n> Specifically in trading cards and emoticon art.\u201d\n\n## Just Small Games, Right?\n\nI thought these would all be smaller, new titles, but even well-established\ngames and studios had GenAI disclosures:\n\nTribes 3: Rivals\n\n> \u201cWe use AI to pre-generate some in-game banners and icons. Some of this\n> generated content is used as reference and then modified by our in-house art\n> team.\u201d\n\nTribes is a storied franchise! The biggest of the bunch was The Finals:\n\nThe Finals\n\n> \u201cDuring the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools\n> to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product\n> reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team. Examples\n> include voiceover audio where we utilize text-to-speech tools to e.g.\n> generate the audio of our in-game commentators Scotty & June.\u201d\n\nThe Finals is not a tiny title. It\u2019s huuuuuuuge! It\u2019s got over one hundred\nthousand player reviews, and raves from Game Informer, IGN, GameSpot, and so\nforth.\n\n## The Eight Categories\n\nAfter perusing the disclosed usage, I categorized the applications into the\nfollowing (rough) areas:\n\n  1. Character and NPC Artwork\n\nGirls of The Tower: \"...some of our item icons and a few NPC portraits,\nexcluding the main characters, were produced through a process involving\ndrafts by artists, AI-assisted rendering, and adjustments by artists.\"\n\n  2. Background and Environment Artwork\n\nThe Great Rebellion: \"Some of the backgrounds in a few levels are based on\nimages created with AI, as well as a few props in the levels.\"\n\n  3. Concept Art\n\nAtman: Rebel Flame: \"During the game design process, we used advanced AI tools\nto generate some pictures as creative references and sources of inspiration,\nand professionals performed artistic processing on this basis to show the\nunique art style of 'Atman: Rebel Flame'.\"\n\n  4. UI and Icon Graphics\n\nSea of Radiation: Prologue: \u201cDue to limited capacity and funding, our store\npage promotional artwork and some of our in-game icons are AI-generated, using\nthe Midjourney\u201d\n\n  5. Store/Marketing Imagery\n\nRetroMaze: \"Generative AI (DALL\u00b7E 3) was used in Steam community resources.\nSpecifically in trading cards and emoticon art.\"\n\n  6. Voice Acting and Audio\n\nTHE FINALS: \"Examples include voiceover audio where we utilize text-to-speech\ntools to e.g. generate the audio of our in-game commentators Scotty & June.\"\n\n  7. Narrative Content\n\nDREAMIO: AI-Powered Adventures: \"This game uses AI to dynamically generate\nstories, illustrations, and voiceovers in response to player input.\"\n\n  8. Artist's Tools\n\nAI Tools were used to generate details, generate colouring and upscale to\nHD.ModLab was used to create the Normalmaps.\n\nThis is, by no means, an exhaustive categorization. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for\nthat. At least, I don\u2019t got time for that today. But that\u2019s already a lot of\ndifferent ways devs are using it in shipped titles.\n\n## The Concluding Conclusion\n\nSo, there are three things that surprise me:\n\n  1. The sheer number of games on Steam that use the tech.\n\n  2. The fact that devs are already using it across small and large games. I really thought larger studios would avoid it entirely.\n\n  3. The breadth of use cases. I was expecting it\u2019d be mostly generated images, but this goes way beyond that.\n\nIt's clear that a nontrivial portion of the game dev industry is actively\nexploring and incorporating this technology into their creative processes. I\u2019m\nguessing that, as the tools advance and become more accessible, we\u2019ll see this\ntrend continue.\n\nI'm curious how this will play out over the next year. What will the numbers\nlook like in December, 2024?\n\nIchiro Lambe\n\nIchiro is a 30 year gaming industry veteran.
