If you\u2019ll\nindulge me, I\u2019d love to share my thoughts about what we did right and what we\ndid wrong.\n\nLet me back up a moment.\n\nAfter I left XING, I went traveling with my family for several months. The\ntrip was long overdue; after seven years of constant work, I needed the time\nand space to really imagine my next steps. I arrived home with 15 new business\nideas, but I knew I couldn\u2019t pursue any of them in earnest until I sold most\nof my shares in XING. While traveling I had realized that I was \u2014 both\nliterally and figuratively \u2014 still far too attached to that company. In order\nto give my next venture its due, I needed to completely free up some\nheadspace.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t look for the highest bidder. When it comes to deal-making, I\nnever do. Instead, I searched for people who had the most thoughtful answers\nto three simple questions:\n\n  1. What\u2019s best for our members?\n  2. What\u2019s best for our employees?\n  3. What\u2019s best for our shareholders?\n\nWe had several buyers offer up answers, but Dr. Hubert Burda and Dr. Paul-\nBernhard Kallen gave by far the most compelling ones. We shook hands over the\ndeal in Hubert\u2019s living room, and I left his home entirely confident that my\ncompany was going to thrive.\n\nI grew XING to $250 million \u2014 Hubert and Paul took it to over half a billion\nwithin four years. That\u2019s a thrill for me that is difficult to describe.\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me. For my next venture, I wanted to help others get a\nchance to feel that same thrill. But I didn\u2019t want to support the business\nguys. I wanted to support the coders, the developers, the geeks. My favourite\nmemories of XING were the times I spent meeting with them, listening to them,\nand learning from them. I truly believe that geeks are the artists of the 21st\ncentury. But in Europe, unlike in the US, most startups are founded by the\nbusinessmen, not the Builders. This never made sense to me, especially because\nthe coders I knew were brimming with great ideas. The key was going to figure\nout the best way to help them unleash their potential.\n\nThis time, though, I wanted to get it right from the start. In previous\ncompanies, we\u2019d labored under countless redesigns. I was eager to try and\navoid that, so I hired my friends at IDEO (including Tom, Andr\u00e9a, Marcus,\nNathan, Soren, Ferdi, Tim, and Philipp) to help me structure my ideas,\nvalidate them with geeks, and kick-start the company. We launched with a\ntweet, and the news quickly spread to over 20 million people within two weeks.\nTo quote my friend Mike, it was like a Klingon warship decloaking out of\nnowhere. Within months, we earned a reputation for great entrepreneurs,\nfantastic ideas, and compelling results.\n\nBut \u2014 and there\u2019s always a but \u2014 we knew we would ultimately be measured on a\nsingle metric: the exit. So far, we haven\u2019t had one. I\u2019ll come back to that in\na second.\n\nThree and a half years ago, when we started, there were hardly any\naccelerators of note in the world. In Europe, Seedcamp was in its second year.\nIn Asia, Innovation Works had yet to launch. And in the US, Y-Combinator was\njust starting to gain traction.\n\nToday, it\u2019s a very different landscape. There are literally thousands of\naccelerators; so many that I often wonder if there are more accelerators than\nangels and more angels than there are entrepreneurs. We also have meaningful\nstartup movements in virtually every country on the planet. From Shanghai, to\nBucharest, from Moscow to Cape Town, from Alaska to Chile, Argentina to Miami,\nfrom Riga to Paris. The odds have changed.\n\nNot to mention that many Fortune 1000 companies are taking their cues from the\nstartup world, rather than the other way around. Digital innovation is\nchanging workflows, collaboration, and business practices all over the world.\nSome are even Building their own \u201cin-house\u201d accelerators to streamline\ninternal processes and see results faster. In the last 3 years, ideas like\nrapid prototyping, lean and agile approach, hosting hackathons, and failing\nfaster are no longer buzzwords from startups, but accepted business norms for\neven the largest global brands.\n\nThings are different for VCs, too. Yuri\u2019s Digital Sky Technologies (DST) and\nhis team have tapped into another market segment \u2014 very late stage investments\n\u2014 and made it possible to keep big companies private that would have otherwise\nneeded to go public for further funding. This not only involved massive D & E\nrounds, but it also provided liquidity to early employees. Many big name VCs\nhave followed this approach, establishing a precedent for huge debt and equity\nrounds that frequently give early employees liquidity. These traditional\nSeries A funds investing later stage coupled with a sharp rise in seed stage\ninvesting contribute to a significant Series A gap.\n\nThere are also far more startups that support startups. I\u2019m particularly\nimpressed by Naval at Angelist.co, who managed to organize and in many ways\ndemocratize a scattered market of companies looking for funding. Even\ncrowdfunding sites, like Kickstarter, have helped fund new ventures and\nprovided millions with a front row seat to the world of entrepreneurship. This\nhelps explain why being an entrepreneur is finally an entirely legitimate\ncareer choice, even in Europe; indeed, in many ways, working at a startup is\nthe new MBA.\n\nSo, if it\u2019s such an exciting and dynamic time to be an entrepreneur, why am I\nstopping HackFwd?\n\nAs with any new venture, there\u2019s a mix of smarts and serendipity at work at\nall times. Sometimes the right smarts and most fortunate serendipity overlap \u2014\nbut sometimes they don\u2019t. But as they say in Silicon Valley, you either win or\nyou learn. So here are my top ten insights from this experience that I\u2019ll take\nwith me to my next venture:\n\n## What We Got Right\n\n1\\. Geeks Can Be CEOs. The assumption that coders are best left in the back\nroom near the servers is not only erroneous, it\u2019s a massive missed\nopportunity. As I once tweeted, it\u2019s far easier to teach a geek about business\nthan teach an MBA to code. I\u2019ve always believed in my gut that HackFwd geeks\nwould not only rise to the occasion to help truly lead their companies, but\nalso bring many previously underappreciated leadership skills to the table.\nBoth proved to be true; I was proud to see how many CTOs thrived under the\npresumption that they, too, also contribute at the level of the CEO when\nneeded.\n\n2\\. European Geeks Are As Talented As American Ones. Innovative thinking is\nnot the natural birthright of US-born coders alone \u2014 in fact, European geeks\nnot only bring equal amounts of passion and genius to the table, but they also\nbring determination that only a presumed underdog status can inspire. We\u2019re\nvery proud that one of our HackBoxes, the team from To Be Honest (formerly\nFantasy Shopper) were the first non-Americans to win the worldwide AWS\nchallenge from Amazon! This kind of recognition is critical to the future of\nEuropean innovation \u2014 that\u2019s also why we came up with a prize for European\ngeeks under 18 to show their talents with HackNow.org. We\u2019ve got two winners\nalready: Luiz from Spain and Marcin from Poland. I sincerely hope that other\norganizations step in to contribute with their own version of HackNow annual\nprizes, because it\u2019s enormously important that young European tech talent\ncontinues to get championed and celebrated on the global stage.\n\n3\\. Mentorship Is Worth More Than Money. Although we offered an extremely\ngenerous funding package, we placed even more emphasis on giving each HackBox\nreal access to luminaries from every startup discipline. In fact, we had\ndedicated, full-time staff focused on product, strategy, marketing, HR,\nrecruitment, and finance, so focussed expertise and support was always a click\nor a call away for any one of our HackBoxes. No need for investment managers!\nPlus we brought in mentors who were truly world class in broader topics, like\nbrand, distribution, PR, business, etc. We covered literally every possible\nangle to ensure each HackFwd startup was as informed as they were inspired.\nMany of our mentors also served as referrers \u2014 indeed, we had ambassadors in\nevery European country, always looking out for the best talent to refer to\nHackFwd.\n\n4\\. The Need For In-Person Inspiration. Every quarter we hosted Build\nConferences in Mallorca, later in Berlin. The point was not only to expose\neach HackBox to amazing talks and face-to-face feedback on their progress, but\nalso allow them to learn from each other and benefit from the emotional\nsupport of their peers who were at a similar point of the startup journey.\nAlthough it would have been easier and more cost-effective to do everything\nonline and remotely, our Build Conferences were the critical human drumbeat to\nhelp both enlighten and empower our teams at regular intervals. But it wasn\u2019t\njust our geeks who loved the conferences \u2014 pretty soon investors and press\njoined the fun. We enjoyed hosting participants from all sectors, including\nRen\u00e9 Obermann, Niklas Zennstroem, Jason Goldberg, Om Malik etc. etc. and VCs\nlike, Brains-to-Ventures, Accel, Index, T-Venture, e.ventures, HTGF, Creathor,\nDN Capital, Atomico, CFP, Balderton, HPV, Battery Ventures, Shortcut,\nSeedcamp, ProFounders and Sunstone. And we loved swapping stories with all the\npress in attendance, including TechCrunch, Wired, GigaOM, The Next Web,\nVentureBeat, Focus, Spiegel, Gruenderszene, Deutsche Startups, Silicon Allee\nand the DLD.\n\n5\\. The Importance Of Intellectual Generosity. We support innovation, period.\nSo it was important that any would-be founder could access our content,\nregardless of whether they were lucky enough to join HackFwd. We were pleased\nwhen our content became a meme, delighted to see our amazing tools used\nwidely, impressed when our plain English contracts were praised, flattered\nwhen we were copied by Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft, and proud when our great\ntalks were viewed over 200.000 times, including some of my personal favourites\nbelow- and, they\u2019re all under Creative Commons license, so please feel free to\nembed them in your own websites:\n\n  1.

In part due to the amount of energy and focus\nwe put into each HackBox, it was difficult to press the stop button early\nenough when things weren\u2019t working. We had a policy of seeing each team at\nleast through the first year, but in some cases we would have been better\nserved but calling time earlier on businesses that just weren\u2019t finding enough\ntraction.\n\n2\\. It Was Difficult To Nurture And Scale. I had no shortage of people eager\nto invest in HackFwd when I began, but I declined. I wanted to first prove to\nmyself that investment truly made sense. Over time it became clear that in\norder to nurture 10 + teams per year, I\u2019d need at least a 50M fund, plus\nultimately the will to scale the operation with follow-on A or B round\ninvestments. While I still have financing offers for this magnitude as well, I\nstill don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019ve developed real heart for my\nexisting companies, and worry I\u2019d be putting them at risk if I switch my focus\nto a bunch of new ones to justify the bigger funds. Put simply, I did not find\nthe formula to scale while still truly supporting every venture. Since I\nfundamentally refuse to follow the common \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach of so many\nSuper Angels or VCs, we had a dilemma of having a business that was the right\nthing for each HackBox but also potentially the wrong thing for HackFwd.\n\n3\\. We Underestimated The Bureaucracy. We all knew that bureaucracy in some\nEuropean states, and across Europe was high. All of HackFwd had extensive\ninternational experience. Nevertheless, we totally underestimated how high,\nand how disproportionate a load this was on small companies. Each European\ncountry has its own (unnecessarily complex) rules and regulations for setting\nup a company. As we helped each startup become legal businesses, we were\nfrustrated by the needless complexity in each market. In Germany you need a\nnotary to sign everything. In France you can\u2019t get shares immediately. In\nPoland everything must be written entirely in Polish and you have to sign on\nevery single front and back page. In Austria you need 35K to found a company.\nThe list goes on and on and on. It\u2019s insane. And every European country makes\nvirtual work agreements \u2014 where you have contractors from one country working\nremotely for a team based in another \u2014 a colossal pain to establish. That\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m pushing hard at all levels of government to create a simple, European\nstandard for establishing small, limited companies. No need for a notary,\ninstant access to shares, electronic filing and registration, standard\ncontracts, and business language of English. And if you want to employ someone\nin Spain to work for a Latvian company with co-workers in Germany and France,\nit\u2019s the matter of a couple mouse clicks, not a couple years of hassle. I am\npart of Neelie Kroes\u2019 Leadersclub and we managed to get both topics in our\nmanifesto. Neelie Kroes will be presenting ideas about the \u201cE-corp\u201d and\n\u201cremote employment\u201d this October to the EU Commission. Please join Niklas\nZennstroem, Joanna Shields and me by signing here.\n\n4\\. We Assumed Faster Exit Times. Within the first couple of years, we\nrealized that, on average, any exit required between 5 and 7 years to be\nworthwhile, longer than the average time we\u2019d hoped and planned for. This\nstands in sharp contrast to the US, where exits commonly happen within a year\ndue to talent acquisition hires. Even when we had a US company eager to buy\none of our star HackBoxes, the deal ultimately fell through because of US Visa\nrestrictions.\n\n5\\. It Can Be Hard To Go Deep And Wide\n\nWe had an amazing variety of HackBoxes, which showed the broad appeal of our\noffer. But it was difficult to constantly switch focus between challenges\nwithout feeling like I was short-changing people. Not to mention the fact\nthat, speaking personally, it was hard not to get really excited about the\nopportunities and want to get my hands really dirty again. Investing is like\ntaking a shower but not truly getting wet \u2014 I must confess that I missed the\ndays of diving headfirst into a challenge, all the way.\n\n## Which brings me to my news today\n\nWe got over 3000 applications for HackFwd, and accepted only 16 companies.\nThat gives you an idea of how high a hurdle they already surpassed. And while\nwe are not taking any new companies into our program, we care deeply about our\nexisting ones and continue to support them. Many of those are now real,\ncredible companies and we are proud shareholders. Some of them are actively\nlooking for funding and we are ready as a co-investor to invest with a new\nlead investor. Most of the companies have a link to their Angellist profile.\nCheck them out.\n\n  1. YieldKit \u2014 The easiest way to earn money with your website.\n  2.

Visualnest \u2014 is a mobile app which helps designers transform their paper sketches into working, interactive models using smartphones\n\nI invested in total around 8 million into HackFwd & our portfolio companies.\nWill it pay off? At minimum, we are certain it will pay a good dividend. But\nis the portfolio worth 2 or 3 times our investment? Maybe. The future will\ntell. But knowing that we won\u2019t lose money (especially compared to many other\ninvestors, accelerators and Incubators or even VCs) is still a solid outcome.\n\n## Just a few more words\n\nWe had amazingly smart referrers with various areas of expertise all over\nEurope helping to review our applications and identify those that should move\nto next round. Which meant listening to literally thousands of pitches in\norder to get to a handful worth serious consideration. That takes a lot of\nwork and even more passion to pull. That\u2019s why I\u2019m forever thankful to:\n\nAndris Berzins, Business Development, Latvia Andr\u00e9 Schmidt, Go-to-market,\nNetherlands Alex Barrera, Marketing, Spain Berislav Lopac, Web Development,\nCroatia Bogdan Iordache, Pitching, Romania Carlo Matic, UX/Usability, Germany\nCharles Wiles, Product, UK Chris Boos, Scaling Technology, Germany Chris\nKowalczyk, Marketing, Poland Dalibor Jakus, Solving complex problems, Slovakia\nDaniel Gutenberg, go to market, Switzerland Didier Tranchier, Finance, France\nDimitris Kalavros-Gousiou, Social Media/Online, Greece Hannes Dernehl,\nBusiness Development, Sweden Jaroslav Satkevic, Collaboration, Lithuania\nJonathan Briggs, Measurement, UK Josep Pujol, IT BackEnd, Spain Jos\u00e9\nZurstrassen, Scaling Companies, Belgium Karl Klingsheim, Business Models,\nNorway Kushtrim Xhakli, Product, Germany Maks Giordano, Marketing, Germany\nNatasha Starkell, Public Relations, Germany Peter Arvai, Going International,\nHungary/US Prof. Franz Guenthner, Search Engines, Germany Prof. William\nLatham, Gaming, UK Rob Fitzpatrick, (Business Modeling, UK Stephanie Kaiser,\nGaming, Germany Sven Illing, Biz Development, Estonia Tine Thygesen, Teams and\nTalent, Denmark Tom Hulme, Business Model, UK Torsten Reil, Games, US\n\nThe process of then selecting \u201cHackBoxes\u201d, as we called them, was never easy.\nBut I was privileged to have enjoyed the support and mentorship of industry\nluminaries I deeply respect, including Marco Boerries (Founder and CEO\nNumberFour), Stefan Richter (Co Founder Freiheit.com), Jean-Paul Schmetz (CEO\nCliqz), Roman Stanek (Founder & CEO of Gooddata), and Michael Jackson (former\nCOO Skype and now Partner at Mangrove). They each gave tremendous energy and\npassion to help ensure we selected the very best teams for HackFwd and helped\nus enable each one to grow and flourish. What do these 5 men have in common?\nThey are all equally skilled coders as they are businessmen, thus proving my\nthesis that the two skill sets need not be mutually exclusive. Thank you.\n\nI was also grateful to have an amazing team on the ground with me. Stephie,\nour Team Lead, is the best event organizer in the world, orchestrated every\nBuild Event, oversaw all the legal work with our teams, lawyers, company\nregistrations in multiple languages, and so much more. David, our Talent Geek,\nis simply the best recruiter in Europe. Agnes and Ed, our Finance Geeks,\nmanaged to make sure every audit was 100% correct. Mikko our first Marketing\nGeek who started successfully his first company vuact.com. Andrew, our second\nMarketing Geek, not only co-founded TechStars but is a marketing genius. And\nJana, our Team Assistant, who always made sure everything worked. Hardly as\neasy job, considering that we all lived in different places, including\nHamburg, Paris, London, Boulder, and, of course, on airplanes. I could not\nwish for better teammates throughout this journey.\n\nI also have a surplus of fantastic memories that I\u2019ll always treasure. Some\nhighlights include:\n\n  1. Applauding as our HackBoxes won startup competitions all over Europe: Pioneers Festival, Nordic Startup, UK, Next web and many more;\n  2. Accepting numerous prizes on behalf of HackFwd, like INDEX and 2nd place in the TechCrunch Europas, AIGA and Core77;\n  3. Considering it a compliment when Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and others began copying our name, designs, and frameworks;\n  4. Enjoying our press coverage from America, Europe, South America, and Asia;\n  5. Indulging in far too many great parties and fun with our community;\n  6. (Plus a handful of secrets we will simply never share);\n  7. HackNow \u2014 the Youth Programming Award we handed out twice;\n  8. Build 0.1, Build 0.2, Build 0.3, Build 0.4, Build 0.5, Build 0.6, Build 0.7, Build 0.8, Build 0.9, Build 0.10, Build 0.11;\n  9. Thanksgiving in Paris & Xmas Parties in Hamburg;\n  10. The Year 1 and Year 2 Videos.\n\nHackFwd has become more than a powerful brand; it\u2019s a movement. I have felt\nhonored to help lead that movement in Europe, and I look forward to supporting\nothers who are eager to do so going forward as well.\n\nSo what\u2019s next for me? I have been active as an investor for over a decade and\nwill continue to do so. I\u2019ve had many ups and down, successes, IPOs, trade-\nsales, small wins, zombies, big losses and even dead companies. I\u2019ve seen it\nall and I\u2019ve felt it all. For the moment, I\u2019ll be concentrating on helping to\nBuild up a few companies out of my 2nd, later-stage fund, Cinco Capital.\n\nRecently I entered the real estate world, as I try to re-imagine the rental\nmarket. I saw a big opportunity to make a painful process far better for\neveryone, and I couldn\u2019t help but jump in and try. Will it work? I don\u2019t know.\nAnd, truthfully, I don\u2019t care. I love trying.\n\nSo as I think back to the last three years with HackFwd, I feel nothing but\ngratitude for all that I learned along the way. We tried extremely hard and\ngave it our all. As a result, it was the richest work experience I could have\nhoped for. In my mind, it has more than paid off. For that, I am truly\nthankful.\n\nLars Hinrichs, Hamburg\n\nSeptember 2013\n\nPS.
