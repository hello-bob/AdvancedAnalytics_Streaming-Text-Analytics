Addiction at times can be\nincorrectly thought of as \u2018a moral failing instead of what we know it to be: a\nchronic treatable brain disease\u2019^2, which results in the body sending signals\nin the absence of the drug. These signals cause the user to \u2018crave\u2019 the\nsubstance, much like the body sends signals when we are hungry or tired. These\nphysiological changes are related to our body\u2019s natural messengers,\nneurotransmitters.\n\nNeurotransmitters are the body\u2019s natural chemical messengers that control\nbodily functions such as breathing, heartbeat and blood pressure, muscle\nmovement, sleep, digestion, and thoughts and memories^3. Some examples of\nneurotransmitters are dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA,\nepinephrine, and histamine. The volume and storage of neurotransmitters within\nthe body is highly regulated. The body can sense when there is too little or\ntoo much of a neurotransmitter and responds by creating more or destroying the\nneurotransmitter. Any change of this homeostasis can have severe consequences\non the body\u2019s ability to react to external stimuli and can be referred to as\nintoxication^4.\n\nThe effects experienced by drugs is related to neurotransmitters.\nNeurotransmitters work on the body by binding to receptors. Neurotransmitters\nand their receptors work very similarly to a lock and key. The\nneurotransmitter perfectly fits into a specific receptor just like a key fits\ninto a specific lock.\n\nSome drugs, referred to as agonists, mimic neurotransmitters causing the body\nto think neurotransmitters are present, when in fact they are not. In our lock\nand key model, this would be like using an object to pick a lock in the\nabsence of a key.\n\nSome other drugs can increase or decrease the level of natural\nneurotransmitters in the body resulting in an increased or decreased level of\nsignals. For example, the drugs can \u2018copy\u2019 the set of keys, allowing the lock\nto be opened more freely, or destroy the keys, preventing the lock from being\nopened.\n\nOther drugs, called antagonists, block the body\u2019s natural neurotransmitters\ncausing no signal even when the stimuli are present. In our model, this would\nbe equivalent to breaking a key off in the lock, preventing future keys from\nopening the lock (infographic ^4). The effects of the drugs can be desirable\nsuch as euphoria or relaxation, while others are not desirable, like paranoia\nor increased blood pressure.\n\nOver time with repeated drug usage, the body will compensate for the imbalance\nof neurotransmitters to restore the homeostasis. For instance, amphetamine\nincreases the level of dopamine in the body. With chronic amphetamine use, the\nbody recognizes the unnaturally high levels of dopamine. As a response, the\nbody starts producing less dopamine. If the user then suddenly stops using\namphetamine, they can experience side effects of low dopamine in the body,\nsuch as lack of motivation, lethargy, moodiness, or difficulty sleeping^5.\nThis phenomenon is referred to as withdrawal, and at times, for some\nsubstances, can be life-threatening.\n\nTolerance is similar to withdrawal in that it is also related to the body\ncompensating for the imbalance of neurotransmitters. In the prior example,\nchronic amphetamine use causes the body to produce less dopamine. However, the\n\u2018high\u2019 experienced by amphetamine use is caused by the unnaturally high level\nof dopamine. If the body is producing less dopamine naturally, the user will\nneed to take more amphetamine to experience the same \u2018high\u2019. This phenomenon\nis referred to as tolerance. Both tolerance and withdrawal are related to\nimbalance of the body\u2019s neurotransmitters.\n\nSUDs are more than just the psychological need to use a substance. They are\ncomplex diseases which affect the natural chemistry of the user\u2019s body. Due to\nthis complexity, individuals suffering from SUDs are recommended to seek\ntreatment from professionals.\n\nReferences\n\n  1. https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/substance-use-disorders/index.html#:~:text=Substance%20Use%20Disorders%20(SUDs)%20are,and%20control%20over%20substance%20use.\n  2. https://nida.nih.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-language-showing-compassion-care-women-infants-families-communities-impacted-substance-use-disorder\n  3. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22513-neurotransmitters#:~:text=Neurotransmitters%20are%20chemical%20messengers%20that,muscle%20cell%20or%20a%20gland.\n  4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628948/#:~:text=Neurotransmitter%20expression%20can%20be%20transient,compensation%20to%20the%20changing%20environment.\n  5. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency\n\nSign up here to learn more and receive our newsletter on the latest updates\nwith USDTL.\n\nBack to view all blogs posts\n\nNavigation\n\n  * Home\n  * Newborn Testing\n\n    * Newborn Testing\n\n      * Newborn Testing\n      * Umbilical Cord Tissue Testing\n\n        * Umbilical Cord Panels & Collection\n        * Umbilical Cord Resources\n      * Meconium Testing\n\n        * Meconium Panels & Collection\n        * Meconium Resources\n      * Newborn Newsletters\n  * Adult & Child Testing\n\n    * Adult & Child Testing\n\n      * Choosing the Best Test\n      * Fingernail Testing\n\n        * Fingernail Panels & Collection\n        * Fingernail Resources\n      * Hair Testing\n\n        * Hair Panels & Collection\n        * Hair Resources\n      * Child Testing\n\n        * Child Testing Panels & Collection\n        * Child Testing Resources\n      * Adult PEth Testing\n\n        * Adult PEth Panels & Collection\n        * PEth Resources\n      * Urine Testing\n\n        * Urine Panels & Collection\n        * Urine Resources\n      * Adult & Child Catalog\n      * Adult & Child Newsletter\n  * Specimen Collection\n\n    * Specimen Collection\n\n      * Collection Instructions\n\n        * Overview\n        * Child Hair Testing\n        * Fingernail\n        * Hair\n        * Meconium\n        * PEth\n        * Umbilical Cord\n        * Urine\n      * Collection Supplies\n      * Collector Locations\n      * Example Chain of Custody & Control Forms\n  * Research Center\n\n    * Research Center\n\n      * Specimen Testing\n      * USDTL Research\n      * Poster Presentations\n      * USDTL Assisted Research\n      * Foundational Research\n      * White Papers\n  * Learning Resources\n\n    * Resources\n\n      * Quarterly Newsletters\n\n        * Adult & Child\n        * Newborn\n      * Articles\n      * Infographics\n      * Events\n      * Videos\n      * Announcements\n      * In the News\n      * Request Literature\n  * About\n\n    * About\n\n      * About USDTL\n      * Our Value\n      * USDTL Cares\n      * Leadership\n      * Certifications\n      * Compliance Statement\n      * Business Closure Dates\n      * Business Hours\n      * WBENC\n      * Ear to the Ground\n  * Careers\n  * Suggest a Test\n  * Join Our Mailing List\n\nUSDTL Forensic Blog\n\nSubscribe to RSS\n\n  * Recent Posts\n  * Archive\n  * Tags\n\n  * Drug Classes and Neurotransmitters: Amphetamine, Cocaine, and Hallucinogens\n  * Environmental Exposure Testing for Delta-8 THC, Delta-9 THC, Delta-10 THC, and CBD\n  * Bromazolam and Synthetic Benzodiazepines\n  * Winter Weather Delay Update\n  * Tianeptine\n  * Revolutionizing DUI Interventions: Wisconsin\u2019s Breakthrough in Biomarker Testing for Impaired Drivers\n  * 3 FAQs You Should Know About Newborn Drug Testing\n  * The Brain Chemistry Behind Tolerance and Withdrawal\n\n  * March 2024 (1)\n  * February 2024 (1)\n  * January 2024 (3)\n  * December 2023 (1)\n  * November 2023 (1)\n  * August 2023 (1)\n\nadult and child adult and child drug testing alcohol biomarker alcohol testing\nalcohol use answer key barbiturates bath salts cannabidiol cannabinoids cbd\nChicago child hair testing CLMA diazepam direct biomarker drug abuse drug\nexposure drug ingestion drugs in fingernail drug testing EtG ethyl glucuronide\nFAS FASD fentanyl Forensic Drug Testing Forensic Technology forensic\ntoxicology gabapentin hair testing heroin Inc.
