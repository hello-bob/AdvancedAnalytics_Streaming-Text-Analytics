Why?\n\nBy Ellen Cushing\n\nIllustration by Matteo Giuseppe Pani. Source: Getty.\n\nMay 7, 2024, 10:55 AM ET\n\nEveryone, for so long, has been worried about the honeybees. Governments,\ncelebrities, social-media users, small businesses, multinational\nconglomerates\u2014in the two decades or so since news emerged that American\nhoneybees were disappearing, all manner of entities with a platform or a\nwallet have taken up and abandoned countless other causes, but they can\u2019t quit\ntrying to save the bees.\n\nIn 2022, at least 18 states enacted bee-related legislation. Last year, a\ncryptocurrency launched with the intention of raising \u201cawareness and support\nfor bee conservation.\u201d If you search Etsy right now for \u201csave the bees,\u201d\nyou\u2019ll be rewarded with thousands of things to buy. Bees and Thank You, a food\ntruck in suburban Boston, funds bee sanctuaries and gives out a packet of\nwildflower seeds\u2014good for the bees!\u2014with every grilled cheese sandwich it\nsells. A company in the United Kingdom offers a key ring containing a little\nbottle of chemicals that can purportedly \u201crevive\u201d an \u201cexhausted bee\u201d should\nyou encounter one, \u201cso it can continue its mission pollinating planet Earth.\u201d\n\nAll of the above is surprising for maybe a few different reasons, but here\u2019s a\ngood place to start: Though their numbers have fluctuated, honeybees are not\nin trouble. Other bees are. But the movement\u2019s poster child, biggest star, and\nattention hound is not at risk of imminent extinction, and never has been.\n\u201cThere are more honeybees on the planet now than there probably ever have been\nin the history of honeybees,\u201d Rich Hatfield, a biologist at the Xerces Society\nfor Invertebrate Conservation, told me. \u201cThey are in no threat of going\nendangered. It\u2019s not an issue.\u201d\n\nThe idea that honeybees need our help is one of our most curiously persistent\ncultural myths. It is well intended. But it is also unhelpful: a distraction\nfrom more urgent biodiversity problems, and an object lesson in the limits of\nmodern environmentalism and the seductiveness of modern consumerism. That the\nmisconception has survived for so long may tell us less about bees than it\ndoes about the species that has, for centuries, adored, influenced, and\nexploited them more than any other. \u201cSave the bees\u201d rhetoric has turned them\ninto something unspoiled, a miracle of mother nature\u2019s ingenious machinery.\nBut everything about the modern American honeybee has been shaped by humans,\nincluding its sustained existence.\n\nA true truth about the bees: The modal American honeybee is, essentially, a\nfarm animal\u2014part of a $200-billion-a-year industry that\u2019s regulated by the\nUSDA and is as sophisticated and professionalized as any other segment of the\nsprawling system that gets food on our plates. The nation\u2019s largest beekeeping\noperation, Adee Honey Farms, has more than 80,000 colonies, facilities in five\nstates, and nearly 100 employees. Its bees, and those at other large-scale\napiaries, do produce honey, but more and more, the real money is in what the\nindustry calls \u201cpollination services\u201d: the renting-out of bees to fertilize\nthe farms of Big Ag, which have seen their indigenous pollinators decline with\nurbanization and industrialization.\n\nEvery February, right before the almond trees start blooming powdery and white\nacross California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, bees from all over the country pack\nonto semitrucks and head west, where they participate in the largest\nsupervised pollination event on Earth, doing their part to ensure that\nAmerica\u2019s most beloved nut makes its way again into snack packs and candy\nbars. Throughout the spring and early summer, they do the same for other\ncrops\u2014watermelons, pumpkins, cucumbers, alfalfas, onions\u2014before heading home\nto the honey farm, where the most ambitious among them can expect to make a\n12th of a teaspoon of the gooey, golden stuff over their lifetime. In the\nearly 1990s, when Adee started renting out bees for industrial fertilization,\nthat income accounted for about a third of its revenue, with honey making up\nthe rest. Now the ratio is flipped.\n\nRead: A uniquely French approach to environmentalism\n\nAs that transition was happening, another force threatened to rearrange the\nindustry even more dramatically. Worker bees were flying away for pollen and\nnever coming back, abandoning their hives\u2019 queens and young like a lousy\nhusband in an enduring clich\u00e9. No one could figure out why. Some blamed a\ncommon class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are toxic to bees.\nOthers zeroed in on the stress incurred by all that trucking of beehives\naround the country for pollination. Maybe it was warmer winters, or\nmalnutrition, or the parasitic Varroa mite, or a sign of the Rapture.\n\nThis was not the first time bees had gone missing en masse. In 1869, and in\n1918, and in 1965, farmers had reported similar phenomena, given names such as\n\u201cspring dwindle\u201d and \u201cdisappearing disease\u201d in the scientific literature. But\nit was the first time that such an event reached full-scale public crisis, or\nthat knowledge of it spread much beyond the insular world of farmers,\nbeekeepers, entomologists, and agriculture regulators.\n\nIn retrospect, it was a perfect moment for a predicament like this to\neffloresce into panic. Social media had recently birthed an immensely powerful\nway of both disseminating information and performing one\u2019s values loudly and\npublicly. An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore\u2019s feature-length climate-change call\nto arms, had become one of the highest-grossing documentaries of all time.\nMichael Pollan was at the peak of his powers, having just published The\nOmnivore\u2019s Dilemma, which laid out the consequence and quantity of choices\nfacing contemporary eaters. Americans were newly aware of the terrifying\nfragility of our food systems, and newly in possession of robust ways to talk\nabout it. Brands were interested in aligning themselves with noncontroversial,\nblandly feel-good causes. Plus, humans were already primed to love bees; we\nhave since biblical times. \u201cWe think of bees as being very pure,\u201d Beth Daly,\nan anthrozoology professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada, told me.\nThey are honey and flowers and sunshine, beauty and abundance,\ncommunitarianism and hard work.\n\nBy 2007, the mystery thing making these lovely creatures go away had a scary-\nsounding new name: colony collapse disorder. Within a decade, bee panic was\neverywhere. A spate of nonfiction books warned of the imminent threat of a\nFruitless Fall and A Spring Without Bees. The White House convened a task\nforce. General Mills temporarily removed the cartoon-bee mascot from boxes of\nHoney Nut Cheerios, enacting a high-concept allegory meant, I guess, to stun\nAmericans into action. The cosmetics company Burt\u2019s Bees released a limited-\nedition lip-balm flavor (strawberry), some of whose proceeds went to one of\nthe approximately gazillion honeybee-conservation nonprofits that had recently\nsprung up. Samuel L. Jackson gave Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds \u201c10\npounds of bees\u201d as a wedding gift. Laypeople started keeping backyard hives.\nH\u00e4agen-Dazs created an awareness-raising ice-cream flavor and funded a VR\nshort film shot from the perspective of a bee; in it, Alex, our apian\nprotagonist, warns that \u201csomething terrible is happening.\u201d\n\nShe (it?) was not entirely wrong. Colony collapse was an actual problem, a\nscientific whodunit with genuinely high stakes. Honeybees are responsible for\npollinating roughly every third bite Americans eat. Scientists were correct to\nthink back then that if colonies were to keep collapsing, our food system\nwould need to change in painful, potentially catastrophic ways.\n\nMuch more worrying, though, and more real: The population of wild bees\u2014the\nnon-honey-producing, non-hive-dwelling relatives of the species humans have\nbeen intent on saving\u2014has been decreasing steadily, for years. Insects of all\nkinds are declining in record numbers, and their deaths will have\nrepercussions we cannot even imagine.\n\nRead: The illogical relationship Americans have with animals\n\nYet heads have been turned mostly toward the honeybee. That\u2019s because, unlike\nso many other imperiled animals, honeybees are part of a huge industry quite\nliterally invested in their survival. Apis mellifera are living things, but\nthey are also revenue-generating assets; the thousands of people who rely on\nbees\u2019 uncompensated labor to buy groceries and pay the cable bill had every\nincentive to figure out colony collapse. So they found better agrochemicals\nand bred mite-resistant bees. They gave their bees nutritional supplements,\nfats and proteins and minerals ground as fine as pollen and snuck into the\nfood supply. They moved hives into atmospherically controlled warehouses. They\nadapted.\n\nAll told, it was kind of the Y2K of environmental disasters. Not that colony\ncollapse was a hoax, or that the panic surrounding it was an overreaction.\nRather, it was an appropriate reaction\u2014a big problem made smaller thanks to\nthe difficult, somewhat unglamorous, behind-the-scenes labor of trained\nprofessionals with a vested interest in averting disaster. In 2019, an\neconomist-entomologist team published a study analyzing the effects of colony\ncollapse on the managed-pollinator industry; they found \u201ccause for\nconsiderable optimism, at least for the economically dominant honey bee.\u201d\nAccording to the most recent data from the USDA Census of Agriculture,\nhoneybees have been the country\u2019s fastest-growing livestock category since\n2007. Also, very clearly, our food system has not fallen to pieces.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean honeybee keepers aren\u2019t struggling\u2014some are. But as\nHatfield, the Xerces Society biologist, told me, that\u2019s an issue for the\nbusiness of honeybee keeping, not the moral and practical project of\npollinator conservation. He finds a useful comparison in a different\ndomesticated animal: chickens. \u201cWhen we get bird flu,\u201d he said, \u201cwe leave that\nup to USDA scientists to develop immunizations and other things to help these\nchickens that are suffering in these commercial chicken coops. We don\u2019t enlist\nhomeowners to help the chicken populations in their backyard.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Seirian Sumner, a wasp scientist and fan, conducted a survey of 748\npeople, mostly in the United Kingdom, on their perceptions of various insects.\nShe and her collaborators, she told me, \u201cwere absolutely flabbergasted\u201d by\ntheir results: Bees are roughly as adored as butterflies and significantly\nmore liked than wasps\u2014their wilder cousins\u2014which serve various important roles\nin ecosystem regulation, and which are in genuine, fairly precipitous decline.\n\nSumner was born in 1974 and doesn\u2019t recall much love for bees when she was\ngrowing up. You weren\u2019t \u201cbuying your bee slippers and your bee socks and your\nbee scarf and your bee mug and everything else,\u201d she told me. Today\u2019s craze\nfor bees, her research suggests, is a mutually reinforcing phenomenon. People\nlove bees because they understand their importance as pollinators. People\nunderstand their importance as pollinators because it is easier to fund\nresearch and write magazine articles and publish children\u2019s books and engage\nin multi-platform brand campaigns about animals that people are already fond\nof.\n\nHoneybees are, in point of fact, amazing. They have five eyes, two stomachs,\nand a sense of smell 50 times more sensitive than a dog\u2019s. They do a little\ndance when they find good pollen and want to tell their friends about it. They\nare feminists, and obviously, they dress well. They produce a near-\nuniversally-liked substance, and they do not have to die to do it. Loving\nbees, and wanting more of them in our food system, is simple. Engaging\nmeaningfully with the cruel, complicated reality of industrial food\nproduction, or the looming, life-extinguishing horror of climate change, is\nnot.\n\nTo save the bees is to participate in an especially appealing kind of\nenvironmental activism, one that makes solutions seem straightforward and\nbuying stuff feel virtuous. Worried about vanishing biodiversity? Save the\nbees. Feeling powerless about your mandatory participation, via the\nconsumption required to stay alive, in agriculture systems that produce so\nmuch wreckage, so much waste, so much suffering for so many living things?\nSave the bees. Tired of staring at the hyperobject? Save the bees. When we are\ngrasping for ways to help, we tend to land on whatever is within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nIn the 17th century, when what is now called the American honeybee was\nimported from Europe, large-scale industrial agriculture did not exist. Farms\nwere surrounded by wild flora and powered by non-machine labor, without\npesticides and chemical fertilizers, which also did not exist. Bees lived,\nate, and pollinated all in the same place; they built their nests in untilled\nsoil and unchopped trees. Even if farmers could have trucked them in, they\ndidn\u2019t have to. But as farming changed, bees became livestock, then itinerant\nlaborers\u2014there to meet the needs of the industrial systems that created those\nneeds in the first place. Their numbers have always oscillated based on our\ndemands: In the 1940s, when sugar rationing made beekeeping extraordinarily\nprofitable, the bee population swelled; as soon as the war was over, it fell\nagain. In 2024, thanks to the efforts of professional beekeepers and (to a\nlesser extent) backyard hobbyists, they\u2019re faring better than ever.\n\nNow the industrialized world that made, and saved, the honeybee as we know it\nis being called on to save other insects\u2014the ones that really are in trouble.\nThis will be trickier. When you ask experts what a layperson should do for all\npollinators in 2024, they have a lot to say: Use fewer insecticides, inside\nand outside. Convert mowed lawn into habitat that can feed wild animals.\nReconsider your efforts to save the honeybee\u2014not just because it\u2019s a\ndiversion, but because honeybees take resources from wild bees. Buy organic,\nand look for food grown using agricultural practices that support beneficial\ninsects. Get involved with efforts to count and conserve bees of all species.\n(The experts do not think you should buy a lip balm.)\n\nWhat they are getting at is ... an inconvenient truth: America does have an\ninsect-biodiversity crisis. It is old and big\u2014much older and much bigger than\ncolony collapse disorder\u2014and so are the solutions to it. The best require\nreturning our environment into something that looks much more like the place\nthe first American honeybees encountered. Having a backyard beehive isn\u2019t the\nanswer to what\u2019s ailing our ecosystem, because having a backyard is the\nproblem. Buying ice cream from a global food conglomerate isn\u2019t the answer,\nbecause buying ice cream from a global food conglomerate is the problem. The\nmovement to save the honeybee is a small attempt at unwinding centuries of\nhuman intervention in our natural world, at undoing the harms of the modern\nfood system, without having to sacrifice too much. No wonder so many of us\nwanted to believe.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
