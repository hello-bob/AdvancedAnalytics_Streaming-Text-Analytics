Illustration: Yann Kebbi/The\nGuardian\n\nA devoted father with a zest for life, he was given an indeterminate sentence\nin 2006. He is still locked up \u2013 and losing hope that he will ever be released\n\nby Simon Hattenstone\n\nWed 1 May 2024 06.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nIn 2006, Martin Myers got in a scrape over a cigarette. He asked a young man\nif he had a spare fag. The man declined to give him one. Myers came from a\nwell-known Traveller family. The man, Myers says, made a derogatory comment\nabout Travellers, so Myers gave up the niceties. He threatened to punch him if\nhe didn\u2019t hand him a cigarette.\n\nThe young man ran away. He then went to the police in Luton and told them what\nhad happened. The police were familiar with Myers. He had previous convictions\nfor dangerous driving, assault, theft and burglary. Myers was arrested,\ncharged and convicted of attempted street robbery. On 8 March 2006, he was\ngiven a tariff \u2013 the minimum time he could serve \u2013 of 19 months and 27 days.\n\nMyers, 42, has now served 18 years in jail for the attempted robbery of that\ncigarette. He was given an indeterminate sentence, known as imprisonment for\npublic protection (IPP). This meant that while he could be released after 19\nmonths and 27 days, he could also be jailed for up to 99 years. IPP was first\nused as a sentence in England and Wales in 2005, having been introduced by\nLabour in 2003 to detain in prison people who posed a significant risk of\ncausing harm to the public. It was a controversial sentence. Critics said that\njailing people for what they could do, rather than what they had done,\ncontradicted the basic principle of justice: that people are innocent until\nproven guilty.\n\nIn September 2012, the European court of human rights ruled that detaining\nindividuals serving IPPs beyond their tariff indefinitely \u201cwas arbitrary and\ntherefore unlawful\u201d if reasonable access to rehabilitation was not provided.\nOn 3 December 2012, IPP was abolished. But while the sentence could no longer\nbe handed out by judges, it wasn\u2019t abolished for those already serving it.\nLast week, David Blunkett, who introduced the sentence as home secretary, told\nme: \u201cWhat has happened with this sentence is the biggest regret I have in\nterms of the outcome of all the many things that I was involved in in the\neight years I was in government.\u201d\n\nToday, more than 11 years after IPPs were banned and 16 years after his tariff\nended, Myers is one of almost 3,000 people imprisoned in England and Wales\nstill serving an indeterminate sentence \u2013 with no release date in sight.\n\nMyers\u2019 mum, Mary, tells me I won\u2019t be able to miss her house: \u201cThere\u2019s a big\ncaravan in the garden and we\u2019ve got a black door.\u201d She is the personification\nof a matriarch \u2013 the mother of 14 children, she has tried to hold the family\ntogether as best as possible for more than half a century. Despite living in\nEngland most of her life, she has retained a strong Irish accent and speaks\nwith a gravelly smoker\u2019s rasp. She wears a grey dressing gown with diamante\nstuds over a grey jumper, which also has diamante studs. She has a magnificent\npresence \u2013 tough, loving and loyal. If you were one of hers, she would always\nbe there for you. Just as she has been for Myers.\n\nShe shows me a photographs of two cute boys with dark brown eyes: \u201cThat\u2019s\nMartin with his twin brother. Patrick lives in London. He\u2019s doing OK.\u201d Myers,\nhowever, is doing anything but OK.\n\nLike so many IPP prisoners, Myers has a history of self-harming in jail. IPP\nprisoners are more likely than any other sentenced group in the prison\npopulation to seriously self-harm. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be able to wear shorts or\nvests now,\u201d Mary says. In prison, Myers injured his hands so badly that he\nneeded a five-hour operation. His legs are so damaged that he was told an\noperation could just make things worse. He has tried to take his own life\ntwice while serving the IPP sentence. \u201cI\u2019m very worried, love,\u201d Mary says.\n\u201cVery, very worried that he\u2019s going to kill himself in that place.\u201d Ninety IPP\nprisoners have done so.\n\n\u2018Some days, I just don\u2019t want to get out of bed\u2019 ... Mary Myers at home in\nLuton. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dr\u0103goi/The Guardian\n\nDid she always worry for Myers? \u201cGod, no!\u201d she says. He was fun, independent-\nminded and had a zest for life. \u201cHe was a happy boy. He\u2019s a good singer, but a\ngreat dancer. He liked reggae music. He was a little bit wild. He\u2019d do things\nthat other kids wouldn\u2019t do. Martin would do anything, love. In the evening,\nthey\u2019d make a ramp and they\u2019d drive their bikes up in the air and over to the\nother side. And they\u2019d make a swing over a river. He was a daredevil. They\u2019d\nlight a big fire outside in the evening and play around it.\u201d\n\nWhere he get his wildness from? She smiles. \u201cProbably me, love. I was always\nwild when I was young. I worked on the land. I cut trees down still.\u201d Mary is\nin her late 70s.\n\nThe family moved around Britain in two caravans \u2013 London, Manchester,\nBirmingham, Wales, Scotland. The older children slept in the smaller one,\nwhile the younger kids slept with Mary and their father in the big one. Mary\nadmits she had little time for conventional schooling. The family were always\non the move, so it was impossible for the children to settle down early on.\n\nThirty years ago, they moved to Luton, when Mary\u2019s husband was suffering with\nhis lungs and struggling to work, gardening and in a scrapyard. \u201cSo we tried\nto settle down.\u201d But, she says, there was so much discrimination against\nTravellers \u2013 from neighbours, strangers, schools and the police. \u201cThe police\ngave us a lot of trouble when we came in here, an awful lot of trouble. Then\nthey laid off for a while. But it started again.\u201d\n\nShe says the school victimised Traveller children. Myers was one of a number\nof her kids who were permanently excluded without having learned to read or\nwrite. Mary, who is also illiterate, has a great way with words. She is here\nwith her friend Ann McMaster, a support worker who is helping her to fight for\nthe release of Myers. \u201cMartin was around 11 the last time he went to school. I\nthink the kids were treated unfairly. The other kids used to call them names,\u201d\nMary says. \u201cD\u2019you mind if I smoke a cigarette, love? D\u2019you mind, Ann?\u201d She\nlooks at her and laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re used to it. The kids were called \u2018pikey\u2019 and\ntreated like the scum of the earth.\u201d\n\n> Sometimes he says: \u2018Mother, should I be in prison?\u2019 And I say: \u2018No, baby,\n> you shouldn\u2019t be in prison, we\u2019ll do everything we can to get you out\u2019\n\nMary Myers\n\nAs they weren\u2019t in school, Myers and Patrick worked with their father. \u201cAt the\nage of nine or 10, they used to drive lorries and cars. They\u2019d drive to go for\nwater and stuff,\u201d Mary says. \u201cThey had great fun. We were as free as birds. We\ndidn\u2019t worry about big bills, we just worried about the police coming to move\nus on.\u201d\n\nAt 18, Myers got married. By the time he was imprisoned on the IPP sentence,\nhe had two children. Mary says being a father changed him, calmed him down.\n\u201cHe was a good dad. The kids were everything to him. He stopped being a\ndaredevil.\u201d\n\nShe knows Myers was wrong to threaten the young man over the cigarette. The\nfirst time he went to the police station, he said Myers had threatened him\nwhen he refused to give him a cigarette. He then returned to the police, this\ntime adding that Myers had threatened him with a knife. \u201cHe said he\u2019d seen\nMartin with a little spud knife. Well, Martin never carried a knife,\u201d Mary\nsays.\n\nFrom prison, Myers tells me it\u2019s true that he threatened the young man, but he\ninsists talk of a knife is nonsense. \u201cI got into a bit of an argument when he\nasked whether I was a Traveller. I grabbed his hand and said: \u2018Give me a\ncigarette or I\u2019ll knock you out.\u2019 I did say that, I admit that. He went there\nand wrote a statement that night and then he goes back to the police station\nthe next day. The second statement is the same as the first statement, except\nit has one thing different; he said I had a knife up my sleeve. I never,\nSimon. I never had a knife.\u201d\n\nKnife or no knife, it\u2019s hard to believe that Myers is in his 19th year of an\nindeterminate sentence for attempting to steal a cigarette. He tries to keep\npositive for his mother\u2019s sake, but it\u2019s a challenge that is often beyond him.\nHis father, a brother and a sister have all died while he has been inside and\nhe wasn\u2019t allowed to attend their funerals. Myers claims that prison officers\nhave told him this is because they don\u2019t like attending \u201cGypsy funerals\u201d. His\ngreatest fear is that Mary will die while he is in prison. Mary\u2019s greatest\nfear is that he will kill himself in prison.\n\nMyers is one of many young men who were handed indeterminate sentences with\nshort tariffs. According to government data, 99% of IPP prisoners are male and\nmore than one-third of IPPs were given to less serious offenders, jailed on a\ntariff of two years or fewer. Wayne Bell was given a two-year tariff when he\nwas 17 for punching another youth and stealing his bike. He has now served 17\nyears in jail. Lawrence Owen was 17 when he set fire to his home to try to\nkill himself after losing three members of his family to cancer in a period of\nmonths. He then phoned the police to admit what he had done. Owen was given a\ntariff of two years and served 13 years. Kelvin Speakman, who spent his\nchildhood in and out of care homes and had mental health and addiction\nproblems, was given a two-year tariff for arson in 2007. He killed himself in\nsegregation nine years later. He was 30.\n\nMyers has been refused parole numerous times. He believes this is at least\npartly down to mistakes made by the Parole Board and the Prison Service. In\n2011, he was wrongly accused of being a sex offender in a letter sent by the\nParole Board. From then on, he was a marked man. \u201cBecause Martin is\nilliterate, he got his cellmate to read what it said about him and that then\nwent around the prison,\u201d McMaster says. \u201cHe was beaten up so badly because of\nthis letter \u2013 and the stigma doesn\u2019t go away. It will never go away. It always\ncomes up. If Martin has an argument with someone, they say: you\u2019re a sex\noffender, you\u2019re a paedophile. He can\u2019t get away from it.\u201d He was hospitalised\ntwice as a result of the assaults.\n\nMyers (right) with his twin brother, Patrick, in 2023.\n\nMyers says the false allegations made his life in prison impossible. \u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen spat on, called a nonce, a rapist. And it wasn\u2019t me. When they wrote the\nletter in 2013, giving the reasons for being knocked back, they put it in\nthere. They said: the reason we\u2019re knocking you back for two years is your\ndrug misuse and your sexually violent offending.\u201d\n\nHe made a complaint to the Prison Service in June 2015, after he was attacked\nby three men because of his supposed sexual offences. Sex offenders are so\nvulnerable in prisons that they are often kept separately from the rest of the\npopulation. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) admitted its mistake and paid Myers\n\u00a321,000 in compensation. He has been attacked a number of times since, his\nassailants still smearing him as a sex offender.\n\nMyers has also falsely been accused of taking a hostage at High Down prison.\nIn a letter seen by the Guardian, the head of security and operations at the\nprison wrote: \u201cThis is not something that has happened while Mr Myers has been\nat High Down,\u201d adding that he could not see \u201cany reason\u201d why it was placed on\nhis file.\n\nMyers says his record is full of false allegations. \u201cI had 178 nickings on my\nNomis [National Offender Management Information System].\u201d Myers talks quietly,\npatiently explaining prison terminology to me. \u201cYou know what a nicking is? An\nadjudication. If you get in trouble in prison, you get placed on report in\nfront of the governor. That\u2019s called adjudication. We call it nickings. And\nthey put 178 adjudications on my Nomis that didn\u2019t belong to me. I\u2019ve also got\nan apology from probation saying I\u2019d \u2018hot-watered\u2019 someone [thrown boiling\nwater on a fellow prisoner\u2019s face] when I didn\u2019t.\u201d In the letter, also seen by\nthe Guardian, the probation officer writes: \u201cI am enclosing a copy of your\namended report. I have taken out the part about the adjudication and the hot\nwater. It was my mistake ... I AM SORRY.\u201d\n\nMyers happens to phone the IPP campaigner Donna Mooney when I am with her. Her\nbrother Tommy Nicol killed himself in 2015 while serving an IPP sentence.\nMooney co-founded the IPP campaigning group Ungripp and is in frequent contact\nwith Myers and other IPP prisoners. Her long-term mission is to get IPP\nprisoners resentenced. But her more immediate purpose is to ensure that\nvulnerable prisoners such as Myers retain hope and don\u2019t kill themselves.\n\nTommy Nicol was kind and friendly \u2013 a beloved brother. Why did he die in\nprison on a \u201899-year\u2019 sentence?\n\nRead more\n\nMyers, who is on speakerphone, says the Parole Board letter falsely alleging\nhe was a sex offender caused his marriage fell apart. \u201cThe minute they put me\ndown as a sex offender and I got beaten up a few times, my wife looked at me\ndifferent and I looked at my wife different,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time I had a\nvisit with her, I thought: \u2018Does she think I\u2019m a wrong \u2019un? Does she think I\u2019m\na nonce or a rapist?\u2019 Our relationship went downhill from there and we got\ndivorced. I\u2019ve lost my wife, my marriage, my kids and everything because of\nwhat they did.\u201d Myers is no longer in touch with his children.\n\nHe believes the letter from the Parole Board alleging he was a sex offender\nwas a genuine mistake, but he is not prepared to give the benefit of the doubt\nover the other allegations made by prison officers. \u201cWhen they put me down as\na sex offender in the letter, that was an accident. But the 178 adjudications,\nand hot water and hostage-taking, was deliberately done, I think. That was to\nknock me back for years.\u201d\n\nHe is convinced that prison officers exploited his illiteracy to make false\nallegations. (Data published by the MoJ in 2022 revealed that 57% of adults in\nprison in the UK have a reading level below that of the average 11-year-old.)\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is putting stuff in my parole dossier, knowing I can\u2019t\nread and write and I can\u2019t get an inmate to read my dossier after what\nhappened with the stuff saying I was a sex offender. They could get me\nkilled.\u201d\n\nThe MoJ declined to comment on the false allegation that Myers was a sex\noffender, the adjudications or the accusations of hostage-taking and hot-\nwatering.\n\nSince 1993, the prison population in England and Wales has almost doubled from\n44,246 to 87,869, peaking at more than 88,000 in October 2023. It\u2019s the\nhighest per capita population in western Europe (146 per 100,000), closely\nfollowed by Scotland (144 per 100,000), with Portugal a distant third (121 per\n100,000).\n\n> He\u2019s missing out on so much ... I need Martin. He\u2019s the closest thing to my\n> dad. I need him out\n\nLacey, Myers\u2019 niece\n\nThere are two main reasons: more people are being sentenced to immediate\ncustody and people are serving long prison sentences. The length of the\naverage sentence grew from 16 months in 1993 to 20.2 months in 2018. In\nOctober 2023, the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, announced plans to reduce the\nprison population, including early release on licence and the suspension of\nshort sentences.\n\nYet while our prisons face an overcrowding crisis, the number of prisoners\nbeing recalled on IPP sentences without committing further crimes has surged\nin recent years, accounting for almost three-quarters of IPP returns in 2022.\nLast September, a freedom of information request by the Centre for Crime and\nJustice Studies found that 461 of 625 IPP offenders recalled in 2022 \u2013 74% \u2013\nhad not been charged with a new offence. The proportion was up significantly\non 2015, when the respective figures were 205 and 363 (56%). Of the 2,796 IPP\nprisoners in jail as of 31 March 2024, more than half (1,616) were recalled to\ncustody.\n\nIn October 2023, Myers was finally released on licence. He still doesn\u2019t know\nwhat made the difference this time. For prisoners serving regular sentences,\nit is the Parole Board\u2019s responsibility to prove they remain a threat to the\npublic, but for IPP prisoners it is their responsibility to prove they are not\na threat. It can be an impossible ask. As far as Myers was concerned, he\u2019d\ndone nothing different this time to prove he was no longer a danger to the\npublic. Then again, he never thought he had been.\n\nMyers was determined that he would never return to jail. Ten weeks later, he\nwas recalled. Myers had not committed another offence. When Mooney rang me\ntowards the end of last year to tell me he had been recalled to jail for\ntaking Valium, I couldn\u2019t believe it. But it was true.\n\nBack in Luton, Mary goes into the kitchen to make us a hot drink. McMaster\ntalks about the many ways in which she has seen the Myers family discriminated\nagainst over the years for being Travellers. McMaster, who used to run the Arc\nchildren\u2019s centre in Luton, tells me of the time she tried to help the family\nwhen they kept getting turned away from the benefits office. \u201cI rang the\nmanager and said: \u2018This keeps happening,\u2019 and he was like: \u2018No, I don\u2019t think\nit does.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I went down there with Mary\u2019s daughter Helen. Helen went first, I stood\nback, and the lady said: \u2018No, I can\u2019t deal with this.\u2019 Then I stepped forward\nand said: \u2018I\u2019ve got a meeting with the manager about this,\u2019 and I said to the\nmanager I blatantly watched it happen. It was terrible. In the end, he did\nsort her benefits, but that\u2019s unfair. It was just because they\u2019re Travellers.\u201d\n\nMary returns with tea and biscuits. \u201cYou need to put two teabags to make a\ndecent cup these days,\u201d she says. Mary has been listening to the conversation\nabout the prejudices the family has faced. \u201cThey just hear your voice. You\u2019ve\ngot a Traveller\u2019s voice, somehow or other. No matter how you do yourself up,\nyou can have diamonds and pearls, as soon as they look at you they know you\u2019re\na Traveller. They can pick us out of a million people.\u201d\n\nLike all prisoners who have served a sentence of at least two weeks, Myers was\nreleased with \u00a382.39 to aid his resettlement, known as the discharge grant. He\nsays he was released without his regular medication. There was no preparation\nfor his return to the community, no therapy, no mental health support. Even\ncampaigners such as Mooney, who believe IPP prisoners who have served over\ntheir tariff should be released into the community, think they first have to\nbe helped to readjust into the outside world.\n\nMary wanted Myers to live at her home in Luton. She had plenty of room and\nunderstood his needs. But Myers was ordered to live in approved premises in a\nrough part of town. She says he didn\u2019t have a chance. \u201cAt the hostel, there\nwas nothing there but drugs, drink and prostitution. He got a punch in the\nback of the neck. He was asked out to fight and he couldn\u2019t fight.\u201d Myers knew\nthat if he was caught fighting, it would mean an instant recall. \u201cI went down\nto see the probation officer and they had a psychologist there. I said to\nthem: \u2018You put Martin into a place he\u2019s going to fail. You put him in there to\nfail.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very worried.\u2019 Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dr\u0103goi/The Guardian\n\nHe managed to avoid the temptation to take class A drugs (he has had addiction\nissues in the past). He spent the days walking to and from Mary\u2019s house,\nspending time with his mother. \u201cWhen he came out of prison, he knew nothing,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to manage his money. Martin gave away all his\nmoney to his nephews and nieces \u2013 sweets, McDonald\u2019s, \u00a314 for haircuts. He\ndidn\u2019t know how to do nothing. They should have sent him into a rehabilitation\nplace where you learn to live on the outside again, or a proper hostel where\nsomebody\u2019s got control of it.\u201d\n\nAfter being released, Myers says, he was hounded by the police. On one\noccasion, officers arrested him and held him in custody for 40 minutes about a\nstolen car. It turned out the theft had happened while he was still in jail.\n(Bedfordshire police says it has no record of the arrest.) Myers began to feel\nthere was a conspiracy to have him recalled.\n\nAfter Mary and Myers complained about the approved premises, he was moved,\nwithout warning, to another approved premises \u2013 in Northampton, 30 miles away.\nHe was in a terrible state. He didn\u2019t know anyone and he tried desperately to\nkeep away from hard drugs, because he knew taking them would mean a recall. He\nwas riven with anxiety and still unable to get his medication. A fellow\nresident offered him Valium to ease his symptoms.\n\n\u201cI took three or four,\u201d Myers tells me from jail. \u201cAt the hostel, the manager\nasked me if I was under the influence of anything. I said: \u2018Yeah, I took some\nValium.\u2019 I went to bed. I woke up. Four policemen and the manager handcuffed\nme and dragged me back to jail.\u201d\n\n> It hit me harder than ever before when I went back to jail, because I\n> thought: \u2018How many years now am I going to do?\u2019\n\nMartin Myers\n\nAfter the resident had given him the Valium, he had offered to sell Myers a\nbatch. \u201cHe said: \u2018Martin, I\u2019ve got about 60 here, do you want them?\u2019 I said:\n\u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll take them off you, so I can take them every day for a few weeks.\u2019\nWhen I went back up to my room, I hid them up my arse, then when I got\nreturned to jail it came up on the body scan that I had something. I got them\nout, opened them up and it wasn\u2019t Valium. It was teabags.\u201d He can almost see\nthe funny side. \u201cSo, the resident gave me the first few for free and then he\nsold me teabags!\u201d\n\nHe was recalled to prison in October.\n\nThe MoJ declined to comment on the approved premises to which Myers was sent,\nor the reasons for his recall, but it acknowledged that Valium was a factor.\n\nHow did he feel when he was told he was being sent back for taking Valium? \u201cI\nwas devastated. I was beating my head against the door of the van. I went on a\nhunger strike and didn\u2019t eat for two weeks. On my kids\u2019 lives, everything hit\nme when I went back to jail harder than ever before, because I thought: \u2018How\nmany years now am I going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nI ask Mary how all this has affected her. \u201cSome days, I just don\u2019t want to get\nout of bed. Some days, I just go upstairs and get the quilt and put it over my\nhead and say: \u2018Right, that\u2019s it. Go to sleep.\u2019\u201d Because of Myers? \u201cYes,\nbecause I\u2019m fed up. I think of Martin all the time. I dream of him. Martin is\nnot as strong as the rest of the family. He could kill himself in seconds.\nSometimes he says: \u2018Mother, should I be in prison?\u2019 And I say: \u2018No, baby, you\nshouldn\u2019t be in prison, we\u2019ll do everything we can to get you out,\u2019 and then\nhis voice gets a bit stronger.\u201d\n\nMore than 18 years on, Myers is back where he started \u2013 serving an\nindeterminate sentence for threatening to steal a cigarette. The difference is\nthat he has seen the inside of numerous prisons and it is 12 years since the\nindeterminate sentence was abolished. His mother says she never will be able\nto make any sense of IPP: \u201cHow can it be right, people going to jail for two\nyears and doing 18 years?\u201d\n\nMyers tells me that, having been recalled, he can\u2019t see any possibility of\ngetting out in the near future. \u201cI think I\u2019ll get another knockback,\u201d he says.\nBut having experienced a taste of freedom, he is not giving up now. \u201cListen,\nI\u2019m trying my best. I\u2019ve had no adjudications since I\u2019ve been back in. I\u2019m\ntrying to keep my head down, I\u2019m trying my best and I\u2019m trying to go home. I\njust want to go home, Simon. That\u2019s all I want \u2013 to go home.\u201d\n\nThree weeks after this call with Myers, his twin brother, Patrick, dies of a\nheart attack at 42. Myers asks for temporary release to go to the funeral, but\nhe believes it is unlikely to be granted. He asks the prison to add my phone\nnumber to his list, but it refuses. His niece Bernadette rings me on his\nbehalf to ask if I will be sure to make it clear that he has never been\narrested for a sex offence.\n\nA day later, another niece, Lacey, rings. Lacey, who is Patrick\u2019s daughter, is\nclearly traumatised. She is still in shock about her father\u2019s death, but is\nterrified for Myers. \u201cHe says he\u2019s in a cell with no medication. I\u2019m worried.\nI don\u2019t know ...\u201d She trails off. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they want him to die. But he\u2019s\ngot a life and he\u2019s missing out on so much. My dad was such a funny guy. He\nhad a good soul, my dad. It\u2019s so sad. It\u2019s hard. Now, I need Martin. He\u2019s the\nclosest thing to my dad. I need him out.\u201d\n\nThe MoJ declined to comment on Myers\u2019 medication. \u201cWe have reduced the number\nof unreleased IPP prisoners by three-quarters since we scrapped the sentence\nin 2012, with a 12% fall in the last year alone where the Parole Board deemed\nprisoners safe to release,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cBut public protection\nwill always remain our top priority and the Parole Board must rightly consider\na prisoner\u2019s behaviour in jail when deciding whether they are safe to be\nreleased.\u201d\n\nMyers manages to get through to me shortly before Patrick\u2019s funeral. He sounds\ndesperate. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019m stuck in jail, no release date, doing a\nsentence that\u2019s been abolished for 12 years. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let me out\nfor Patrick\u2019s funeral. I\u2019m devastated,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t even say my last\ngoodbye to him.\u201d\n\nAs this article went to press, Myers got confirmation: he won\u2019t be permitted\nto attend his brother\u2019s funeral.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or\nemail jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
