In standard\n> models of bounded rationality, sub-optimal decision-making is simulated by\n> adding homoscedastic noise to optimal decisions rather than explicitly\n> simulating constrained inference. In this work, we introduce a latent\n> inference budget model (L-IBM) that models agents' computational constraints\n> explicitly, via a latent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents'\n> goals) that controls the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs\n> make it possible to learn agent models using data from diverse populations\n> of suboptimal actors. In three modeling tasks -- inferring navigation goals\n> from routes, inferring communicative intents from human utterances, and\n> predicting next moves in human chess games -- we show that L-IBMs match or\n> outperform Boltzmann models of decision-making under uncertainty. Inferred\n> inference budgets are themselves meaningful, efficient to compute, and\n> correlated with measures of player skill, partner skill and task difficulty.\n\nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2312.04030 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2312.04030v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.04030arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Athul Paul Jacob [view email] [v1] Thu, 7 Dec 2023 03:55:51 UTC (220 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Modeling Boundedly Rational Agents with Latent\nInference Budgets, by Athul Paul Jacob and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2312\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
