But the roughly 60 million Americans\nbenefiting from the program are poised to soon lose the discount because key\nRepublicans \u2014 who routinely dole out billions of dollars on far dumber fare \u2014\nrefuse to fund a $4-$7 billion extension.\n\nAs a result, the FCC started informing struggling Americans in April that\ntheir broadband bills are all about to jump significantly as the program\nstarts to wind down. There\u2019s apparently going to be a last ditch effort to\nfinance the program in May, but despite the support of broadband providers and\na sizeable bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, the funding bill has a long-shot\nchance at success.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson is basically slow walking the funding\nbill to death because a key component of MAGA types don\u2019t want to pay for the\nprogram or give the Biden administration a policy win in an election season.\n\nThese are, it should be noted, the same Republicans that doled out trillions\nin tax breaks to corporations in exchange for nothing (including $42 billion\nto AT&T alone). They\u2019re also the same Republicans that wanted to give Elon\nMusk a billion dollars so he could pretend to deliver expensive satellite\nbroadband to some airport parking lots and a handful of traffic medians.\n\nThese same Republicans routinely throw absurd gobs of money at all sorts of\nideological dipshittery and badly managed corporate handouts. The \u201cfiscal\nresponsibility\u201d stuff is a performance the lazy U.S. press helps the party\nperpetuate. In reality, it\u2019s just petty obstructionism.\n\nFolks like Gigi Sohn, whose nomination to the FCC you might recall was killed\nby a sleazy telecom industry and GOP joint disinformation campaign, isn\u2019t\nparticularly impressed:\n\n> \u201cBecause of political gameplay, about 60 million Americans will have to make\n> hard choices between paying for the internet or paying for food, rent, and\n> other utilities, widening the digital divide in this country,\u201d said Gigi\n> Sohn, a former top FCC official. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing that a popular,\n> bipartisan program with support from nearly half of Congress will end\n> because of politics, not policy.\u201d\n\nIf you care about this sort of stuff, I suspect your lawmakers might benefit\nfrom a call.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in love with the ACP. It basically involves throwing billions of\ndollars at telecom giants so they\u2019ll temporarily reduce high broadband prices\n\u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be high in the first place if they hadn\u2019t spent 30 years\nlobbying (quite successfully) to defang our regulators and crush all\ncompetition. Many of these same companies (like Verizon and Charter) exploited\nthe program to upsell users to more expensive tiers.\n\nBut given that both Democrats and Republicans are too corrupt to tackle or\neven acknowledge the real problem (unchecked regional monopoly, stifled\ncompetition, and market failure), this was at least some sort of temporary\nsolution. We actively courted low income Americans to the program, got them\nused to the benefits of affordable internet during a health crisis, then\npulled the rug out from under their feet.\n\nFiled Under: affordability, Affordable Connectivity Program, broadband,\ncongress, corruption, fcc, high speed internet, low income, telecom\n\n4 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Net Neutrality Is Back!

We were\ncontacted by a door-to-door salesman for Verizon over their 4G wireless\nmodems. We have always been hesitant to try it, but the speed was triple our\ncurrent line, and cost the exact same cost. During the talk with the rep, he\nmentioned in massing that the cost could be reduced even further with the \u201cACP\nprogram\u201d as well. I took one glance at the description and realized it was a\nsubsidy for low income, which did not apply to our family for SURE, so I\nignored it. (Postscript Verizon: We dumped it, because after a week or so we\nstarted getting disconnects every day that lasted several minutes. We work\nfrom home, so a reliable internet is more important than faster speeds)\n\nLater, while setting up Comcast internet for a friend, I was forced to call\nthem to set up the modem. Despite me not mentioning anything about financials\nand with them in full knowledge that I was a friend and not a member of the\nhouse, the phone rep mentioned (again) the ACP to me in their end-spiel. This\nfamily probably could qualify for it.\n\nAt that point I realized that the ISPs are simply pushing this not for their\ncustomer\u2019s sake, but most likely because they get to keep a few extra bucks (I\nbelieve the government pays out more to the ISP than the ISP reduces\ncustomer\u2019s costs by, so it\u2019s an incentive for them to advertise). Feels pretty\nicky that ANY money of a customer-based support bill is given to pad the\npockets of any ISPs too.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nDon Baker says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 7:49 am\n\n# Nailed It\n\nA $30 discount on $100 service that should cost $30.There lies the problem as\nyou have noted so many times and yet...\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 8:16 am\n\n> Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is basically slow walking the funding\n> bill to death because a key component of MAGA types don\u2019t want to pay for\n> the program or give the Biden administration a policy win in an election\n> season.\n\nAlso because it makes poor people just a little less desperate, and the\nRepublican party\u2019s whole bag is ensuring there\u2019s a large, desperate lower\nclass.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nThe NBA\u2019s Next \u2018TV\u2019 Rights Contracts Are Going To Be Fascinating And Telling\n\nThere\u2019s One Last Shot To Save A Low Income Broadband Program Republicans Are\nTrying To Kill\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * How I Use AI To Help With Techdirt (And, No, It\u2019s Not Writing Articles)\n  * Effective Altruism\u2019s Bait-and-Switch: From Global Poverty To AI Doomerism\n  * Judge Tosses Out Many Of The Remaining Charges Against Backpage\u2019s Michael Lacey\n\nTechdirt Deals\n\nBuy Now\n\n$99.00\n\nU-STREAM Home Streaming Studio with 10\" Ring Light & Tripod\n\nTechdirt Insider Discord\n\nThe latest chatter on the Techdirt Insider Discord channel...\n\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over.
