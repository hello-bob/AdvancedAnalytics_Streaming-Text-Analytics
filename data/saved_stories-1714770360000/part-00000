But\nyou will hardly ever hear about this in church.\n\nNina Kristiansen journalist\n\nwednesday 01. May 2024 - 04:30\n\n\u201cWe who study the Old Testament are very aware that God has a past. The\nreligion described in these texts comes from somewhere,\u201d says Anne Katrine de\nHemmer Gudme.\n\nShe is a professor at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Theology.\n\nIt all starts in a turbulent area in the Middle East.\n\nIt begins with people losing their land. Before, they could go to the temples,\nwhere they could see and learn about the gods and how to worship them. When\nthey no longer had access to the temples, texts became more important, like a\nkind of instruction manual.\n\n\u201cSacred texts become the centre of religion, but this did not happen right\naway,\u201d Gudme says.\n\nAnnonse\n\n## Two vulnerable kingdoms\n\nNearly 3,000 years ago, two small kingdoms were located where Israel and\nPalestine are today. They were neither large nor important, but were\nstrategically located on an important trade route.\n\nThis resulted in other kingdoms constantly targeting them. They were besieged\nand conquered. In the year 722 BCE, Israel, one of the kingdoms, falls. 130\nyears later, Judah, the other, falls. The people flee.\n\nThese peoples had several gods, whom they worshiped and sacrificed to in their\ntemples. Yahweh was one of them. Today he is called God.\n\nNeither he nor the other gods protected their people from their enemies.\n\n\u201cThese people were in the midst of a national, collective trauma. They had\nexperienced total defeat. They then begin to produce texts for what later\nbecomes the Old Testament. Think of it as a form of crisis management,\u201d Gudme\nsays.\n\n## Preserve and promote Yahweh\n\nThey keep their god, Yahweh, even though he did not protect them from\noccupation and exile. Maybe it was their fault that they were not good enough\nworshipers?\n\n\u201cBut now they change the religion. Previously they had several gods, where\nYahweh was one of them. Now he becomes the most important,\u201d Gudme says.\n\nOnly a few scholars could write at the time.\n\n\u201cSo it's among this elite that we find the authors of the Old Testament. It's\nnot unusual for the upper class to set the premises,\u201d she says.\n\nTheir message was that from now on, Yahweh would be the only god they would\nworship.\n\nThat's why they use a lot of space in their writings to warn against the other\ngods.\n\nAnne Katrine de Hemmer Gudme studies the Old Testament at the Faculty of\nTheology at the University of Oslo.(Photo: Nina Kristiansen)\n\n## Believed in other gods\n\nAnnonse\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it was more monolatry than monotheism,\u201d says Gudme.\n\nMonolatry means that the authors of the Old Testament recognised that other\ngods existed, but they encouraged people to worship only one of them, Yahweh.\n\n\u201cLater on, over the centuries, they move to the belief that there is only one\ngod, Yahweh or God as we call him today,\u201d Gudme says.\n\nOn the path from Yahweh as one of several gods to the only god, the other gods\nare harassed and declared powerless.\n\n\u201cThese gods slowly disappear, because many were satisfied with them and still\nworshiped them. They didn't bother to listen to some grumpy men who said that\nYahweh was the only god,\u201d she says.\n\nAsherah was one of the gods that the authors of the Old Testament warn\nagainst.\n\n## Yahweh and his Asherah\n\n\u201cThe way Asherah is treated in the scriptures is deeply fascinating. She is\nvilified and demeaned. She is linked to a Syrian god and not mentioned in\nconnection with Yahweh,\u201d Gudme says.\n\nBut Asherah was closer to Yahweh than the authors of the Old Testament would\nadmit. Gudme, like other Bible scholars, believes she may have been Yahweh's\nwife.\n\n\u201cInscriptions have been found from that time that place Asherah side by side\nwith Yahweh, that she is Yahweh's Asherah,\u201d she says.\n\nAsherah and Yahweh ae also depicted on pots. The inscription is a blessing to\n'Yahweh and his Asherah'. This pot is from around 800 BCE and was found by\narchaeologists in Sinai.(Photo: Wikimedia / public domain)\n\nThere are not many inscriptions that point to Asherah and Yahweh as a couple,\nbut they have been found in several places in the area.\n\nOne of them is from Sinai, Egypt \u2013 see the image above. Another of the finds\nwas made in Jerusalem. Two divine figures stand close together on a fragment\nof a pot. Researchers believe it is Yahweh and Asherah.\n\n## Fierce propaganda against Asherah\n\nIn addition to inscriptions, researchers have found a number of small female\nceramic figurines. Most agree that these represent Asherah.\n\n\u201cThese figurines may represent Asherah,\u201d says Anne Katrine Gudme. It was\ncommon to have such a figurine at home from 700 to 500 BCE.(Photo: Chamberi /\nWikimedia / CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n\u201cWe don't know much about Asherah. She is often associated with love, passion,\nand war, but it's not certain that these were actually her domains,\u201d says\nGudme.\n\nThe authors of the Old Testament were active in their propaganda against\nAsherah. They equate her with a well-known villain, the false god Ba'al. They\nencourage people to destroy symbols of Asherah.\n\n\u2018Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah\npoles, and burn their idols in the fire,\u2019 it says in Deuteronomy, chapter 7,\nverse 5.\n\n\u201cThey are eager to tell people not to worship Asherah, also called the Queen\nof Heaven. This wouldn't have been necessary if they thought she didn't\nexist,\u201d Gudme says.\n\n## Losing ground over time\n\nPeople protest. They do not want to give up their goddess: \u2018But ever since we\nstopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings\nto her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine\u2019\n(Jeremiah, chapter 44, verse 18). Because after they stopped worshiping the\ngoddess, they lost everything. War and famine took their lives.\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  * #### God originally had a wife\n\n  * #### \u201cOur urine is worth its weight in gold,\u201d says researcher\n\n  * #### Are we really running out of helium?\n\n  * #### Wolf packs don\u2019t actually have alpha males and alpha females, the idea is based on a misunderstanding\n\nBut time passes. The texts multiply, and the existence of other gods is toned\ndown. Now the authors put more emphasis on the fact that Yahweh is the only\ngod that exists.\n\nAnd he gains more and more followers.\n\n\u201cSome events make the texts even more important, such as the Romans destroying\nthe temple in Jerusalem around the year 70 BCE. By then, the scriptures had\nabsolute authority,\u201d Gudme says.\n\nThe worshipers of Yahweh have succeeded.\n\n## Triumphs in three religions\n\n\u201cMany other religions have also had collections of scriptures, but the texts\nthat become the Old Testament have had an exceptional history of being handed\ndown through the centuries,\u201d says Gudme.\n\n\u201cThey become sacred texts in Judaism. They are picked up by the first\nChristians. And they appear as stories in the Quran,\u201d she says\n\nCato Gulaker is head of studies and an associate professor at Ansgar\nUniversity College, which is owned by the Mission Covenant Church of Norway.\n\nGulaker confirms that the scholarly approach to the Bible widely accepts that\nGod's identity changed when scripture became more important than land during\nthe exile.\n\n\u201cYahweh was a local storm god in the Late Bronze Age. To put it simply, many\nsmall gods were merged into the big god,\u201d he says.\n\nThis was not popular in some Christian circles.\n\n## Feelings run high among students\n\n\u201cThere are some who would prefer this not to be the case, and who try to\nchallenge this information,\u201d says Gulaker.\n\nGod's past is not widely known \u2013 not even among the students who study\ntheology at Ansgar University College.\n\n\"They encounter their childhood faith, which is a lightweight, against the\nheavy academic study of the texts in the Old Testament. The students go\nthrough a maturation process,\" says Gulaker.\n\nSome students find this process more painful than others, but the education\nfocuses on the biblical texts.\n\n\u201cThis is not about theory or archaeology. We stick closely to the biblical\ntexts. Students learn Hebrew and Greek and about what has been lost in the\ntranslations. Then they have to make up their own minds,\u201d Gulaker says.\n\nHe mentions that feelings can run high in the classroom when they go through\nhow God changed over the 1,000 years that the Old Testament was written.\n\nCato Gulaker is head of studies and researcher at Ansgar University\nCollege.(Photo: Lasse Eid / Ansgar College)\n\n## Does not go over well in church\n\n\u201cThe Old Testament contains stories of God being jealous, irritated, and\ntaking evening walks, and stories where God is omniscient and omnipotent,\u201d\nGulaker says.\n\nHe clarifies that the teaching emphasises studies of texts about God that have\nevolved over time, represented by what people have thought and written about\nhim.\n\n\u201cGod himself is not available as a research subject,\u201d he says.\n\nMost students end up with a less rigid view of the Bible, and more knowledge\nof what the texts actually say.\n\n\"Yet, they are left with the idea that the ancient scriptures have something\nto say to us today,\" says Gulaker.\n\nBut you won't hear the priest talking about God's past or the slightly\nirritated god.\n\n\u201cMuch of this does not go over well during the Sunday service. But I teach\nabout this in Bible classes for people who want to know more,\u201d he says.\n\n## Skilled god or skilled helpers?\n\nSo the question is whether Yahweh prevailed over Asherah and the other gods\nbecause he was a stronger god or because he had more skilled people on his\nside.\n\n\u201cIt depends on whether you look at this historically or religiously. Yahweh\nessentially had his own advertising agency and copywriters. He was supported\nby people who had power in society, and who managed to recruit more people,\u201d\nGudme says.\n\nShe believes she knows what the authors of the Old Testament would have\nanswered:\n\n\u201cThey would answer both ways: We have the best god, and the best god has us,\nwho are the best worshipers,\u201d she says.\n\nBut it could have gone differently.\n\n\u201cIt was not a given that Yahweh would survive the other gods, but sometimes\ncoincidences and a bit of luck lead to events that change the world,\u201d Gudme\nsays.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTranslated by Nancy Bazilchuk\n\nRead the Norwegian version of this article on forskning.no\n\n##### Related content:\n\nUniversity of Agder\n\n## People who marry and have children become more religious\n\n## Top 10 of 2023: Scrotums, Vikings, and man flu\n\nreligion christianity archaeology history society and culture\n\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 LinkedIn Del p\u00e5 e-post\n\nAnnonse\n\n## While her husband was doing forced labour for embezzlement, Maren Bang\nwrote the first Norwegian cookbook\n\n## God originally had a wife\n\n## The judge who saved witches from the stake\n\n## Prison officer so irritated by researchers with no experience that he\npursued a doctorate himself\n\n## All sperm whales off the Norwegian coasts are males.
