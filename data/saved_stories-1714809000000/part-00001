However, the fragile nature of entangled\n> photons operating in real-world fiber infrastructure has historically\n> limited continuous operation of such networks. Here, we present a fully\n> automated system capable of distributing polarization entangled photons over\n> a 34 km deployed fiber in New York City. We achieve end-to-end pair rates of\n> nearly 5\\times10^5 pairs/s and entanglement fidelity of approximately 99\\%.\n> Separately, we achieve 15 days of continuous distribution, with a network\n> up-time of 99.84\\%. Our work paves the way for practical deployment of 24/7\n> entanglement-based networks with rates and fidelity adequate for many\n> current and future use-cases.\n\nSubjects:| Quantum Physics (quant-ph)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08626 [quant-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08626v1 [quant-ph] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08626arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Mehdi Namazi [view email] [v1] Fri, 12 Apr 2024 17:39:51 UTC (2,972 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Automated distribution of high-rate, high-\nfidelity polarization entangled photons using deployed metropolitan fibers, by\nAlexander N.
