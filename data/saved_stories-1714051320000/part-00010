In that time, I\u2019ve trained a lot of\ngenerative models. More than anyone really has any right to train. As I\u2019ve\nspent these hours observing the effects of tweaking various model\nconfigurations and hyperparameters, one thing that has struck me is the\nsimilarities in between all the training runs.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming awfully clear to me that these models are truly approximating\ntheir datasets to an incredible degree. What that means is not only that they\nlearn what it means to be a dog or a cat, but the interstitial frequencies\nbetween distributions that don\u2019t matter, like what photos humans are likely to\ntake or words humans commonly write down.\n\nWhat this manifests as is \u2013 trained on the same dataset for long enough,\npretty much every model with enough weights and training time converges to the\nsame point. Sufficiently large diffusion conv-unets produce the same images as\nViT generators. AR sampling produces the same images as diffusion.\n\nThis is a surprising observation! It implies that model behavior is not\ndetermined by architecture, hyperparameters, or optimizer choices. It\u2019s\ndetermined by your dataset, nothing else. Everything else is a means to an end\nin efficiently delivery compute to approximating that dataset.\n\nThen, when you refer to \u201cLambda\u201d, \u201cChatGPT\u201d, \u201cBard\u201d, or \u201cClaude\u201d then, it\u2019s\nnot the model weights that you are referring to. It\u2019s the dataset.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Non_Interactive \u2013 Software & ML | Powered by Minimalist Blog WordPress Theme\n\n", "frontpage": true}
