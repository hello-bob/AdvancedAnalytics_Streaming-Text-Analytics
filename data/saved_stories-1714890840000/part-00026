I\u2019ve come to understand that a warm and loving family is worth\ninfinitely more than the money or accomplishments I hoped might compensate for\nthem.\u201d\n\nHenderson, who has written for the Wall Street Journal and has a popular\nSubstack newsletter, is best known for coining the term \u201cluxury beliefs\u201d \u2014\nideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while inflicting\ncosts on the lower classes.\n\nOne example is residents of an apartment building with a 24-hour doorman on\nthe Upper East Side advocating for abolishing the police, another is the idea\nthat education is all that people need to succeed, and that home life is\nsecondary.\n\n9\n\nRob Henderson\u2019s new memoir follows his path from foster care to Yale\nUniversity. John Nguyen/JNVisuals for NY Post\n\nThe 33-year-old uses his personal story to make broader points about class\ndifferences, the importance of family and how government social services\nutterly failed him.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### Chaos ensues at \u2018Fyre Festival of books\u2019 conference in Denver that\nreportedly left multiple bibliophiles with injuries\n\n### How Whoopi Goldberg survived double doses of grief\n\n### The limits of the International Criminal Court and more: Letters to the\nEditor \u2014 May 5, 2024\n\nBorn in Los Angeles to a drug-addicted mother, Henderson was put in foster\ncare at age 3.\n\nBy the time he was 17, he\u2019d lived in ten different homes.\n\nHis upbringing was filled with poverty and violence.\n\nHe recalls his birth mother being handcuffed as he was yanked from her,\npacking his belongings in shoeboxes and garbage bags as he was shuffled from\none foster home to the next and even his adoptive mother\u2019s partner getting\nshot.\n\n9\n\nRob Henderson\u2019s first book \u201cTroubled\u201d is out on February 20th.\n\nBut, he persevered, entering the Air Force at age 17 in 2007, graduating with\na BS in psychology from Yale in 2018 via their ROTC program, and earning a PhD\nin psychology from Cambridge in 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople have told me that my story has brought them to tears,\u201d Henderson\nwrites. \u201cThat\u2019s never been my intention \u2014 I don\u2019t want pity. I\u2019m one of the\nlucky ones. There are many kids who have suffered far more. Some of them never\nrecover from what they\u2019ve endured.\u201d\n\nHere, he talks to The Post about his new book, family and education.\n\n9\n\nHenderson says the experience of writing a memoir was emotionally taxing. John\nNguyen/JNVisuals for NY Post\n\nWhy did you decide to go down the memoir route for your first book?\n\nInitially it wasn\u2019t my plan, but I have an unusual story, and I wanted to give\npeople a sense of what life is actually like for a child and a teenager living\nin extreme chaos \u2014 which is illustrative of what life is like now in working\nclass neighborhoods in America.\n\nThere aren\u2019t that many stories like this written about the sort of people who\nlived in foster care and are on the margins of society.\n\nHow did the instability of foster care inform your views on the importance of\nfamily?\n\nOddly enough, I never really had a stable, permanent family, but the book is\nabout the importance of family.\n\nI lived in seven different foster homes in Los Angeles, and then I was adopted\nand lived through a few separations and divorces. So, in total, it was 10\ndifferent homes \u2014 without even counting my birth mother and the frequent\nrelocations living in her car or in slum apartments.\n\n9\n\nRob Henderson was shuffled through more than ten households growing up in\nfoster care. Courtesy of Rob Henderson\n\nThere was a period in my adolescence from 9 to 13 where I did have two\nparents.\n\nMy adoptive mother entered a relationship with a woman and they raised me for\na few years together.\n\nThe bright spot of my childhood was those years.\n\nMy grades were the highest they had ever been.\n\nI was the most academically focused.\n\nI was the least likely to get into trouble at school or with my friends.\n\nWe can focus on economics, but I would much rather focus on stability and\nsecurity \u2014 the emotional rather than just the financial.\n\nMore broadly, if you look at the statistics for who ends up going to college,\nthese are kids from two parent families.\n\nWe focus a lot on poverty and inequality, but actually, if you look at the\ndata, it\u2019s instability that\u2019s much more likely to predict whether a kid goes\nto college or not.\n\nA kid who lives in extreme unpredictability in his or her early life is much\nless likely to go to college than a kid who simply lives in a low income\nfamily.\n\n9\n\nHenderson says his unstable childhood taught him about the importance of\nfamily. Courtesy of Rob Henderson\n\nYou argue that educated people tend to overemphasize education as a fix-all\nfor underprivileged kids. Why is that?\n\nPeople involved in policy and shaping culture focus on education as the\nprimary means of upward social mobility.\n\nOne of the points I try to make in the book is that yes, education is\nimportant.\n\nIt worked for me.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily work for everyone.\n\nEven though I was always academically inclined, the level of disorder in my\nlife was weighing me down so much that I wasn\u2019t in a position to fully exploit\nmy own capabilities.\n\nThe kinds of people we want to see achieve social mobility are often in\nextremely dire, unstable, chaotic circumstances \u2014 the kind of circumstances\nthat I grew up in \u2014 and even if you do somehow manage to get every single one\nof these kids into some fancy college and they get a degree and they get a\ncomfortable high paying job, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make up for all of the\nsuffering that they went through.\n\n9\n\nThe author is currently studying at Cambridge University. John\nNguyen/JNVisuals for NY Post\n\nI\u2019d like us to focus more on what happens before age 18 than after.\n\nWe\u2019re so focused on, \u2018Ok, they graduate high school. Do they go to college or\nnot? And do they graduate from college?\u2019\n\nI argue that, through childhood and adolescence, we have to focus more on,\n\u2018Are these kids being looked out for? Are they being nurtured? Do they have\nthis sort of security and adequate care in order for them to achieve the\nthings that we would like them to achieve?\u2019\n\nIn your years at Yale and then Cambridge, what differences did you notice\nbetween your peers and yourself?\n\nI realized, of course, these kids came from wealthier backgrounds financially.\n\nBut they also came from more comfortable backgrounds in terms of stability and\nstructure.\n\nI had a class where a professor administered an anonymous poll.\n\nOut of the 20 students, 18 of them had been raised by both of their birth\nparents.\n\nThat just floored me because where I grew up it was zero.\n\n9\n\nHenderson says he was always academically inclined but that a chaotic\nchildhood suppressed his potential. Courtesy of Rob Henderson\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the kinds of kids who go to places like\nYale came from stable families, where their parents prioritize their marriage\nand their relationships and education.\n\nThose early experiences at Yale were sort of the foundational experiences that\nled me to develop this idea of luxury beliefs.\n\nThe importance of the two-parent family is a perfect example.\n\nA lot of people who graduate from places like Yale will express this opinion\nthat two parents are unimportant for kids, and that all families are exactly\nthe same.\n\nMeanwhile, almost every single one of these elite college graduates were\nraised by two parents and then they themselves will go on to replicate those\nsame experiences for their own kids.\n\n9\n\nAt Yale University, Henderson realized most of his privileged peers were\nraised in two-parent households. John Nguyen/JNVisuals for NY Post\n\nHow do you think we can work towards closing the gap between the intellectual\nelite class and the rest of the public?\n\nWe should be skeptical of the people who claim to speak on behalf of these\ncommunities.\n\nInstead of looking to self proclaimed leaders of various marginalized and\ndispossessed groups, we need to actually ask those groups themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s worth collecting data, looking at surveys, speaking with people \u2014 not\njust community leaders and activists who have their own agendas.\n\nI saw this at Yale where someone who shares the characteristics of a\nhistorically mistreated group would claim to speak on behalf of them, but they\nhad very little in common with them other than the way that they looked.\n\nI want people to be a bit more skeptical of the self-proclaimed activist\nleaders who could be trying to push an agenda, trying to elicit sympathy, and\ntrying to exploit people\u2019s concerns\n\n9\n\nRobert Henderson (left), with his adoptive sister, only knew broken households\ngrowing up. Courtesy of Rob Henderson\n\nWhat is the number one lesson or take away that you hope that readers walk\naway with?\n\nA lot of the things that happen in our lives aren\u2019t our fault. But how we live\nour life is still our responsibility.\n\nOnce I became an adult, I realized a lot of the mistakes I had made were in\nlarge part due to my very unusual and difficult upbringing, but I couldn\u2019t use\nthat as an excuse anymore.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nThe people who caused suffering or caused difficulties in your life are not\ngoing to fix it. Only you can fix the trajectory of your life. Once I fully\naccepted that, things started to turn around for me.\n\nWriter and social critic Rob Henderson\u2019s debut book, \u201cTroubled: A Memoir of\nFoster Care, Family, and Social Class,\u201d is out this Tuesday.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * books\n  * Colleges and universities\n  * foster children\n  * memoirs\n  * poverty\n  * yale university\n  * 2/17/24\n\nRead Next Former CBS CEO Leslie Moonves fined $11K for prodding LA c...\n\n#### Trending Now in US News\n\n  * This story has been shared 245,089 times. 245,089\n\n### Wisconsin elementary school teacher, 24, busted for 'making out' with 5th-\ngrader -- three months before wedding\n\n  * This story has been shared 171,160 times. 171,160\n\n### Fourth body discovered in well where US, Australian surfers were\nreportedly found dead in Mexico\n\n  * This story has been shared 44,916 times. 44,916\n\n### University of Michigan commencement disrupted by anti-Israel protesters:\n'You are ruining our graduation'\n\n  * This story has been shared 33,791 times. 33,791\n\n### 'Violent' Columbia protester is heir to ad empire, has mansion, model baby\nmama \u2014 and long rap sheet\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Kourtney Kardashian says she was \u2018not feeling quite ready\u2019 during \u2018Kardashians\u2019 shoot while 3 months postpartum\n\n  * ### Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s look-alike daughter, Dannielynn, attends Kentucky Derby with dad Larry\n\n  * ### The 150th Kentucky Derby 2024 red carpet: Martha Stewart, Wynonna Judd, Sheryl Lee Ralph and more\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Today's Iconic Moment in NY Sports History: The New York Knicks draft Willis Reed\n\n## Now on Decider\n\n  * ### Bill Maher Blasts Merrick Garland For Always Being Soft On Trump\n\n  * \u2018The View\u2019 Derailed As Brooke Shields Describes Benjamin Bratt\u2019s \u201cModesty Sock\u201d In \u2018Mother Of The Bride\u2019\n  * \u2018WWHL\u2019: Andrea Canning Reveals Charlie Sheen\u2019s \u201cDrug Dealer Was In The Room\u201d For Their Viral 2011 Interview\n  * Anne Hathaway\u2019s \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 Interview Hits An Awkward Snag After The Audience Reacts In Silence To Her Question\n\nSee All\n\n## Covers\n\n### Today's Cover\n\n#### Front Cover Back Cover\n\n#### Flip for back cover\n\n### Browse Covers\n\nRob Henderson's new memoir follows his path from foster care to Yale\nUniversity.
