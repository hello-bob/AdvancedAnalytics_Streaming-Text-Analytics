The information was\nrevealed in court documents Google provided in its antitrust dispute with the\nUnited States Department of Justice.\n\nThe DoJ has accused Google of having a monopoly on search, and in the lawsuit\nagainst Google, the search engine deal with Apple has been a major focus. In\nNovember, lawsuit documents indicated that Google was paying 36 percent of the\ntotal revenue that it earns from searches conducted on Safari, and now it\nturns out that equates to $20 billion.\n\nGoogle has been the default search engine on Apple devices since 2002, though\nthe deal has been renegotiated several times. Apple and Google have worked to\nkeep the terms of the search engine agreement under wraps during the trial and\nbefore, but it has been well known that Google is paying Apple billions per\nyear.\n\nLast October, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the agreement between\nApple and Google has made it impossible for search engines like Bing to\ncompete. Microsoft at one point wanted Apple to buy Bing, but Apple was not\ninterested. Microsoft blamed Google, but Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple was\nconcerned that Bing could not compete in \"quality and capabilities.\" Cue\nclaimed that Apple uses Google as the iPhone's default search engine because\nApple has \"always thought it was the best.\"\n\nGoogle is the default search engine on Apple devices in most countries, but\nusers can opt to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia as alternatives.\nChanging browser engines requires opening up the Safari settings.\n\nIn Europe, the Digital Markets Act has required Apple to make changes to how\nbrowsers work. Users are able to choose a default browser when setting up\ntheir iPhone, and there are more options than the handful of providers that\nApple allows in the United States.\n\nIf Google loses the antitrust lawsuit against it, the deal between Apple and\nGoogle could be dissolved. Closing arguments are expected on Thursday and\nFriday, with the judge's ruling set to come later in 2024.\n\nTags: Google, Safari\n\n[ 156 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\ndanakin\n\n15 hours ago at 05:06 pm\n\nBut, privacy....\n\nScore: 18 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nMr. Heckles\n\n15 hours ago at 05:11 pm\n\n> There\u2019s a reason for the saying... \u201cJust Google it\u201d\n>\n> \u201cJust Bing/DuckDuckGo it\u201d...
