What can we do to get the most out of our bonus\nyears?\n\nWilliam J Kole\n\nSun 28 Apr 2024 13.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nLoneliness. Ageism. Physical limitations, cognitive decline and, increasingly,\nelder poverty.\n\nThe downsides of living to 100 and beyond are numerous. But so are the\nupsides. Life at its essence is about time \u2013 time to live, time to laugh, time\nto love \u2013 and many of those who have achieved a triple-digit age are living\ntheir best lives as centenarians.\n\nAs I explore in my new book, The Big 100: The New World of Super-Aging, we\u2019re\nexperiencing what the United Nations calls a \u201clongevity revolution\u201d, and\nthere\u2019s no turning back. By 2050, the number of us reaching 100 is projected\nto increase eightfold to 3.7 million people \u2013 roughly the equivalent of\neveryone living in Connecticut or Los Angeles. And half of all five-year-olds\nalive right now are expected to live to 100.\n\nWhat can we do to get the most out of our bonus years? Here\u2019s some wisdom from\nthose who\u2019ve been there.\n\n## Believe in something bigger than yourself\n\nJuan Vicente Mora was officially recognized by the Guinness Book of World\nRecords as the oldest male in the world, with an age of 112 years and 253\ndays. He was born on 27 May 1909 in El Cobre, Tachira State, Venezuela. Juan\nVicente died in April 2024 just shy of his 115th birthday. Photograph:\nNurPhoto SRL/Alamy\n\nHad you asked the world\u2019s oldest living man why he lived so long, Juan Vicente\nP\u00e9rez Mora, who recently died just a few weeks shy of his 115th birthday, was\nalways quick to answer: \u201cLove God and always carry him in your heart.\u201d A\ndevout Catholic who prayed the rosary twice a day, the Venezuelan said what he\ntreasured most was \u201cthe love of God, the love of family\u201d.\n\nJapan\u2019s Kane Tanaka, who died in 2022 as the world\u2019s then oldest living\nperson, voiced similar sentiments over her 119 years and 107 days. A convert\nto Christianity from Shinto, she frequently attributed her longevity to her\nfaith.\n\nKane Tanaka, recognized as the world\u2019s oldest living person by Guinness World\nRecords, is pictured in Fukuoka, south-western Japan, on 5 January 2020, as a\nnursing home celebrates three days after her 117th birthday. Photograph:\nNewscom/Alamy\n\n\u201cThe secret is the grace of God living in me, and me trying to live the best\nlife that I could,\u201d says 100-year-old Martha Bailey of Fort Washington,\nMaryland.\n\nSpirituality is the tie that binds many centenarians and super-centenarians.\nNational Geographic and the Blue Zones organization interviewed 263 people\naged 100 or older, and all but five belonged to a faith community. Subsequent\nresearch suggests attending religious services four times a month can add at\nleast four years of extra life span.\n\nThat squares with the findings of a much larger longterm study suggesting\nregularly attending religious services can increase life span. A team at the\nHarvard TH Chan School of Public Health examined data collected over a 20-year\nperiod from nearly 75,000 middle-aged female US nurses who were free of\ncardiovascular disease and cancer when the study began. Regardless of race or\nethnicity, those who attended a temple, synagogue, mosque or church at least\nonce a week had a 33% diminished risk of death from all causes \u2013 but\nespecially heart attack, stroke and cancer \u2013 compared with those who never\nwent.\n\n\u201cReligion and spirituality may be an under-appreciated resource that\nphysicians could explore with their patients,\u201d the researchers say. The \u201cwhys\u201d\nremain elusive, though some scientists think abstinence from drugs and alcohol\n\u2013 common to many faiths \u2013 may help explain the benefits, along with the\nstress-relieving power of prayer and meditation. There\u2019s also the sense of\ncommunity and belonging.\n\n## Find your purpose\n\nWesley Brown, a US senior district judge, during his 100th birthday\ncelebration at the US district court on 29 June 2007. Brown, appointed by John\nF Kennedy in 1962 and one of two federal judges to serve until age 104, died\non 23 January 2012. Photograph: Jeff Tuttle/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nIf we\u2019re going to live to 100, we\u2019d better have something to live for. That\nwasn\u2019t a problem for the US district judge Wesley Brown.\n\nHe died at 104 as the oldest sitting federal judge in American history. Sharp\nand competent to the end, with a wicked sense of humor \u2013 Brown used to warn\nlawyers gearing up for lengthy trials in his Kansas courtroom that he might\nnot be alive for their closing arguments \u2013 he credited his very caseload for\nextending his life by keeping his mind and body active and giving him a sense\nof purpose.\n\nWell past his 100th birthday, he was still taking the stairs to his fourth-\nfloor chambers. A year before his death, asked how he intended to leave the\nbench that John F Kennedy appointed him to in 1962, he quipped: \u201cFeet first.\u201d\n\nDr Ephraim Engleman understood. The 104-year-old rheumatologist died as he\nlived: at work, at his desk, in between seeing patients at the Rosalind\nRussell Medical Research Center for Arthritis in San Francisco.\n\nDr Ephraim Engleman at his office in San Francisco, California, on 25 February\n2014. Engleman was honored by the department of medicine by having the center\nnamed after him to The Rosalind Russell-Ephraim P Engleman Medical Research\nCenter for Arthritis.\u2019 Photograph: Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco\nChronicle/Getty Images\n\nEngleman very deliberately never retired, a move he regarded with suspicion as\n\u201cgenerally a great mistake\u201d. One of his top rules for longevity was: \u201cEnjoy\nyour work, whatever it is, or don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n## Laugh\n\nJeanne Calment, France\u2019s oldest living person, drinks champagne during the\ntaping of a television show in Arles in 1991. Born 21 February 1875, Calment\neventually became the greatest attraction in the southern city of Arles since\nVincent Van Gogh, who spent a year there in 1888. She met him there when he\ncame to her uncle\u2019s store to buy paints, and later remembered him as \u2018dirty,\nbadly dressed and disagreeable\u2019. Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest person who ever lived whose age could be authenticated by\nrecords, credited laughter for her longevity and she should know. Jeanne\nCalment of France \u2013 who made it to 122 years and 164 days \u2013 lost her eyesight\nand her hearing but kept her sense of humor to the last.\n\n\u201cI never wear mascara ... too often I laugh until I cry,\u201d said Calment, who\u2019s\nbest known for a wisecrack she made at the age of 121: \u201cI only have one\nwrinkle and I\u2019m sitting on it.\u201d\n\nHerlda Senhouse of Wellesley, Massachusetts, who just celebrated her 113th\nbirthday, didn\u2019t have an easy life as a Black woman in the Jim Crow era. But\nshe giggles through conversations and sees laughter as a perfect way to\ncounter toxic stress, the enemy of longevity.\n\nHerlda Senhouse of Massachusetts, recently celebrated her 113th birthday.\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Heralda Senhouse\n\nSenhouse\u2019s emphasis on positivity and optimism underscores how both of those\nthings not only add years to our lives but life to our years.\n\nMore than mere wishful thinking, positive beliefs around aging have the\npotential to extend our lives by as much as seven and a half years, according\nto research by Becca Levy, an epidemiologist at Yale University\u2019s School of\nPublic Health. The cumulative effects of an optimistic outlook even outweigh\nthe steps we take to exercise, lower our blood pressure and cholesterol, and\nwatch our weight.\n\n## Love\n\nWhat\u2019s love got to do with it? A lot more than you might think.\n\nResearchers say married people tend to live longer than singles \u2013 men by two\nand a half years; women by a little less \u2013 and they also stand a better chance\nof living to 100.\n\nTension and conflict in marriage are stand-up comedy staples, but studies have\nshown that those of us who endure the vicissitudes of life with a partner\nexperience less stress than those who go solo. Couples in happy, nurturing\nrelationships have greater life expectancy free of disability and other health\nchallenges than singles, and they tend to have more financial security.\n\nBob Yaw and Gloria Hansard read poetry together on 2 November 2022.\nPhotograph: Rachel Leathe/Chronicle/Bozeman Daily Chronicle\n\nIt\u2019s not the sex, the tax deductions or even the cohabitation. Deep platonic\nfriendships can have the same effect. At an assisted living facility in\nMontana, two centenarians have found beauty and meaning in a relationship\nthat\u2019s blossomed around their shared love of poetry. When they met, Bob Yaw\nwas 101 and Gloria Hansard was 100. They live down the hall from each other\nbut gather each evening in her apartment to recite verses.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t meet long ago,\u201d Hansard told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. \u201cJust\npoems are all we know of each other.\u201d\n\nTheir friendship isn\u2019t just life-extending. It\u2019s life-giving.\n\n  * Veteran journalist William J Kole, the author of The Big 100: The New World of Super-Aging, was a 2022 fellow in aging journalism at Columbia University in New York and the National Press Foundation in Washington DC He currently works for Axios.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Well actually\n  * Ageing\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
