Photograph: Gareth Iwan\nJones/The Guardian\n\nCovid vaccines, chemtrails, the Great Reset ... Why do people invent false\nconspiracies when there are so many real ones to worry about? There\u2019s only one\nway to find out: ask a believer\n\nby George Monbiot\n\nSat 4 May 2024 11.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nI am a conspiracy theorist. I believe that groups of people conspire secretly\nagainst our interests to line their pockets, cover their backs or achieve\npolitical goals. By this definition I suspect you are, too. We see evidence of\nthese conspiracies every day. We see them in the Horizon scandal, in which the\nPost Office kept prosecuting innocent operators. We see them in the\ngovernment\u2019s use of a \u201cVIP\u201d lane for procuring PPE from friends and donors at\nextortionate prices. We see them in the Windrush scandal, in which people were\ndenied their legal rights and unlawfully deported by the UK government. In the\nCambridge Analytica scandal: a secretive micro-targeting campaign likely to\nhave influenced the Brexit vote. In the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers,\nshowing how the ultra-rich hide their money from taxes and legal scrutiny.\n\nAll these are conspiracies in the true sense: hidden machinations that advance\nparticular interests while causing harm to others. A theory is a rational\nexplanation, subject to disproof. If you accept these scandals are the result\nof hidden machinations, which they evidently are, you are a conspiracy\ntheorist.\n\nAs so often with matters of public importance, the language we use is\ndeficient and misleading. We need better terms, that distinguish wacky and\noften malign fairytales from the very essence of democracy: the reasoned\nsuspicion of those who exercise power over us. I prefer to call the fairytales\n\u201cconspiracy fictions\u201d and those who peddle them \u201cconspiracy fantasists\u201d.\n\nAn extraordinary aspect of this issue is that there\u2019s so little overlap\nbetween conspiracy fantasists and conspiracy theorists. Those who believe\nunevidenced stories about hidden cabals and secret machinations tend to\ndisplay no interest in well-documented stories about hidden cabals and secret\nmachinations.\n\nWhy might this be? Why, when there are so many real conspiracies to worry\nabout, do people feel the need to invent and believe fake ones? These\nquestions become especially pressing in our age of extreme political\ndysfunction. This dysfunction results, I believe, in large part from a kind of\nmeta-deception, called neoliberalism. The spread and development of this\nideology was quietly funded by some of the richest people on Earth. Their\ncampaign of persuasion was so successful that this ideology now dominates\npolitical life. It has delivered the privatisation of public services; the\ndegradation of public health and education; rising inequality; rampant child\npoverty; offshoring and the erosion of the tax base; the 2008 financial crash;\nthe rise of modern-day demagogues; our ecological and environmental\nemergencies.\n\nBut every time we start to grasp what is happening and why, somehow this\nunderstanding is derailed. One of the causes of the derailment is the\ndiversion of public concern and anger towards groundless conspiracy fictions,\ndistracting us and confusing us about the reasons for our dysfunctions. It\u2019s\nintensely frustrating.\n\n> The first things he told me aligned so closely with my own worldview, it was\n> almost like my own voice coming back at me\n\nGeorge Monbiot\n\nThere are plenty of hypotheses about why people believe these stories, but\nonly one good way of answering the question. Talking to them.\n\nI live in the Lentil Belt: close to Totnes in south Devon. While all sorts\nmake their homes here, it has a reputation, not entirely undeserved, for\n\u201cconspirituality\u201d: the convergence of new age culture and conspiracy fictions.\nThe most disturbing episode in the BBC radio series Marianna in Conspiracyland\nfeatured Totnes artist Jason Liosatos. He couldn\u2019t see what was wrong with a\nblatantly antisemitic and eugenicist claim he\u2019d made. When I looked him up, I\nfound an article by the anti-racism campaign Hope Not Hate, detailing his\nantisemitic smears. He had also been banned from YouTube for his falsehoods\nabout the pandemic. He sounded like a monster. But when his name came up among\nfriends, I was told, \u201cThe weird thing is, he\u2019s also a really nice bloke,\nalways helping people and giving his money away, a pillar of the community.\u201d\nThe apparent opposite of the basement-dwelling misanthrope I had pictured.\n\nI was intrigued. How could someone walk both paths? How could they be\nprosocial and kind, yet spread the most antisocial and cruel falsehoods? He\nseemed the obvious person to talk to if I wanted to learn why and how these\nfictions spread.\n\nWhen I stepped into his gallery, Liosatos greeted me warmly (he knew who I\nwas) and mentioned a mutual friend. A tall, fit, handsome man of 62, with a\npowerful frame and thick hair, he seemed remarkably friendly and kind. How\ncould this person hold such terrible views? He agreed to talk to me and we\narranged to meet at Dartington Hall, a medieval building not far from town.\n\nResearching the interview, I found the contradictions astonishing. Like\nRussell Brand, he mixes toxic fables with spiritual exhortations. \u201cCherish the\ngift of another day alive on this planet in this vast universe.\u201d I found all\nthe usual conspiracy fictions: vaccines, nanoparticles, 9/11, \u201cchemtrails\u201d,\n5G, net zero, the Great Reset ... and some of the worst antisemitic slurs I\u2019ve\never seen online.\n\nBorn in Barry, Liosatos has a warm south Wales accent. He left school early\nand suffered drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness. His sense of social\njustice led him into trouble: in South Africa he was shot at while trying to\ndefend Black citizens from police beatings. After a spiritual awakening, he\ngot his life together: he\u2019s a talented and successful artist. Many of his\npaintings have non-political themes: portraits, landscapes, cows, horses,\nabstracts. A few show grim scenes of starvation and exploitation. How could I\nmake sense of this man?\n\nWe sat across a table long enough for Vladimir Putin, in a grand room in the\nold hall. He struck me as almost guileless, without the barriers most people\nerect against the world. His body language was open and relaxed. It was hard\nnot to like him.\n\nBut from the moment we began to talk, I found myself in a place of extreme\ndiscomfort. The first things he told me aligned so closely with my own\nworldview that it was almost as if I were hearing my own voice coming back at\nme. Weirdly, this triggered a strong sense of guilt by association: as if,\nbecause I agree with him in some respects, I am also responsible for the gross\nantisemitism and other fictions he has spread. He spoke fluently about how we\ninternalise the oppressive nature of a system \u201cbased on short-term greed,\nfear, profit, power, debt and slavery\u201d. People, he told me, \u201cpretend they\u2019re\nOK. And that\u2019s part of the problem. There\u2019s an amazing capacity in each person\nto endure suffering, pain, boredom, punishment, work that they don\u2019t want to\ndo.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have put it better myself.\n\n\u2018The weird thing is, friends said of Liosatos, he\u2019s also a really nice bloke.\u2019\nPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian\n\nLike me, he wants to \u201cstart building small templates\u201d of community action. And\nhe acts on this impulse, with remarkable generosity and openness. \u201cPeople come\nin my shop,\u201d he told me, \u201csometimes to ask me for money; sometimes people just\ncome in and burst out crying.\u201d He seems to function as a kind of unofficial\ntherapist for distressed people in the town. He said he explains to them that\nwhat they\u2019re feeling is a natural response to living in a maddening world\nsystem. I strongly agree with that, and I would put a name to it: capitalism,\nwhich, thanks to the penetrating oil of neoliberalism, now finds its way into\nevery crack in our lives.\n\nI soon discovered, again with some discomfort, that there\u2019s another thing we\nhave in common: neither of us are in it for the money. When I asked him about\nhow being banned from YouTube had affected his income, he told me it was a big\nblow, as he had a lot of followers, but added, \u201cI never pushed it as an income\nthing.\u201d He could have made a lot of money, he said, but he wasn\u2019t interested.\nNow, on his own channel, he sells a few nutritional supplements (this seems to\ngo with the territory), but says he makes hardly anything, a claim that,\nlooking at his site, I can easily believe.\n\nThis differentiates him from many other conspiracy fantasists, some of whom\nmake a packet by spreading their false stories. Some, like the army of\nbullshitters sponsored by the oil companies, are paid directly. Sometimes, the\narrangements are more diffuse. The Tea Party movement, for example, which\ngenerated toxic culture wars, political divisions and conspiracy fictions\n(such as the Obama \u201cbirther\u201d myth), was nurtured and promoted by Americans for\nProsperity, a campaign group founded by the ultra-wealthy Koch brothers.\n\nSome make astonishing fortunes by promoting fictions on Substack, Spotify and\nRumble. Certain influencers have made tens of millions this way. Liosatos, by\ncontrast to some of the culture war entrepreneurs, seems to speak from\nconviction. \u201cI\u2019ve just wanted to really talk about a better world for\nhumanity, and a fairer world,\u201d he told me.\n\n> I don\u2019t want to be this person speaking about controversial things. But I\n> feel an obligation to people who haven\u2019t even been born yet\n\nJason Liosatos\n\nWhen I asked him about the impact of the BBC series, he told me that many\npeople in town, including people he loved, \u201csuddenly wouldn\u2019t speak to me\u201d.\nSomeone drew a swastika on the wall of his gallery. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be this\nperson who\u2019s speaking about controversial things, George. Let me tell you, I\u2019d\nrather not do this ... But I\u2019m doing it because I feel an obligation to people\nwho haven\u2019t even been born yet.\u201d\n\nThis is what I kept bumping up against throughout our conversation: the\nrhetoric used by people in the green and left movements \u2013 people like me \u2013 had\nbeen repurposed to justify grotesque libels against Jews and other groups.\nLiosatos uses the language of liberation to rationalise falsehoods that\nreinforce oppression.\n\n\u201cPeople can say what they like about me,\u201d Liosatos said. \u201cBut come and speak\nto me, come and meet me, that\u2019s all I ask people to do. I\u2019m not such a bad\nguy.\u201d\n\nI asked him about a video on his channel, in which Liosatos interviews a\nfellow artist called Harry Vox. Vox, a US citizen, describes himself, as many\nconspiracy fantasists do (causing me yet another ripple of dissonance), as an\n\u201cinvestigative journalist\u201d. In reality, he simply recites discredited claims.\nOn Liosatos\u2019s video, he claimed that \u201call of the thinktanks that have any\nsignificance in Washington are financed with Jewish money\u201d; that \u201cJews control\nthe media\u201d; that for 600 years Jews have made money \u201cas the tollkeepers, as\nthe fee-takers, the rentiers\u201d. They don\u2019t work, \u201cthey just own the real estate\nand rent it out\u201d and so on. In other words, he deployed that ancient transfer\nof guilt, blaming all the ills of capitalism on Jews. Throughout this\ndisgusting diatribe, Liosatos nodded along, sometimes interjecting, \u201cWell\nsaid, Harry.\u201d\n\nAll these stories are longstanding tropes or false generalisations used to\nspread and justify antisemitism. As Hope Not Hate has documented, Liosatos\nhimself has a history of such claims, for example telling people to \u201cread the\nProtocols of the Learned Elders of Zion to know who your masters are\u201d, and\nclaiming that Bill and Hillary Clinton are owned by \u201cZionist Jewish\nBanksters\u201d.\n\nWhen I challenged him about these and other such falsehoods, it soon became\nclear that Liosatos believed the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was a real\nstrategy document written by Jews. How on earth, I wondered, could anyone not\nknow it was a notorious antisemitic forgery? When I tried to persuade him to\nsee that he was channelling outrageous lies, Liosatos started rambling, waving\nhis arms, speaking in broken sentences, suddenly diverting into unrelated\nsubjects.\n\nI began to suspect that he saw himself as a martyr, persecuted for following\nhis beliefs. He claimed that the Guardian was paying me to prove that he was\nantisemitic. \u201cWhat do you want to do, put me in Dartmoor prison? Is that where\nyou think I should be?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t scheming to bring him down. But I felt it was worth interviewing him,\nor someone like him, because conspiracy fictions, even \u2013 perhaps especially \u2013\nwhen promoted by people who claim to want a better world, can have deadly\nconsequences. They inspire terrorism and attacks on Jews, Muslims, immigrants,\nlegislatures and other targets. Anti-vaxx myths help spread infectious\ndisease. Some of the most common falsehoods also target the public sector and\ncivic life, spreading lies about public health, schools, traffic calming,\nurban planning, climate policy, university courses, taxes. They reinforce the\nassaults of neoliberalism. When such falsehoods are spread by powerful\ninterests, you could see them as conspiracies to spread conspiracy fictions.\nThey bamboozle people, disempower them and distract attention from the crimes\nand strategies of states, oligarchs and corporations. People who recite these\nfables might imagine they\u2019re sticking it to The Man. In reality, they\u2019re\nserving him.\n\n\u2018Pity and anger had been joined by another sensation: contamination. I felt I\nneeded a shower.\u2019 Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian\n\nAlmost invariably, this litany of false stories leads people towards the far\nright. Conspiracy fictions are the fuel of far-right politics: it cannot\noperate without them.\n\nI asked Liosatos whether he agreed that, for hundreds of years, including\nduring the Holocaust, Jews have been persecuted and murdered as a result of\nantisemitic slurs. The paranoia I had begun to detect now seemed to burst into\nthe open.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to call me a Holocaust denier now, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your view of the Holocaust?\u201d\n\nHe started speaking very rapidly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure there was a Holocaust, George. Yeah,\nthere was a Holocaust, wasn\u2019t there? ... I know people were ... Were they\ngassed, killed? You know? So many people, Polish people as well, lots of\npeople, right?\u201d\n\nWhile many other people, including 1.8 million non-Jewish Poles, were killed\nin cold blood by the Nazis, the number of Jews they murdered \u2013 six million \u2013\nfar outstrips their assaults on any other group. A common theme in \u201csoft\u201d\nHolocaust denial is to fudge these facts.\n\nBy now Liosatos\u2019s warm expansiveness had vanished. He was stammering and\ntense, arms rigid. I felt at once furious and sad for him. There was something\ntragic about the way he had tried to navigate what he rightly sees as a mad\nworld, and come to all the wrong conclusions.\n\nI raised another interview he had conducted, with a man called Courtenay\nHeading. On Liosatos\u2019s video, Heading claimed that viruses don\u2019t exist and\nCovid is \u201ca fraud\u201d, and called doctors promoting Covid vaccines \u201cMengele\nmedics\u201d. This is a common theme in Liosatos\u2019s work: for example, he has\npromoted the groundless and discredited claim that the blood clots found in\ncorpses by embalmers are caused by Covid vaccines.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Heading was awaiting trial. Liosatos thanked him\nfor everything he\u2019d done, described him as a hero and compared him to Martin\nLuther King and Gandhi for putting himself on the wrong side of the law.\nLiosatos told me that Heading is now in prison. When I asked him why, he said,\n\u201cWell, he was doing a lot \u2013 he was doing a lot of things, doing a lot of\nmarches, he was \u2013 he was \u2013 he was really being ... \u201d\n\n> I\u2019m trying my best, you know? If someone needs help, I\u2019ll try and help them.\n> OK, maybe I\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes ...\n\nJason Liosatos\n\n\u201cWhat was he actually in prison for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that by putting himself on the wrong side of the law he was a hero.\nBut you didn\u2019t know what charge he was facing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember, it was a plethora of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a specific charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, you tell me. Show me that I\u2019m a dummy, George. Go on, take the glory.\u201d He\nseemed both frustrated and resigned, almost as if he knew the jig was up.\n\n\u201cIt was persistently stalking and harassing a woman scientist. Throughout the\ntime she was pregnant. For which he received eight months\u2019 jail.\u201d To Heading,\nthe scientist\u2019s \u201ccrime\u201d was to set up a Covid testing centre.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I didn\u2019t know that ... So you\u2019re now next going to say \u2013 to make me out\nto be even more of an idiot, obviously \u2013 that I should have investigated that\nmore.\u201d\n\nYes, I said, he should have investigated that more. Wasn\u2019t he curious about\nwhy Heading was awaiting trial?\n\n\u201cWell, I knew he\u2019d been \u2013 I heard he\u2019d been harassing someone who was in the\nscience department. And he had plenty of proof that this vaccine is hurting\npeople.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think that justified harassing a scientist?\u201d\n\nA long pause. \u201cWell, I think it does, yeah. Yeah, I do, yeah. And now they\u2019ve\nsaid, \u2018Oh, she was pregnant.\u2019 But, George, listen, I find your questioning\namazing. I think you should have been a lawyer or something, George.\u201d\n\nWhen I told him I was trying to understand him, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been sent\nhere.\u201d It seemed he felt he, too, was the victim of a conspiracy. I moved on\nto the issue that puzzles me most. Why are so many conspiracy fantasists\nuninterested in real conspiracies?\n\n\u2018Could it be he focuses on conspiracy fictions because he can\u2019t face the real\nhorrors we confront? He threw his shoulders back, exasperated.\u2019 Photograph:\nGareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian\n\nIt must take quite an effort to see the false stories but not the true ones.\nFor example, there\u2019s a widespread fiction that \u201cchemtrails\u201d \u2013 the term\nconspiracy fantasists give to aircraft contrails \u2013 are a dastardly scheme to\nspray us with toxic metals (barium and aluminium compounds), to alter our\nminds. There is no evidence for such claims \u2013 but toxic metals in aircraft\nexhausts could indeed be altering our minds. In the UK, the fuel used in\npiston prop aircraft still contains tetraethyl lead. At sufficient doses, lead\nreduces IQ and mental performance, and can cause irrational behaviour,\ndelirium, nightmares and hallucinations. A paper in Public Health Challenges\nestimates that more than 370,000 households (about 900,000 people) living\nclose to aerodromes in the UK are \u201cat risk of being exposed to damaging levels\nof lead\u201d.\n\nIn the EU, tetraethyl lead in aircraft fuel is being phased out. But the UK\ngovernment has insisted, since Brexit, on creating a separate chemicals\nregulation system. One result is that there are no plans to stop the use of\ntetraethyl lead here.\n\nI strongly suspect, but can\u2019t prove, that this is a result of industry\nlobbying. Call it a conspiracy hypothesis. I also suspect this is the kind of\noutcome some big donors to the leave campaign were hoping for: the\nderegulation of dirty and antisocial capital is a central aim of neoliberalism\nand, as we\u2019ve seen in many cases, Brexit has delivered it. Call that a partly\nupheld conspiracy hypothesis. But I\u2019ve yet to find a chemtrail fantasist who\nshows the slightest interest in either tetraethyl lead or the dark money\npoured into Brexit. If a story is either plausible or proved, it seems, they\ndon\u2019t want to know.\n\nSo I asked Liosatos about the scandals I mentioned at the start of this\narticle: Post Office, Windrush, VIP lane, Cambridge Analytica, Panama and\nPandora Papers. In every case, he told me he didn\u2019t know enough about them.\n\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d I told him, \u201cthat you focus on the things that aren\u2019t true,\nand not on the things that are true.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m amazed you\u2019re saying that,\nGeorge, I really am ... Why do you think I haven\u2019t looked into them, George?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what are you insinuating ... ? Say it. Get it off your chest ... It\u2019s\nalmost like ... You\u2019re just sort of trying to sort of pick a fight! It\u2019s\nreally weird, you know?\u201d\n\nThe wind suddenly seemed to go out of him.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough, mate, honest to God. I really have. I\u2019ve had a long\nday ... I\u2019ve been in the hospital with my friend for the last week and a half\n... And to be honest, I love you dearly, I really do, I\u2019m not pulling out\nbecause I feel threatened by you ... I just \u2013 I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nHe seemed so dismayed and outraged that I began to wonder whether I was\npersecuting him. Was I being too harsh towards this confused and flailing man?\nCan you be too harsh towards someone who spreads vicious antisemitic lies and\nseeks to justify stalking? I still felt both pity and anger towards him, but\nby then these sensations had been joined by another: contamination. I felt as\nif I needed a shower.\n\nEscape from the rabbit hole: the conspiracy theorist who abandoned his\ndangerous beliefs\n\nRead more\n\nHe began shifting on his seat, almost standing up to leave. I asked if we\ncould discuss just one more thing. It seemed to me that Liosatos genuinely\nwanted to create a better world. How can the journey to that better world\ninvolve spreading antisemitism and defending stalkers?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying my best, you know? If someone needs help, I\u2019ll try and help them.\nAt the same time, OK, maybe, like you said, I\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes\n... You can write what you want about me, I\u2019m not worried about it. I\u2019m really\nnot. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d\n\nCould it be, I asked, that he focuses on conspiracy fictions because he can\u2019t\nface the real horrors we confront? He threw his shoulders back, exasperated.\n\n\u201cOh God, George, I\u2019m amazed you just said that to me. I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m not\nsaying you\u2019re wrong about everything. It\u2019s complex, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nWhat I do, George, is I look at what everyone says, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t look at what everyone says, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, OK, George. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I stop the recording?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou can say that Jason said to turn it off in the Guardian ... Hey, wait for\nit, hang on: \u2018He became irritated, he kept putting his glasses on. And then he\ncame towards me.\u2019 George, are you going to do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bloody hope not, mate.\u201d\n\nAs we stepped into the mossy courtyard, he seemed deflated. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to do this any more. I\u2019m getting nothing out of it. I\u2019m going to go back\nto the spiritual vision.\u201d I said I thought that was a good idea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a hug,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her excellent book Doppelganger, Naomi Klein explains how today\u2019s\nconspiracy fictions are a distorted response to the impunities of power. We\nknow we\u2019re being lied to, we know justice is not done, we see the\nbeneficiaries flaunting their immense wealth and undemocratic power.\nConspiracy fantasists may get the facts wrong, \u201cbut often get the feelings\nright\u201d.\n\nI would add a couple of thoughts. I see conspiracy fictions as a form of\nreassurance. This might sound odd: they purport to reveal \u201cthe terrifying\ntruth\u201d. But look at what they\u2019re actually saying. Climate breakdown? It\u2019s a\nhoax. Covid? All fake. Power? Just a tiny cabal of Jews. In other words, our\ndeepest fears are unfounded.\n\nThese fictions are highly conservative. Several of Harry Vox\u2019s libels would\nhave been familiar in England 800 years ago. Suspicion of science and\ntechnology, to judge by the widespread association of blacksmithing with dark\narts, goes back to the iron age. Anti-vaxx myths in Europe are as old as\nvaccination. Conspiracy fictions tell us nothing has changed, the same\nbastards are in charge, this is an evil we know. Perhaps this is why some\nfantasists become so attached to their stories: they\u2019re a place of safety.\n\nConspiracy fictions also tell us we don\u2019t have to act. If the problem is a\nremote and highly unlikely Other \u2013 rather than a system in which we\u2019re deeply\nembedded, which demands a democratic campaign of resistance and reconstruction\n\u2013 you can wash your hands of it and get on with your life. They free us from\ncivic responsibility. This may be why those who take an interest in conspiracy\nfictions are so seldom interested in genuine conspiracies.\n\nWhen I got in touch to fact-check with Liosatos after writing a draft of this\narticle, he emailed back to ask for a couple of small deletions about personal\nmatters, which I accepted, but otherwise seemed resigned to it. He told me\nthat while \u201cthis is definitely not a retaliation for your character\nassassination of me\u201d, he wanted me to know that \u201cwhen I was with you I sensed\na deep spiritual emptiness and sadness within you, albeit well covered ... it\ncan be quite sad for me to see and feel people\u2019s pain which they hide so\nwell\u201d. Then, reminding me of his warmth and lack of rancour, and the turmoil\nthis has caused me from the beginning, he wrote, \u201cThank you again for inviting\nme for our meeting, and I wish you all the very best, love, and prosperity.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to assess our own spiritual welfare, but all I can say in response\nis that I\u2019ve been surprised, as I\u2019ve grown older, by a powerful and gathering\nhappiness. I feel strangely reconciled to both life and the end of life, no\nlonger haunted by either the demons of my youth or by the prospect of\ninfirmity and death.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019m deceiving myself. Perhaps we all succumb to fictions of our\nchoosing.\n\nJason Liosatos and I have the same desire for a better world, the same anger\ntowards those who thwart it. What differentiates us, I think, is rigour. I\nthink he is insufficiently rigorous in choosing what to believe. As a result\nof this lack of rigour, his instinct for justice and his potent sense of his\nown persecution have taken him to a very dark place. This has led someone\ntrying to be good to spread great harms. It\u2019s a warning to us all.\n\nThe Invisible Doctrine by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison is published by\nAllen Lane on 16 May at \u00a312.99.
