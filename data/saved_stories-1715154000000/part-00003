Keren is\ntrained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a\ndisease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPart of Home Planet\n\nIn September of 2012, when the internet was still mostly good and housing was\nstill mostly affordable, a social media site served me a notice about\nsomething called \u201cthe Inman Park Squirrel Census Data Presentation and\nSpectacle.\u201d The flyer, in tidy mid-century fonts overlaying a vintage\nillustration of a beaming man carpeted in woodland creatures, announced that\nthe event \u2014 including a contest, a squirrel dance, and squirrel art \u2014 would\ntake place around the corner from the Atlanta apartment I\u2019d recently rented.\n\nMy first thought was: Is this real?\n\nIt was a few months after I\u2019d moved back to town, fresh off a series of\nquestionable professional choices and a few wildly unpleasant years in the\ncompany of Boston\u2019s meanest doctors, hoping to pivot to a (then) less\nunpleasant career in public health.\n\nI was ambivalent about being in Atlanta: I grew up in this city\u2019s pleasant but\nbland suburbs, and as a chubby, ethnic, melancholy teen with no interest in\nyouth soccer or Christian fellowshipping, I couldn\u2019t wait to get out. When I\nescaped in the late 1990s, I swore I\u2019d never come back.\n\nNearly 20 years later, however, the city had changed, and I was strongly\nstarting to suspect I might not hate it. At festivals and parades and\nrestaurants and galleries, the ocean of pale preppies I\u2019d fled had been\nreplaced with kaleidoscopic ambition, people and languages from all over\nsprouting ideas and hustle. A massive pedestrian connector now linked many of\nthe neighborhoods my family\u2019s yellow Chevy Malibu used to speed through on the\nway to the zoo, and they bloomed with improvised stages and open mics and\nmural art.\n\nAtlanta in the early 2010s nourished a brand of quirk I liked; this squirrel-\ncounting thing just meant it was that much closer to my doorstep. Plus, it\npromised to put a little sizzle on an area of epidemiology not all that\ndifferent from mine, if you squinted.\n\nSo I went, alone, to see what story the spectacle would tell. Under strings of\ntwinkling lights in the backyard of what was then an offbeat home decor shop\n(now a Ben and Jerry\u2019s), I watched as a series of earnest nerds presented the\nresults of a project they\u2019d begun a year earlier: A count, a proper\nepidemiological census, of the eastern gray squirrels inhabiting my\nneighborhood.\n\nI sat in the crowd, surrounded by onlookers wide-eyed with a blend of awe and\nbewildered delight, and felt something inside me simultaneously thrill and\ncalm. These people had gathered to celebrate what looked like a community\nscience project, and indeed, plenty of math and methodology flashed before us\nthat night. But there was more to this odd little pageant, something warm and\ngenerous. I wasn\u2019t a part of it, but somehow I felt invited to be.\n\nThese were my kind of weirdos. Maybe I would like it here, after all.\n\n### What questions do you have for our climate team?\n\nLet us know by filling out this form.\n\nThe Squirrel Census changed over the next 10 years: It expanded, went to the\nmoon (or, at least, New York City), and then, abruptly, ended \u2014 sort of. I\nchanged, too. But it left on me the mark of a wild sort of magic, a\npermanently reoriented gaze on the literal nature of imagination and human\nconnection. This is why, for me, its music will never die.\n\n### How the Squirrel Census got its start\n\nThat night in 2012 was my first run-in with Jamie Allen, the project\u2019s earnest\nnerd-in-chief, then a 40-something bespectacled dad with a skater-boy flop of\nbrown hair. Allen worked days as an advertising copywriter and wrote short\nfiction in his free time; it was his dog\u2019s squirrel obsession that had first\nsparked an idea for a story about a squirrel horde attacking a golden\nretriever, which then led him to wonder: How many squirrels were out there,\nanyway?\n\nFor Allen, who got his start making digital news at CNN, satisfying even\naimless curiosity was a vocation. The people answering the phones at the US\nFish and Wildlife Service and the Humane Society thought it was a funny\nquestion; Allen thought it was funny they didn\u2019t know the answer. A week\nlater, over beers on the back deck of his Inman Park rental with his best\nfriend, programmer Stewart Haddock, he brooded over the lack of data to answer\nhis question, and in the way people do when they\u2019re a little loaded, suggested\nthey figure out how to count all the squirrels in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cMaybe you should limit it to Inman Park,\u201d said Haddock, \u201cbecause you live in\nit.\u201d\n\nMost normal people would\u2019ve given up at this point. Allen couldn\u2019t. He talked\nabout squirrels and the putative counting of them to friends and strangers, at\nbars and at convenience stores, and over ping-pong, which he played a lot of,\nalso mostly at bars. And the strange thing was, like the kind of uncannily\nselective magnet that inexorably sucks together the parts of a Voltron or\nassembles Avengers, the idea drew the right people together into what would\neventually, serendipitously become the volunteer Squirrel Census team.\n\nIf the project were a cartoon, its origin story would make an ideal opening-\ncredits montage, with blazing light arcs trailing each member as they\u2019re\nraptured out of their quotidian lives as professional mapmakers, actual\nsquirrel epidemiologists, and Department of the Interior forestry mavens. Each\none is slammed by a gust of wind into a seat at the long pine table at Allen\u2019s\nhouse (code-named Tom Clancy for the twin sets of dark front windows framing\nthe entryway like a pair of aviators), and as kiddie stadium rock plays, they\n\u2014 on three! \u2014 vow to actually do it, to count the squirrels in Allen\u2019s\nneighborhood. And to do it right.\n\n### Is the Squirrel Census science? Yes ... but also, no.\n\nThat might be why the project initially appealed to me: It was the kind of\nscience I\u2019d moved to Atlanta to learn to do, focused not only on understanding\nthe natural world, but on making its invisible mechanics legible to its\ninhabitants.\n\nTo be clear, counting squirrels is a totally legitimate scientific pursuit.\nScientists survey them to stay ahead of threats that invasive species pose to\nshared habitats, and to investigate diseases that spread at the seams where\nhuman and animal life entwine. They also count squirrels to better understand\nthe health of the environment that sustains them; like other wild animals,\nsquirrels function as sentinels of ecological health.\n\nHumans have been tracking squirrel migrations for at least two centuries. The\nmost recent \u2014 the Great Squirrel Migration of 1968, in which swarms of\nstarving eastern gray squirrels crisscrossed the eastern US, probably in\nsearch of food \u2014 was chronicled by the Danish-American wildlife biologist Vagn\nFlyger, who sometimes trapped the animals in his backyard using a combination\nof peanut butter and crushed Valium.\n\nFlyger\u2019s work also forms the basis of the Squirrel Census\u2019s method for\nestimating a squirrel population based on point-in-time counts. In 2012, based\non methods Flyger published in 1959, the team overlaid a map of the Inman Park\nneighborhood with a hectare grid. They assigned each hectare to a few\nvolunteer sighters, many recruited from among family and friends. In April\n2012, they recorded squirrel counts and other activity, twice in each hectare,\nfor 20 minutes at a time. The team later used Flyger\u2019s validated formula \u2014\nwhich includes an adjustable factor to account for trees and other squirrel-\nobscuring miscellany \u2014 to estimate the neighborhood\u2019s overall squirrel\nabundance.\n\nIt would be easy to confuse the Squirrel Census with science. It used\nvalidated, evidence-based, scientific methods for achieving the central goals\nof the project, and presented its findings in the kind of precise visual\nlanguage that communicates close examination of a subject along multiple axes.\nAnd after all, most animal counts are science.\n\nThe difference, which was apparent as soon as Jamie Allen opened his mouth\nthat night in 2012, was that the Squirrel Census\u2019s chief purpose was to\nproduce not science but story.\n\nI hunted down my own copy of a squirrel heat map I\u2019d seen mounted on the wall\nunder the string lights that night in September. Against a spare rendering of\nmy neighborhood\u2019s streets, buildings, and parks in grayscale and mint green,\nits accounted-for squirrels clustered in overlapping bubbles of pale peach; it\nwas the first piece of art I ever got professionally framed.\n\nI hung it in my living room. When I invited people for dinners or parties or\ndrinks on the covered front porch, I\u2019d often find at least one person standing\nin front of the map for many minutes, staring, or looking for their house, or\nsometimes just murmuring, \u201cIs this real?\u201d\n\n### A new mythology of home\n\nAs a kid, I always felt mismatched with Atlanta, like an alien whose spaceship\nhad taken a wrong turn on the way to its real hometown. In short order, the\ncity would transform itself into a Summer Olympics host, then become hip-hop\u2019s\ncenter of gravity, then blossom into something sneeringly but accurately\ncalled Y\u2019allywood \u2014 but back then, it felt to me like a backwater, sleepy and\nstifling under its famous tree canopy.\n\nWhen I came back in 2012, I\u2019d had other options \u2014 which meant that now, I was\nan adult who had chosen to come back to the place where I\u2019d grown up. Atlanta\nhad changed, but the story I told myself about it had not.\n\nAt the exact moment I was looking for a new way to understand my hometown, the\nSquirrel Census was spinning a contemporary mythology set against its\nbackdrop. In this new lore, we, like the ancient Greeks, looked upward to find\nour heroes, outlaws, tricksters, and lovers \u2014 but they were in the treetops,\nnot the heavens, and the new Mount Olympus was just outside my door.\n\nWho were we, the humans, in this story? What was this city I now lived in? I\nwas no longer an awkward, undesirable teen, and Atlanta was no longer a\nbackwater. As the Squirrel Census told it, we were a bunch of sweet, bumbling\ndorks bewitched by our creature kin, who themselves dwelt in a complicated\nworld filled with good and evil, lust and subterfuge, power struggles and\nself-sacrifice. That this tangle of buckled sidewalks and forests and creaky\nold Victorian houses was the setting for their dramas cast magic dust over\nevery branch and leaf.\n\nImagining these creatures\u2019 interiority made us better people, too. Not in the\nsense that it was a badge of hipster honor to have perceived something through\na Wes Andersonian lens, but in the sense that creating stories about these\nanimals bonded us to them. The way Rochester felt like there was a string tied\nunder his left ribs that connected him to Jane Eyre, a thin thread now\nconnected us with these beasties we used to simply ignore.\n\nWhen they foraged, tussled, attacked, or gave chase, it tugged a little at our\nribcages, and those pangs made us \u2014 made me \u2014 care more about the place where\nthey lived. It led me to see my neighborhood through the eyes of a squirrel,\nas a haven rich with resources and hiding places \u2014 and myself as a steward of\ntheir home, accountable for keeping it safe, quiet, and green. Sharing a\ncorner of the forest with our mythical versions of these beings expanded our\nhearts, and we were better for it.\n\n### In which I count squirrels\n\nSix years after I first heard about the Squirrel Census, I finally got to be\npart of it.\n\nBy late 2018, when the team counted the squirrels in New York City\u2019s Central\nPark, I\u2019d backed even further away from medicine and was barreling headfirst\ninto a journalism career \u2014 which, refreshingly, felt like a good fit. I\u2019d\nplanned a visit to New York that happened to coincide with the count, and\nsigned up to spend a perfect, sunny Saturday afternoon listening for chitters\nand watching for flashes of cinnamon fur in a section of the park across from\nthe American Museum of Natural History. The experience was analog by design,\nwith pencils and printed packets of thick paper for all our navigation and\nrecord-keeping.\n\nFor a decade, I had been spoiled by the blue dot on my phone\u2019s map that always\ntold me where I was relative to my surroundings, and I\u2019d forgotten the squirt\nof dopamine that accompanies matching an actual statue or bridge or shrubbery\nwith landmarks on a map. I lurked near a newlywed couple in the Shakespeare\nGarden, watching not them but a twitch of chestnut fluff foraging near a\ncluster of shrubs. As joggers and cyclists whizzed by, I trained my eyes\nupward, looking for bushy telltales in the massive American elms bordering\nCentral Park West. New York has historically had a fraught relationship with\nsquirrels, alternately hunting them into vanishing rarity and coddling them as\npets; now, they\u2019re everywhere.\n\nMy packet had spaces for me to note not only squirrel number, size, color,\nactivity, and location but also the abundance of human and other-animal drama\nplaying out around me and my own reactions to the theatrics. I\u2019d also been\ninstructed to listen for squirrel vocalizations, including kuks, quaas, and\nvarious moans. I strained my ears to disentangle critter-kibitzing from the\nusual park cacophony. I felt sneaky, special, a little feral.\n\nThat night, amid the tusked and taxidermied furnishings of the Explorer\u2019s Club\n\u2014 the project\u2019s New York City headquarters for the duration of the Central\nPark count\u2019s planning, execution, and reveal \u2014 I schmoozed with fellow\nsquirrel sighters. I marveled with them at how much bigger and brighter the\nworld seemed when we saw it through a woodland animal\u2019s eyes. We basked in our\nwidened gaze on the world: We were a whole new kind of alive, suddenly aware\nof the sheer mass of life in our surroundings and overwhelmed by the sanctity\nof existence, of having the privilege to care about any of it. An older\nvolunteer, one of 10 awarded an \u201calpha-alpha sighter\u201d designation for\nextraordinary commitment to the cause, delivered an a cappella rendition of\n\u201cCount Your Blessings,\u201d only instead of \u201cblessings,\u201d he sang \u2014 what else? \u2014\n\u201csquirrels.\u201d\n\n### The end (for now)\n\nIn March 2021, a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, I got a very long email\nannouncing that at least for the moment, the Squirrel Census was\ndisassembling, sort of. I was in Florida, watching my partner\u2019s mother die in\nhospice, and was weirdly shattered by the news. At a time when it felt like\nall the goodness had been drained out of the earth, when we most needed ways\nto connect with each other and to be reminded what it was we shared, the\nSquirrel Census seemed like just one more casualty of the new world\u2019s\nunbreathable air.\n\nAnother realization came into relief as the news sank in, related to the very\nspecific way the pandemic kept us from museums, concerts, and parties: There\u2019s\na difference between experiencing joy and awe alone and experiencing it with\nothers.\n\nThe Squirrel Census had knotted a thread that tethered me not only to the\nfast-beating hearts of the wildlife in my backyard, but to the people who\u2019d\nstood beside me as we squinted into the trees, or at a poster, or just at the\nthought of such an absurd thing as a census of squirrels. Our politics, and\nthen the pandemic, made those moments scarce and precious; I wasn\u2019t yet sure\nif and when we would reclaim them.\n\nStill, I understood: The Squirrel Census team was tired. Maybe they were also\nbroke. Clearly, they needed a change. Jamie Allen liked to say people either\ngot the Squirrel Census or they didn\u2019t, and the people who did were special \u2014\n\u201cLife Poets,\u201d according to that farewell note. If we were lucky, life would go\non. But we would need to find its poetry somewhere else.\n\nEventually, the pandemic\u2019s urgency diminished. Various team members had long\nsince moved away to live out other dreams when Jamie, his kids now out of the\nhouse, moved to Los Angeles in 2023. After all, he said in a way that kind of\nbroke my heart, he\u2019d never planned to spend the rest of his life in Atlanta.\nOver the holidays, a Squirrel Census email turned up in my inbox with links to\ntwo peculiar, perfect little songs. In February, Allen told me the project is\nstill on an extended hiatus. \u201cWe\u2019re a band that\u2019s in between albums, and we\u2019re\nnot really writing a current album,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we do, we\u2019ll get the\nband back together.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense, I think. It does feel like, all this time, I\u2019ve been\nfollowing a pied piper of sorts, if not a band. His tune did convince me there\nwas something out there that was worth following, and following it made me\nbetter, and maybe a little weirder.\n\nIt was real.\n\n### You've read 1 article in the last 30 days.\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
