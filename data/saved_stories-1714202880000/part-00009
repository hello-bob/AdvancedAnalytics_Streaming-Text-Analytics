A spokesperson declined to say how many samples were tested.\n\nAs of Thursday, bird flu had been detected in 33 herds in eight states: Idaho,\nKansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas.\n\nRichard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research\nHospital, said the number of positive samples is consistent with numbers he's\nreviewed from smaller sample sets.\n\n\"But the number does seem high if the number of infected farms is indeed only\n30-odd,\u201d Webby wrote in an email. \"Clearly there are more infected animals out\nthere than being reported.\"\n\nThe FDA first said Tuesday that it had found viral fragments in commercially\nsold milk, triggering the Agriculture Department to issue a federal order\nmandating that all dairy cows be tested for bird flu before they are\ntransported between states.\n\nHealth officials maintain \u2014 and experts agree \u2014 that pasteurized milk is safe\nto drink. The FDA detected small pieces of the virus in milk, not live,\ninfectious virus.\n\n\u201cRight now, all indication is that pasteurization is effective,\u201d said Dr.\nAndrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University.\n\n### Recommended\n\nU.S. news\n\n### U.S. newsBiden administration delays plans to ban menthol cigarettes\n\nU.K. Royals\n\n### U.K. RoyalsKing Charles to resume public duties after 'progress' in cancer\ntreatment\n\nThe FDA said Tuesday, \u201cTo date, we have seen nothing that would change our\nassessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\u201d It is conducting studies\non the effects of pasteurization on the bird flu virus in milk and expects to\nrelease results in the coming days.\n\nThe virus, a strain of bird flu called H5N1, is concerning to public health\nofficials because of its high fatality rate: More than half of the people who\nhave contracted the illness have died, according to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n\nHowever, the virus does not spread easily between people, and while it can\ncause severe illness, the only two cases reported in the U.S. \u2014 one in the\ncurrent outbreak and one in 2022 \u2014 have been mild.\n\nThe concern is that it could one day mutate in a way that makes it spread\nbetween people more easily.\n\nBerkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\nBerkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.
