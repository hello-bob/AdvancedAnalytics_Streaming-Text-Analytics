It\nplans to follow that with an even bigger facility in California.\n\nCourtesy of Hydrostor/Inside Climate News\n\nThis story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the\nClimate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe need for long-duration energy storage, which helps to fill the longest\ngaps when wind and solar are not producing enough electricity to meet demand,\nis as clear as ever. Several technologies could help to meet this need.\n\nBut which approaches could be viable on a commercial scale?\n\nToronto-based Hydrostor is one of the businesses developing long-duration\nenergy storage that has moved beyond lab scale and is now focusing on building\nbig things. The company makes systems that store energy underground in the\nform of compressed air, which can be released to produce electricity for eight\nhours or longer.\n\nI spoke with Curtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor\u2019s CEO and cofounder, to get an\nupdate on how close he is to breaking ground on large plants in Australia and\nCalifornia and to learn how he makes the case for his company.\n\nHe emphasizes the simplicity of his product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple system that just uses a hole in rock [plus] air and\nwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the equipment is all from the oil and gas industry,\nso you don\u2019t need new manufacturing or anything.\u201d\n\nSome background on why long-duration storage matters: The grid of the near\nfuture will require a mix of energy storage resources to fill gaps when there\nare lulls in generation from wind and solar. Most lithium-ion battery systems\nrun for a maximum of four hours. Energy system planners have said the grid\nwill also need storage options that can run six, eight, and 12 hours, and some\nthat last as long as a day or more.\n\nCourtesy of Paul Horn/Inside Climate News\n\nThe Department of Energy has identified the need for long-duration storage as\nan essential part of fully decarbonizing the electricity system, and in 2021\nset a goal that research, development, and investment would help to reduce the\ncosts of the technologies by 90 percent in a decade.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

This includes several types of long-duration batteries, and some\nresources that have been around for a while, such as pumped hydro storage at\nhydroelectric dams.\n\nHydrostor\u2019s first large project to go online is likely going to be Silver City\nEnergy Storage Centre in Australia, which will have the ability to discharge\nat 200 megawatts for up to eight hours. Construction should begin around the\nend of 2024 and the plant should be running by mid-2027, VanWalleghem said.\n\nThe next project would be Willow Rock Energy Storage Center, located near\nRosamond in Kern County, California, with a capacity of 500 megawatts and the\nability to run at that level for eight hours. Hydrostor is aiming to begin\nconstruction by late next year and have it running before 2030. But before\nthat, the company needs to get a permit from the California Energy Commission,\na process that has restarted after a brief pause.\n\nUnlike some other long-duration storage companies, Hydrostor has proven its\ntechnology. The company has operated a small, 1.75-megawatt plant in Goderich,\nOntario, since 2019, which can run for about six hours at a time. Compressed-\nair storage existed before Hydrostor\u2014plants in Germany and Alabama have been\naround for decades and use variations on this approach.\n\nHydrostor\u2019s system uses a supersize air compressor that ideally would run on\nrenewable electricity. The system draws air from the environment, compressing\nit and moving it through a pipe into a cavern more than 1,000 feet\nunderground. The process of compressing the air produces heat, and the system\nextracts heat from the air and stores it above ground for reuse. As the air\ngoes underground, it displaces water from the cavern up a shaft into a\nreservoir.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to discharge energy, the system releases water into the cavern,\nforcing the air to the surface. The air then mixes with heat that the plant\nstored when the air was compressing, and this hot, dense air passes through a\nturbine to make electricity.\n\nThe long-term viability of the technology will be closely tied to how its cost\ncompares to other types of long-duration storage. The California plant has a\nprojected cost of about $1.5 billion, which would make it competitive with\npumped hydro and other available options. The users of the plant\u2019s services\nwould include Central Coast Community Energy, a nonprofit power provider based\nin Monterey.\n\nCourtesy of Paul Horn/Inside Climate News\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

The storage systems have a projected\nlifespan of about 50 years, which is an important data point when comparing it\nto battery systems, which have much shorter lives, he said.\n\nYiyi Zhou, an analyst for BloombergNEF, said Hydrostor is one of about 100\ncompanies that focus, at least in part, on developing long-duration energy\nstorage.\n\nHydrostor stands out, she said, because its technology is \u201crelatively mature\u201d\nand the company has also been one of the most successful in the space at\nraising money from investors.\n\nBloombergNEF reported a global total of 1.4 gigawatts and 8.2 gigawatt-hours\nof long-duration energy storage as of last September, excluding pumped hydro.\nThe average duration, which you can calculate by dividing gigawatt-hours by\ngigawatts, was 5.9 hours.\n\nFor perspective, the two Hydrostor projects being developed have a combined\ncapacity of 0.9 gigawatts, more than half of the global total now online.\n\nFor this year and next, the long-duration storage technologies likely to see\nthe fastest adoption are compressed-air storage and flow batteries, according\nto BloombergNEF. (I wrote an explainer on flow batteries in 2022.)\n\nI find it challenging to get my arms around this part of the clean energy\neconomy because of the large gap between what\u2019s been developed and what\u2019s in\nsome stage of planning. There are many opportunities for projects to sputter\nand die along the way.\n\nWith this in mind, I\u2019ll be watching to see whether Hydrostor is able to begin\nconstruction on schedule in Australia and whether it can navigate the\nregulatory approval process for the plant in California.\n\nThe California project has gone through some big changes. At one point,\nHydrostor had two proposals in the state, but dropped one because of\nchallenges in the permitting process, including some issues with building in a\nlocation overseen by the California Coastal Commission. The remaining project,\nWillow Rock, has also gone through changes to the design and the location in\nresponse to feedback from the local community and from regulators.\n\nThe California Energy Commission paused its review of Willow Rock last fall to\ngive Hydrostor time to provide details on its updated plan. The review process\nbegan again in March and could be complete as soon as this time next year.\n\nOne of the factors to keep in mind is that California\u2019s state government and\nthe California Energy Commission have made clear that they want to build long-\nduration energy storage. The state has estimated that it will need 4 gigawatts\nof long-term energy storage capacity to be able to meet the goal of 100\npercent clean electricity by 2045.\n\nHydrostor and state officials want to see this project get up and running. If\nthat happens, it could provide a showpiece to make the case for building many\nothers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to the growth, just getting these projects\nconstructed and then start doing more, five, 10 projects at a time,\u201d\nVanWalleghem said.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * He emptied a crypto exchange onto a thumb drive\u2014then disappeared\n\n  * The real-time deepfake romance scams have arrived\n\n  * Boomergasms are booming\n\n  * Heading outdoors?
