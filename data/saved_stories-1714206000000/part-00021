Deposit Photos\n\nSHARE\n\nEnergizer has designed a new lithium coin battery that releases a blue dye\nimmediately upon interacting with moisture such as saliva. The marker offers\nparents a visible way to determine if their children accidentally swallowed\none of these toxic products.\n\nAfter two decades of steady integration into everything from key fobs and\nremote controls to cooking thermometers and smart watches, lithium button\nbatteries are now extremely commonplace household items. Unfortunately, their\nubiquity coincides with a major, ongoing spike in the number of children\ningesting the small batteries. Over 70,300 emergency doctor visits were\nreported for children\u2019s battery-related issues between 2010 and 2019. Of\nthose, nearly 85 percent involved button batteries.\n\nApart from the choking hazard, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission warns\na battery\u2019s chemicals can cause severe bodily injury, and even death, within a\nmatter of hours if ingested. Additionally, the electric current generated by\nsaliva\u2019s interactions with a battery can simultaneously burn through body\ntissue, leading to even more potentially lethal complications. Every year,\nthousands of emergency hospital visits occur because of ingesting batteries.\n\n[Related: What to expect if your child swallows a button battery.]\n\nTo help address the continuing public health concern, Energizer recently\npartnered with the children\u2019s safety nonprofit Reese\u2019s Purpose to design a\nsafer button battery, as well as even stronger childproof packaging.\n\nApart from a bitter-tasting, nontoxic coating increasingly found on similar\nproducts, the company\u2019s newest coin-shaped batteries are also wrapped in a\ncontainer that requires scissors to open. But even if a child does get their\nhands on one, parents and caretakers will almost instantly be able to see if\nthey need to contact emergency medical services.\n\nDescribed as a \u201ccolor alert technology,\u201d the battery\u2019s dotted, negative\nunderside releases a nontoxic, food grade blue dye when mixed with moisture,\nsuch as spit. According to Energizer\u2019s website, the batteries contain about as\nmuch dye as an ounce of a flavored sports drink, and will disappear after a\nfew water rinses or teeth brushing.\n\nHamsmith started the nonprofit advocacy group in honor of her 18-month-old\ndaughter who died in 2020 after swallowing a remote control\u2019s coin battery.\n\nRegardless of childproofing innovations, however, caretakers should\nimmediately take a child to medical professionals if they suspect battery\ningestion. The National Capital Poison Center warns against inducing vomiting\nand instead suggests having any child over 12 months old to swallow honey.\nDoing so can coat the ingested battery, and thus help delay some chemical\nburning of internal tissue while en route to receiving medical attention. That\nsaid, children younger than 1-year-old shouldn\u2019t eat honey, so rushing them\nimmediately to the emergency room for an X-ray is the best approach.\n\nIn the event of suspected emergencies, parents are encouraged to call the\nNational Battery Ingestion Hotline (800-498-8666) or Poison Control Center\n(800-222-1222).\n\nAndrew Paul\n\nAndrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.
