Commodore UK itself would last until August 30th, 1995, before\ngoing under.\n\n> #OnThisDay 1994 : 30 years ago today, Commodore declared bankruptcy marking\n> an end of an era for the company that brought us the Commodore 64 and the\n> Commodore Amiga 500 among other machines. #90s #retrogaming\n> pic.twitter.com/9fQobBBAjB\u2014 Russty_Russ #Retro (@russty_russ) April 29, 2024\n\nThe company was founded in 1976 by Jack Tramiel and Irving Gould. Its C64\npersonal computer was a massive success, enabling the firm to post sales of\n$49 million by the close of 1983.\n\nSince 1994, the Commodore brand name has changed hands more than once, and\nAmigaOS is still in active development. We've also seen mini-consoles based on\nCommodore's products, including the A500 Mini and C64 Mini \u2013 and another\nAmiga-based system is coming this year.\n\nBlaze has also released three C64 collections for its Evercade line of\nsystems.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### News Kickstart, The World's Biggest Amiga Show, Is Back This Year\n\nDavid Wise, Stoo Cambridge and Tony Warriner all confirmed\n\n### Guide Best Amiga Games Of All Time\n\nThe finest games on Commodore's beloved 16-bit system\n\n### Review THEC64 Collection 3 (Evercade) - A Third Helping Of Commodore\nClassics\n\nThird time's a charm?\n\n[source twitter.com]\n\n  * Share:\n  * 142\n\n  * 3\n  * 4\n\nAbout Damien McFerran\n\nDamien has been writing professionally about tech and video games since 2007\nand oversees all of Hookshot Media's sites from an editorial perspective.

It meant a long, drawn out\nbuyout that I feverously (then tediously read) over about a year in Amiga\nFormat.\n\nGateway 2000 did nothing when they bought it and Escom at least tried, but\nagain, nothing sizeable to even attempt to compete with the contemporary PC,\nthat it had already lost ground to. And by that point, the market had shifted\nto the total exclusion of Amiga as a commercial gaming entity.\n\nI am looking forward to the Amiga Maxi, or whatever the next retro machine is\ncalled, and I have some great memories and fondness of my Amiga days.\n\n  * 5\n  * Reply\n\n  * 2\n  * Daggot\n  * Mon, 6pm\n\nI was a sad time indeed. I had a friend that bought the CD32 just after it\nlaunched. He had some interesting ideas on how to use the tech for non-gaming\nuses (this was 90s mind you). Just sad to have seen it go back then.\n\nBut, looking back now, I do wonder if they really could have competed in the\nend against the standardization of the PC platform. The only context we have\nis the Mac, and even it went through an era of mirroring the PC platform. So,\nextrapolate the Amiga, and it would have had to follow a similar path like\nMac. General off the shelf cpu, with dedicated chips (?) except with an actual\nfocus on gaming. Ya, that's an interesting though experiment. Would the Amiga\nbasically have been the Mac, where it supported creative development, except\nit actually supported gaming? Hmm. What would that have done to PC Master Race\nas the Amiga would have had an established audience that the PC would take a\ndecade to build. Something to noodle over.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 3\n  * Ristar24\n  * Mon, 8:24pm\n\nSad times... I miss Zzap! 64. I never owned an Amiga (too expensive), but the\nC64 is probably my favourite ever home mirco, I still enjoy Platoon, Last\nNinja, Batman the Movie, Stunt Car Racer, Bubble Bobble, International Karate,\nDizzy... even the Ocean Loader is forever in my memory.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 4\n  * Darknyht\n  * Mon, 8:49pm\n\nI grew up in a house that eventually had an original C-64, two C-64C's and a\nC-128. I used the C-128 until the mid-90's when I inherited an old 8088 that\nwas replaced. Q-Link and GEOS contributed to many book reports and I probably\nspent way too much time on there gaming and creating text adventures in BASIC.\n\nMy dad's GILM Football is still out there on the net that he wrote for a\nfriend and it somehow survived all these years. He also ran a basic BBS on the\nC-128 for a few years using a speedy commodore branded modem.\n\nI still am amazed at all the things programmers did back then with such\nlimited resources. I cannot help but feel that most software these days are\njust bloated.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\nTap here to load 4 comments\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Grand Theft Auto III Likely Wouldn't Exist Without The Sega Dreamcast\n\nHere's how Sega's console helped Rockstar find its groove\n\n  * This Company Makes 35-Year-Old Game Boys Look Like New\n\n35 years young\n\n  * PS1 Exclusive Crash Bandicoot Gets Ported To Sega Saturn\n\n\"Bringing Crash Bandicoot to Sega's 32-bit console is quite a challenge\"\n\n  * Someone Has Finally \"Fixed\" The Mega Drive's Audio Shortcomings\n\nSay hello to MegaMP3\n\n  * Here's Some Footage Of A Young Matt Berry Exploring CeX's Legendary Retro Shop\n\nBack when the idea of retro was still pretty new...\n\nPopular Right Now\n\n  * Evercade EXP-R And Evercade VS-R Consoles Launch With Tomb Raider This July\n\nYesterday, 9:45am\n\n  * All Analogue Pocket OpenFPGA Cores And Where To Download Them\n\nThu, 11:25am\n\n  * Someone Has Finally \"Fixed\" The Mega Drive's Audio Shortcomings\n\nMon, 4pm\n\n  * PS1 Exclusive Crash Bandicoot Gets Ported To Sega Saturn\n\nMon, 8:30am\n\n  * The Inside Story Of Rare's Wrestlerage, The Lost SNES WWF Game That Evolved Into Killer Instinct\n\nMon, 1:05pm\n\n  * Grand Theft Auto III Likely Wouldn't Exist Without The Sega Dreamcast\n\nFri, 12:05pm\n\n  * Flashback: How The Kindness Of Sega Saved Nvidia From Going Under\n\nYesterday, 3pm\n\n  * The Cost Of Owning A MiSTer FPGA Is About To Come Down Dramatically\n\nYesterday, 8am\n\n  * You Can Now Unbrick Any Sony PSP\n\nThu 18th Apr 2024\n\n  * Review: AYANEO Flip DS - A Great (But Costly) Way To Play 3DS And Wii U In 2024\n\nThu 18th Apr 2024\n\n  * Anniversary: 30 Years Ago Today, Commodore Died\n\nMon, 1:30pm\n\n  * Retro Gaming Takes Over The BBC's Breakfast Show\n\nYesterday, 2:45pm\n\nShow More\n\n\u00a9 2024 Hookshot Media, partner of Gamer Network.
