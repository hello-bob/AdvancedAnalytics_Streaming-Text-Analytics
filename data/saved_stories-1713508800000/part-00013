(Image credit:\n@oscar_barea on Twitter)\n\nSince October of 2022, user @oscar_barea on Twitter has been posting his\nongoing progress on a customized vintage 3dfx Voodoo card. His custom\n\"VoodooX\" is based on the 3dfx VSA-100 GPU, which was used in a variety of\n3dfx cards, including the 3dfx Voodoo4 4500 and Voodoo5 5500. This will not be\none of the best graphics cards, not unless you want to roll back the clock to\nthe late 90s, but it's a fun project regardless.\n\nA vintage 3dfx Voodoo5 GPU was auctioned off for $15,000 early last year. Any\nprototypes of 3dfx hardware represent a piece of timeless computing history at\nthis point, as the company and assets were sold to Nvidia after it went\nbankrupt in 2000. Prior to that ignominious end, however, 3dfx was one of the\nfirst and greatest names in consumer-accessible 3D acceleration.\n\nAccording to @AshEvans81, who is also participating in the project, the card\nis using auctioned-off \"new\" VSA100 chips popularized by the Voodoo4 GPUs.\nThis means that the modifications to get VoodooX running with 32MB RAM are\nstill ultimately within the spec of VSA100 (the Voodoo4 4800 AGP boasted\n64MB), though the original thread will show this still took a lot of effort to\nget working.\n\n> VoodooX 3Dfx project - I assembled the card and target is check how works\n> DVI & HDMI output.

Not many people care to revive archaic GPUs\nfrom before the turn of the millennium, not to mention ordering boards to\nattempt to create a functional graphics cards with new capabilities.\n\nThe work here is truly impressive, in particular the new support for DVI video\noutput. Anyone who's had to deal with analog VGA video knows that video\nquality is much lower than with the now mostly abandoned DVI interface, which\nwas a precursor of sorts to the modern HDMI standard. The immediate visual\nimprovement offered by DVI, even on this old hardware, looks quite nice.\n\nThe in-progress project is still limited to 32MB of RAM, but the hope is to\nhave a switch that toggles between 32MB of RAM and 64MB of RAM. Once that\nhurdle is cleared, VoodooX could be the best Voodoo graphics card ever made.\nJust don't mind the 24-year gap, as these things... they take time.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

But saying\n\"between\" does muddy the waters somewhat. :)\n\nBut yes, the 4000, 4800, 5000, and 6000 never were released to retail.\n\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/3dfx-vsa-100.g946\n\nReply\n\n  * Beerfloat\n\nThis is cool but it might be good to mention that there is at least one maker\nof 3dfx re-issues out there already; Anthony AKA zxc64 has a bunch of\ninteresting cards available for ordering, including Voodoo 4 4500 and 5 5500\nequivalent cards that feature both VGA and HDMI outputs, some Voodoo 5 6000\nalikes, and also some pretty cool other stuff like Rendition Verite, PowerVR\nand Savage cards.\n\nNot associated with the guy, other than having bought one of his Voodoo 5\n5500s. He\u2019s in Russia and the site isn\u2019t very quick. But the product is legit.\n\nhttps://www.zxc64.com/\n\nReply\n\n  * dtemple\n\nThese are neat projects, but I wish somebody would sort out the stability with\nthe DDR memory controller that was intended for use in the V4 4800. Anything\nless than that, I'd prefer just using a wrapper honestly.\n\nReply\n\n  * LabRat 891\n\nIsn't the lithography process used in those VSA-100s pretty ancient? Any\nsmaller-fabs that'd be willing to re-produce the chip? (Or, yet another 'hang\nup' from nVidia buying 3DFX?)\n\nRegardless, I'd be willing to shell out ~$100 for a PCI66 'new' Voodoo, and\nwell over $100 for a PCIe slotable version w/ tunable PCI bridge clocks*.\n\n*I've seen/read that VSA-100 can operate up into IBM's 133Mhz PCI clockrange (or higher), with performance increases every step of the way.\n\nReply\n\n  * sitehostplus\n\nOk, and when do Nvidia's lawyers get involved and shut this down?\n\nI'm thinking this probably violates a boatload of patents they hold.\n\nReply\n\n  * LabRat 891\n\n> sitehostplus said:\n>\n> Ok, and when do Nvidia's lawyers get involved and shut this down?\n>\n> I'm thinking this probably violates a boatload of patents they hold.\n\nIt's using already-manufactured(by 3DFX) GPU chips. There's no more issue here\nthan folks throwing RV and Muscle Car V8s in Tube Steel DIY Chassis.\n\nNo one is building the IP-protected part(s), they're just\nkitbashing/salvaging+re-using.\n\nThe 'rub' would (potentially) come up if a fab/company wanted new silicon made\n(using 3DFX/nVidia IPs).\n\nEven then, it might need to be settled in court. I'm not sure if 3DFX's IP's\n(that nVidia inherited in the buyout) have technically expired. It's been\ndecades since the buyout, and it may be difficult for nV to claim those IPs\nare still 'in use'.\n\n'Dunno. But, this project (and ZXC64's) aren't doing anything 'risky' in that\nregard.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nDetermined modder gets 'Halo 2' running at 720p on the original Xbox \u2014 after\ntweaks to the console hardware, kernel, and game\n\nChinese researchers use low-cost Nvidia chip for hypersonic weapon\n\u2014unrestricted Nvidia Jetson TX2i powers guidance system\n\nChatGPT can craft attacks based on chip vulnerabilities \u2014 GPT-4 model tested\nby UIUC computer scientists\n\nASRock reveals two new 27-inch 1440p IPS monitors, one with an integrated Wi-\nFi antenna in the stand\n\nPlayStation overlay is coming to PC alongside 'Ghost of Tsushima' port\n\nSamsung unveils 10.7Gbps LPDDR5X mobile memory optimized for AI applications\n\nASML sets density record with latest chipmaking tools \u2014 High-NA EUV equipment\nprints first patterns\n\nHigh-end AMD RDNA 2 supply is dwindling \u2014 RX 6950 XT, RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT\nvirtually out of stock\n\nTSMC powers parts of Taipei with backup generators \u2014 Taiwan requests help as\nblackouts begin\n\nRaspberry Pi FPV monitor shares drone flights in real time\n\nDetermined enthusiasts are building a custom 3dfx graphics card \u2014 VoodooX has\n32MB RAM and DVI output\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
