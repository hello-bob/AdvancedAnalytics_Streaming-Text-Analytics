Yes, all the info is already public in\na way \u2013 Discord is kinda like IRC on steroids \u2013 and it's a reminder that it's\nnot impossible to gather up all this chatter using bots for various purposes\n(if not surveillance then training AI models.)\n\nThe website presents the data it's collected in several ways. Each known user\nhas a profile, which contains all known aliases, pronouns, connected accounts\nto other platforms such as Steam and GitHub, Discord servers joined, and\npublic messages. If you wanted to quite literally spy on a Discord user or\nusers, Spy.pet lets you do that, for a fee.\n\nIndeed perusing the privacy-smashing website isn't free. Users have to buy\ncredits to look up profiles, access archives of conversations, and search for\nservers without having to sit through a cool-down time. Each credit costs one\ncent, and as a user profile costs ten credits to access (seven for cached\nprofiles), it costs just a tenth of a dollar to look someone up. Of course,\nSpy.pet only takes cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nThere is also a special \"enterprise\" option that requires contact with the\nsite owner. \"Interested in training an AI model with Discord messages? Are you\na group of federal agents looking for a new source of intel? Or maybe\nsomething else? We've got you covered,\" is how Spy.pet bills its top-tier\nprogram.\n\nIt seems Spy.pet used to take donations via a Coinbase link, but this no\nlonger works. This is apparently because Coinbase banned Spy.pet from\noperating on its platform, according to Spy.pet's lone blog post.\n\n  * Discord.io pulls the cord after crooks steal 760K users' info\n  * Discord in the ranks: Lone Airman behind top-secret info leak on chat platform\n  * X hiring 100 content cops in bid to tame Wild West of online safety\n  * Chinese spies blamed for data-harvesting raids on Barracuda email gateways\n\nThe same post also says the website was DDoS'ed throughout February, though\nthe owner apparently shrugged it off. \"All of these attacks caused minimal\ndamage to myself personally or the website in general,\" the operator said.\n\"All of this effort caused only 50 minutes of downtime. That's it.\"\n\nAs a side note, the footer of Spy.pet has some interesting content, such as a\nlink to a video of TempleOS developer Terry Davis dancing, a \"Transparency\"\npage that just says the word \"transparency,\" and a link to the \"Request\nRemoval\" page that actually just plays the meme clip of newspaper editor J.\nJonah Jameson laughing at Peter Parker in the 2004 movie Spider-Man 2.\n\nSpeaking of which, Spy.pet has a potentially interesting interpretation of the\nEuropean Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as pointed out by\nthe Stack Diary blog this week. Spy.pet may want to review at least three\naspects of GDPR: Articles 6, 8, and 17, which are the rules on consensual data\ntracking, parental consent for data tracking of minors, and the \"right to be\nforgotten,\" or being able to ask for personal data to be deleted.\n\nThe US FTC also doesn't take the harvesting and selling of children's data\nlightly, as it just opened a lawsuit against Meta in November on this topic.\n\nWe've reached out to Discord and Spy.pet and we'll update you if we get a\nstatement from either or both. \u00ae\n\n### Updated to add at 2330 UTC\n\nDiscord has told us it is probing Spy.pet to see if any action needs to be\ntaken against the chat-harvesting service.\n\n\"Discord is committed to protecting the privacy and data of our users. We are\ncurrently investigating this matter,\" a spokesperson for the app maker told\nThe Register.\n\n\"If we determine that violations of our Terms of Service and Community\nGuidelines have occurred, we will take appropriate steps to enforce our\npolicies. We cannot provide further comments as this is an ongoing\ninvestigation.\"\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Data\n  * Discord\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Data\n  * Discord\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Messaging\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Data\n  * Discord\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Data\n  * Discord\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Messaging\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### US legislators propose American Privacy Rights Act - and it looks quite\ngood\n\nAfter two decades of calls for national protections, something may actually\nhappen\n\nPublic Sector8 days | 39\n\n#### Academics probe Apple's privacy settings and get lost and confused\n\nJust disabling Siri requires visits to five submenus\n\nSecurity12 days | 30\n\n#### 96% of US hospital websites share visitor info with Meta, Google, data\nbrokers\n\nCould have been worse \u2013 last time researchers checked it was 98.6%\n\nResearch5 days | 13\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Reform of USA's Section 702 spying rule may make it to a vote this week\n\nTool that lets spooks observe Americans appears to have been renewed for\nanother year\n\nPublic Sector8 days | 12\n\n#### Head of Israeli cyber spy unit exposed ... by his own privacy mistake\n\nInfosec in brief Plus: Another local government hobbled by ransomware; Huge\nrise in infostealing malware; and critical vulns\n\nSecurity9 days | 19\n\n#### Grafana Labs updates observability line-up with query-less visualization\n\nCTO Tom Wilkie gives an optimistic take on AI without climbing on the\nbandwagon\n\nApplications8 days |\n\n#### US House approves FISA renewal \u2013 warrantless surveillance and all\n\nInfosec in brief PLUS: Chinese chipmaker Nexperia attacked; A Microsoft-signed\nbackdoor; CISA starts scanning your malware; and more\n\nSecurity2 days | 10\n\n#### Google will delete data collected from 'private' browsing\n\nDeclares victory in settlement of class action lawsuit, but individual claims\nremain possible\n\nPersonal Tech15 days | 30\n\n#### AT&T admits massive 70M+ mid-March customer data dump is real though old\n\nStill claims the personal info wasn't stolen from its systems\n\nSecurity16 days | 11\n\n#### Lawsuit claims Meta hobbled Facebook Watch to help Netflix\n\nAdvertiser antitrust lawsuit says claimed deal with Netflix is anticompetitive\n\nPersonal Tech14 days | 2\n\n#### Ex-White House CIO tells The Reg: TikTok ban may be diplomatic disaster\n\nInterview Theresa Payton on why US needs a national privacy law\n\nPublic Sector16 days | 63\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
