It\u2019s fast and scales from one\nserver to thousands. Great for ad-hoc command execution, service deployment,\nconfiguration management and more. Here's why you should try pyinfra:\n\n  * \ud83d\ude80 Super fast execution over thousands of targets with predictable performance.\n  * \ud83d\udea8 Instant debugging with realtime stdin/stdout/stderr output (-vvv).\n  * \ud83d\udd04 Idempotent operations that enable diffs and dry runs before making changes.\n  * \ud83d\udce6 Extendable with the entire Python package ecosystem.\n  * \ud83d\udcbb Agentless execution against anything with shell access.\n  * \ud83d\udd0c Integrated with connectors for Docker, Terraform, Vagrant and more.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall pyinfra with pip:\n\n    \n    \n    pip install pyinfra\n\nNow you can execute commands over SSH:\n\n    \n    \n    pyinfra my-server.net exec -- echo \"hello world\"\n\nOr target Docker, the local machine, and other connectors:\n\n    \n    \n    pyinfra @docker/ubuntu exec -- echo \"Hello world\" pyinfra @local exec -- echo \"Hello world\"\n\nAs well as executing commands you can define state using operations:\n\n    \n    \n    pyinfra @docker/ubuntu apt.packages iftop update=true _sudo=true\n\nWhich can then be saved as a Python file like deploy.py:\n\n    \n    \n    from pyinfra.operations import apt apt.packages( name=\"Ensure iftop is installed\", packages=[\"iftop\"], update=True, _sudo=True, )\n\nAnd executed:\n\n    \n    \n    pyinfra @docker/ubuntu deploy.py\n\nNow you know the building blocks of pyinfra! By combining inventory,\noperations and Python code you can deploy anything.\n\nSee the more detailed getting started or using operations guides.
