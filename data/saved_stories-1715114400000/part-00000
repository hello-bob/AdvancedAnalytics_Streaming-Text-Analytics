Arinkin, D. Beraldo, J. Campbell, L.\nChen, D. Gaitsgory, J. Faergeman, K. Lin, S. Raskin and N. Rozenblyum.\n\nThe papers will be posted in the order in which they are being produced.\n\n#### Papers:\n\n  * GLC I: Construction of the functor\n  * GLC II: Kac-Moody localization and the FLE\n  * The geometric Langlands functor II: equivalence on the Eisenstein part (this paper is in the process of being split into two: GLC-II and GLC-III)\n  * GLC IV: Ambidexterity\n  * GLC V: The multiplicity one theorem\n\n", "frontpage": false}
