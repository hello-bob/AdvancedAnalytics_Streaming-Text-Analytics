While MLPs have fixed activation functions\n> on nodes (\"neurons\"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges\n> (\"weights\"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is\n> replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that\n> this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy\n> and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable\n> or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving.\n> Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than\n> MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can\n> easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and\n> physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists\n> (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising\n> alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's\n> deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.\n\nComments:| 48 pages, 20 figures.
