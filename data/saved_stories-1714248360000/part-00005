These\ninclude incompatibility with key software, particularly that for music and\naudio, or Sonoma may not be supported on your Mac. At the same time, you want\nyour Mac to be as secure as possible. This article tackles a question that I\u2019m\noften asked: how can I safely run an older version of macOS on my Mac? My\nanswer comes in two parts: how to give macOS as good protection as possible in\na process of Sonomatisation, and how to minimise the risks you take.\n\n#### What does Sonoma bring?\n\nDifferences in security protection depend on which version of macOS your Mac\nis running. Mojave and earlier have a completely different architecture that\nexposes the system in a single, common startup volume. That improved\nconsiderably in Catalina, and further in Big Sur. Since then, the System\nvolume has been a read-only snapshot with a tree of hashes to check its\nintegrity. Provided that your Mac is running Big Sur or later, it gets the\nbenefits of that new architecture, and there\u2019s nothing to be done with earlier\nmacOS than can compensate for it.\n\nChecking executable code before it\u2019s run is another feature that has undergone\ngreat change over the last few years. Provided it doesn\u2019t have a quarantine\nflag set, Mojave performs only limited checks, and will happily run almost all\ncompletely unsigned code, and apps whose signatures have become broken because\ntheir contents have been altered.\n\nCode that does have a quarantine flag is better scrutinised, though. All\nversions of macOS since about Yosemite (10.10) have used malware recognition\nsignatures in XProtect, and those are still updated across all those versions.\nThat merits careful checking, as some older versions of macOS have sometimes\nstopped receiving those updates.\n\nXProtect checks made when macOS is about to run executable code are \u2018Classic\u2019\nXProtect, and part of the Gatekeeper protection system. In Sonoma this is much\nmore aggressive, checks all code regardless of its quarantine status, and is\nfar stricter when it comes to code signatures and changes made internally to\napps. There\u2019s no way you can change older macOS to the standards imposed by\nSonoma, unfortunately.\n\nmacOS Catalina and later also have a new type of XProtect, its Remediator, a\nset of scanning modules that look for signs of malicious software known to\nApple. Those scans aren\u2019t normally run on demand, and their results aren\u2019t\nshown in the GUI either. However, from Catalina onwards XProtect Remediator\nshould scan your Mac for malware every 24 hours or so. As with XProtect,\nensure that your Mac is kept up to date with its current version.\n\nThis assumes that your Mac runs macOS as intended by Apple, and you don\u2019t\ndisable any of its security mechanisms, such as System Integrity Protection\n(SIP). The effects of doing so are far wider than just stopping certain files\nfrom being modified, and can disable much of Gatekeeper\u2019s defences. This\nbecomes more complicated with OCLP, which allows your Mac to run a more\nresilient version of macOS, but may require that some of its security features\nare disabled. Striking the right balance here is technical, and isn\u2019t easy.\n\n#### macOS vulnerabilities\n\nBoth Apple and third-party security researchers devote a lot of effort to\nchecking macOS for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the malicious.\nAlthough most of those discovered aren\u2019t known to be exploited, it can only be\na matter of time before some are. Apple therefore releases security updates to\naddress known vulnerabilities, but only for the current and last two previous\nmajor versions of macOS, at present that means Sonoma, Ventura and Monterey.\n\nIf you have to run an older version of macOS, you\u2019re thus best off running a\nversion for which Apple still issues security updates, and the more recent,\nthe more likely Apple will fix its most important vulnerabilities. This\ncurrently runs as:\n\n  * macOS 14 Sonoma gets full security patches,\n  * macOS 13 Ventura gets less than Sonoma, but more than\n  * macOS 12 Monterey, but at least that does get some patches, while\n  * macOS 11 Big Sur and earlier get none at all.\n\nThis assumes that you ensure macOS is kept up to date with its latest security\nupdates. If you don\u2019t, then some of its vulnerabilities may already be\nexploited in malicious software. These security updates aren\u2019t a bonus, but an\nessential, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to compensate for their absence.\n\n#### Safari updates\n\nAccompanying these security and other macOS updates are updates to Safari.\nBecause your browser is often the front line between your Mac and malicious\nsoftware, ensuring Safari is kept up to date is every bit as essential as\ngeneral security updates. These are bundled in the current version of macOS,\nbut for the previous two versions are normally released separately alongside\nits macOS security update.\n\nUnfortunately, that means that Macs running Big Sur haven\u2019t had a Safari\nupdate for a long time, and the version they\u2019re running is highly likely to\nhave some serious vulnerabilities. Rather than using an old version of Safari,\nyou may then be better off using the current version of a third-party browser,\nsuch as Firefox. That\u2019s not an easy decision to make, but ensuring robust\nbrowser security is of great importance.\n\n#### Malware protection\n\nOne of the most common questions I\u2019m asked is whether the protection provided\nby macOS is sufficient, or third-party security software is required. At\npresent, if you\u2019re able to run the current release of Sonoma, keep it up to\ndate, and only engage in low-risk activities, I consider that third-party\nsecurity software is not required by the cautious user. That\u2019s only my\npersonal opinion, though, and I appreciate that others have different\nopinions.\n\nHowever, with older versions of macOS or higher risks, you should consider\nwhether your Mac wouldn\u2019t benefit from additional protection. Provided that\nit\u2019s developed by engineers who understand the Mac and work with rather than\nagainst macOS, it may well be a help. But it can never be a substitute for\nyour careful behaviour: if you do choose to run a security product, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you can click on any dodgy link, or drop your guard. Security\nsoftware is an enhancement, not a substitute, for good security practices.\n\nSoftware firewalls such as Little Snitch and LuLu can be effective in your\ndefences, but also require your attention to ensure that they operate\noptimally, allowing necessary traffic to pass, and only blocking the\nmalicious. In the wrong hands, they can cause all sorts of problems.\nObjective-See offers several other excellent products that can significantly\nreduce your Mac\u2019s risks, and are worth assessing carefully.\n\n#### Risk taking\n\nIf you\u2019re going to run an older version of macOS on your Mac, you must be\nfully aware of all risks that you take. After all, it\u2019s the human that is\nalmost invariably the weakest part of any Mac\u2019s security. Risk is determined\nby the threat landscape, and what you do with your Mac.\n\nAt the moment, you\u2019re most likely to come into contact with malicious software\nand other threats if you engage in any of the following:\n\n  * downloading \u2018warez\u2019 and commercial software with licensing restrictions removed, typically in torrents,\n  * trading in cryptocurrency,\n  * visiting dubious sites associated with certain countries,\n  * engaging in any form of illegal or marginal trading or activity,\n  * journalism, research, criticism, or political activity involving certain governments.\n\nThe last of those exposes you to the risk of being targeted by what Apple\nterms \u201cmercenary spyware\u201d produced by well-funded groups like NSO, who produce\nsome of the most deeply invasive attacks. The others are all well-known\nvectors for more regular malicious software. Defending against those requires\nthe full resources of the latest version of Sonoma, if you really have to\nengage in that activity, and requires specialist advice and security\nenhancements.\n\nFor the great majority of us who don\u2019t take those risks, the most real threats\nare phishing attacks and similar scams via email or messaging services\nincluding Messages, and the occasional unintended visit to an unexpected\nwebsite. If you\u2019re going to survive those, then your personal defences are\nmost important, and must be maintained.\n\nWith care and thought, running an older version of macOS need not put you at\nsignificantly greater risk. As the old adage goes: be good, and if you can\u2019t\nbe good all the time, at least be very careful.\n\n#### Summary\n\n  * Big Sur and later have a more resilient system architecture.\n  * Keep XProtect up to date.\n  * If possible, run Catalina or later to benefit from XProtect Remediator, and ensure it\u2019s kept up to date.\n  * Don\u2019t disable any of the security protection in macOS. If you\u2019re using OCLP, striking the right balance is complicated.\n  * Prefer the most recent version of macOS your Mac can run, and ensure it\u2019s kept up to date with security updates.\n  * Ensure Safari is also kept up to date; if your Mac can\u2019t run a current version, consider using a different browser that can be kept updated.\n  * Consider third-party security products as an enhancement, not a substitute for good security practices.\n  * Don\u2019t run the risk of downloading \u2018warez\u2019, trading in crypto, visiting dubious sites, engaging in illegal activities, or becoming a target for mercenary spyware.\n  * Never drop your guard.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nWhat security updates does my macOS get?October 20, 2023In \"Macs\"\n\nWhat is changing in Mac firmware?December 18, 2023In \"Macs\"\n\nFirmware updates and futuresJuly 26, 2023In \"Macs\"\n\nPosted in Macs, Technology and tagged Gatekeeper, macOS, malware, OCLP,\nRemediator, risk, Safari, security, update, XProtect.
