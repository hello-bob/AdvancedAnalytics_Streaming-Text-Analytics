Laughably so. Twenty years ago, Bill Gates promised to rid\nthe world of spam by 2006. How's that worked out for you?\n\nGates' failure is hanging particularly heavily on Google right now. It's not\nso much the email version; Gmail's Report As Spam option works well, as empty\nclickbait content clogging up its search system. That's been with us forever:\nthe difference now is that AI spam is proliferating out of control. Content\nspam was two percent of search hits before ChatGPT: it's ten percent now;\nGoogle is manually delisting sites like never before.\n\nIt takes a lot for Google to remove sites from its search results. That means\nlosing ad revenue - the main reason spam sites exist - and revenue is the\ncrack cocaine of publicly traded tech companies. See Microsoft's continued\nattempts to monetize the Windows desktop. Or Meta's alleged use of harmfully\naddictive algorithms.\n\nYou know this already, you use big tech services and you know the difference\nbetween what the companies say in public and what they actually deliver. You\ndon't matter, the revenue you represent does.\n\n## We'll kill spam in two years \u2013 Gates\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES\n\nThe primary reason Google is spending its own money to reduce its revenue is\nthat AI spam content is so cheap and easy to produce that it has a much better\nchance of overwhelming everything else. It is so toxic, moreover, that it\nrisks driving mass migration of users away from Google, people already fed up\nwith sponsor-heavy search results heavily spiced with pre-AI clickbait\ngarbage. This is certainly an exponential threat to Google, and potentially to\nall other on-ramps to web content. Which is to say, the web as we know it as a\nplace to create and discover outside big known brands.\n\nStopping this is hard. One answer is to out-AI the AI spammers, automating the\nbusiness of finding and isolating the cheats. Two problems: AI is very\nresource-intensive and this risks joining cybercurrency in the business of\nboiling the oceans in an exponential megawatt orgy. The other is that there is\nno way to win, as AI spam develops the equivalent of antibiotic immunity.\n\nEven before either happens, the situation is dangerous for Google and other\nsearch engines looking to make AI the preferred front-end to the search\nexperience. That AI will have to train on an increasingly contaminated data\nset of web content, and even if it works, giving a succinct report of the\nsearched info instead of a list of links, it's not clear where what this means\nfor ad revenue. Google earns when you click links, not when you read Google.\nMove the adverts to the AI report? That removes all of the revenue from ad-\nsupported sites, good and bad, something that will actively kill off good\ncontent at the same time that the regulators of the world let loose a cry to\nshatter the heavens.\n\nNone of these scenarios looks good. Most look apocalyptic. Yet some of the\nbasic assumptions are wrong. Change the context, and different outcomes\nappear, outcomes that are far from disastrous. Quite the opposite.\n\nGoogle has made its uncountable billions by divorcing ad revenue from content\nproviders. Before Google, ad revenue models depended on what people choose to\nconsume. Now, that's algorithmic. The Google algorithm started off well with a\ngood model of what good content looked like in terms of structure, links, and\nother factors. The better quality a site, the more traffic and the more\nrevenue for them and Google? As if. It's always cheaper to game the algorithm\nthan to play fair, so the cash goes to the gamers \u2013 and Google.\n\nThis has been very unhealthy in so many ways, giving Google and its peers the\nreach and resources to game the system for themselves. The algorithms are\nwreathed in darkness, ostensibly to prevent third parties gaming them but\nconveniently providing a corporate shield for shenanigans. We have a worse web\nfor work and play as a result, to say nothing of the social impact of\nalgorithm-derived poison that amplifies fear, anger and divisiveness. Bringing\nthe apocalypse to all this would be no disaster at all. At least to humans.\n\nIf AI kills the algorithm, what happens next? Imagine sites had the option to\npublish a quality statement online, much as they must have a privacy statement\nnow. Machine parsable, they'd give search and suggestion algorithms a way to\nhonor the intent of the user. Rules like \"no unflagged AI content,\"\n\"transparent ownership,\" \"Marketing,\" and \"Lizard People HQ\" or whatever. Set\nyour preferences, and get that content prioritized. Find a site you consider\nnot sticking to its rules, and tell the system not to show it again. And,\nwhile it's at it, any site that links to it.\n\n  * Open source versus Microsoft: The new rebellion begins\n  * Cloud vendor lock-in is shocking, but there's a get out of jail card\n  * Apple's GoFetch silicon security fail was down to an obsession with speed\n  * Time to examine the anatomy of the British Library ransomware nightmare\n\nThe effect would be to wrest control of the algorithm from its creators and\nwhere they put their tumbles on the balance of what you want and what they'll\ngive you. The stats \u2013 anonymized, opt-in \u2013 of what the graph of who chose what\nwould be fascinating, not to say a rich source of signals for identifying\ncheaters. Everything's gameable, but you can give good behavior a commercially\nsignificant chance.\n\nIt may seem to encourage joining bubbles, but also a way to burst out of them.\nSites that keep their word will get more revenue and will in time form chains\nof trust; sites that reject the whole idea will be free to audiences that\nagree with them: it's misrepresentation that will become harder.\n\nGmail's Report As Spam button is an implicit admission that algorithms alone\ncan't keep us safe. If AI clickbait means the same applies to our web of\ndeceit, we may yet be thankful it happened. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Spamming\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Spamming\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n17 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Spamming\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Spamming\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Microsoft to tackle spam by restricting Exchange Online bulk email\n\nNeed to send to more than 2,000 external recipients in 24 hours?
