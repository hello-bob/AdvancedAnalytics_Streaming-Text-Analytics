that they one day will be able to afford a home, fell to a record low 13.4%, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday.\n  * There\u2019s not a lot of good news on the renting front, either. Respondents expect rental costs to increase by 9.7% over the next year.\n\nA sign advertising a home for sale is displayed outside of a Manhattan\nbuilding on April 11, 2024 in New York City.\n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\n\nThe dream of home ownership has gotten even further away for renters, with\nhigher housing costs and elevated interest rates standing in the way of the\nAmerican housing dream, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey\nreleased Monday.\n\nThe share of renters as of February who possess hopes of \u201cresidential\nmobility,\u201d or the belief from renters that they one day will be able to afford\na home, fell to a record low 13.4% in the central bank\u2019s annual housing survey\nfor 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s down from 15% in 2023 and well off the 20.8% series high back in 2014.\n\nPessimism about future prospects comes amid a confluence of factors conspiring\nagainst the likelihood of renters being able to transition to home ownership.\n\nFor one, some 74.2% of renters viewed obtaining a mortgage as somewhat or very\ndifficult, which the New York Fed said has \u201cdeteriorated substantially\u201d from\nthe 66.5% level in 2023 and 63.1% in 2022.\n\nMoreover, mortgage rates have remained high by historical standards. A 30-year\nfixed-rate mortgage now carries an average 7.22% borrowing rate, the highest\nsince late November 2023, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nHousing affordability has improved little, with the median price in February\nat $388,700, the highest since November, according to the National Association\nof Realtors. The NAR\u2019s housing affordability index was at 103 in February,\ndown slightly from January but still at elevated levels with average monthly\nhousing payments at $2,040.\n\nSurvey respondents expect housing prices to increase 5.1% over the next year,\nnearly double the 2.6% expected rate in February 2023 and above the pre-\npandemic mean of 4.2%.\n\nDespite prospects for the Fed to cut interest rates before the end of 2024,\nrespondents think mortgage rates are only going to go higher. The outlook for\na year from now is that borrowing costs will be 8.7%, and 9.7% in three years,\nboth survey records.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of good news on the renting front, either. Respondents\nexpect rental costs to increase by 9.7% over the next year, up 1.5 percentage\npoints from last year\u2019s survey and the second highest in series history.\n\nThe results come a week after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold\nbenchmark interest rates steady while indicating that there has been \u201ca lack\nof further progress\u201d in its efforts to bring the annual inflation rate back\ndown to 2%.\n\nFutures market pricing is indicating that the Fed will begin lowering rates in\nSeptember, with a another cut likely to come in December.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Most of Warren Buffett\u2019s stock portfolio is tied up in just 5 stocks.
