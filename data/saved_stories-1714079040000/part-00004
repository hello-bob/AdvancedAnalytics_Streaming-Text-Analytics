This new tool helps you figure out which\nones to trust.\n\nIn many high-stakes situations, large language models are not worth the risk.\nKnowing which outputs to throw out might fix that.\n\nBy\n\n  * Will Douglas Heavenarchive page\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nStephanie Arnett/MITTR | iStock, Envato\n\nLarge language models are famous for their ability to make things up\u2014in fact,\nit\u2019s what they\u2019re best at. But their inability to tell fact from fiction has\nleft many businesses wondering if using them is worth the risk.\n\nA new tool created by Cleanlab, an AI startup spun out of a quantum computing\nlab at MIT, is designed to give high-stakes users a clearer sense of how\ntrustworthy these models really are. Called the Trustworthy Language Model, it\ngives any output generated by a large language model a score between 0 and 1,\naccording to its reliability. This lets people choose which responses to trust\nand which to throw out. In other words: a BS-o-meter for chatbots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related Story\n\nAI hype is built on high test scores. Those tests are flawed.\n\nWith hopes and fears about the technology running wild, it's time to agree on\nwhat it can and can't do.\n\nCleanlab hopes that its tool will make large language models more attractive\nto businesses worried about how much stuff they invent. \u201cI think people know\nLLMs will change the world, but they\u2019ve just got hung up on the damn\nhallucinations,\u201d says Cleanlab CEO Curtis Northcutt.\n\nChatbots are quickly becoming the dominant way people look up information on a\ncomputer. Search engines are being redesigned around the technology. Office\nsoftware used by billions of people every day to create everything from school\nassignments to marketing copy to financial reports now comes with chatbots\nbuilt in. And yet a study put out in November by Vectara, a startup founded by\nformer Google employees, found that chatbots invent information at least 3% of\nthe time. It might not sound like much, but it\u2019s a potential for error most\nbusinesses won\u2019t stomach.\n\nCleanlab\u2019s tool is already being used by a handful of companies, including\nBerkeley Research Group, a UK-based consultancy specializing in corporate\ndisputes and investigations. Steven Gawthorpe, associate director at Berkeley\nResearch Group, says the Trustworthy Language Model is the first viable\nsolution to the hallucination problem that he has seen: \u201cCleanlab\u2019s TLM gives\nus the power of thousands of data scientists.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Cleanlab developed technology that discovered errors in 34 popular\ndata sets used to train machine-learning algorithms; it works by by measuring\nthe differences in output across a range of models trained on that data. That\ntech is now used by several large companies, including Google, Tesla, and the\nbanking giant Chase. The Trustworthy Language Model takes the same basic\nidea\u2014that disagreements between models can be used to measure the\ntrustworthiness of the overall system\u2014and applies it to chatbots.\n\nIn a demo Cleanlab gave to MIT Technology Review last week, Northcutt typed a\nsimple question into ChatGPT: \u201cHow many times does the letter \u2018n\u2019 appear in\n\u2018enter\u2019?\u201d ChatGPT answered: \u201cThe letter \u2018n\u2019 appears once in the word \u2018enter.\u2019\u201d\nThat correct answer promotes trust. But ask the question a few more times and\nChatGPT answers: \u201cThe letter \u2018n\u2019 appears twice in the word \u2018enter.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only does it often get it wrong, but it\u2019s also random, you never know\nwhat it\u2019s going to output,\u201d says Northcutt. \u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t it just tell\nyou that it outputs different answers all the time?\u201d\n\nCleanlab\u2019s aim is to make that randomness more explicit. Northcutt asks the\nTrustworthy Language Model the same question. \u201cThe letter \u2018n\u2019 appears once in\nthe word \u2018enter,\u2019\u201d it says\u2014and scores its answer 0.63. Six out of 10 is not a\ngreat score, suggesting that the chatbot\u2019s answer to this question should not\nbe trusted.\n\nIt\u2019s a basic example, but it makes the point. Without the score, you might\nthink the chatbot knew what it was talking about, says Northcutt. The problem\nis that data scientists testing large language models in high-risk situations\ncould be misled by a few correct answers and assume that future answers will\nbe correct too: \u201cThey try things out, they try a few examples, and they think\nthis works. And then they do things that result in really bad business\ndecisions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trustworthy Language Model draws on multiple techniques to calculate its\nscores. First, each query submitted to the tool is sent to several different\nlarge language models. Cleanlab is using five versions of DBRX, an open-source\nmodel developed by Databricks, an AI firm based in San Francisco. (But the\ntech will work with any model, says Northcutt, including Meta\u2019s Llama models\nor OpenAI\u2019s GPT series, the models behind ChatpGPT.) If the responses from\neach of these models are the same or similar, it will contribute to a higher\nscore.\n\nAt the same time, the Trustworthy Language Model also sends variations of the\noriginal query to each of the DBRX models, swapping in words that have the\nsame meaning. Again, if the responses to synonymous queries are similar, it\nwill contribute to a higher score. \u201cWe mess with them in different ways to get\ndifferent outputs and see if they agree,\u201d says Northcutt.\n\nThe tool can also get multiple models to bounce responses off one another:\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Here\u2019s my answer\u2014what do you think?\u2019 \u2018Well, here\u2019s mine\u2014what do\nyou think?\u2019 And you let them talk.\u201d These interactions are monitored and\nmeasured and fed into the score as well.\n\nNick McKenna, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, who\nworks on large language models for code generation, is optimistic that the\napproach could be useful. But he doubts it will be perfect. \u201cOne of the\npitfalls we see in model hallucinations is that they can creep in very\nsubtly,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a range of tests across different large language models, Cleanlab shows\nthat its trustworthiness scores correlate well with the accuracy of those\nmodels\u2019 responses. In other words, scores close to 1 line up with correct\nresponses, and scores close to 0 line up with incorrect ones. In another test,\nthey also found that using the Trustworthy Language Model with GPT-4 produced\nmore reliable responses than using GPT-4 by itself.\n\nLarge language models generate text by predicting the most likely next word in\na sequence. In future versions of its tool, Cleanlab plans to make its scores\neven more accurate by drawing on the probabilities that a model used to make\nthose predictions. It also wants to access the numerical values that models\nassign to each word in their vocabulary, which they use to calculate those\nprobabilities. This level of detail is provided by certain platforms, such as\nAmazon\u2019s Bedrock, that businesses can use to run large language models.\n\nCleanlab has tested its approach on data provided by Berkeley Research Group.\nThe firm needed to search for references to health-care compliance problems in\ntens of thousands of corporate documents. Doing this by hand can take skilled\nstaff weeks. By checking the documents using the Trustworthy Language Model,\nBerkeley Research Group was able to see which documents the chatbot was least\nconfident about and check only those. It reduced the workload by around 80%,\nsays Northcutt.\n\nIn another test, Cleanlab worked with a large bank (Northcutt would not name\nit but says it is a competitor to Goldman Sachs). Similar to Berkeley Research\nGroup, the bank needed to search for references to insurance claims in around\n100,000 documents. Again, the Trustworthy Language Model reduced the number of\ndocuments that needed to be hand-checked by more than half.\n\nRunning each query multiple times through multiple models takes longer and\ncosts a lot more than the typical back-and-forth with a single chatbot. But\nCleanlab is pitching the Trustworthy Language Model as a premium service to\nautomate high-stakes tasks that would have been off limits to large language\nmodels in the past. The idea is not for it to replace existing chatbots but to\ndo the work of human experts. If the tool can slash the amount of time that\nyou need to employ skilled economists or lawyers at $2,000 an hour, the costs\nwill be worth it, says Northcutt.\n\nIn the long run, Northcutt hopes that by reducing the uncertainty around\nchatbots\u2019 responses, his tech will unlock the promise of large language models\nto a wider range of users. \u201cThe hallucination thing is not a large-language-\nmodel problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncertainty problem.\u201d\n\n### by Will Douglas Heaven\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
