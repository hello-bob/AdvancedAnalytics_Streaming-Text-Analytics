The attacker can take full control of the compromised system,\npotentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise,\nand even total system takeover.\n\nThe Protect AI\u2019s sobering statistics underscore the accelerating scale and\nvelocity of the AI/ML Zero Day problem, and they suggest a growing need for\nenhanced security measures in AI development environments.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\n### Old Vulnerabilities, New Practices\n\nFrom the perspective of Marcello Salvati, a senior threat researcher at\nProtect AI, there were several interesting vulnerabilities related to AI/ML\ntooling in the report.\n\n\u201cIf I had to give a couple that stand out, it would probably be the PyTorch\nServe RCE and the BentoML RCE,\u201d Salvati said. Both allow attackers to gain RCE\non the server running these popular projects.\n\nPyTorch and BentoML are also both inference servers, which means they\u2019re\ndesigned to be exposed to users for them to use AI/ML models. \u201cThis factor\nmakes these vulnerabilities extremely easy and valuable for an attacker to\nexploit,\u201d Salvati explained.\n\nThe quantity of basic web application vulnerabilities discovered in these\nAI/ML projects is the report\u2019s biggest surprise. \u201cThese types of\nvulnerabilities are rarely seen in the majority of web applications these days\nbecause of the prevalence of secure coding practices and web frameworks with\n\u2018built-in\u2019 security guardrails,\u201d Salvati said.\n\nThe resurgence of these types of vulnerabilities indicates that security is an\nafterthought in AI/ML-related tooling, Salvati said. That goes against all the\nlessons that have been learned over the past decade or so.\n\n### LLM Tooling a Security Weakness\n\nFrom Protect AI\u2019s perspective, with LLM tooling becoming more popular,\nsecurity-immature projects are being deployed at a high pace. Organizations\nmay feel compelled to adopt LLM-based security projects due to competitive\npressures or the desire to stay ahead in the ever-evolving threat landscape.\n\nHowever, the rapid adoption of these projects raises concerns about security\nmaturity. In their haste to deploy LLM tools, organizations may overlook\ncrucial aspects of security, such as comprehensive risk assessments, robust\ntesting protocols, and adherence to industry best practices.\n\nAs a result, there is a risk of deploying solutions that are not adequately\nfortified against emerging threats or lack the safeguards to protect sensitive\ndata and assets. Organizations must prioritize security maturity alongside\ninnovation.\n\n### Adopting Least Privilege, Zero Trust\n\nAI adoption is proceeding at a breakneck (some would argue, reckless) speed.\nFor organizations and security teams to protect themselves against a rapidly\nexpanding and maturing threat, Salvati said adopting standard web application\nsecurity is table stakes.\n\n\u201cThe concept of least privilege applies here, as does adoption of security\nmodels including Zero Trust,\u201d Salvati explained. \u201cMost importantly, train your\ndevelopers and AI engineers in secure coding practices and basic security\nprinciples.\u201d Internal security audits of new AI/ML tools and libraries before\ndeployment also cut the risk.\n\nConsidering the rate of acceleration in this AI/ML space it\u2019s extremely hard\nto make any predictions 12-24 months out. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m certain of is\nthat companies will be breached more often as a consequence of going \u2018full\nsteam ahead\u2019 in adopting this tooling,\u201d Salvati cautioned.\n\n### AI as Weakness and Advantage\n\nEarlier reports have indicated GenAI adoption by malicious actors is bringing\nnew security risks to organizations, though the same technology could be used\ndefensively.\n\nIndeed, even while IT security teams grapple with the new vulnerabilities AI\nadoption brings, implementation of AI-based cyber tools could also help\norganizations that are struggling to meet growing threats.\n\nPhoto by engin akyurt on Unsplash\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n  * AI Helps Security Teams, But Boosts Threats\n  * Cybersecurity Market Faces Funding Downturn in Q1 2024\n  * Insider Threats Surge Amid Growing Foreign Interference\n\nMore from Nathan Eddy\n\nApril 18, 2024April 18, 2024 Nathan Eddy AI, BentoML, machine learning, ML\nFlow, open source, pytorch, Ray, Remote Code Execution, Triton Inference\nServer\n\n  * \u2190 Cheap \u2018Junk-Gun Ransomware\u2019 Emerging on the Dark Web\n  * Finding Losses in Gains: Loss of Funds in Forks of Gains Network \u2192\n\n#### Nathan Eddy\n\nNathan Eddy is a Berlin-based filmmaker and freelance journalist specializing\nin enterprise IT and security issues, health care IT and architecture.\n\nnathan-eddy has 250 posts and counting.See all posts by nathan-eddy\n\n### Techstrong TV\n\nClick full-screen to enable volume control\n\nWatch latest episodes and shows\n\n### Upcoming Webinars\n\n### Podcast\n\nListen to all of our podcasts\n\n### Press Releases\n\n#### GoPlus\u2019s Latest Report Highlights How Blockchain Communities Are\nLeveraging Critical API Security Data To Mitigate Web3 Threats\n\n#### C2A Security\u2019s EVSec Risk Management and Automation Platform Gains\nTraction in Automotive Industry as Companies Seek to Efficiently Meet\nRegulatory Requirements\n\n#### Zama Raises $73M in Series A Lead by Multicoin Capital and Protocol Labs\nto Commercialize Fully Homomorphic Encryption\n\n#### RSM US Deploys Stellar Cyber Open XDR Platform to Secure Clients\n\n#### ThreatHunter.ai Halts Hundreds of Attacks in the past 48 hours: Combating\nRansomware and Nation-State Cyber Threats Head-On\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\n### Most Read on the Boulevard\n\nCheap \u2018Junk-Gun Ransomware\u2019 Emerging on the Dark Web\n\nVulnerabilities for AI and ML Applications are Skyrocketing\n\nSIM Swappers Try Bribing T-Mobile and Verizon Staff $300\n\nEx-Security Engineer Gets Three Years in Prison for $12 Million Crypto Hacks\n\nHouse Passes Privacy-Preserving Bill, but Biden Blasts it\n\nUSENIX Security \u201923 \u2013 NRDelegationAttack: Complexity DDoS attack on DNS\nRecursive Resolvers\n\nPalo Alto Networks PAN-OS Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2024-3400)\n\nCritical RCE Vulnerability in 92,000 D-Link NAS Devices\n\nMY TAKE: GenAI revolution \u2014 the transformative power of ordinary people\nconversing with AI\n\nWhat are Identity Providers (IdP)?\n\n### Industry Spotlight\n\nAPI Security Application Security Cloud Security Cloud Security Cyberlaw\nCybersecurity Data Privacy Deep Fake and Other Social Engineering Tactics\nEditorial Calendar Featured Governance, Risk & Compliance Humor Identity &\nAccess Identity and Access Management Industry Spotlight Insider Threats IOT\nIoT & ICS Security Mobile Security Most Read This Week News Popular Post\nRegulatory Compliance Securing the Cloud Security Awareness Security Boulevard\n(Original) Social -
