The complaint alleges that Razer only stopped the false advertising\nfollowing negative press coverage and consumer outrage at the deceptive\nclaims. The Department of Justice filed the case upon notification and\nreferral from the FTC.\n\nImage\n\nAdvertisement featuring Razer's Zephyr mask\n\n\u201cThese businesses falsely claimed, in the midst of a global pandemic, that\ntheir face mask was the equivalent of an N95 certified respirator,\u201d said\nSamuel Levine, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThe FTC\nwill continue to hold accountable businesses that use false and\nunsubstantiated claims to target consumers who are making decisions about\ntheir health and safety.\u201d\n\nThe complaint alleges the defendants deceptively advertised Razer\u2019s Zephyr\nmask as an N95-equivalent, COVID-protective product. They offered the standard\nRazer Zephyr, consisting of one Zephyr mask and three sets of filters, for\n$99.99; the Razer Zephyr Starter Pack, consisting of one Zephyr mask and 33\nsets of filters, for $149.99; and a Razer Zephyr Filter Pack, containing 10\nsets of filters, for $29.99.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the defendants began selling the Razer Zephyr and\nthe Razer Zephyr Filter Pack to U.S. consumers online and in three stores \u2013 in\nSeattle, San Francisco, and Las Vegas \u2013 in October 2021. Later that month,\nthey started selling the Razer Zephyr Starter Pack to U.S. consumers online\nthrough limited \u201cdrops.\u201d\n\nIn their advertisements, the defendants initially falsely marketed their\nZephyr masks as an N95 or N95-equivalent mask that would protect consumers\nfrom contracting COVID-19. Most of these advertisements were on the Internet,\nincluding on the defendants\u2019 own website and social media posts and videos on\nsites including TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Discord and YouTube.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented the Razer Zephyr as\nan N95-equivalent mask that met standards established by NIOSH, the agency\nthat approves N95 respirators. By definition, N95 respirators must filter at\nleast 95 percent of ambient air particles between .1 and .3 micrometers in\nsize, with even higher filtration levels for larger particles. While\nrespirators and masks are designed for different purposes, N95 respirators are\nfrequently referred to as N95 masks.\n\nDespite the N95-related claims the defendants made in their ads, Razer never\nsubmitted a facemask to NIOSH for approval for any type of certification and\nNIOSH accordingly never certified any version of the Zephyr mask as an N95\nrespirator. The defendants also never sought or received permission from NIOSH\nto use the term N95 in marketing and selling its products. Accordingly, the\ndefendants never had the required approval to advertise the Zephyr as an N95\nfacemask.\n\nThe proposed order settling the complaint addresses each alleged violation of\nthe FTC Act. First, it bans Razer from making, without prior FDA approval, any\nclaims that any product prevents or reduces the likelihood of infection with,\nor transmission of, the COVID-19 virus; reduces the severity or duration of\nCOVID-19; or otherwise cures, mitigates, or treats COVID-19.\n\nThe proposed order also prohibits the defendants from representing the health\nbenefits, performance, efficacy, safety, or side effects of protective goods\nand services (as defined in the proposed order), unless they have competent\nand reliable scientific evidence to support the claims made. The proposed\norder also prohibits the Razer defendants from making certain marketing and\nadvertising misrepresentations, including that any goods or services are\naffiliated with, endorsed, certified, cleared, authorized, approved by,\nregistered, or otherwise connected to any government entity.\n\nNext, the order prohibits them from the deceptive use of government logos or\ntrademarks to imply such an affiliation, from falsely claiming that any\nproduct meets government-established standards when it has not, and from\nmisrepresenting any other fact material to consumers such as total cost of the\nproduct and any aspect of its performance, efficacy, or other primary\ncharacteristics.\n\nFinally, the order imposes a $100,000 civil penalty against the defendants and\nrequires them to pay $1,071,254.33 to the United States, equal to Razer\u2019s\nrevenue from the masks, which the FTC expects to use to provide refunds to\ndefrauded consumers. This amount will allow the FTC to provide full refunds to\nconsumers who purchased the deceptively marketed products.\n\nThe Commission vote approving the complaint and proposed order was 3-0. It was\nfiled by DOJ in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia. The proposed order settles the FTC case against: 1) Razer, Inc.;\n2) Razer (Asia-Pacific) Pte., Ltd.; 3) Razer USA, Ltd.; 4) Razer Health Pte.,\nLtd.; and 5) Razer Online Pte., Ltd.\n\nThe staff attorneys on this case are Vikram Jagadish and Jordan Navarrette of\nthe FTC\u2019s Northeast Region.\n\nNOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has \u201creason to believe\u201d that\nthe named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and it\nappears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.\nStipulated final injunctions/orders have the force of law when approved and\nsigned by the District Court judge.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\neducate consumers.
