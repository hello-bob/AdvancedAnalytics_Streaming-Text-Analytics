I noticed a distinct drop in search quality after\nthe bing partnership.\n\n    * @Pechente@feddit.de\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n86\u2022\n\nedit-2\n\n23 hours ago\n\n> My DuckDuckGo experience has surprisingly been more useful.\n\nYeah, right!? I remember that one or two years ago DDG was consistently worse\nthan Google but recently Google\u2019s quality has dropped off a cliff. Now when I\ndon\u2019t get the desired result in DDG and switch to Google, the results are\nusually just as bad or worse.\n\n      * @smort@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n17\u202213 hours ago\n\nThe only time google gets me better results than DDG now is if I have a really\nvague question, like \u201cmovie where the guy wears a trash bag on his leg and has\na pi\u00f1a colada on the train to Milwaukee\u201d\n\n        * @brbposting@sh.itjust.works\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n3\u20221 hour ago\n\nAnd super specific queries?\n\n        * @Grandwolf319@sh.itjust.works\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n2\u202210 hours ago\n\nFor me it\u2019s programming issues. I guess devs know that doing SEO would shoot\nthemselves in the foot.\n\n          * @ignism@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n1\u202210 hours ago\n\nCould you elaborate? You\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to google for programming\nissues, but at the same time devs don\u2019t do SEO?\n\n            * @Grandwolf319@sh.itjust.works\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n4\u20229 hours ago\n\nSure. What I mean is that when I search for issues in duck duck go, I don\u2019t\nsee relevant results. But then I put \u201c!g\u201d and what I want (usually stack\noverflow or GitHub) comes to the top.\n\nSo it makes sense that programming sites do tags and keywords properly to\noptimize things for the user instead of trying promote their site no matter\nwhat.\n\nAt least that\u2019s my guess anyway.\n\n      * @frankgrimeszz@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n9\u202223 hours ago\n\ndeleted by creator\n\n      * @ThirdWorldOrder@lemm.ee\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n-11\u202219 hours ago\n\ndeleted by creator\n\n        * TJA!\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n12\u202219 hours ago\n\nWhat?

If im troubleshooting some weird software issue then i find it doesnt\nalways list as many results, as if it hasnt indexed as many sites.\n\nDDG at least now means I can search random shit without it suddenly being\ninserted into my social media algorithms like some kind of psychological\ntorture.\n\n    * @pearsaltchocolatebar@discuss.online\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n39\u202221 hours ago\n\nMy DDG searches have been absolute garbage for the past few months. About 75%\nof the time I have to re-search my keywords on Google to actually get a\nrelevant result.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m about to switch back to Google.\n\n      * @CarbonatedPastaSauce@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n37\u202221 hours ago\n\nThat\u2019s not been my experience. I\u2019ve been using DDG for years, and when I first\nswitched I would occasionally have to go find something on Google instead.\nThat slowly fell off as the years went by because going to Google and getting\nbetter search results became rarer and rarer. It\u2019s to the point now where I\ndon\u2019t even do it, unless I need to look at something on street view.\n\n        * @makyo@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n17\u202220 hours ago\n\nI second this, this has been my experience exactly. It\u2019s gotten so bad that\nnot only do I not need the Google fallback, but I\u2019m starting to feel like the\nDDG results are better than the Google ones in the first place.\n\n      * @Grandwolf319@sh.itjust.works\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n1\u202210 hours ago\n\nIt depends on what your searching. For me programming questions are way better\non google.\n\nAlso searching obvious questions like a country\u2019s population, google still\ndoes its job there too.\n\n      * beefbot\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n15\u202220 hours ago\n\nUnfortunately, this has also been my DuckDuckGo experience for several months.\nI wish it wasn\u2019t\n\n      * @Everythingispenguins@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n3\u202218 hours ago\n\nTry Startpage.

Like all the results were malicious. I suspect they had an\ninternal breach or the session was somehow hijacked. That was years ago, but\nit made me wary.
