(styled as bleem!) is a commercial PlayStation emulator released by the\nBleem! Company in 1999 for IBM-compatible PCs and Dreamcast. It is notable for\nbeing one of the few commercial software emulators to be aggressively marketed\nduring the emulated console's lifetime, and was the center of multiple\ncontroversial lawsuits.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nBleem! was a PlayStation emulator designed to allow people to play original\nPlayStation games on their PC or Dreamcast gaming consoles (the Dreamcast\nversion was called Bleemcast!). It was released in March 1999. The company\nthat developed and commercialized Bleem! initially consisted of just two\npeople, David Herpolsheimer (president) and Randy Linden,^[1] but in the\ncommercial phase included Will Kempe, Scott Karol, Sean Kauppinen, Bryan\nStokes, James Sinclair,^[2] and Paul Chen, later of Rovio Entertainment.\n\n### Context[edit]\n\nTo allow for full-speed emulation on even lower-end computers of what was at\nthe time a current generation console, the authors coded Bleem! in assembly.\nThis allowed them to create precise optimizations.^[3] Unlike Connectix's\ncommercial Virtual Game Station, it made use of a PC's 3D graphics hardware\nfor rendering, allowing for enhanced resolutions and filtered textures not\npossible in real-time software rendering of the time.\n\nBleem! used low-level memory emulation and other real-mode technology. It did\nnot function on operating systems using the Windows NT kernel, including\nWindows 2000. In fact, Bleem!'s statement at the time was that Bleem! would\nnever support running on Windows NT-based systems, as Windows 98 was the\ndominant operating system at the time.\n\nSony, despite having lost its case with Connectix, continued to pursue legal\naction against Bleem!. Bleem!, financially unable to defend itself, was forced\nto go out of business.\n\nAs of 2005, two members of the team were working for Sony: Randy Linden was\nworking for SCEA on porting titles and looking at the possibility of emulation\nof previous generation titles for the next PlayStation,^[citation needed] and\nSean Kauppinen was promoting EverQuest II and Star Wars Galaxies for Sony\nOnline Entertainment.\n\n### Copy protection[edit]\n\nTo combat redistribution of the small downloadable emulator, the user had to\nbuy the Bleem!-CD, containing about 35 MB of data: a DirectX distributable and\nthe actual version of Bleem! available at the time of the CD's printing. The\nrest of the CD was only for copy protection and was impossible to copy by\nconventional means; nevertheless, the copy protection was cracked within two\nweeks of the release.\n\nFurther updates to the emulator were free until the company ceased operation\nseveral years later.\n\n## Bleemcast![edit]\n\nComparison: R4: Ridge Racer Type 4, running natively on the PlayStation, and\nunder Bleemcast!, respectively.\n\nBleemcast! is an independently developed commercial emulator by Bleem! that\nallows one to load and play PlayStation discs on the Sega Dreamcast. It is\ncompatible with most Dreamcast controllers and steering wheels, and leverages\nthe Dreamcast's superior processing power for enhanced graphics. It was\ncreated by using the MIL-CD security hole found in the Dreamcast BIOS.\n\n### History[edit]\n\nOriginally, Bleem! was planning to have the disc able to run any PlayStation\ngame on the Dreamcast, but due to technical difficulties, they developed the\nconcept of the \"Bleempak\", in which the software would boot only 100 specific\ngames each. New Bleempaks would have to be purchased if one game was not\navailable to boot in a Bleempak. Due to the Dreamcast controller's fewer\nbuttons compared to the PlayStation, there were plans to release a Bleem!\ncontroller somewhat similarly designed to the PlayStation controller, and a\nPlayStation-to-Dreamcast controller adapter, which would allow one to use a\nPlayStation controller on the Dreamcast. As technical difficulties grew\nfurther, all these ideas were scrapped, with no \"Bleempak\" and no hardware\nreleases.\n\nHowever, they managed to release individual Bleemcast! bootdiscs for three\npopular games: Gran Turismo 2, Tekken 3, and Metal Gear Solid. WWF SmackDown!\nwas also being planned for a release, but was not completed, while a couple of\nscreenshots of Final Fantasy IX were surfacing during this time, but was never\nannounced as a planned release.^[4] As promised from the beginning, the games\nran in a 640\u00d7480 resolution, as opposed to the PS1's 320\u00d7240 resolution, and\nfeatured anti-aliasing and bilinear filtering. This drastically improved the\ngames' graphics, but also brought out some graphical imperfections that were\noriginally hidden in the lower resolution.\n\n## Sony lawsuit[edit]\n\nTwo days after Bleem! started taking preorders for their emulator, Sony filed\nsuit over violations of copyright. Sony had accused Bleem! of engaging in\nunfair competition by allowing PlayStation BIOSs to be used on a personal\ncomputer as this would ultimately damage Sony's sales of the PlayStation. The\nJudge had rejected the notion, and issued a protective order to \"protect David\nfrom Goliath\". Sony's second copyright allegation regarded the use of\nscreenshots on their advertisements comparing the native PlayStation and\nemulated Bleem! versions. The district court had held in favor of Sony\nregarding the allegation and issued a preliminary injunction against Bleem!;\nhowever, Bleem! later appealed the decision providing their use of copyrighted\nmaterial was protected under fair use. The appeal was successful, with the\ncourt stating that the use of screenshots of Sony's video games rather\nconstituted comparative advertising.^[5]\n\nIn spite of the loss, the release of the Bleemcast! caused Sony to file\nanother lawsuit accusing them of unfair competition and patent infringement\nregarding the use of PlayStation BIOSs on the Sega Dreamcast. This approach\nhad become problematic for Bleem!, despite no actual court ruling against\nthem. The main issue regarded the financial problems Bleem! had faced as they\nhad to deal with defense costs of $1 million per patent. This had caused\nBleem!'s work to decline, so that they had only managed to release three\ngames: Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo 2, and Tekken 3, for the Bleemcast!.^[6]\nAt this point, Sony had obstructed Bleem! from developing further video games\nfor the Bleemcast! and had even threatened retailers selling these\nproducts.^[7]\n\nThe legal fees forced the company out of business and eBay auctions of some of\nthe company's possessions were held soon after \u2013 including a huge library of\nworldwide game releases used for compatibility testing.\n\n### Closure of Bleem![edit]\n\nAlthough Sony ultimately did not win any of its lawsuits against them, Bleem!\nhad to shut down when the huge court costs became too much for the small\ncompany to handle. Bleem! shut down in November 2001,^[8] the same year Sega\nannounced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast in North America. Bleem!\nclosed their website, with only an image on their front page showing Sonic the\nHedgehog tearfully holding a flower next to a Bleem! gravestone. The image was\nlater altered and Sonic was removed, ironically to avoid a lawsuit from\nSega.^[9] Sega themselves had also been indirectly involved in the obstruction\nof Bleemcast! by the way of the removal of support for the unpopular (for\nSega's intended use) MIL-CD format on later Dreamcast models.^[4]\n\n### Beta leak[edit]\n\nA beta build of Bleemcast! was eventually leaked. Even though it was buggy and\nincomplete, it would run some PlayStation games, though not all the games it\nran would be playable.^[citation needed] Using this beta, hackers were able to\ncreate \"Bleemed games\" \u2013 discs of a PlayStation title with the Bleemcast!\nemulator built in. ISO images of many of these discs circulate on file-sharing\nnetworks.\n\nAfter the leak, Rod Maher, one of the developers of Bleemcast!, made a public\nstatement regarding the beta, providing some insight into the development\nprocess. He revealed that the leaked beta predated the beta that had been\nshown at E3 and that the leaked beta was 30% complete.^[10] The commercial\nBleemcast! release was notable as the only release on the Dreamcast that had\nnot been pirated, as it had a complex copy-protection scheme. All three\nBleempaks were finally cracked and made available online in December 2009,\neight years after their introduction.^[citation needed]\n\n## Bleem Powered[edit]\n\nOn January 4, 2021, Piko Interactive announced that they had acquired the\nBleem! brand name, with plans to start a retrogaming-focused online storefront\ntitled Bleem Powered,^[11] which as of late 2022 still seems to be under\ndevelopment.^[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Rhodes, Tom. \"Best Little Emulator Ever Made!\".
