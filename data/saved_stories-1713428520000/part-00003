So let\u2019s quickly refer you to Wikipedia:\n\n> Rickrolling is an Internet meme involving the music video for the 1987 Rick\n> Astley song \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d. The meme is a bait and switch; a\n> person provides a hyperlink which is seemingly relevant to the topic at\n> hand, but actually leads to Astley\u2019s video. The link can be masked or\n> obfuscated in some manner so that the user cannot determine the true\n> destination of the link without clicking. People led to the music video are\n> said to have been rickrolled. Rickrolling has extended beyond web links to\n> playing the video or song disruptively in other situations, including public\n> places, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy\u2019s\n> Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. The meme helped to revive Astley\u2019s\n> career.\n\nNow, in another sign that rickrolling has gone beyond the web, we have above a\nsnapshot of a quantum physics written by Sairam Gudiseva, a student at (we\nbelieve) White Station High School in Tennessee. As the snapshot shows,\nGudiseva managed to run the lyrics of \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d down the left\nmargin of the page ... while still keeping his ideas flowing. Well done, young\nman. You can see a full page of his essay here.\n\nBy the way, this is not the first time some levity has been introduced to a\nphysic paper. You might want to refer back to our 2012 post, Physical\nAttraction: Marriage Proposal Comes in the Form of a Physics Paper.\n\nvia i09\n\nRelated Content:\n\nPhysics: Free Online Courses (Part of our collection of 825 Free Online\nCourses from Top Universities)\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson Talks Asteroid Physics & \u201cNon Newtonian Solids\u201d with\nInspiring 9\u2010Year-Old Student\n\nMarilyn Monroe Explains Relativity to Albert Einstein (in a Nicolas Roeg\nMovie)\n\nThe Most \u201cIntellectual Jokes\u201d: Our Favorite Open Culture Reader Submissions\n\nFacebookThreadsMastodonRedditMessageEmailShare\n\nby OC | Permalink | Comments (7) |\n\nSupport Open Culture\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to rely on our loyal readers rather than erratic ads.
