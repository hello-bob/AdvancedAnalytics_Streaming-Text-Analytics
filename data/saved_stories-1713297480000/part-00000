Yet a number of physicists hope to replace this\n\u201cblock universe\u201d with a physical theory of time.\n\n114\n\nRead Later\n\nThe physicist Tim Koslowski listens to the discussion at the Time in Cosmology\nconference.\n\nPhilip Cheung for Quanta Magazine\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\n## Introduction\n\nEinstein once described his friend Michele Besso as \u201cthe best sounding board\nin Europe\u201d for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich;\nlater they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in\nthe spring of 1955, Einstein \u2014 knowing that his own time was also running out\n\u2014 wrote a now-famous letter to Besso\u2019s family. \u201cNow he has departed this\nstrange world a little ahead of me,\u201d Einstein wrote of his friend\u2019s passing.\n\u201cThat signifies nothing. For us believing physicists, the distinction between\npast, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201d\n\n> All episodes\n>\n> 00:00/00:00\n>\n> APPLE\n>\n> SPOTIFY\n\nEinstein\u2019s statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists\nargue that Einstein\u2019s position is implied by the two pillars of modern\nphysics: Einstein\u2019s masterpiece, the general theory of relativity, and the\nStandard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are\ntime-symmetric \u2014 that is, the physics they describe is the same, regardless of\nwhether the variable called \u201ctime\u201d increases or decreases. Moreover, they say\nnothing at all about the point we call \u201cnow\u201d \u2014 a special moment (or so it\nappears) for us, but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at\nlarge. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a \u201cblock universe\u201d \u2014\na static block of space-time in which any flow of time, or passage through it,\nmust presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.\n\nMany physicists have made peace with the idea of a block universe, arguing\nthat the task of the physicist is to describe how the universe appears from\nthe point of view of individual observers. To understand the distinction\nbetween past, present and future, you have to \u201cplunge into this block universe\nand ask: \u2018How is an observer perceiving time?\u2019\u201d said Andreas Albrecht, a\nphysicist at the University of California, Davis, and one of the founders of\nthe theory of cosmic inflation.\n\nOthers vehemently disagree, arguing that the task of physics is to explain not\njust how time appears to pass, but why. For them, the universe is not static.\nThe passage of time is physical. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this block universe,\u201d\nsaid Avshalom Elitzur, a physicist and philosopher formerly of Bar-Ilan\nUniversity. \u201cI don\u2019t think that next Thursday has the same footing as this\nThursday. The future does not exist. It does not! Ontologically, it\u2019s not\nthere.\u201d\n\nLast month, about 60 physicists, along with a handful of philosophers and\nresearchers from other branches of science, gathered at the Perimeter\nInstitute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, to debate this question\nat the Time in Cosmology conference. The conference was co-organized by the\nphysicist Lee Smolin, an outspoken critic of the block-universe idea (among\nother topics). His position is spelled out for a lay audience in Time Reborn\nand in a more technical work, The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time,\nco-authored with the philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger, who was also a co-\norganizer of the conference. In the latter work, mirroring Elitzur\u2019s\nsentiments about the future\u2019s lack of concreteness, Smolin wrote: \u201cThe future\nis not now real and there can be no definite facts of the matter about the\nfuture.\u201d What is real is \u201cthe process by which future events are generated out\nof present events,\u201d he said at the conference.\n\nAndreas Albrecht, a physicist at the University of California, Davis, presents\nhis work on the nature of time.\n\nPhilip Cheung for Quanta Magazine\n\nThose in attendance wrestled with several questions: the distinction between\npast, present and future; why time appears to move in only one direction; and\nwhether time is fundamental or emergent. Most of those issues, not\nsurprisingly, remained unresolved. But for four days, participants listened\nattentively to the latest proposals for tackling these questions \u2014 and,\nespecially, to the ways in which we might reconcile our perception of time\u2019s\npassage with a static, seemingly timeless universe.\n\n## Time Swept Under the Rug\n\nThere are a few things that everyone agrees on. The directionality that we\nobserve in the macroscopic world is very real: Teacups shatter but do not\nspontaneously reassemble; eggs can be scrambled but not unscrambled. Entropy \u2014\na measure of the disorder in a system \u2014 always increases, a fact encoded in\nthe second law of thermodynamics. As the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann\nunderstood in the 19th century, the second law explains why events are more\nlikely to evolve in one direction rather than another. It accounts for the\narrow of time.\n\nBut things get trickier when we step back and ask why we happen to live in a\nuniverse where such a law holds. \u201cWhat Boltzmann truly explained is why the\nentropy of the universe will be larger tomorrow than it is today,\u201d said Sean\nCarroll, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, as we sat in a\nhotel bar after the second day of presentations. \u201cBut if that was all you\nknew, you\u2019d also say that the entropy of the universe was probably larger\nyesterday than today \u2014 because all the underlying dynamics are completely\nsymmetric with respect to time.\u201d That is, if entropy is ultimately based on\nthe underlying laws of the universe, and those laws are the same going forward\nand backward, then entropy is just as likely to increase going backward in\ntime. But no one believes that entropy actually works that way. Scrambled eggs\nalways come after whole eggs, never the other way around.\n\nTo make sense of this, physicists have proposed that the universe began in a\nvery special low-entropy state. In this view, which the Columbia University\nphilosopher of physics David Albert named the \u201cpast hypothesis,\u201d entropy\nincreases because the Big Bang happened to produce an exceptionally low-\nentropy universe. There was nowhere to go but up. The past hypothesis implies\nthat every time we cook an egg, we\u2019re taking advantage of events that happened\nnearly 14 billion years ago. \u201cWhat you need the Big Bang to explain is: \u2018Why\nwere there ever unbroken eggs?\u2019\u201d Carroll said.\n\nSome physicists are more troubled than others by the past hypothesis. Taking\nthings we don\u2019t understand about the physics of today\u2019s universe and saying\nthe answer can be found in the Big Bang could be seen, perhaps, as passing the\nbuck \u2014 or as sweeping our problems under the carpet. Every time we invoke\ninitial conditions, \u201cthe pile of things under the rug gets bigger,\u201d said\nMarina Cortes, a cosmologist at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and a co-\norganizer of the conference.\n\nTo Smolin, the past hypothesis feels more like an admission of failure than a\nuseful step forward. As he puts it in The Singular Universe: \u201cThe fact to be\nexplained is why the universe, even 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang, has\nnot reached equilibrium, which is by definition the most probable state, and\nit hardly suffices to explain this by asserting that the universe started in\nan even less probable state than the present one.\u201d\n\nOther physicists, however, point out that it\u2019s normal to develop theories that\ncan describe a system given certain initial conditions. A theory needn\u2019t\nstrive to explain those conditions.\n\nAnother set of physicists think that the past hypothesis, while better than\nnothing, is more likely to be a placeholder than a final answer. Perhaps, if\nwe\u2019re lucky, it will point the way to something deeper. \u201cMany people say that\nthe past hypothesis is just a fact, and there isn\u2019t any underlying way to\nexplain it. I don\u2019t rule out that possibility,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cTo me, the past\nhypothesis is a clue to help us develop a more comprehensive view of the\nuniverse.\u201d\n\nJenann Ismael, a philosopher at the University of Arizona, argues that the\nblock universe holds within it the explanation for our experience of time\u2019s\napparent passage.\n\nPhilip Cheung for Quanta Magazine\n\n## The Alternative Origins of Time\n\nCan the arrow of time be understood without invoking the past hypothesis? Some\nphysicists argue that gravity \u2014 not thermodynamics \u2014 aims time\u2019s arrow. In\nthis view, gravity causes matter to clump together, defining an arrow of time\nthat aligns itself with growth of complexity, said Tim Koslowski, a physicist\nat the National Autonomous University of Mexico (he described the idea in a\n2014 paper co-authored by the British physicist Julian Barbour and Flavio\nMercati, a physicist at Perimeter). Koslowski and his colleagues developed\nsimple models of universes made up of 1,000 pointlike particles, subject only\nto Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, and found that there will always be a moment\nof maximum density and minimum complexity. As one moves away from that point,\nin either direction, complexity increases. Naturally, we \u2014 complex creatures\ncapable of making observations \u2014 can only evolve at some distance from the\nminimum. Still, wherever we happen to find ourselves in the history of the\nuniverse, we can point to an era of less complexity and call it the past,\nKoslowski said. The models are globally time-symmetric, but every observer\nwill experience a local arrow of time. It\u2019s significant that the low-entropy\nstarting point isn\u2019t an add-on to the model. Rather, it emerges naturally from\nit. \u201cGravity essentially eliminates the need for a past hypothesis,\u201d Koslowski\nsaid.\n\nThe idea that time moves in more than one direction, and that we just happen\nto inhabit a section of the cosmos with a single, locally defined arrow of\ntime, isn\u2019t new. Back in 2004, Carroll, along with his graduate student\nJennifer Chen, put forward a similar proposal based on eternal inflation, a\nrelatively well-known model of the beginning of the universe. Carroll sees the\nwork of Koslowski and his colleagues as a useful step, especially since they\nworked out the mathematical details of their model (he and Chen did not).\nStill, he has some concerns. For example, he said it\u2019s not clear that gravity\nplays as important a role as their paper claims. \u201cIf you just had particles in\nempty space, you\u2019d get exactly the same qualitative behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nIncreasing complexity, Koslowski said, has one crucial side effect: It leads\nto the formation of certain arrangements of matter that maintain their\nstructure over time. These structures can store information; Koslowski calls\nthem \u201crecords.\u201d Gravity is the first and primary force that makes record\nformation possible; other processes then give rise to everything from fossils\nand tree rings to written documents. What all of these entities have in common\nis that they contain information about some earlier state of the universe. I\nasked Koslowski if memories stored in brains are another kind of record. Yes,\nhe said. \u201cIdeally we would be able to build ever more complex models, and come\neventually to the memory in my phone, the memory in my brain, in history\nbooks.\u201d A more complex universe contains more records than a less complex\nuniverse, and this, Koslowski said, is why we remember the past but not the\nfuture.\n\nBut perhaps time is even more fundamental than this. For George Ellis, a\ncosmologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, time is a more\nbasic entity, one that can be understood by picturing the block universe as\nitself evolving. In his \u201cevolving block universe\u201dmodel, the universe is a\ngrowing volume of space-time. The surface of this volume can be thought of as\nthe present moment. The surface represents the instant where \u201cthe\nindefiniteness of the future changes to the definiteness of the past,\u201d as he\ndescribed it. \u201cSpace-time itself is growing as time passes.\u201d One can discern\nthe direction of time by looking at which part of the universe is fixed (the\npast) and which is changing (the future). Although some colleagues disagree,\nEllis stresses that the model is a modification, not a radical overhaul, of\nthe standard view. \u201cThis is a block universe with dynamics covered by the\ngeneral-relativity field equations \u2014 absolutely standard \u2014 but with a future\nboundary that is the ever-changing present,\u201d he said. In this view, while the\npast is fixed and unchangeable, the future is open. The model \u201cobviously\nrepresents the passing of time in a more satisfactory way than the usual block\nuniverse,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorge Ellis, a cosmologist at the University of Cape Town, listens to a\npresentation.\n\nPhilip Cheung for Quanta Magazine\n\nUnlike the traditional block view, Ellis\u2019s picture appears to describe a\nuniverse with an open future \u2014 seemingly in conflict with a law-governed\nuniverse in which past physical states dictate future states. (Although\nquantum uncertainty, as Ellis pointed out, may be enough to sink such a\ndeterministic view.) At the conference, someone asked Ellis if, given enough\ninformation about the physics of a sphere of a certain radius centered on the\nBritish Midlands in early June, one could have predicted the result of the\nBrexit vote. \u201cNot using physics,\u201d Ellis replied. For that, he said, we\u2019d need\na better understanding of how minds work.\n\nAnother approach that aims to reconcile the apparent passage of time with the\nblock universe goes by the name of causal set theory. First developed in the\n1980s as an approach to quantum gravity by the physicist Rafael Sorkin \u2014 who\nwas also at the conference \u2014 the theory is based on the idea that space-time\nis discrete rather than continuous. In this view, although the universe\nappears continuous at the macroscopic level, if we could peer down to the so-\ncalled Planck scale (distances of about 10^\u201335 meters) we\u2019d discover that the\nuniverse is made up of elementary units or \u201catoms\u201d of space-time. The atoms\nform what mathematicians call a \u201cpartially ordered set\u201d \u2014 an array in which\neach element is linked to an adjacent element in a particular sequence. The\nnumber of these atoms (estimated to be a whopping 10^240 in the visible\nuniverse) gives rise to the volume of space-time, while their sequence gives\nrise to time. According to the theory, new space-time atoms are continuously\ncoming into existence. Fay Dowker, a physicist at Imperial College London,\nreferred to this at the conference as \u201caccretive time.\u201d She invited everyone\nto think of space-time as accreting new space-time atoms in way roughly\nanalogous to a seabed depositing new layers of sediment over time. General\nrelativity yields only a block, but causal sets seem to allow a \u201cbecoming,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThe block universe is a static thing \u2014 a static picture of the\nworld \u2014 whereas this process of becoming is dynamical.\u201d In this view, the\npassage of time is a fundamental rather than an emergent feature of the\ncosmos. (Causal set theory has made at least one successful prediction about\nthe universe, Dowker pointed out, having been used to estimate the value of\nthe cosmological constant based only on the space-time volume of the\nuniverse.)\n\n## The Problem With the Future\n\nIn the face of these competing models, many thinkers seem to have stopped\nworrying and learned to love (or at least tolerate) the block universe.\n\nPerhaps the strongest statement made at the conference in favor of the block\nuniverse\u2019s compatibility with everyday experience came from the philosopher\nJenann Ismael of the University of Arizona. The way Ismael sees it, the block\nuniverse, properly understood, holds within it the explanation for our\nexperience of time\u2019s apparent passage. A careful look at conventional physics,\nsupplemented by what we\u2019ve learned in recent decades from cognitive science\nand psychology, can recover \u201cthe flow, the whoosh, of experience,\u201d she said.\nIn this view, time is not an illusion \u2014 in fact, we experience it directly.\nShe cited studies that show that each moment we experience represents a finite\ninterval of time. In other words, we don\u2019t infer the flow of time; it\u2019s part\nof the experience itself. The challenge, she said, is to frame this first-\nperson experience within the static block offered by physics \u2014 to examine \u201chow\nthe world looks from the evolving frame of reference of an embedded perceiver\u201d\nwhose history is represented by a curve within the space-time of the block\nuniverse.\n\nIsmael\u2019s presentation drew a mixed response. Carroll said he agreed with\neverything she had said; Elitzur said he \u201cwanted to scream\u201d during her talk.\n(He later clarified: \u201cIf I bang my head against the wall, it\u2019s because I hate\nthe future.\u201d) An objection voiced many times during the conference was that\nthe block universe seems to imply, in some important way, that the future\nalready exists, yet statements about, say, next Thursday\u2019s weather are neither\ntrue nor false. For some, this seems like an insurmountable problem with the\nblock-universe view. Ismael had heard these objections many times before.\nFuture events exist, she said, they just don\u2019t exist now. \u201cThe block universe\nis not a changing picture,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s a picture of change.\u201d Things happen\nwhen they happen. \u201cThis is a moment \u2014 and I know everybody here is going to\nhate this \u2014 but physics could do with some philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nlong history of discussion about the truth-values of future contingent\nstatements \u2014 and it really has nothing to do with the experience of time.\u201d And\nfor those who wanted to read more? \u201cI recommend Aristotle,\u201d she said.\n\nCorrection: A photo caption was revised on July 25, 2016, to correct the\nspelling of Jenann Ismael\u2019s name.\n\nThis article was reprinted on TheAtlantic.com.\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nBy Dan Falk\n\nContributing Writer\n\nJuly 19, 2016\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\ncosmologygeneral relativityphysicsQuanta Podcastquantum physicstheoretical\nphysicsthermodynamicstimeAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Physics\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\nThe Joy of Why\n\n### Can Information Escape a Black Hole?\n\nBy Janna Levin\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n4\n\nRead Later\n\nastronomy\n\n### How the Ancient Art of Eclipse Prediction Became an Exact Science\n\nBy Joshua Sokol\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n1\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
