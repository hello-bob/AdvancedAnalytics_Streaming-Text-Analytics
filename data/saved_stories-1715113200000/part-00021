Enter Emily Pelosi, who was given the title of \u201chead of\nemployee listening\u201d at software giant Intuit in 2022.\n\nPelosi has a Ph.D. in industrial and organizational psychology, and has worked\nin HR research and analytics teams at places like Amazon and CenturyLink. She\nleads a team that gathers employee sentiment data, analyzes it to produce\ninsights from workers\u2019 experiences, and then works with HR and other teams to\nhelp formulate talent strategies.\n\nHer role may sound unusual, but she says it\u2019s not as rare as one might think;\nand more companies are hiring these experts as talent attraction and retention\ncontinues to be a top priority.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s something that is a little more cutting-edge and has grown in\npopularity,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cI noticed more and more of these types of\nroles emerging during the pandemic, and after, when employers realized we have\nto listen differently, we have to act differently, to navigate the first of\nmany unprecedented global crises.\u201d\n\nShe sat down with Fortune to discuss why Intuit decided to create her role and\nhow she helps the company\u2019s leaders make the best decisions for them based on\ndata.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFortune: What does \u201cemployee listening\u201d mean? What prompted Intuit to create\nthis role?\n\nEmily Pelosi: At a high level, employee listening is made up of many\nactivities that companies, including Intuit, have been doing for many years.\nPulse engagement surveys, onboarding surveys, exit surveys, things like that.\nHowever, the pandemic ushered in a new way of working, a new pace of work and\nchange, and many global challenges which created a need for more real-time\ninsights. For that reason, Intuit and other companies have evolved to include\nmechanisms for more continuous listening that provide more frequent touch\npoints. For example, we have a survey called \u201cAlways On\u201d that lives on our\nhomepage that employees can participate in once a week to tell us what\u2019s on\ntheir minds.\n\nWhat does your role entail?\n\nI\u2019m managing a couple of things. I lead our enterprise-wide listening program,\nwhich is made up of our surveys. [I also lead] our \u201cvoice of the employee\u201d\nanalytics program, where we\u2019re gathering data using listening channels that\nare used between our big company-wide pulse surveys that happen roughly twice\na year. We\u2019re working directly with our HR business partners to hear what\nchallenges they\u2019re working through with their leaders, and how we can support\nthem. We also look at some passive data sources as well, such as help tickets\nthat employees submit, to see where employees need the most support.\n\nI also lead a small people research team designed to take those survey\ninsights, go deep into the data, and uncover new unique insights that\nultimately help our leaders empower our employees to do the best work of their\nlives.\n\nWhat functions do you work most closely with?\n\nI partner closely with our talent development team, helping inform how we can\nsupport our managers, measure their capability, and develop that further. In\nthe last couple of years, we\u2019ve been partnering closely with our hybrid work\nteam, informing the way our return to office policy looks. We also partner\nclosely with D&I. Many different groups across our HR organization are\nprimarily my key customers.\n\nDo you work with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi?\n\nI do actually meet with our CEO at least twice a year. He\u2019s heavily involved\nin our biannual company survey. We partner with him and our chief people\nofficer Laura Fennell to make sure we\u2019re asking the right questions. We align\nwith them upfront on what we\u2019re asking, how we\u2019re asking it. And he\u2019s the\nfirst person we meet with when the survey closes, to talk through what we\nlearned, what our key areas of opportunity are, what we want to focus on as a\ncompany, and then we go from there.\n\nWhat previous career or education experience do you think best prepared you to\ntake on this title and responsibilities?\n\nMy background is in industrial and organizational psychology. I like to define\nit as the science of the workplace. It\u2019s a little bit of data analytics,\nresearch, methodology, survey design. All the things that would help you\nscientifically explain what\u2019s going on in a workplace, specifically with\nemployees and their interactions.\n\nFor example, my dissertation was on employee engagement. Understanding the\ndrivers of engagement, some of the outcomes, and what that can look like helps\ninform the way you measure things and explain to your leaders what it means.\n\nI also see a lot of overlap with people in similar roles to mine, having a\nbackground in people analytics. At the end of the day, this job can be a\nlittle bit of everything: data analysis and research, survey design,\nmeasurement, even data engineering and product management, because once you\u2019re\ngathering the data, you have to find a way to effectively store it, ensure\nconfidentiality, things like that. It really can be a mixed bag.\n\nWhat do you consider the most challenging part of your job?\n\nAn ongoing challenge for anyone in this type of role is learning how to ask\nthe right questions. We\u2019re continually iterating on the ways we gather\nfeedback, what we\u2019re asking. Because a lot of companies, Intuit included, are\ninvesting in AI and using that to help us glean more meaningful insights from\nemployee data. But even with that technology, you have to consider what\nquestions you\u2019re asking. That frames up employees\u2019 responses and impacts what\nthey say or don\u2019t say. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re always thinking critically\nabout. That\u2019s not something everyone realizes, that there\u2019s an actual science\nto employee surveys.\n\nCan you give an example of that?\n\nA team might come to us and say, \u2018Hey, we launched this new event with this\ninitiative, and we want to see if it made a difference on XYZ. Did it improve\nbelonging for employees? Did this make them feel more connected?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ll start the conversation by asking: What were the goals of your\ninitiative? We will take them through breaking down those goals into specific\noutcomes that you would expect to see because of this particular action.\nSometimes, that\u2019s a level of granularity that people haven\u2019t thought about\nbefore. Drilling down something to a specific behavior can be challenging. But\nit\u2019s always fun to walk alongside that journey with our partners and help them\nidentify: This is what people are doing differently, because they did our\nprogram. Or, this is what they\u2019re not doing differently, let\u2019s go back to the\ndrawing board.\n\nHow do you handle complaints or negative sentiments shared by employees?\n\nSomething we talk about a lot is that it\u2019s important to distinguish\nquestioning from asking questions. What\u2019s super interesting is, just having\nthe nature of an open-text question or asking: What could we be doing\ndifferently? You\u2019re literally asking for criticism. You\u2019re gonna get more\nnegative sentiment.\n\nOne of our principles toward approaching these situations is leading that\nconversation with data. Some of the AI models we use, we\u2019re able to take a\nbunch of comments and say: How many people brought up XYZ? How many people\nbrought up that topic? How negative was the sentiment? That helps inform the\nmagnitude in terms of the emotion behind it, and what percentage of people\nmight be feeling that way. Once you can distinguish between a situation that\u2019s\na very small group of people with very negative sentiment, versus a larger\npercentage, that changes how you respond to that.\n\nMay 2, 2024: This story has been updated to reflect the correct name of\nIntuit\u2019s chief people officer.\n\nSubscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive\nnavigate the changing needs of the workplace.
