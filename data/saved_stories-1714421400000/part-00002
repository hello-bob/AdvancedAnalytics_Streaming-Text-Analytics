You can download\nit here.\n\nGreetings! In the last update we covered everything that you can expect from\nour next upcoming expansion, Grasping Fortune. But Morrowind is a massive\nprovince and Tamriel Rebuilt is developing on many fronts in parallel. The\nlast time that we went over our full plans for the future \u2013 our development\nroadmap \u2013 was in late 2021. Hence, it\u2019s high time we update you with how those\nplans have changed and give you a high-level overview of each of the new and\nexciting expansions that we\u2019re currently tackling.\n\nRemember, Tamriel Rebuilt is developed as a series of episodic releases or\nexpansions, with new chunks of Morrowind\u2019s mainland released every year\n(aspirationally, at least). Whenever an expansion is released, the new areas\ncome with the full complement of interior locations, characters, and quests,\nall seamlessly tying into the base game and the prior expansions.\n\nA map of all prior and currently in-development Tamriel Rebuilt expansions.\n\nIn order for all this to work, teams focusing on different fields of mod\ndevelopment are chipping away at different parts of the province. Asset\ndevelopers bring the work of our concept artists to life, creating the 3D\nassets that our level designers need. Only once the asset palette for a new\nregion is more-or-less finished, can exterior level designers create a new\narea of the overworld. Once that is done, a drove of interior level designers\ndescends to fill out the (sometimes) hundreds of highly detailed interior\nlocations \u2013 buildings, caves, dungeons \u2013 that each expansion needs. And only\nonce the latter work is winding down can quest developers fill the lands with\nhundreds more memorable characters and quests.\n\nBelow, we will walk you through the different expansions we are currently\nworking on, roughly in the order that we expect them to be released. All of\nthis is, obviously, highly tentative and subject to change at any time.\nFurthermore, no dates are offered, as everything here is done by volunteer\neffort, the ebbs and floods of which are infamously hard to predict.\n\nCovered in-depth in our last news post, Grasping Fortune is the next expansion\nin our pipeline and the one closest to completion.\n\nA birds-eye view of the playable area to be added in Grasping Fortune. The\nexterior worldscape is now more-or-less finished. Yellow landscape comprises\nmostly the Coronati Basin region while the red area is Shipal-Shin. Dotted\nblack lines denote an area that may possibly be added to the expansion, should\nit be finalized in time. The inset on the top left shows the location on a map\nof all of Morrowind.\n\nGrasping Fortune will add a vast area of the mainland stretching south from\nLake Andaram (the focus of our last expansion) all the way to the southwestern\ntip of Morrowind against Cyrodiil and Black Marsh. Its main focus will be the\ngrand city of Narsis, the headquarters of House Hlaalu, home of the Imperial\nProconsul, and the second-biggest and possibly richest city in Morrowind.\nSmaller towns in the release include Othmura, Ald Iuval, Ald Marak, Hlerynhul,\nSadrathim, and Shipal-Sharai.\n\nLooking across Sadrathim towards Narsis. Exterior (foreground) level design by\nChef.\n\nIncluded in the release will also be a huge chunk of countryside \u2013 both the\ncultivated Coronati Basin region and the wild canyons of Shipal-Shin. Search\nfor monasteries, Shinathi nomad camps, a tower of the Barsaebic Ayleids, a\nSecond Empire (Reman) ruin, the giant Velothi tower compound where the Ja-\nNatta Syndicate makes its lair, and the Stormgate and Septim\u2019s Gate passes to\nBlack Marsh and Cyrodiil, respectively. Just don\u2019t get mauled by a horned\nbutcher or stung by a skyrender!\n\nYou can expect questlines for almost every imaginable faction (often several\nof them), including ones for House Redoran, the Twin Lamps, and the brand-new\nJa-Natta Syndicate criminal organization.\n\nThe Narsis waterfront. Exterior level design by Chef.\n\nCurrently, exteriors are finished aside from a few optional touch-ups and,\npossibly, a new slice of land bitten off from the later Wealth Beyond Measure\nexpansion. Interiors are almost done, save for a few larger locations and the\nskyrender hives (which still need some new 3D assets). Addition of NPCs and\ngeneral dialogue is finished for almost all of the towns, most of Narsis, and\nthe Coronati Basin wilderness; some areas of Narsis and the Shipal-Shin\nwilderness still remain to be populated. More than a dozen miscellaneous\nquests and several questlines have already been merged and a similar number is\nfinished pending review. But most of the questing load still lies ahead.\n\nNarsis Fighters Guild. Interior level design by RyanS and Mark, screenshot by\nOsidian.\n\nShould they be completed prior to when Grasping Fortune is released, several\nadditions to the expansion\u2019s core content also may be included, such as:\n\n  * Foul Murder \u2013 our short epilogue to Morrowind\u2019s main quest, starting in Necrom. The questline is already merged into our main in-development plugin, but is currently disabled by default until we get a creature model which the questline sorely needs.\n\nBetter bring some area-of-effect weapons with you to Firemoth. Exterior level\ndesign by Selengor and Chef, quests by Evil Eye, screenshot by Taniquetil.\n\n  * Firemoth Rekindled \u2013 our revamp of the 2002 official mod \u201cSiege of Firemoth,\u201d which now includes an Imperial Legion questline to rebuild the fortress, in addition to an all-around overhaul and improvement of the original level and quest design. This revamp is now officially ready to go and you may, in fact, see it released even before Grasping Fortune.\n\n  * Telvannis Stopgap \u2013 finalization of our old 00s-era Telvanni content by the addition of new questlines to Master Vaerin, Mistress Rathra, and a final quest involving Master Dral \u2013 all now complete. A stretch goal is to include an endcap to the Ranyon-Ruhn Temple questline, for which two new interior locations were recently finished. Eventually, these new questlines may be significantly revamped or superseded, once our Grand Telvannis Redo starts in many years\u2019 time. But in the meanwhile, they will hopefully tide Telvanni fans over.\n\nA teaser for some potential far northern Tamriel Rebuilt content, by\nTaniquetil.\n\n  * Leviathan Isles \u2013 a small archipelago to the north of Sheogorad host to a ruined Imperial fort, Nord barrow, and more. The archipelago is intended to play a small part in a couple of province-spanning questlines. The exterior and interior locations are finished, but quests still need to be added.\n\n  * Old Ebonheart Melee Tournament \u2013 a complex scripting marvel of a questline (made only with all-natural, non-GMO MWscript) that has you participating in a full-blown melee tournament steeped in inter-provincial politics. Marhaus has finished most of the scripting work, but much remains to be done, owing to the questline\u2019s complexity.\n\nA new dreugh citadel in the cursed Nolubal Bay west of Bal Oyra. Exterior\nlevel design by Silvone.\n\n  * Northeastern Morrowind Dreugh Citadels \u2013 making use of the new dreugh tileset released with the Andaram expansion last year, three new dreugh citadels and several grottos will be added to fully flesh out the underwater portion of our 2022 Embers of Empire expansion. Exterior work on these is finished, pending review.\n\n  * Vounoura \u2013 a shrouded island to the north of Telvannis, related to the Morag Tong. The island, its interiors, and a brand-new Daedric lord quest has been finished (the latter complete with elusive new TES III voice acting!). Some more quests involving the location remain to be made, as does a follow-on to vanilla Morag Tong content.\n\nThe abandoned Tel Inan stands lonely on the island of Olanar. Exterior level\ndesign by Cicero.\n\n  * Olanar \u2013 an island far to the southeast of Port Telvannis host to a long-abandoned Telvanni tower and rumored to hide a legendary treasure. The island\u2019s exterior and most interiors have been finished for a while, but we are waiting on some Maormer (!) assets to be finished, prior to quest work starting.\n\nAll of the above items are, again, not core parts of the expansion and may get\nbundled with following expansions, should they not materialize in time.\n\nWhile our main effort remains focused on Grasping Fortune, we have in recent\nyears kept going a side-effort to rework some of our oldest and least engaging\nareas, now called Poison Song.\n\nPoison Song will revamp our old Sundered Scar region, but may tentatively also\ninclude some entirely new lands in the new Orethan region, including the town\nof Othrenis and the chapel of Nanaav, and, finally, our first three questlines\nfor House Indoril.\n\nA birds-eye view of the playable area to be added or revamped in Poison Song.\nThe gray-hued area in the north is the redone Sundered Scar region, where most\nof the exterior worldspace is finished. The green area in a half-arch around\nthe city of Almalexia is the currently work-in-progress Orethan region, an\narea wholly new to the mod. The inset on the top left shows the location on a\nmap of all of Morrowind.\n\nThis expansion is the second of our \u201credo\u201d releases, where we touch up older\nareas of the mod that don\u2019t quite hold up to our current worldbuilding vision\nand quality standards. (The first being 2022\u2019s acclaimed Embers of Empire,\nwhich revamped Telvannis\u2019 western seaboard and the Imperial cities and towns\ntherein.)\n\nThe Sundered Scar wilderness. Exterior level design by pralec and Quit.\n\nThe Sundered Scar region, the expansion\u2019s main focus, lies directly east of\nOld Ebonheart on the mainland coast of the Inner Sea (roughly south of Molag\nAmur in the vanilla game). This region is currently a clone of the vanilla\ngame\u2019s Bitter Coast region with a grand total of three minor quests taking\nplace there. Although originally released in 2012 as part of the Sacred East\nexpansion, its landscapes largely date to 2003, when much of the area was\nexplicitly made as \u201cfiller content.\u201d\n\nThe town of Marog in the new Sundered Scar. Exterior level design by pralec,\nscreenshot by LogansGun.\n\nSeeking to make this area worthwhile, we have retooled the Sundered Scar into\na dangerous wasteland of geysers, sulfuric hot springs, and weird tube-fauna,\ninspired by Bethesda\u2019s scrapped concepts for a Great Scathes region on\nVvardenfell, which was left largely unimplemented in the vanilla game.\n\nThe new caravanserai by Quit which will replace the old Inn Between.\n\nOnce the heartlands of House Mora, from which Nerevar hailed, the region was\nripped asunder during the cataclysm that created the Inner Sea at the end of\nthe War of the First Council, the ground underneath the land coming to a boil.\nAlthough ostensibly governed by the Indoril, this area has been left largely\nvacant in remembrance of the slain Hortator. Only small townsteads, the\nforemost of them being the trade town of Darvonis, dot the region. Most of it\nremains dangerous wilderness filled with the ruins of Morrowind\u2019s past\nglories. An exception is the lush island of Gorne in Azura Bay (known from the\nvanilla Morrowind book \u201cThe Poison Song\u201d), which hosts an isolated chapel of\nHouse Indoril.\n\nThe lush island of Gorne off the Vvardenfell coast. Exterior level design by\nCicero.\n\nTentatively, we may also include a small-ish part of our new Orethan region in\nPoison Song, just to the south of Sundered Scar. Realizing we had most of the\nneeded assets earlier this year, we decided to already kick off exterior\ndevelopment there. This fully new chunk of land surrounding the city of\nAlmalexia would make Poison Song no longer just a \u201credo,\u201d but a full-on \u201cdo.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental concept for the Orethan region by be-a-stranger.\n\nOur currently released mainland includes two old regions of the same name \u2013\nthe rather nondescript Alt Orethan and the lush forest of Lan Orethan \u2013 which\nwere first released in 2012. Although the latter is quite lovely in its own\nway, our new concepts for House Indoril call for turning the area into a vast\ncentral breadbasket feeding the metropolis of Almalexia. After all, in\nBethesda\u2019s original 1996 concept, this part of Morrowind was host to the\nCentral (Deshaan) Plains, of which the Orethan region would form a part of.\n\nWork-in-progress Orethan landscape. More colourful land textures and flora are\nstill to be added. Exterior level design by Chef and/or Quit.\n\nBuilding off of the few environmental assets shown in TES III: Tribunal\u2019s\nMournhold, the new Orethan region will be a subtropical garden where\nAlmalexia\u2019s influence has sculpted the very land into the most perfect\nexpression of Indoril theocracy. Lush green vegetation is accented by many\ncolorful flowers and fruit trees. Peaceful Velothi villages tend to bountiful\nfields irrigated by the meandering tributaries of the Orethan.\n\nThe heavily work-in-progress town of Othrenis. Exterior level design by Quit.\n\nThe central settlement in the particular slice of the Orethan coming with\nPoison Song is Othrenis. This is a wealthy trade town on Veloth\u2019s Path that\nincludes a popular pilgrimage temple in addition to saltrice depots and a\nbustling slave market frequented by House Dres traders. The town is ruled at a\ndistance from Nanaav, the airy and lovingly cultivated chapel of Indoril\nBeroth, who despite being an anti-Hlaalu warhawk is at personal odds with the\nsimilarly warlike Indoril Ilvi of Roa Dyr to the north (this is in contrast to\nBeroth\u2019s current depiction in the released mod, which shall change).\n\nThe heavily work-in-progress chapel of Nanaav. Exterior level design by Chef,\nnew architecture assets by Shivatheo.\n\nSo, how far along is Poison Song? Well, all except two Sundered Scar exterior\nclaims are finalized and most interior locations are either pending review or\nbeing worked on. The Orethan part, while smaller in scope, has only just\nstarted exterior development. Although enough assets are available for initial\nwork, we still need the final ground textures and pink gorapple trees that\nwill give the Orethan more color, as well as a variety of new flowers.\nTherefore, its possible that Sundered Scar will be done long before the\nOrethan; in that case, we will likely release the former separately.\n\nRegardless, once we do release the new Orethan chunk, we will finally be able\nto offer our players the first three questlines for House Indoril. As for\nother quests, Poison Song won\u2019t be rich in Imperial guilds, but expect at\nleast Temple and Morag Tong questlines in Darvonis and Othrenis, as well as a\nton of miscellaneous quests throughout the wilderness areas and the smaller\nsettlements.\n\nThe landscape around the town of Bodrum has recently been cleaned up by\nPhenoix12 and Mothpot.\n\nFinally, Poison Song will help us tie up some loose ends from our past\nreleases. As is well-known, we weren\u2019t quite 100% satisfied with the exterior\nand interior level design in our 2022\u2019s Dominions of Dust expansion \u2013 much of\nthe area had been in development since 2009, way before our current quality\nand consistency standards were in place. Therefore, a touch-up of the exterior\nlandscaping in the Roth Roryn region is ongoing (which may also touch the\nArmun Ashlands region), and we are well on our way to revamping or remaking\nmany of the corresponding interiors \u2013 work we hope to release together with\nPoison Song.\n\nA sketch of a possible new Armun Ashlands colour palette by be-a-stranger.\n\nComing right after Grasping Fortune in our main line of expansions is Wealth\nBeyond Measure, another massive release that will round out the remaining part\nof southwestern Morrowind.\n\nThe focus of this expansion will be the city of Kragenmoor, House Hlaalu\u2019s\nsecond most important settlement and, certainly, the most imperialized native\ncity of Morrowind. Stretching from Kragenmoor all the way to Lake Coronati is\nthe bulk of the lush and alien Othreleth Woods region, much of it filled with\nHlaalu towns, agriculture, and industry. Running parallel to it is the wild\nnorthern spur of the Shipal-Shin canyonlands, the border between Morrowind and\nCyrodiil, which transition into the Velothi Mountains just west of Kragenmoor.\n\nA birds-eye view of the playable area to be added in Wealth Beyond Measure.\nThe yellow area is the Othreleth Woods region and the red area underneath the\nnorthern spur of Shipal-Shin. In the northwest, Shipal-Shin transitions into\nthe greenish-gray Velothi Mountains. Most of the exterior worldspace is\nfinalized (although largely un-reviewed), with a few conspicuous areas still\nworks in progress. The inset on the top right shows the location on a map of\nall of Morrowind.\n\nKragenmoor is an up-and-coming power center for House Hlaalu, though not\nexactly one to rival Narsis. Built on the ruins of what was once the heartland\nof the Kragen dwarves, then later a Redoran stronghold, the city now sits\nastride the busiest trade route between Morrowind and Cyrodiil, and is full of\nHlaalu and outlander nouveau riche with their ostentatious mega-mansions.\nImperial influence runs strong here; it\u2019s where we find one of the most\nimportant East Empire Company halls and the center of Morrowind\u2019s Imperial\nCult, complete with two different chapels to Imperial Divines. Still, the city\nremains just as important to the Tribunal Temple, as it\u2019s where Veloth\u2019s Path\nreally starts.\n\nThe work-in-progress city of Kragenmoor by Nemon and Chef.\n\nBesides Kragenmoor, numerous other Hlaalu settlements dot the Othreleth Woods.\nThe foremost among these is Andrethis, a bustling Balmora-sized industry town\nthat is also one of the least imperialized Hlaalu settlements. Besides the\nother towns, villages, plantations, and mines, ruins of the once-great Redoran\nWaters March dot the region. Beyond them, in the deep woods await poisonous\nflora, carnivorous mushrooms, and dangerous predators \u2013 few dare venture far\nfrom roads in the Othreleth Woods.\n\nA piece of the Othreleth Woods. Exterior level design by Phenoix12, screenshot\nby shivatheo.\n\nBesides that, you will see more of the wild west of Shipal-Shin, where a\ncouple more Shinathi clans make their nomadic living, rubbing shoulders with\noutcasts, smugglers, and the occasional Hlaalu outpost. To the west of\nKragenmoor is the southernmost part of the Velothi Mountains, now sporting a\nbrand-new asset palette (compared to the slightly northern part of the region\nreleased in 2022, which relied mostly on vanilla Morrowind assets, and which\nwill get repainted in parallel). There you will find Shadowgate pass,\nMorrowind\u2019s busiest crossing into Cyrodiil, as well as the remains of the\nonce-great Kragen dwarves, the antecedents of the Rourken Dwemer who emigrated\nto Hammerfell and built up a civilization there, prior to their disappearance.\n\nThe northwestern end of Shipal-Shin near the town of Salvelis. Exterior level\ndesign by Phenoix12.\n\nWealth Beyond Measure will complete our House Hlaalu lands and will therefore\nallow us to implement our first full, end-game faction questline. This will be\na high-stakes affair that involves locations and actors all across the\nmainland and Vvardenfell. In fact, we will aim to integrate the whole vanilla\nHouse Hlaalu quest cycle seamlessly into the larger questline \u2013 of course,\nthis will mean substantial edits to the vanilla game, which likely means we\u2019ll\nmake it optional. Expect also a new House Hlaalu stronghold on the mainland!\nOtherwise, the questing scope is shaping up to be quite similar to Grasping\nFortune, as we will need two questlines for a number of vanilla factions,\nalong with innumerable miscellaneous quests.\n\nDwemer ruins litter the Velothi Mountains. Exterior level design by LogansGun.\n\nProgress on this expansion is quite promising, as most parts of the exterior\nworldspace have been finished or are already far into development. In\nparticular, the city of Kragenmoor is mostly built, but will get a small\nreduction from its previously bloated size. About a third of the landmass has\nalso been reviewed, allowing interior work to proceed. Many dozens of such\nlocations are already finished.\n\nThe newest area in Tamriel Rebuilt to come into active development is the\nsouthern part of Velothis District, i.e. the lands of House Redoran. This\nfirst, as-of-yet unnamed Redoran release will comprise the southern half of\nRedoran lands consisting of two wholly new, unique regions: the Clambering\nMoor and the Grey Meadows. In those regions lie the important March capitals\nof Veranis and Silgrad, but most of the surrounding lands are relatively\nsparsely inhabited, threatened by both Orc and Nord raids. A highlight of its\nown will be Malahk-Bazul, an isolated mountain valley home of the particularly\nnasty Malahk Orcs.\n\nA birds-eye view of the playable area to be added in the first House Redoran\nexpansion. Exterior work has just only started on the Clambering Moor region\nin the south of the area and the greenish Velothi Mountains to its west. The\nGrey Meadows region to its north remains all default-brown heightmap, as it\nrequires new assets to be made before exterior worldspaces can be created. The\ninset on the top left shows the location on a map of all of Morrowind.\n\nLong-time Tamriel Rebuilt fans may remember that we already completed most of\nthe Redoran lands between 2010 and 2013; these were present in our old, now-\ndeprecated TR_Preview plugin, which you may have played. However, while\ngenerally enjoyable, those exteriors mostly relied on vanilla assets and came\nwith a whole host of subtle design issues common to our work in the early-to-\nmid 2010s. All-in-all, the experience of recent years (cough Dominions of Dust\ncough) makes it clear that it is much more fruitful to approach new lands as a\nclean slate with a strong starting concept and a fully unique asset palette \u2013\nwhich is what we are now doing.\n\nA scene in the Clambering Moor. Work-in-progress exterior level design by\nPickles, screenshot by shivatheo.\n\nThe Clambering Moor region directly abuts our released lands in the Roth\nRoryn. It is a crimson highland moor rolling down from the peaks of the\nVelothi Mountains towards the Inner Sea, dotted by sparse mushroom groves. The\narea is host to isolated Redoran farmsteads and outposts, Malahk Orc camps,\nDwemer ruins, and even Nord ruins from the First Nord Empire.\n\nThe city of Veranis, capital of Stones March. Exterior level design by Chef\nand Pickles.\n\nThe Clambering Moor forms the northern part of the Redoran Stones March, one\nof the five marches that comprise the territory of the House. Its capital is\nthe well-fortified Veranis, sitting astride the Roryn river in a narrow valley\nand designed to deter and repel the Malahk Orcs. It, and by extension the\nwhole March, is home to a proud stoneworking and mining tradition but also\nincludes the full complement of vanilla Imperial guilds. Besides Veranis,\nseveral smaller villages eke out a living in the region, mostly relying on\nmining and ranching.\n\nThe Clambering Moor transitioning into the Velothi Mountains. Exterior level\ndesign by LogansGun.\n\nThe Grey Meadows region to the north of the Clambering Moor is a much harsher\nplace, an eerie bog subject to strong ashfall from Vvardenfell and full of\nstrange webs and poisonous spores.\n\nGrey Meadows concept art by be-a-stranger.\n\nThe Grey Meadows were the darling of 2010s Tamriel Rebuilt, being the first\nregion built using mostly custom assets \u2013 and to great results. Although we\naim to recreate its look and atmosphere almost 1-to-1, the technical execution\nof the landscape suffers from several deep-seated issues common for the time,\nmaking it more fruitful to recreate from scratch.\n\nOld, ca 2011 implementation of Grey Meadows, which used to be in our\nTR_Preview plugin. Screenshot by saddboye.\n\nThe city of Silgrad (called Kogotel in our former planning) lies in the west\nend of the Grey Meadows and is the capital of the smaller Ashes March that\norganizes the Redoran holdings of the region. Like Veranis, it is a fortified\nstronghold built to last attacks from the Nords of the Rift. Ancient\nmechanisms devised by Sotha Sil keep the city safe from flooding and the\npoisonous vapors of the hinterland. Although a couple other Redoran villages\nbrave the region, only the Kushimmu ashlanders have really adapted to life in\nthe deep marsh.\n\nA small village of the Malahk Orcs in the valley of Malahk-Bazul. Exterior\nlevel design by Phenoix12.\n\nLying within Morrowind\u2019s borders only in the technical sense is Malahk-Bazul,\na high mountain valley on the tri-point between Morrowind, Cyrodiil, and\nSkyrim. This mountainous land is home to the eastern Malahk Orcs \u2013 those of\nthe Changed Folk who, according to legend, pursued the Chimer all the way to\nResdayn\u2019s borders in revenge for Trinimac\u2019s debasement by Boethiah. In any\ncase, the Malahk Orcs are much larger, meaner, and more aggressive than the\nmore common western Orcs; only fools dare enter their lands. Still, a high-\nlevel player may find many hidden treasures in this land seldom tread by\ncivilized folk. Just beware, the Orcs are far from the worst thing hiding in\nthe valley.\n\nThe gate to Cyrodiil stays closed for now. Exterior level design by Phenoix12.\n\nAfter a couple years spent slowly building up the asset base, we were able to\nopen the first exterior claims both in the Clambering Moor and the new parts\nof the Velothi Mountains just earlier this year. Our exterior level designers\ndove right in: most claims already have substantial progress made and a couple\nones are already finalized and awaiting review. As some required assets for\nthe Grey Meadows don\u2019t yet exist, we have not currently opened new exterior\nclaims there. But, hopefully, that won\u2019t be too far off either.\n\nWe are well aware that the landmass of this first Redoran release is rather\nhuge. However, with Redoran lands being generally less-settled than Hlaalu\nones, we suspect that the amount of work needed should be roughly comparable\nto that of our upcoming Hlaalu releases. Still, if the expansion becomes too\nbig of a bite to swallow at once, we\u2019ll likely split the Grey Meadows region\ninto its own, later release.\n\nThe above Redoran work concludes the expansions that we are actively\nimplementing. However, let\u2019s go over some more mature plans for regions to be\nworked on in the future.\n\nLeft: concept for Mephalan Vales forests by athcliath97. Right: concept for a\nrevamped Akamora in the Mephalan Vales by be-a-stranger. The latter is a\nlittle outdated, as the chapel will now use the Indoril (a.k.a. Old Mournhold)\narchitecture set.\n\nFollowing Poison Song, the next of our old regions up for redo is the Mephalan\nVales, a tangle of fog-shrouded canyons that forms the northern border of\nIndoril lands. This was really the first wholly new, coordinated regional\nconcept that Tamriel Rebuilt attempted to build starting in 2006. The core\nidea remains solid, but its over-reliance on cobbled-together rock objects at\nthe expense of the landscape mesh introduces a lot of \u201cmoddiness\u201d and poor\nnavigability. Besides, we now have the opportunity to give the region a slate\nof unique environmental assets.\n\nChef testing out some of the new regional assets for the Mephalan Vales by\nshivatheo.\n\nThe new conception of the Mephalan Vales consists of labyrinthine ridges of\nsharp purple cliffs, this being implied to be the region from where the rock\nfor Morrowind\u2019s many Daedric ruins was quarried from. Between the cliffs lie\ndeep, canopied valleys blanketed in perpetual fog and home to a variety of\nless and more dangerous native spiders. Several Velothi villages and the town\nof Akamora specialize in handicrafts, especially the lucrative spider silk\ntrade.\n\nA variety of work-in-progress Mephalan Vales spider and spider-daedra meshes\nby Cameron (first three on the left) and Lamb Shark a.k.a. Sandaron (right).\n\nShivatheo recently completed most of the environmental assets \u2013 land textures,\nrocks, cliffs, trees, smaller flora \u2013 needed for an initial implementation of\nthe exterior landscape. For implementation to begin, however, we still need to\ncomplete the new regional heightmap.\n\nConcepts for the region of Nedothril (left) and the city of Mervayan (right)\nby be-a-stranger.\n\nAfter Mephalan Vales, the remaining parts of the Indoril lands will also need\nrevamps, although it is uncertain in which order that will happen. A new\nregional concept exists for the Nedothril coast, east of the Orethan region,\nwhich is to become a coastline of porous rock formations jutting out from the\nmudflats of eastern Morrowind. Nedothril will host a major city in the Velothi\ntileset, Mervayan, the Indorils\u2019 main trade port on the Padomaic Ocean.\nLikewise, the Sacred Lands region surrounding Necrom will become a golden\ngrassland full of ominous fungi. Necrom itself will also require a full\noverhaul, given its lack of quest content and dated architecture meshes.\n\nSacred Lands concepts by be-a-stranger. Left: Necrom, right: Fort Umbermoth.\n\nThe final boss of our Indoril content will, of course, be the city of\nAlmalexia, the biggest in all of Morrowind. Although we have long stated that\nwe seek to develop Almalexia dead last in the project, this was mainly a\nreaction to the previous failed attempt at creating the city in 2011-2014 \u2013 an\nevent that nearly led to the demise of the entire mod project. Our volunteer\ndeveloper-base is constantly rotating, however, and most of the people that\nlived through that particular trauma have moved on. With the experience of\nNarsis under our belts, we are newly confident that the project can take\nAlmalexia on once again, in the sooner-rather-than-later future, especially\nnow that pretty much everyone is happy with be-a-stranger\u2019s new concept for\nthe city. This will likely be a years-long background burner project.\n\nConcepts for the city of Almalexia by be-a-stranger.\n\nOur main line of expansions will, in the meanwhile, continue finishing up\nRedoran lands. After the first, currently in-development expansion, the next\none will hopefully round out the rest of our Redoran lands. Half of it will\nconsist of the Julan-Shar region, a relatively lush, if frigid, conifer forest\nmarked by hydrothermal activity. Travertine terraces, geysers, and smoke-\nbillowing mushrooms are common. The focus of this region will be the city of\nBlacklight, capital of House Redoran. The city will be heavily inspired by\nScamp\u2019s legendary 2011 implementation that graced the old TR_Preview plugin,\nbut much expanded in footprint and remade using purpose-built assets in order\nto alleviate the performance and stylistic concerns that the former suffered\nfrom.\n\nCompared to the old TR_Preview depiction, Julan-Shar will also be expanded far\ntowards the north and northwest to provide more content and bring the shape of\nMorrowind\u2019s landmass closer to the depictions found in in-game books and\nBethesda\u2019s pre-release concept maps. This will eventually require us to move\nSolstheim to the northeast (as the popular mods Anthology Solstheim and Tomb\nof the Snow Prince already do), but this is years into the future.\n\nEnvironmental concept for the Julan-Shar region by Feivelyn (left) and the\ncity of Blacklight by be-a-stranger (right).\n\nThe Great Valley region to the west of Blacklight will be a steep glacial\nvalley cut into a spur of the Velothi Mountains. Agriculture is difficult in\nthis snowy landscape, but the scarce herding grounds on the valley floor form\nthe locus of conflict between the ancient Nord diaspora, for whom the area is\nproperly called the Nordic hold of Uld Vraech, and the Redoran, to whom Tiber\nSeptim granted control of the region.\n\nEnvironmental concept for the Great Valley region by be-a-stranger.\n\nFollowing the Redoran lands, our plan is to finally swing over to the\nsoutheastern Deshaan District, the lands of House Dres. A proper start on this\nfront seems ever distant, but what has recently happened is a large-scale\nreconceptualization of House Dres. 2010s planning tended to make the Dres\noverly exceptional, having them be worshippers of the Anticipations instead of\nthe Tribunal (in conflict with one of the few vanilla Morrowind dialogue lines\non House Dres that states they are staunch Temple supporters) and suggesting\nthat their material culture and social structure be wholly separate from that\nof the other Houses. Recently, we have toned this exceptionalism down a notch,\nending up at a happy medium where we hope the faction will be easier to\nimplement and integrate better into the TES III game world while still\noffering much that is novel. A new book by Douglas Goodall on the Dres has\nhelped much in this regard.\n\nThe new regional setup for the Deshaan District shown on a cut-out of our\nplanning map (added by Taniquetil). The region names are not yet final.\n\nA big change has occurred in the Deshaan District\u2019s region setup, too.\nPreviously, most Dres lands were to consist of a salt desert that was\ncultivated into a saltrice breadbasket only by virtue of slave-powered Dres\nengineering that brought up water from deep aquifers. While this was a cool\nconcept, it did not really fit the spirit of the few TES-III-era in-game and\nout-of-game mentions and depictions of Dres lands. Hence, while the salt\ndesert will be retained, it will form only the western portion of Dres lands\nagainst the Shipal-Shin region, with the Deshaan Plains proper becoming a more\nnaturally bountiful grassland. A new volcanic highlands region will separate\nthe plains from the unchanged Arnesian jungles to the south.\n\nWork-in-progress Dres architecture tileset by Athcliath97.\n\nWhat\u2019s very promising is that Athcliath97 continues to make great progress on\nour n-th attempt at a House Dres architecture set, something that countless\nasset developers have struggled with over more than two decades. Having\nabandoned the ever-troublesome modular canton concept for bespoke canton\nmodels made specifically for a couple cities, this latest iteration is\ncertainly the best yet and has gotten the farthest in terms of completion \u2013\neven the interior set is now being worked on!\n\nEnvironmental concept art for new Telvannis regions by Feivelyn. Left: the dry\nand dusty Dagon Urul in the northwestern tip of the Telvanni peninsula. Right:\nthe sadrith-covered Telvanni Isles to the east of the peninsula.\n\nFor now, the final stretch goal of Tamriel Rebuilt will be an eventual rework\nof our House Telvanni lands. These were completed already in 2008, when we\ndidn\u2019t have the ability to create substantial amounts of new 3D assets. Hence,\nTelvannis is at once the most complete part of the mod, but also among the\nmod\u2019s biggest let-downs, as it merely recycles vanilla Morrowind\u2019s region\nconcepts and assets. A great new concept for Telvannis exists, but is\ncurrently awaiting its turn until we complete the rework of our Indoril lands.\n\nEnvironmental concept art for new Telvannis regions by Feivelyn. Left: the\nunholy forest of Sunad Mora on the eastern coast of the Telvanni peninsula.\nRight: the rocky and picturesque Scath Anud region in the far southwest of\nTelvannis.\n\nAs you can see, quite a lot remains to be done in Morrowind, but many hands\nmake light work! If you appreciate Tamriel Rebuilt and would like to help us\nrealize our vision sooner, please consider joining the project as a developer.\nIt\u2019s famously easy to get started with TES III modding and our community\nguides and developer feedback provide all the help you need. Most of our\ndevelopers had no modding or game development experience before deciding to\njoin us.\n\nRegardless, make sure to also come chat on our Discord server, where we\ndevelop the mod in the open and where we also host much more frequently\nupdated progress reports. Til next time!\n\n## Comments\n\n### Magnificent Preview\n\nby WellTemperedClavier on Sun, 2024-04-28 17:30\n\nThis all looks amazing! And I know it's in the best possible hands.\n\n### Long time no see\n\nby Toma400 on Mon, 2024-04-29 10:32\n\nClavier! So happy to see you here, still following PTR <3 Not sure if you\nremember me from over a year ago, but I recall you motivating me to join\nquestdeving :D haven't done quest showcase yet, but I joined the project other\nway! Miss seeing you on PT server, but I assume you have some good reasons to\nbe on hiatus. Either way, I wish you all the best, and if you ever want to\ncome back, I'm sure you will be welcomed warmly ^^\n\n### Community\n\n  * Forum\n  * Discord\n  * Matrix\n  * Search\n\n### User\n\n  * Profile\n  * Messages\n  * Bookmarks\n  * Watchlist\n\n### Development\n\n  * Dashboard\n  * Claims Browser\n  * Asset Browser\n  * Bugtracker\n  * Tamriel Data\n  * Name Generator\n\n### About\n\n  * Introduction\n  * Joining TR\n  * Frequently Asked Questions\n  * Handbook\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nThe content of this site is \u00a9 by the Tamriel Rebuilt community.
