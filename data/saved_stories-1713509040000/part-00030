Despite its importance, replication\nefforts are few and far between in psychological science with many attempts\nfailing to corroborate past findings. This scarcity, compounded by the\ndifficulty in accessing replication data, jeopardizes the efficient allocation\nof research resources and impedes scientific advancement. Addressing this\ncrucial gap, we present the Replication Database\n(https://metaanalyses.shinyapps.io/replicationdatabase/), a novel platform\nhosting 1,239 original findings paired with replication findings. The\ninfrastructure of this database allows researchers to submit, access, and\nengage with replication findings. The database makes replications visible,\neasily findable via a graphical user interface, and tracks replication rates\nacross various factors, such as publication year or journal. This will\nfacilitate future efforts to evaluate the robustness of psychological\nresearch.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\n* R\u00f6seler, Lukas & Kaiser, Leonard & Doetsch, Christopher Albert & Klett, Noah & Seida, Christian & Sch\u00fctz, Astrid & Aczel, Balazs & Adelina, Nadia & Agostini, Valeria & Alarie, Samuel, 2024. \"The Replication Database: Documenting the Replicability of Psychological Science,\" MetaArXiv me2ub, Center for Open Science.\n\nHandle: RePEc:osf:metaar:me2ub DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/me2ub\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n## More about this item\n\n### Statistics\n\nAccess and download statistics\n\n## Corrections\n\nAll material on this site has been provided by the respective publishers and\nauthors.
