As Professor Heidi\nHurd aptly said, consent works \u201cmoral magic\u201d \u2013 it transforms things that would\nbe illegal and immoral into lawful and legitimate activities. As to privacy,\nconsent authorizes and legitimizes a wide range of data collection and\nprocessing.\n\nThere are generally two approaches to consent in privacy law. In the United\nStates, the notice-and-choice approach predominates; organizations post a\nnotice of their privacy practices and people are deemed to consent if they\ncontinue to do business with the organization or fail to opt out. In the\nEuropean Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) uses the express\nconsent approach, where people must voluntarily and affirmatively consent.\n\nBoth approaches fail. The evidence of actual consent is non-existent under the\nnotice-and-choice approach. Individuals are often pressured or manipulated,\nundermining the validity of their consent. The express consent approach also\nsuffers from these problems \u2013 people are ill-equipped to decide about their\nprivacy, and even experts cannot fully understand what algorithms will do with\npersonal data. Express consent also is highly impractical; it inundates\nindividuals with consent requests from thousands of organizations. Express\nconsent cannot scale.\n\nIn this Article, I contend that most of the time, privacy consent is\nfictitious. Privacy law should take a new approach to consent that I call\n\u201cmurky consent.\u201d Traditionally, consent has been binary \u2013 an on/off switch \u2013\nbut murky consent exists in the shadowy middle ground between full consent and\nno consent. Murky consent embraces the fact that consent in privacy is largely\na set of fictions and is at best highly dubious.\n\nBecause it conceptualizes consent as mostly fictional, murky consent\nrecognizes its lack of legitimacy. To return to Hurd\u2019s analogy, murky consent\nis consent without magic. Rather than provide extensive legitimacy and power,\nmurky consent should authorize only a very restricted and weak license to use\ndata. Murky consent should be subject to extensive regulatory oversight with\nan ever-present risk that it could be deemed invalid. Murky consent should\nrest on shaky ground. Because the law pretends people are consenting, the\nlaw\u2019s goal should be to ensure that what people are consenting to is good.\nDoing so promotes the integrity of the fictions of consent. I propose four\nduties to achieve this end: (1) duty to obtain consent appropriately; (2) duty\nto avoid thwarting reasonable expectations; (3) duty of loyalty; and (4) duty\nto avoid unreasonable risk. The law can\u2019t make the tale of privacy consent\nless fictional, but with these duties, the law can ensure the story ends well.\n\nKeywords: Privacy, Consent, Notice and Choice, Contracts, GDPR, CCPA\n\nJEL Classification: K10, K12\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nSolove, Daniel J., Murky Consent: An Approach to the Fictions of Consent in\nPrivacy Law (August 20, 2023). 104 Boston University Law Review 593 (2024),\nGWU Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2023-23, GWU Law School Public Law\nResearch Paper No. 2023-23, Available at SSRN:\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=4333743 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4333743\n\n### Daniel J.
