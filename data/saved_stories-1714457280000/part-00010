The 17th century English playwright Shackerley\nMarmion made good use of violable in A Fine Companion, writing, \"Alas, my\nheart is Tender and violable with the least weapon Sorrow can dart at me.\" But\nEnglish speakers have never warmed up to that word the way we have to\ninviolable, and it continues to be used much less frequently. Both terms\ndescend from the Latin verb violare, which both shares the meaning with, and\nis an ancestor of, the English word violate.\n\n## Test Your Vocabulary with M-W Quizzes\n\nName That Flower\n\nPlay Now\n\n12-Letter Words Quiz\n\nPlay Now\n\nChallenging Standardized Test Words Vol. 3\n\nPlay Now\n\n13-Letter Word Quiz\n\nPlay Now\n\nWhat Did You Just Call Me?\n\nPlay Now\n\nGuess the Curious Origins of These Everyday Words\n\nPlay Now\n\nName That Flower\n\nPlay Now\n\n12-Letter Words Quiz\n\nPlay Now\n\nChallenging Standardized Test Words Vol. 3\n\nPlay Now\n\n13-Letter Word Quiz\n\nPlay Now\n\nWhat Did You Just Call Me?\n\nPlay Now\n\nGuess the Curious Origins of These Everyday Words\n\nPlay Now\n\nName That Flower\n\nPlay Now\n\n12-Letter Words Quiz\n\nPlay Now\n\nChallenging Standardized Test Words Vol. 3\n\nPlay Now\n\n## Name That Synonym\n\nFill in the blanks to create a synonym of inviolable: _ a c _ _ s _ _ c t.\n\nVIEW THE ANSWER\n\n## Podcast\n\n  * Share\n\n    * Share\n\n  * Subscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n    * Amazon Music\n    * Apple Podcasts\n    * CastBox\n    * Google Podcasts\n    * iHeartRadio\n    * Pocket Casts\n    * RadioPublic\n    * Spotify\n    * Stitcher\n    * TuneIn\n    * RSS\n\n  * Download\n  * Description\n\n\u00d7\n\nAdvertising 0 / 0\n\n|\n\n00:00 / 00:00\n\n| Skip\n\nListen on\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n<iframe> Player Code\n\nEmbed this player on your website using the snippet below\n\n## More Words of the Day\n\n  * #### Apr 28\n\n## ken\n\n  * #### Apr 27\n\n## assail\n\n  * #### Apr 26\n\n## homage\n\n  * #### Apr 25\n\n## tendentious\n\n  * #### Apr 24\n\n## burgeon\n\n  * #### Apr 23\n\n## exodus\n\nSEE ALL WORDS OF THE DAY\n\n### Can you solve 4 words at once?\n\n### Can you solve 4 words at once?\n\nLove words?
