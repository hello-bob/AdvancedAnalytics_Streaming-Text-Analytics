The\nprotection scheme was exposed in 2022 when Russian authorities arrested six\nmembers of the group, which sold millions of stolen payment cards at flashy\nonline shops like Trump\u2019s Dumps.\n\nA now-defunct carding shop that sold stolen credit cards and invoked 45\u2019s\nlikeness and name.\n\nAs reported by The Record, a Russian court last week sentenced former FSB\nofficer Grigory Tsaregorodtsev for taking a $1.7 million bribe from a\ncybercriminal group that was seeking a \u201croof,\u201d a well-placed, corrupt law\nenforcement official who could be counted on to both disregard their illegal\nhacking activities and run interference with authorities in the event of their\narrest.\n\nTsaregorodtsev was head of the counterintelligence department for a division\nof the FSB based in Perm, Russia. In February 2022, Russian authorities\narrested six men in the Perm region accused of selling stolen payment card\ndata. They also seized multiple carding shops run by the gang, including Ferum\nShop, Sky-Fraud, and Trump\u2019s Dumps, a popular fraud store that invoked the\n45th president\u2019s likeness and promised to \u201cmake credit card fraud great\nagain.\u201d\n\nAll of the domains seized in that raid were registered by an IT consulting\ncompany in Perm called Get-net LLC, which was owned in part by Artem Zaitsev \u2014\none of the six men arrested. Zaitsev reportedly was a well-known programmer\nwhose company supplied services and leasing to the local FSB field office.\n\nThe message for Trump\u2019s Dumps users left behind by Russian authorities that\nseized the domain in 2022.\n\nRussian news sites report that Internal Affairs officials with the FSB grew\nsuspicious when Tsaregorodtsev became a little too interested in the case\nfollowing the hacking group\u2019s arrests. The former FSB agent had reportedly\nassured the hackers he could have their case transferred and that they would\nsoon be free.\n\nBut when that promised freedom didn\u2019t materialize, four the of the defendants\npulled the walls down on the scheme and brought down their own roof. The FSB\narrested Tsaregorodtsev, and seized $154,000 in cash, 100 gold bars, real\nestate and expensive cars.\n\nAt Tsaregorodtsev\u2019s trial, his lawyers argued that their client wasn\u2019t guilty\nof bribery per se, but that he did admit to fraud because he was ultimately\nunable to fully perform the services for which he\u2019d been hired.\n\nThe Russian news outlet Kommersant reports that all four of those who\ncooperated were released with probation or correctional labor. Zaitsev\nreceived a sentence of 3.5 years in prison, and defendant Alexander Kovalev\ngot four years.\n\nIn 2017, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Trump\u2019s Dumps, and found the contact address\nlisted on the site was tied to an email address used to register more than a\ndozen domains that were made to look like legitimate Javascript calls many\ne-commerce sites routinely make to process transactions \u2014 such as \u201cjs-\nlink[dot]su,\u201d \u201cjs-stat[dot]su,\u201d and \u201cjs-mod[dot]su.\u201d\n\nSearching on those malicious domains revealed a 2016 report from RiskIQ, which\nshows the domains featured prominently in a series of hacking campaigns\nagainst e-commerce websites. According to RiskIQ, the attacks targeted online\nstores running outdated and unpatched versions of shopping cart software from\nMagento, Powerfront and OpenCart.\n\nThose shopping cart flaws allowed the crooks to install \u201cweb skimmers,\u201d\nmalicious Javascript used to steal credit card details and other information\nfrom payment forms on the checkout pages of vulnerable e-commerce sites. The\nstolen customer payment card details were then sold on sites like Trump\u2019s\nDumps and Sky-Fraud.\n\nThis entry was posted on Monday 22nd of April 2024 04:07 PM\n\nA Little Sunshine Ne'er-Do-Well News Web Fraud 2.0\n\nAlexander Kovalev Artem Zaitsev Federal Security Service (FSB) Ferum Shop Get-\nNet LLC Grigory Tsaregorodtsev Sky-Fraud Trump's-Dumps\n\n## 10 thoughts on \u201cRussian FSB Counterintelligence Chief Gets 9 Years in\nCybercrime Bribery Scheme\u201d\n\n  1. RWKOS April 22, 2024\n\nProbably prosecuted because he didn\u2019t a) pay tribute to, or b) arrange for a\ncut to go to Vlad, or c) group didn\u2019t cover tracks well and were causing\nheadaches, or d) some combo of a to c.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n    1. nemo April 23, 2024\n\nHm. Another theory: because they used the image and name of a Friend Of Putin\nfor their crimes...\n\nReply \u2192\n\n      1. J A April 24, 2024\n\nFor some reason Russian cybercriminals name their services after famous\nAmericans. There\u2019s also BidenCash.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  2. Bluz April 22, 2024\n\n\u201c At Tsaregorodtsev\u2019s trial, his lawyers argued that their client wasn\u2019t\nguilty of bribery per se, but that he did admit to fraud because he was\nultimately unable to fully perform the services for which he\u2019d been hired.\u201d\nWTF? very creative defense LOL\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  3. John April 23, 2024\n\nSo the Russian Federation actually goes after cybercriminals inside its\nterritory? I thought they were exempt provided they kept their crimes outside\nof the country.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  4. Sam on wheels April 23, 2024\n\nWhat a CORRUPT system, oh my goodness! The government employee gets 9 years\nbut the crooks and scum who ruined millions of lives get 1/3 of his sentence\njust for admitting that they convinced him to take a bribe ... disgusting Now\nevery criminal in Russia knows that if they have a bribe on the payroll they\ncan get a reduced sentence\n\nReply \u2192\n\n    1. Sarah Hirhyel Jatau April 24, 2024\n\nI was a little bit confused as to why Tsaregorodtsev got the longest jail term\n, but i believe to whom much is given much is expected. this was to serve as a\ndeterrent to those in the seat of power. a way to let them know that if this\ngoes south you have more to lose than those directly involved.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  5. Robert Campbell April 24, 2024\n\nAll 5 of the comments are just what the Dr. ordered. I find it Comical that\nnot one of these so called Cyber experts acknowledged the obvious. Name a\nsingle G7 Intelligence Agency that has convinced a senior officer let alone\nthe Chief of said Agency. The mess we are in will never be fixed because of\npeople like them.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  6. L Jean Camp April 24, 2024\n\n\u201d all four of those who cooperated were released with probation or\ncorrectional labor. \u201d I do not understand \u201creleased with correctional labor\u201d.\nI do not associate correctional labor in Russia with being released. Is that\ncommunity service?\n\nAlso, why is American law enforcement so cheap? His equivalent in the FBI sold\nout for a quarter of a million. https://apnews.com/article/charles-mcgonigal-\nguilty-cash-fbi-oleg-deripaska-76124ec7d63c53535194a7a9277dc795 for much more\nthan one case https://www.businessinsider.com/america-charles-mcgonigal-\nproblem-russia-kremlin-deripaska-fbi-sentencing-corruption-2023-12\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  7.
