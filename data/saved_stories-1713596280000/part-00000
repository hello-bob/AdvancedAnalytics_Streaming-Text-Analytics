LittleLink has more than 100 branded\nbutton styles you can easily use, with more regularly added by our community\nin this repo and in LittleLink Extended.\n\n### \ud83c\udf1e Themes and Accessibility\n\nLittleLink offers both light and dark themes right out of the box. If the\ndefault color schemes don't match your preference, you can easily customize\nthem by updating the values in skeleton-light.css or skeleton-dark.css. For\nthose who prefer an automatic adjustment, setting your CSS to skeleton-\nauto.css enables the theme to adapt based on the device's system settings. To\nenhance visual accessibility in both light and dark modes, buttons lacking\nsufficient contrast with the background are outlined with an inverse stroke to\nensure visibility. While LittleLink emphasizes accessibility, it's important\nto acknowledge that not all brands incorporated into LittleLink achieve this\nstandard. Branded buttons that come into LittleLink always retain the original\nessence of the brand and some branded buttons might fall short of optimal\naccessibility in terms of contrast.\n\n### \ud83e\udd47 Performance\n\nLittleLink epitomizes simplicity and minimalism. When evaluating the\nLittleLink sample page (which mirrors a typical LittleLink setup for an\nindividual) through tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights, showcases\nLittleLink's excellence with 100/100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best\nPractices, and SEO. My initial vision for LittleLink was to craft it from the\nfundamentals. I chose Skeleton as the foundation, enabling me to create\nsomething minimal and quick, removing the unnecessary bloat you would get from\nusing a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity.\n\n### \u2601\ufe0f Deploy\n\nNo need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work\u2014it uses the\nbare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with Vercel,\nNetlify, or Amplify using the button below. LittleLink is also easy to host\nthrough GitHub Pages or on your home lab server, CDN, or other frontend\nhosting services. To edit, all you need is a little basic HTML knowledge to\nadd a link to the exisiting buttons or you can create your own. See our adding\ncustom buttons to your own fork wiki. It's simple, promise. \ud83e\udd1e\n\n##### One-Click Deployments\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Contributions\n\nPlease reference the submitting a new brand to LittleLink wiki before opening\na PR.\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Community Extras\n\n#### \ud83d\udef8 LittleLink Extended\n\nLooking for more niche services to add to your copy of LittleLink?
