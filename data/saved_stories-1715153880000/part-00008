Now, thanks to new\nprocessor advances from Intel and AMD, it's about to get even more so.\n\nFortunately, you don't have to fend for yourself if you're shopping for a new\nIntel or AMD laptop with these new-fangled chips that claim to be heralding a\nnew era of AI PCs. It's not as complex as it might seem, at least as far as\nyou need to be concerned when looking to buy one of the best laptops on the\nmarket this year.\n\nI'm here to walk you through everything you need to know about these new\nneural processing units and how they're going to help you with a whole new\nrange of AI-accelerated tasks, from productivity to gaming.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n## What is an NPU?\n\n### What is an NPU?\n\nAn NPU, or Neural Processing Unit, is a dedicated processor or processing unit\non a larger SoC designed specifically for accelerating neural network\noperations and AI tasks. Unlike general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, NPUs are\noptimized for a data-driven parallel computing, making them highly efficient\nat processing massive multimedia data like videos and images and processing\ndata for neural networks. They are particularly adept at handling AI-related\ntasks, such as speech recognition, background blurring in video calls, and\nphoto or video editing processes like object detection.\n\nNPUs are integrated circuits but they differ from single-function ASICs\n(Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). While ASICs are designed for a\nsingular purpose (such as mining bitcoin), NPUs offer more complexity and\nflexibility, catering to the diverse demands of network computing. They\nachieve this through specialized programming in software or hardware, tailored\nto the unique requirements of neural network computations.\n\nFor most consumer products, the NPU will actually be integrated into the main\nCPU, as in the Intel Core and Core Ultra series or the new AMD Ryzen\n8040-series laptop processors. At larger data centers or more specialized\nindustrial operations, though, the NPU might be an entirely discrete processor\non the motherboard, separate from any other processing units.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n### NPU vs. GPU\n\nWhile many AI and machine learning workloads are run on GPUs, there is an\nimportant distinction between the GPU and NPU.\n\nWhile GPUs are known for their parallel computing capabilities, not all GPUs\nare good at doing so beyond processing graphics, as they require special\nintegrated circuits to effectively process machine learning workloads. The\nmost popular Nvidia GPUs have these circuits in the form of Tensor cores, but\nAMD and Intel have also integrated these circuits into their GPUs as well,\nmainly for handling resolution upscaling operations \u2014 a very common AI\nworkload.\n\nNPUs, meanwhile, simply take those circuits out of a GPU (which does a bunch\nof other operations) and make it a dedicated unit on its own. This allows it\nto more efficiently process AI-related tasks at a lower power level, making\nthem ideal for laptops, but also limits their potential for heavy-duty\nworkloads that will still likely require a GPU to run.\n\n### The role of NPUs in different systems\n\nNPUs are designed to complement the functions of CPUs and GPUs. While CPUs\nhandle a broad range of tasks and GPUs excel in rendering detailed graphics,\nNPUs specialize in executing AI-driven tasks swiftly. This specialization\nensures that no single processor gets overwhelmed, maintaining smooth\noperation across the system.\n\nFor instance, in video calls, an NPU can efficiently manage the task of\nblurring the background, freeing up the GPU to focus on more intensive tasks.\nSimilarly, in photo or video editing, NPUs can handle object detection and\nother AI-related processes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the workflow.\n\n## NPUs in PCs\n\nNPUs are becoming increasingly common in the PC and laptop domain. Intel's\nCore Ultra processors and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors are\nexamples where NPUs are integrated alongside CPUs and GPUs. These NPUs handle\nAI tasks faster, reducing the load on the other processors and leading to more\nefficient computer operations.\n\nQualcomm's NPU, for instance, can perform an impressive 75 Tera operations per\nsecond, showcasing its capability in handling generative AI imagery. This\ninclusion of NPUs in the latest generation of devices means that the industry\nis well-equipped to leverage the latest AI technologies, offering more AI-\nrelated conveniences and efficient processes for users.\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\n## NPUs in mobile devices\n\nIn smartphones, NPUs play a crucial role in AI computing and applications.\nHuawei was one of the first companies to integrate NPUs into smartphone CPUs,\nsignificantly enhancing AI arithmetic power and energy efficiency compared to\ntraditional CPUs and GPUs. Apple's Bionic mobile chips have leveraged NPUs for\ntasks like video stabilization, photo correction, and more.\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nNPUs also enhance the capabilities of devices in recognizing content in\nphotos, adjusting camera settings for optimal shots, creating bokeh effects in\nselfies, and aiding in AI-driven features like Bixby Vision on Samsung Galaxy\ndevices.\n\n## NPUs in other devices\n\nNPUs are becoming increasingly popular in a range of devices that\ntraditionally haven't had advanced processors, like TVs and cameras. But as\nevery electronic device becomes more and more of a computer in its own right,\nNPUs are finding their way into all sorts of devices around the home.\n\nIn TVs, for example, NPUs are used to upscale the resolution of older content\nto more modern 4K resolution. In cameras, NPUs can be used to produce image\nstabilization and quality improvement, as well as auto-focus, facial\nrecognition, and more.\n\nSmart home devices are also making use of NPUs to help process machine\nlearning on edge devices for voice recognition or security information that\nmany consumers won't want to be sent to a cloud data server for processing due\nto its sensitive nature.\n\n## The Future of NPUs\n\nAs we progress further into an increasingly AI-driven future, the growth of\nNPUs will only accelerate. With major players like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm\nintegrating NPUs into their latest processors, we are stepping into an era\nwhere AI processing is becoming more streamlined, efficient, and a whole lot\nmore ubiquitous.\n\nDevices equipped with NPUs will be able to perform AI tasks faster, leading to\nquicker data processing times and more convenience for users. Whether it's\nthrough faster video editing, advanced AI filters in applications, or\nefficient handling of AI tasks in smartphones, NPUs are paving the way for a\nsmarter, more efficient computing experience.\n\nIn the end, NPUs represent a significant leap forward in the world of AI and\nmachine learning at the consumer level. By specializing in neural network\noperations and AI tasks, NPUs alleviate the load on traditional CPUs and GPUs.\nThis leads to more efficient computing systems overall, but also provides\ndevelopers with a ready-made tool to leverage in new kinds of AI-driven\nsoftware, like live video editing or document drafting. In essence, whatever\ntask you're performing on your PC or mobile device, it's likely NPUs will\neventually play a role in how those tasks are processed.\n\nJohn Loeffler\n\nComponents Editor\n\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a\nprogrammer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in\nBrooklyn, NY.\n\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and\ntechnology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science,\nincluding industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general\nscience writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\n\nYou can find him online on Threads @johnloeffler.\n\nCurrently playing: Baldur's Gate 3 (just like everyone else).\n\nMore about cpu\n\nSome AMD Zen 2 CPUs finally get defenses against Zenbleed security flaw \u2013 and\nit\u2019s about time\n\nIntel\u2019s next-gen CPUs might confuse you with their names \u2013 but whatever Arrow\nLake is called, it\u2019ll face a tough fight against AMD Zen 5\n\nLatest\n\nRussian hackers target EU countries using a simple Microsoft Outlook security\nflaw\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nVPNs aren't invincible\u20145 things a VPN can't protect you from\n\nI rode the new Maeving RM1S \u2013 and it's the first truly convincing 125cc\nelectric motorbike I've tried\n\nI heard Magico\u2019s big new M7 speakers and now I cannot save $560k quick enough\n\nI ran an entire marathon with a Garmin, an Apple Watch and Strava \u2013 here are\nall the differences\n\nI'm a Star Wars expert \u2013 here are 3 things I want to see from Star Wars: The\nAcolyte\n\nHow does a data breach affect you and why should you care?\n\nVDI: What is it and why Virtual Desktop Infrastructure matter to businesses of\nall sizes\n\nMy Apple Watch's ear-splitting alarm went off in the gym \u2013 don't make the same\nmistake I did\n\nWhat is Vishing and how does it work?\n\nThink your robot vacuum is impressive?
