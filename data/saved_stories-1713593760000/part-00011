A UK-based\ncompany called Moolec says it has created genetically modified soya plants\nthat produce beans in which a quarter of the soluble proteins are pig\nproteins. It has named its plant \u201cPiggy Sooy\u201d.\n\nMoolec is also creating pea plants that contain beef proteins. It claims its\nproducts will be able to provide similar taste, texture and nutritional value\nas meat, but without the high costs associated with cultured meat.\n\nThe company won\u2019t yet say which pig genes have been added to soya to produce\nPiggy Sooy. \u201cAt this point, we can\u2019t disclose that, for intellectual property\nreasons,\u201d says Amit Dhingra at Moolec.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more:\n\nA factory will soon start making green food from air and electricity\n\nHowever, photos of Moolec\u2019s Piggy Sooy beans show they have a pinky-red tinge\ninside them (see picture, above). This means it is likely that one of the\nadded genes is for a protein with an iron-containing haem group such as\nmyoglobin. Myoglobin gives red meat its colour and also contributes to its\nflavour.\n\nImpossible Foods already adds a plant haeme protein called soy leghaemoglobin\nto its burgers to give them a more meat-like look and taste. Leghaemoglobin is\nnaturally found in the roots of soya plants, but to obtain enough, Impossible\nFoods manufactures it in genetically modified yeast.\n\n#### Sign up to our Fix the Planet newsletter\n\nGet a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month.\n\nSign up to newsletter\n\nAnother company called Motif produces beef myoglobin as an additive called\nHemani for meat substitutes. Motif began manufacturing it in modified yeast,\nbut plans to make it in modified maize to scale up production.\n\nDhingra says the added proteins in Piggy Sooy have been chosen to give the\nright \u201cfeel in the mouth\u201d after food is cooked, but wouldn\u2019t comment when\nasked if myoglobin was one of them, nor would he say if anyone has tried\ntasting Piggy Sooy beans yet.\n\nProducts such as Piggy Sooy could help make our food supply more sustainable,\nsays Dhingra.\n\nRead more:\n\nCutting meat for Veganuary? Here's how to get your protein from beans\n\nEnvironmental writer Mark Lynas thinks similarly. \u201cIt should also be much more\nenvironmentally sustainable, and also avoid the unpleasantness of intensive\nanimal farming,\u201d he says.\n\nLynas has argued that the \u201cyuck factor\u201d associated with transgenic plants \u2013\nthose whose DNA has been modified using genetic material from something else \u2013\nis what led to the opposition to genetically modified crops. He isn\u2019t sure how\nPiggy Sooy will go down with the public.\n\n\u201cI really have no idea how this will land. It\u2019s interesting that they have\ngone all-out for the \u2018piggy\u2019 thing \u2013 there is no attempt to sweeten the pill,\u201d\nsays Lynas. \u201cOf course, scientifically it\u2019s just a protein, and we already\nengineer lots of plants and microbes to make desirable proteins.\u201d\n\nThis production of transgenic proteins in plants and microbes is sometimes\ncalled molecular farming. \u201cWhile we aren\u2019t aware of research specifically\nlooking at molecular farming, there is strong evidence that consumers want \u2013\nand are actively seeking out \u2013 more sustainable alternatives to animal\nagriculture,\u201d says Seren Kell at the Good Food Institute Europe. \u201cSales of\nplant-based options have increased by 21 per cent in Europe since 2020.\u201d\n\nVegan pet food: Can cats and dogs be happy and healthy without meat?\n\nEmerging research suggests vegan pet food may be able to keep dogs and even\ncats healthy and happy, reducing the massive impact that traditional pet food\nhas on the environment\n\nMoolec points out that 98 per cent of all soya grown in the US is genetically\nmodified, and says the success of Impossible Foods shows that consumers aren\u2019t\ndeterred by genetically modified products.\n\nThe company is now seeking the approvals necessary to grow and sell Piggy Sooy\nin the US, says Dhingra. This should be easier to obtain than in Europe\nbecause of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules. \u201cIn the US, food\ningredients developed in this manner would be considered under the FDA\u2019s\nvoluntary pre-market consultation programme for foods from new plant\nvarieties,\u201d says Kell.\n\nIn Europe and the UK, regulations are stricter and the process of getting\napproval would take at least 18 months, she says.\n\nTransgenic plants with added genes from other species have been widely grown\nin many parts of the world, including in Europe, for decades. For instance,\nso-called Bt crops have an added gene for a bacterial protein that kills\ninsects without harming larger animals.\n\nRead more:\n\nGenetically modified tobacco plant produces cocaine in its leaves\n\nTopics:\n\n  * plants/\n  * genetic modification/\n  * food and drink\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Sign up to our weekly newsletter\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!
