South Korean media suggest the SK\nShipping vessels \u2013 the SK Serenity and SK Spica \u2013 are now likely to be sold\nfor scrap.\n\nLast December a court in London ruled that South Korean shipbuilder Samsung\nHeavy Industries (SHI) should pay the shipowner $290m to SK Shipping as a\nresult of defects in the cargo holds of two gas carriers. The ships had been\nordered nine years ago, and made headlines at the time, as they were the first\nto feature a new Korean-developed KC-1 membrane system. Despite several\nrepairs, the containment systems were found to be faulty and the ships never\ntraded.\n\nKoreans have been trying to develop their own gas containment systems for\nyears to avoid paying sizeable fees to France\u2019s GTT, the world\u2019s dominant\nprovider of membrane gas containment systems for ships trading today.\n\nTags\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSam ChambersMay 2, 2024\n\n1 1,615 1 minute read\n\nFacebook X LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Messenger Messenger\nWhatsApp Telegram Share via Email Print\n\n### Sam Chambers\n\nStarting out with the Informa Group in 2000 in Hong Kong, Sam Chambers became\neditor of Maritime Asia magazine as well as East Asia Editor for the world\u2019s\noldest newspaper, Lloyd\u2019s List.
