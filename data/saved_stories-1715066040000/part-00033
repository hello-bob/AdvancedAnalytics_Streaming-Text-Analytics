There\u2019s salty, soy-based \u201cshoyu\u201d or \u201cmiso\u201d paste. Perhaps it\u2019s\nred-hot spicy with a dash of chili. Sometimes there\u2019s no soup at all but a\nsauce to dip the noodles in.\n\nThe curly noodles are lighter than the darker buckwheat \u201csoba,\u201d or \u201cudon,\u201d\nwhich are also usually flatter or thicker.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThis \u2018supereasy ramen\u2019 recipe shows how easy it is to make the Japanese noodle\ndish at home\n\n## GLOBAL SUCCESS\n\nRamen has also surged in popularity in the U.S., South Korea and other\ncountries. Retail sales in the United States have risen 72% since 2000,\naccording to NielsenIQ, a sales tracker. In the 52 weeks ending April 13,\nAmericans bought more than $1.6 billion worth of ramen.\n\nIn restaurants, versions beyond the traditional soup are appearing, said\nTechnomic, a research and consulting company for the restaurant industry.

They emerge,\ndripping with sweat, smacking their lips.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably a talking bowl of ramen,\u201d says Frank Striegl as he leads a dozen\nAmerican tourists through the back alleys of Tokyo\u2019s funky Shibuya district on\nwhat he calls \u201cthe ultimate ramen experience.\u201d\n\nThe crowd is led behind a shabby doorway, sometimes down narrow stairs, to a\ndim-lit table where ramen gets served in tiny bowls, practically the size of a\nlatte cup, or about a quarter of a regular ramen bowl. That\u2019s so guests have\nenough room in their tummies to try out six different kinds of ramen, two at\neach spot during the tour.\n\nParticipants of Tokyo Ramen Tours enter Shinbusakiya, a ramen shop which\noffers \u201cHokkaido classics,\u201d at Shibuya district on April 2, 2024, in Tokyo.\n(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nOne restaurant, Shinbusakiya, offers \u201cHokkaido classics\u201d from the northernmost\nmain island, while another, Nagi, offers \u201cFukuoka fusion,\u201d from the southern\nmain island of Kyushu. It includes a green ramen, similar to pasta al pesto.\nSyuuichi, which means \u201conce a week,\u201d features curry-flavored ramen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just, of course, about eating delicious ramen, but also learning\nabout it,\u201d said Striegl, a Filipino American who grew up in Tokyo. He calls\nramen \u201cpeople\u2019s food.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of countries around the world have their version of ramen in a way,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSo I think because of that, it\u2019s a dish that\u2019s easy to understand. It\u2019s\na dish that\u2019s easy to get behind.\u201d\n\nWhile the tour participants were relishing their noodles, Striegl outlined a\nbrief history of ramen: Its roots date back to the samurai era, when a shogun\ntook a fancy to Chinese noodles, setting off the localizing journey for ramen\nthat continues today.\n\nKatie Sell, a graduate student on Striegl\u2019s tour, called ramen \u201ca kind of\ncomfort food, especially in the winter. Get a group of friends, go have some\nramen and just enjoy it.\u201d\n\nKavi Patel, an engineer from New Jersey, said he was glad he included the\nhumble ramen on his tour of Japan, along with more established attractions\nlike the ancient capital of Kyoto and the deer park in Nara. \u201cI\u2019m having good\nfun,\u201d he said.\n\nFrank Striegl, bottom right, a guide of Tokyo Ramen Tours, explains\nparticipants of a ramen tasting tour at Nagi, which offers \"Fukuoka fusion,\"\ntype ramen at Shibuya district on April 2, 2024, in Tokyo.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\n## ADJUSTING TO CHANGE\n\nWhile ramen has never been more popular in Japan, ramen places have struggled\nbecause of the pandemic, the weakening Japanese yen, and the higher cost of\nwheat imports and energy, according to a study by Tokyo Shoko Research.\n\nOne beneficiary of the pandemic is a home delivery service for frozen,\nprofessionally cooked ramen. Called takumen.com, it boasts some 500,000\nsubscribers in Japan.\n\nAnother Tokyo operation, Gourmet Innovation, has signed on 250 of the\ncountry\u2019s top ramen joints to sell packaged versions of their soup, noodles\nand toppings, to be heated up in boiling water and served at home.\n\nCo-founder and executive Kenichi Nomaguchi, who hopes to expand his business\noverseas, says ramen and animation are Japan\u2019s most successful exports.\n\nWhy ramen? Unlike pasta or curry, ramen is difficult to replicate at home, he\nsaid, Making it from scratch involves hours of cooking stock, with pork, beef\nor chicken, various fish or bonito flakes, and \u201ckombu\u201d kelp. Some stock uses\noysters.\n\n## LOTS OF VARIETY\n\nBesides the different soup stocks and flavors, onions, grated garlic, ginger\nor sesame oil can be added for extra punch. Toppings can include bean sprouts,\nbarbecued pork, boiled or raw eggs, seaweed, fermented bamboo shoots called\n\u201cmenma,\u201d chopped green onions, cooked cabbage, snow peas or corn.\n\nSome insist a bowl of ramen is not complete without a slice of narutomaki, a\nwhitefish cake with a pink spiral pattern.\n\nCo-founder and executive Kenichi Nomaguchi of Tokyo-based Gourmet Innovation,\nexplains on the merchandise during an interview with The Associated Press, in\nTokyo on April 10, 2024.(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nA staff member cooks one of their ramen merchandise sold online at Gourmet\nInnovation, in Tokyo Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

So the pork has to be big so it\u2019s truly memorable,\u201d said\nKota Kobayashi, who serves Jiro-style ramen at his chain, \u201cOre No Ikiru\nMichi,\u201d which translates to, \u201cThe way I live my life.\u201d\n\nKobayashi is a former professional baseball player at the Yokohama Bay Stars,\nand played with the minor league Cleveland Guardians before switching to his\nramen business.\n\n\u201cWhen I quit baseball, I chose ramen as my way of life,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nHe can wax philosophical about ramen. One cultural difference he has observed\nis that Americans tend to leave the noodles and drink all the soup, while the\nJapanese mostly do the opposite.\n\nAnd taste is only part of what makes good ramen. One must also offer\nentertainment, Kobayashi said.\n\nAt his restaurants, the chopsticks are tucked in a box on a shelf, so first-\ntime visitors ask where they are. Repeat customers go straight to that box.\nKobayashi calls out, \u201cWelcome back,\u201d making the customers feel a connection,\neven if he doesn\u2019t remember a thing about them.\n\n## ___\n\nDee-Ann Durbin contributed to this story from Detroit.\n\n## ___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nYURI KAGEYAMA\n\nKageyama covers Japan news for The Associated Press.
