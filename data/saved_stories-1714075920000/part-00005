There\u2019s even a dedicated Product School and the\nProduct Institute.\n\nCompanies from startups to enterprises are formalizing product management\ndivisions \u2013 including Google, Mailchimp, Nextlix, Reddit and 1Password.\n\nThe role of Chief Product Officer is becoming increasingly prevalent, as\nevidenced by its adoption by seven out of the Top 10 companies on the Fortune\n100 list.\n\nProduct management isn\u2019t just a trend. It\u2019s a powerhouse driving success\nacross industries.\n\nIn fact, strong product management is critical to the success of software\ninvestments \u2013 both maximizing revenue potential and saving wasted money on\nmisaligned efforts. Considering the rapid pace of technological advancement\nand changing consumer behaviors, strong product management is more important\nthan ever to validate assumptions, streamline operations and iterate based on\nmarket feedback.\n\nBut it\u2019s tough to measure the ROI of product management as a strategic\nfunction.\n\nWe can look at individual use cases, like when we created a product team at a\ndigital car platform, sales increased by 5x in just 9 months and the speed-to-\nmarket improved from 45 days to 15.\n\nIn another case, we worked with a children\u2019s magazine to implement data-driven\ndecision making and to enhance product pages \u2013 generating up to $1.2 million\nin incremental revenue annually, as well as saving $186,000 yearly in losses\nby implementing proper data and testing practices.\n\nOverall, the success of product management is often tied closely to the\noverall success of the product, as well as enhanced product quality, increased\ncustomer satisfaction, and overall business growth.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll examine more deeply the impact of product management and how it\nhelps ensure the success of your software investment.\n\nFirst, a note: It\u2019s crucial to differentiate between viewing product\nmanagement merely as a tactical function, focused on tasks like drafting use\ncases and managing backlogs (akin to the roles of product owners and project\nmanagers) versus a strategic function that drivies business outcomes.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the discussion on measuring ROI, this distinction\nbecomes pivotal in understanding how to harness the full potential of product\nmanagement to propel your team forward.\n\n(Have a specific product management conundrum?

They now serve as poignant illustrations of the\nconsequences of overlooking the strategic significance of product management.\n\nMySpace: MySpace was once hailed as the titan of social networking, with a\nvaluation of $12 billion. Then Facebook and Twitter came along and introduced\nnew features \u2013 but MySpace clung to its original strategy and watched as its\nusers dwindled. Within three years, Facebook surpassed MySpace.\n\nGoogle Glass: Launched in 2013, Google Glass was one of the first large-scale\nattempts to capitalize on artificial reality. It was announced to so much hype\nthey planned to ramp production to more than 2 million units per year. But\nGoogle Glass encountered a barrage of challenges \u2013 from mounting privacy\nconcerns and social backlash to a lack of clear use cases. Less than two years\nafter its grand debut, Google Glass was shelved.\n\nQuibi, a short-form video streaming platform, raised nearly $2 billion from\ninvestors, sure that the world craved bite-sized entertainment on the go. But\nthey overlooked a critical detail: validating the assumption that consumers\nwould pay for a mobile-only service in a world where content is freely\navailable. Quibi\u2019s meteoric rise was eclipsed by the harsh reality of market\nindifference \u2013 and shut down the same year it launched.\n\nVine: Vine, a short-form video hosting service, was crowned the fastest\ngrowing app on the planet. Twitter acquired Vine pre-launch for $30 million,\nand four months after the launch it was the No. 1 free app on the App Store.\nWithin seven months, it had reached an incredible 40 million users. Just as\nquickly, the tides shifted as competitors like Instagram and Snapchat emerged,\nand Vine failed to keep up with market demand. Vine shut down within four\nyears.\n\nWe believe one thing could have saved these companies from failure: leveraging\nthe strength of good product management.\n\nEffective product management involves continuous market research and\nunderstanding of consumer preferences and trends. A strong product management\nteam would have recognized the shifting landscape and evolving consumer needs,\nenabling these companies to adapt their strategies and offerings accordingly.\n\nQuibi could have benefited from more extensive market validation to understand\nconsumer willingness to pay for mobile-only content. Similarly, Google Glass\nmight have identified privacy concerns and social acceptance issues before its\nwidespread release.\n\nBy prioritizing user feedback and ensuring that their products meet customer\nneeds, these companies could have built stronger, more engaging offerings that\nretained users and attracted new ones.\n\nFinally, incorporating continuous iteration and feedback into the product\ndevelopment process ensures that products evolve in alignment with user needs\nand preferences. This approach could have helped Google Glass pivot towards\nmore acceptable use cases or helped Quibi, MySpace and Vine adapt and innovate\nbased on real market feedback.\n\n## 9 ways product managers add value to your bottom line\n\nSo how exactly does a product manager create business value?\n\nBefore we dive in, it\u2019s important to note: Product managers also excel at\nidentifying what not to pursue, preserving valuable time and resources of\nengineering teams and others in the company. Their ability to prevent costly\nmissteps and guide strategic decision-making is invaluable in today\u2019s fast-\npaced business landscape. It\u2019s tough to measure what you say \u201cno\u201d to, but the\ncost savings can be just as important as the revenue generation.\n\nThat said, a good product manager can generate value in several ways (any of\nwhich are measurable), including:\n\nMaximizing revenue of the product: A skilled product manager is adept at\nprioritizing features based on value and impact. By focusing on high-value\nfeatures first, they optimize ROI for the development efforts.\n\nIncreased user adoption (or retention): One of the biggest challenges for tech\nproducts is not just acquiring users but keeping them engaged over time.\nProduct managers play a crucial role in understanding user behavior and\npreferences. They analyze data to identify pain points in the user journey,\nstrategize improvements, and implement features that enhance the user\nexperience. By doing so, they increase user satisfaction, leading to higher\nadoption rates and improved retention.\n\nIncreased customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction is the bedrock of any\nsuccessful product. However, reaching and maintaining high levels of\nsatisfaction can be challenging amid evolving market dynamics and customer\nexpectations. A skilled product manager listens to customer feedback,\nidentifies areas for improvement, and advocates for user-centric changes\nwithin the development process. By prioritizing features that directly address\ncustomer needs and pain points, they elevate satisfaction levels, foster\nloyalty, and drive positive word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nLess bloat and tech debt: Accumulating technical debt over time can hinder\nproduct innovation and scalability. Product managers play a crucial role in\npreventing the buildup of unnecessary features and technical complexities.\nThey advocate for a lean and efficient product roadmap, focusing on essential\nfunctionalities that align with business objectives. By making informed\ndecisions about feature prioritization and resource allocation, they minimize\nbloat and mitigate the long-term risks associated with technical debt,\nensuring a more sustainable and adaptable product architecture.\n\nReducing time-to-market: Efficient product management can significantly\naccelerate the development cycle. Product managers streamline decision-making,\neliminate bottlenecks, and ensure a quicker time-to-market for your software.\n\nStrategic alignment: Product managers ensure that the product aligns with the\noverall business strategy. They bridge the gap between the technical team and\nbusiness stakeholders and business goals, keeping everyone on the same page.\n\nCustomer-centric approach: As an industry, we have a tendency to build a lot\nof features that no one really wants or needs. Building products without a\ndeep understanding of customer needs often leads to wasted resources,\nunnecessary documentation and missed opportunities. Product managers champion\na customer-centric approach by conducting thorough market research,\ninterviewing users regularly to refine understanding of user need, and\nvalidating product hypotheses through iterative testing.\n\nBetter, smaller product bets: In the fast-paced tech industry, adaptability is\nkey. Product managers continually assess market changes, customer feedback,\nand technological advancements, adjusting the product in the right direction\nas they learn more about what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nData modernization: Product managers and their teams are the key to successful\ndata modernization efforts \u2013 which is key in today\u2019s data-driven landscape.\nProduct managers identify relevant metrics, establish data governance\nframeworks, and facilitate the integration of modern data technologies into\nthe product ecosystem. By harnessing the power of data analytics, they enable\ninformed decision-making, drive product optimization, and unlock new avenues\nfor innovation and growth.\n\n## Schedule a free product management consultation\n\nWe provide flexible product management consulting options \u2013 including burst\ncapacity for strategic initiatives or product coaching for leaders navigating\nin the midst or organizational churn.
