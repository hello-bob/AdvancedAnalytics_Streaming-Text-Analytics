Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Nvidia CEO hand-delivers world's fastest AI system to OpenAI, again \u2014 first\nDGX H200 given to Sam Altman and Greg Brockman\n\nNews\n\nBy Dallin Grimm\n\npublished yesterday\n\nTalk about a special delivery.\n\n(Image credit: Greg Brockman on Twitter / X) (Image credit: Greg Brockman on X\n/ Twitter)\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on a new side gig as a courier, delivering the\nworld's first DGX H200 ever seen in the wild to OpenAI's Sam Altman and Greg\nBrockman. The trio shared a picture of their meeting on Twitter/X,\ncommemorating a successful Jensen Huang delivery to OpenAI.\n\nThe DGX H200 is a brand-new and rocket-fast GPU-based server from Nvidia,\nholding the new H200 Tensor Core GPU inside a powerful enterprise-grade server\nshell. The Hopper-based H200 GPU represents a generational step forward from\nits little brother, the H100, with the newer card now featuring 141 GB of\nmemory running at 4.8 TB/s compared to the H100's measly 80 GB at 3.3 TB/s.\nNvidia calls its H200 \"the world\u2019s most powerful GPU for supercharging AI\nworkloads\", a claim that few could refute.\n\n> First @NVIDIA DGX H200 in the world, hand-delivered to OpenAI and dedicated\n> by Jensen \"to advance AI, computing, and humanity\":\n> pic.twitter.com/rEJu7OTNGTApril 24, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nHuang signed the supercomputer with the epithet \"to advance AI, computing, and\nhumanity\". The signature and photo op bring to mind a very similar scene from\n2016 when Huang had a very similar delivery for OpenAI - the world's first\nDGX-1 server handed off to an excited Elon Musk. Back when Musk was a proud\nmember and co-founder of OpenAI, he happily received the DGX-1, also signed\nwith Huang's cheers \"to the future of computing and humanity\". The gift of the\nDGX-1 was hailed by Elon and many members of the OpenAI team as a boon that\naccelerated their research by weeks, and the astronomical leap in performance\nup to the DGX H200 could have a similar impact.\n\nBut those were happier times; today, Musk is in the process of suing OpenAI.\nHe alleges claims of breaking their founding contract by turning OpenAI from a\nnon-profit into an aggressive for-profit company, and for exacerbating the\npotential dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI), calling the\nprospect of AGI \"a grave threat to humanity.\u201d It seems there is no love lost\nbetween Musk and Huang today, a warm relief for fans of the CEO of leather\njackets/Nvidia and the man who killed Twitter. Time will tell if Musk will\nreceive a free AI supercomputer of his own for training his pet Grok's next\ngeneration.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

X is\nabout as alive as a Zombie, it is not making a profit, unlike (your making me\nsay something nice about) Facebook :( who make Billions.\n\nReply\n\n  * watzupken\n\nOne sample for free. Rest buyers will pay through their noses. Good way to\nmarket.\n\nReply\n\n  * M0rtis\n\nHe probably went in personally to cut a deal with Altman to invest in nVidia\ninstead of setting up his own fab for making AI chips or something along those\nlines. Win-win for nVidia and Altman\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nTSMC readies lower-cost 4nm manufacturing tech: Up to 8.5% cheaper\n\nQualcomm responds to benchmark cheating allegations \u2014 Snapdragon X Elite/Plus\nbenchmarks claimed to be fraudulent (Updated)\n\nTSMCs 2nm nodes get NanoFlex, N2P loses backside power delivery\n\nTSMC unveils 1.6nm process technology with backside power delivery, rivals\nIntel's competing design\n\nMore AMD Zen 5 CPUs spotted in Linux patch notes\n\nUS investigates China's access to RISC-V \u2014 open standard instruction set may\nbecome new site of US-China chip war\n\nFallout-inspired game runs in Excel \u2014 a spreadsheet-powered wasteland escape\nfrom your daily corporate wasteland\n\nAMD Strix Point engineering sample underwhelms in early Geekbench 6 results\n\nAMD-powered classic Macintosh Classic-Inspired mini PC available for retail \u2014\nAyaneo's new AM01 released after a successful Indiegogo campaign\n\nRaspberry Pi Compute Module 4S memory variants announced\n\nTSMC's labor practices draw serious concern in Arizona \u2014 the company's new\nchip plant allegedly plagued by worker abuses\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
