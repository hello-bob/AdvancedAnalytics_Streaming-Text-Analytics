And also I'm really sure\nthat they know exactly what they're doing,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Russia's Ministry of Defence for comment.\n\nThere have also been reports of maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea being\naffected by GPS interference.\n\nJamming is the most widespread form of such meddling, but there have also been\nnumerous instances of \"spoofing\", when legitimate signals are replaced with\nfake ones, indicating a false location.\n\nKeir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think\ntank, believes Russia is meddling with GPS for both offensive and defensive\nreasons.\n\nHe says that while on the one hand Russia is testing \"its capabilities for\nimmobilizing Europe completely in time of crisis\", it is also trying to\nprotect itself from possible missile and drone attacks.\n\n\"Ukraine has already found ways around Russia's GPS jamming, using other\nnavigational systems to carry out drone strikes deep into Russia. But of\ncourse that doesn't mean that Russia doesn't benefit from making sure that GPS\nsimply does not work,\" Mr Giles told the BBC.\n\nThe impact of GPS interference on Russia's own navigation is much less severe\nas it has its own sat-nav system, called GLONASS.\n\nAircraft may have backup systems to work around GPS jamming, but Dana Goward,\npresident of the US-based Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, which\nprotects and improves GPS communication, says that meddling with signals still\nposes serious risks because \"all of our systems and society has been\nstructured around precise GPS signals\".\n\n\u201cWhen we take the GPS out, clearly to some degree the efficiency and the\nsafety of the aviation system is going to go down,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPeople have to revert to old procedures that they're not quite so familiar\nwith. There is going to be some harm, and we just hope it all stops before\nsomething bad happens.\u201d\n\n## Shapps's plane GPS 'jammed' near Russian territory\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\nRussia\n\nEstonia\n\nRelated\n\n## Russia to hold nuclear drills following 'threats' from West\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Seven dead in attack on Russia's Belgorod region\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Weary troops stuck on front line as Ukraine struggles to find manpower\n\n16 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n49 mins ago\n\n## US soldier arrested in Russia accused of theft\n\nThe sergeant, who was held on 2 May, is accused of stealing from a woman,\nreports the BBC's partner CBS.\n\n49 mins ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Cubans lured to Russian army by high pay and passports\n\nThe number of Cubans recruited to fight in Ukraine is thought to be in the\nhundreds.\n\n2 days ago\n\nEurope\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Japan calls Biden migrant comments 'unfortunate'\n\nThe US President called Japan, China, India and Russia \"xenophobic\" because\nthey did not welcome immigration.\n\n3 days ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Kyiv can use British weapons inside Russia - Cameron\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron says it is up to Ukraine to decide how to\nuse British arms.\n\n3 days ago\n\nEurope\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Governments not protecting press freedom, report says\n\nGovernments are failing to protect journalism from political attacks,\naccording to Reporters Without Borders.\n\n3 days ago\n\nWorld\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
