We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations\n> where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the\n> transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the\n> caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the\n> transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function\n> (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at\n> interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the\n> detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes.\n> Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we\n> explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of\n> the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find\n> that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done\n> relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a\n> network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple\n> narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the\n> feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing,\n> directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.\n\nComments:| 13 pages, 3 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of\nGalaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-\nph.IM)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01201 [gr-qc]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01201v3 [gr-qc] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01201arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Slava G.
