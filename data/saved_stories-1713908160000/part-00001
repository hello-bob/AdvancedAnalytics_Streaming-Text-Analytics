Supercut of the two best pacing shots\nfrom this date. Accelerating out of Walnut Ridge, AR and sanding the flues\njust south of Knobel, AR. Speed towards the end of the video is approaching 45\nMPH. Enjoy =) FAQ (READ): Oil burning locomotives must have their flues and\ntubes \"sanded\" every few dozen miles because any oil that does not fully\ncombust in the firebox will end up coating said tubes and flues and hinder\nheat transfer to the boiler. When the locomotive is working hard, a heavy\ndraft is induced from the firebox, through the tubes and flues to the smokebox\nand out the stack. The sand that is poured through the firebox peep hole in\nthe cab is sucked through the tubes and flues and scours them clean of the oil\ndeposits, hence the short periods of black exhaust. The diesel locomotive\naccompanies UP Steam power to provide a measure of security and flexibility in\noperations. The diesel can hold or slow the train speed down using dynamic\nbraking, thus saving the cost of new brake shoes and the time needed to\ninstall them. Additionally, the diesel can be used to assist when necessary,\nand to extend the fuel and water supply, allowing for longer operating\ndistances and days. Finally, as of 2021, the diesel is an integral part of the\nPTC system required for FRA compliance. The water overflow from just in front\nof the rear cylinder on the fireman's side is the exhaust steam injector\noverflow port. Discharge from this port is normal when starting and stopping\nthe injector, and when the injector switches between live steam and exhaust\nsteam.
