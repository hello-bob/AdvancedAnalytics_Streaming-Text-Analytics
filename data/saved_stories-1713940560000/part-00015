But major releases where the first version\nnumber changes (e.g. upgrading from v1.21 to v7.0) contain breaking changes\nand the release notes explain how to deal with them.\n\n## 7.0.0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v7.0.0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges origin/v1.21/forgejo..origin/v7.0/forgejo\n\n  * Breaking changes requiring manual intervention:\n\n    * MySQL 8.0 or PostgreSQL 12 are the minimum supported versions. The database must be migrated before upgrading. The requirements regarding SQLite did not change.\n    * The per_page parameter is no longer a synonym for limit in the /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases API endpoint.\n    * The date format of the created and last_update fields of the /repos/{owner}/{repo}/push_mirrors and /repos/{owner}/{repo}/push_mirrors API endpoint changed to be timestamps instead of numbers.\n    * Labels used by pprof endpoint have been changed:\n\n      * graceful-lifecycle to gracefulLifecycle\n      * process-type to processType\n      * process-description to processDescription This allows for those endpoints to be scraped by services requiring prometheus style labels such as grafana-agent.\n    * The repository description imposes additional restrictions on what it contains to prevent abuse. You may use the v7.0 test instance to check how it will be modified.\n    * The Gitea themes were renamed and the [ui].THEMES setting must be changed as follows:\n\n      * gitea is replaced by gitea-light\n      * arc-green is replaced by gitea-dark\n      * auto is replaced by gitea-auto\n  * Breaking changes in the user interface: Note that the modifications related to CSS, templates or assets (images, fonts, etc.) are not documented here. Although they can be extracted and modified, Forgejo does not provide any guarantee that such changes will be portable from one version to another (even a patch version). See also the developer documentation about interface customization.\n\n    * Update checker setting might change. The documentation was listing it as enabled by default, however, for a while it was disabled unless it was explicitly specified in the config or on the installation page. Instances migrated from Gitea also had it disabled due to different default value. Since then Forgejo got a privacy-friendly DNS-based update checking mechanism which is now being enabled by default unless explicitly specified in the config.\n    * Language statistics for repositories that use linguist attributes in .gitattributes may show different statistics than previously, because Forgejo recognizes more linguist attributes now.\n    * It is no longer possible to replace the default web editor used to write comments or issues and pull requests with the EasyMDE editor. It is however still available as an alternative to edit releases and wiki pages.\n    * The list of all repositories and the New Issue button are no longer available in the user dashboard for issues and pull requests.\n  * Migration warning\n\n    * If the logs show a line like the following, run doctor convert to fix it.\n        \n                [W] Current database is using a case-insensitive collation \"utf8mb4_general_ci\"\n\n    * Large instances may experience slow migrations when the database is upgraded to support SHA-256 git repositories. For instance, here are the logs from a test migration of the https://codeberg.org production database:\n        \n                [I] Migration[286]: Add support for SHA256 git repositories [W] [Slow SQL Query] ALTER TABLE `commit_status` MODIFY COLUMN `context_hash` VARCHAR(64) [] - 3m41.647738396s [W] [Slow SQL Query] ALTER TABLE `comment` MODIFY COLUMN `commit_sha` VARCHAR(64) [] - 1m5.500234133s [W] [Slow SQL Query] ALTER TABLE `release` MODIFY COLUMN `sha1` VARCHAR(64) [] - 22.06241145s\n\n  * Features and enhancements\n\n    * Repository settings have been refactored, lifting out the repository unit-related settings to their own page. (#2221)\n\n      * When additional units can be enabled, an \"Add more...\" link will be displayed for repository admins. This can be turned off. (#2533)\n    * Repository administrators can allow anyone to edit the wiki in the repository Settings. (#2001)\n    * Instance administrators can enable repository badges in the configuration file. This feature depends on a shield generator service such as shields.io, and is disabled by default. (#2070)\n    * Instance administrators can configure the additional clone methods displayed on the repository home view. (gitea#29320)\n    * Instance administrators can assign custom flags to repositories. This is disabled by default, and currently requires custom templates to do anything useful with the flags. (#2079 & #2097)\n    * Fallback for basic repo search using git-grep when code indexer is disabled (gitea#29998)\n    * Repository administrators can disable forking instance-wide by setting the new [repository].DISABLE_FORKS setting. (#2445)\n    * Render permalinks to files with a line range by an inline preview in all places where markup is allowed (#2669)\n    * A user can now optionally set their preferred pronouns (#1518).\n    * Always enable caches.\n    * Forgejo now recognizes more linguist attributes, making it possible to include documentation in the repository language statistics, for example. (#2088)\n    * When displaying the message to open a pull request from a recently pushed branch, the recently pushed branch now links to the appropriate branch. (#2141)\n    * Users who signed up, but have not activated their accounts yet, are now able to change their email before activation. (#1891)\n    * The \"You pushed on branch ....\" banner is now displayed for repositories you have a fork of with recently pushed branches too (#2195), and it will no longer consider branches that share no history with the default branch. (#2196)\n    * Forgejo will now highlight signed tags in a similar way it highlights signed commits. (#2534)\n    * Forgejo gained support for the more recent GitHub-style alert blocks.

The release numbering of the\nForgejo v1.21 patch series follows the Gitea release numbering. However, the\npublication of Gitea v1.21.9 and Gitea v1.21.10 were a few days apart because\nof a regression that is not present on Forgejo and there was no need to\npublish Forgejo v1.21.9-0.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version\nas soon as possible.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated to 6.0.10+0-gitea-1.21.10\n\n  * Built with Go 1.21.9 and golang.org/x/net v0.23.0\n\nIt includes vulnerability fixes.\n\n    * CVE-2023-45288 which permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. A Forgejo instance is affected if it is configured to listen to HTTPS instead of doing this via a reverse proxy.\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Fix to not remove repository avatars when the doctor runs with --fix on the repository archives.\n    * Detect protected branch on branch rename. If a branch cannot be renamed due to a protected branch rule, show this error in the UI instead of throwing an internal server error.\n    * Don't delete inactive emails explicitly. This can cause issues as the associated user might not have been deleted. It would lead to a database inconsistency and internal server errors if the user tries to activate their account.\n    * Fix user interface when a review is deleted without refreshing.\n    * Fix paths when finding files via the web interface that were not escaped.\n    * Respect DEFAULT_ORG_MEMBER_VISIBLE setting when adding creator to org.\n    * Fix duplicate migrated milestones.\n    * Fix inline math blocks can't be preceeded/followed by alphanumerical characters.\n\n## 1.21.8-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.21.8-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.21.7-0..v1.21.8-0\n\nThis stable release contains bug fixes.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest\nversion.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated to 6.0.8+0-gitea-1.21.8\n\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Fix /api/v1/{owner}/{repo}/issue_templates which was always failing with a 500 error.\n    * Prevent error 500 on /user/settings/security when SignedUser has a linked account from a deactivated authentication source.\n    * Fix error 500 when pushing release to an empty repo.\n    * Fix incorrect rendering csv file when file size is larger than UI.CSV.MaxFileSize.\n    * Fix error 500 when deleting account with incorrect password or unsupported login type.\n    * handle user-defined name anchors like [Link](#link) linking to <a name=\"link\"></a>Link.\n    * Use correct head commit for CODEOWNER.\n    * Fix manual merge button.\n    * Make meilisearch do exact search for issues.\n    * Fix PR creation via api between branches of same repo with head field namespaced.\n\n## 1.21.7-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.21.7-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.21.6-0..v1.21.7-0\n\nThis stable release contains bug fixes and a security fix.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version\nas soon as possible.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated to 6.0.7+0-gitea-1.21.7\n\n  * Built with Go 1.21.8\n\nIt includes vulnerability fixes.\n\n    * CVE-2023-45290 which could lead to memory exhaustion when parsing a multipart form.\n    * CVE-2023-45289 which could allow incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect.\n  * Security fix\n\n    * The google.golang.org/protobuf module was bumped to version v1.33.0 to fix a bug in the google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson package which could cause the Unmarshal function to enter an infinite loop when handling some invalid inputs.

This causes Forgejo to hang on the check-attr command, because no output was being flushed. Workaround this by detecting if Git v2.43.1 is used and set GIT_FLUSH=0 thus getting the correct behavior.\n    * When setting url.host on a URL object with no port specified (like is the case of default port), the resulting URL's port will not change.

Although they can be extracted and modified, Forgejo does not provide any guarantee that such changes will be portable from one version to another (even a patch version). A Q&A discussion is available to share tips and tricks. A new section was also added to the developer documentation about interface customization.\n\n    * If you have custom asset files, e.g. custom themes, inside custom/public/* (css included), you need to transfer these files to custom/public/assets/* for them to be detected. Read more in the documentation and the Q&A discussion dedicated to interface customization.\n    * Git branches are stored in the databases to reduce the calls to a git process and improve performances. After upgrading, login as an admin, go to the /admin page and click run Sync missed branches from git data to databases. If this is not done there will be messages such as LoadBranches: branch does not exist in the logs.\n    * Some Forgejo CLI options have changed and scripts may need to be updated. For instance --verbose is no longer a global option and is implemented on a per sub-command basis. Check forgejo --help or forgejo docs for more information.\n    * Remove \"CHARSET\" config option for MySQL and always use \"utf8mb4\". It has been a requirement for years and specifying anything else is likely to cause issues. Existing MySQL databases still using utf8 can be converted using the CLI: forgejo doctor convert.\n    * Restrict certificate type for builtin SSH server. This is a breaking change for setups where the builtin SSH server is being used and for some reason host certificates were being used for authentication.\n    * Set SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS_BACKUP to false by default. There is no automatic cleanup of these backups and can end up using a significant amount of disk space over time.\n    * The minimum RSA keylength is now 3072 instead of 2048.\n    * Prior to this release, a token scoped to read or write permissions on issues was allowed to access both issues and pull requests, regardless of the restrictions imposed to the team in which they belong. In a team it is possible to grant finer grained permissions, for instance to allow a user to access issues but not pull requests. These restrictions are now enforced and API calls that previously succeeded on /api/v1/repos/{org}/{repo}/issues or other endpoints common to both issues and pull requests could return 404. Granting the user the necessary permissions in the team in which they belong will allow them to use that endpoint again.\n  * Forgejo Actions: It is now enabled by default but should still be considered alpha stage and subject to unannounced breaking changes.\n\n    * The API can now be used to manage secrets for users, organizations and repositories.\n    * Registration tokens can register multiple runners instead of a single one. Read more about runner registration.\n    * Add support for variables in addition to secrets.\n    * Add support for recurring actions similar to cron jobs.\n    * Add the possibility to disable workflows from the user interface.\n    * Add automatic cleanup of artificats.\n    * Add automatic cancelation of jobs when pushing new commits to a PR.\n    * Add support for uploading multiple artificats.\n    * Add support for the pull_request_target event which has access to secrets because it runs using the workflows from the base branch instead of the pull request.\n    * Add support for reading labels from the runner instead of specifying them during registration.\n  * Features:\n\n    * With the Chroma upgrade from 2.7.0 to 2.10.0 syntax highlighting is now available for Smali, DHCP, WebGPU Shading Language, AutoHotkey, AutoIt, tal (uxntal), ArangoDB Query Language (AQL), BIND DNS Zone, Odin, Sourcepawn, CPP, C. New files and extensions are associated as follows: .tpp as a c++, .eex as a Elixir, Pipfile and poetry.lock as a TOML, ISCdhcpd filename, .twig, Mathematica.\n    * With the go-enry upgrade from v2.8.4 to v2.8.6, language detection in the repository now includes:\n\n      * Bluespec BH: atom-haskell/language-haskell\n      * D2: terrastruct/d2-vscode\n      * Go Workspace: golang/vscode-go\n      * Gradle Kotlin DSL: nishtahir/language-kotlin\n      * Hosts File: Alhadis/language-etc\n      * LOLCODE: KrazIvan/LOLCODE-grammar-vscode\n      * MDX: wooorm/markdown-tm-language\n      * Nasal: BobDotCom/Nasal.tmbundle\n      * Nushell: hustcer/nu-grammar\n      * Pact: kadena-io/pact-atom\n      * RBS: soutaro/vscode-rbs-syntax\n      * Rez: textmate/rez.tmbundle\n      * Sweave: textmate/sweave.tmbundle\n      * TL-Verilog: adamint/tlv-vscode\n      * Typst: michidk/typst-grammar\n      * WDL: broadinstitute/wdl-sublime-syntax-highlighter\n      * WGSL: wgsl-analyzer/wgsl-analyzer\n      * WebAssembly Interface Type: bytecodealliance/vscode-wit\n    * Newly pushed branches show in the web UI with a link to create a PR. Read more about the New Pull Request button.\n    * Labels that are no longer useful can be archived. They can no longer be selected but they remain on existing issues. Read more about archiving labels.\n    * The blame view now takes into account the .git-blame-ignore-revs file.\n    * Pre-register OAuth2 applications for git credential helpers.

In a team it is\npossible to grant finer grained permissions, for instance to allow a user to\naccess issues but not pull requests. These restrictions are now enforced and\nAPI calls that previously succeeded on /api/v1/repos/{org}/{repo}/issues or\nother endpoints common to both issues and pull requests could return 404.\nGranting the user the necessary permissions in the team in which they belong\nwill allow them to use that endpoint again.\n\n  * Security fix\n\nAdditional API and web endpoints now fail when given manually crafted\nidentifiers.\n\n## 1.20.5-1\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.20.5-1 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.20.5-0..v1.20.5-1\n\nThis stable release contains critical security fixes, as explained in the\nv1.20.5-1 companion blog post.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe strongly recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the\nlatest version as soon as possible.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated to 5.0.6+0-gitea-1.20.5\n\n  * Security fixes\n\n    * API and web endpoints now fail when given manually crafted identifiers.\n    * When an extension is added to the URL of a user profile (e.g. /myuser.rss) it is now verified to be visible.\n    * docker login now fails with basic auth when 2FA is enabled.\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent bug fixes are described below.

To ensure that no tokens have a larger scope than expected they must be removed and recreated.\n    * If your app.ini has one of the the following [indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_TYPE, [indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_BATCH_NUMBER, [indexer]., [indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_DIR, [indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_CONN_STR, [indexer].UPDATE_BUFFER_LEN, [mailer].SEND_BUFFER_LEN, [repository].PULL_REQUEST_QUEUE_LENGTH or [repository].MIRROR_QUEUE_LENGTH, Forgejo will abort immediately. Unless you know exactly what you're doing, you must comment them out so the default values are used.\n    * The -p option of environment-to-ini is no longer supported\n    * The \".png\" suffix for user and organizations is now reserved\n    * The section [git.reflog] is now obsolete and its keys have been moved to the following replacements:\n\n      * [git.reflog].ENABLED \u2192 [git.config].core.logAllRefUpdates\n      * [git.reflog].EXPIRATION \u2192 [git.config].gc.reflogExpire\n    * The logger used to display Forgejo's was refactored and has new settings, different from the previous one found at log.<mode>.<logger> in app.ini. Check the documentation and app.example.ini for more information. The SMTP logger was removed.\n    * Forgejo will refuse to start if the refactored path & config system does not pass sanity checks (e.g. WORK_PATH must be absolute).\n    * Manually set WORK_PATH in app.ini. If the app.ini file is writable by the user under which the Forgejo server runs and WORK_PATH is not set, the server will add it. Otherwise it will log an error starting with Unable to update WORK_PATH. One of the consequences of not setting WORK_PATH in app.ini is that pushing to a repository via ssh is likely to fail as explained in the corresponding bug report. Read the technical details in the commit that implements the WORK_PATH change.\n    * The user profile can be customized with a Markdown file. The profile page of a user is rendered using the README.md file of the .profile repository, if it exists. It is a breaking change because it will display the .profile/README.md of a pre-existing repository, private or not.\n    * The API endpoint pagination for team members was fixed: it now starts at 1 instead of 0, just like all other paginated API endpoints.\n    * The SSH_KEYGEN_PATH variable in app.ini now defaults to using the Go SSH key parsing instead of the ssh-keygen binary. When START_SSH_SERVER is true, the decision to use the Go SSH key parsing or an external binary will now depend on the value of SSH_KEYGEN_PATH instead of always using the Go SSH key parsing.\n    * The storage settings were refactored. Read more about storage settings.\n    * The [repository.editor] PREVIEWABLE_FILE_MODES setting was removed. This setting served no practical purpose and was not working correctly. Instead a preview tab is always shown in the file editor when supported.\n    * In addition to the already deprecated options inside [queue], many options have been dropped as well. Those are WRAP_IF_NECESSARY, MAX_ATTEMPTS, TIMEOUT, WORKERS, BLOCK_TIMEOUT, BOOST_TIMEOUT, BOOST_WORKERS. You can remove them from your app.ini now. Additionally, some default values have changed in this section.\n    * The default CSS and templates included in Forgejo were heavily refactored and a large number of variables renamed. These changes are not documented and there is a very high chance that a tempate extracted and modified for a particular Forgejo instance will no longer work as it did. Browsing through the git history of the template in the sources is the best way to figure out how and why it was modified.\n  * Moderation: Blocking another user is desirable if they are acting maliciously or are spamming your repository. When you block a user, Forgejo does not explicitly notify them, but they may learn through an interaction with you that is blocked. Read more about blocking users.\n  * Package: New registries are available for SWIFT, debian, RPM, alpine, Go and CRAN.\n  * Accessibility: numerous improvements for issue comments, the menu on the navbar, scoped labels, checkboxes and dropdowns, RTL rendering support to Markdown, file (re-)views, interactive tooltips, using a button element, repository list and more.\n  * Time: The display and localization of time was improved for tooltips, milestones, due date and translations that contain dates, commit graphs, runners, webhooks, tests and more. Previously each rendered timestamp would be static, now the real time since an event happend is show. If a comment was added 2 minutes before the page rendered it would show as \"2 minutes ago\" on the initial render and if another 8 minutes have passed, without a page refresh you'd see \"10 minutes ago\".\n  * Wiki\n\n    * Improve the display of the table of content\n    * Fixed a bug preventing team users who have wiki write permission from deleting a page\n    * Shows the External Link icon and URL in the header to indicate that the user will be sent to an external side to help prevent fishing\n    * Allow dash in titles\n  * Actions\n\n    * The internal CI graduated from experimental to alpha. It now has with a user documentation that includes examples and an extensive administrator guide to set it up.\n    * Forgejo Actions workflows are now available to run tests and publish releases for Forgejo itself.\n    * The Woodpecker CI configuration for PR verification and building releases for Forgejo v1.18 and v1.19 is no longer maintained as part of Forgejo itself and was moved to its own repository.\n  * Templates\n\n    * Configuration for the issue templates. Read more about issue config in the documentation.\n    * Add validations.required check to the dropdown field\n    * Issue template support markdown edition\n    * Use a general Eval function for expressions in templates\n    * reload-templates CLI\n  * User Interface and User eXperience\n\n    * The web editor used when creating issues, adding comments, etc. changed from EasyMDE which was no longer actively maintained to GitHub markdown. To help with the transition it is still possible to switch back to using EasyMDE using the double arrow button in the menubar.\n    * Improve wiki sidebar and TOC\n    * Show outdated comments in the files changed tab of a pull request review\n    * Redirect to package after version deletion\n    * Use a separate admin page to show stats\n    * Improve avatar compression and resizing\n    * Add button to compare force pushed commits in pull requests\n    * When creating a new file in a repository via the web user interface allow for a path to be pasted\n    * Allows \"video\" HTML tag to be used in MarkDown, with the src, autoplay, and controls attributes\n    * Add \"Reviewed by you\" filter for pull requests\n    * Make Ctrl+Enter submit a pending comment (starting review) instead of submitting a single comment\n    * If an instance chooses to disable new pull or push mirrors or mirrors entirely, an appropriate message will now be shown to the user in the Repository Settings\n    * Change Close to either Close issue or Close pull request\n    * Make Issue/PR/projects more compact\n    * Improve RSS user interface\n    * Add details summary for vertical menus in settings to allow toggling\n    * Show visibility status of email in own profile\n    * Improve the protected branch setting page\n    * Improve the display of the pull request branch delete button\n    * Fix the color for repository transfer related buttons when having no permission to act\n    * Add a progressbar to Milestone Page\n    * Nicer display when the list of notifications is empty\n    * Rename board to column in projects\n    * Improve header bar on issue, pull requests and milestone\n    * Add organization visibility label when displayed on the dashboard\n    * Unification of registration fields order\n    * Append (comment) when a link points at a comment rather than the whole issue\n    * Add visibility (private, limited) in the dashboard navbar\n    * Show all activities in the dashboard, not just the most recent ones\n    * Do not display the stars in the repository list of the dashboard\n    * Improve the display of tags to include the tag message\n    * Hide the target selector if a tag exists when creating a new release\n    * Show the calculated commit status state of the latest commit on the default branch for each repository in the dashboard repository list\n    * Sort users and orgs on the explore page by recency\n    * Show the number of repositories in the user or organization profile\n    * Review management (requesting again and discard) now happens at the top of the pull request\n    * Add markdown preview when submitting a review\n    * Support no label/assignee filter and batch clearing labels/assignees\n    * Display when a repo was archived\n    * Improve squash merge commit author and co-author with private emails\n    * Allow adding new files to an empty repo\n    * Move Rename branch from repo settings page to the page of branches list\n    * Add \"Updated\" column for admin repositories list\n    * Hide the merge box of a pull request if it is merged and the branch was deleted\n    * The repository migration can be canceled\n    * Add button on the diff header to copy the file name\n    * Add --quiet option to the dump CLI\n    * Support searching for an issue with its number in the the list of issues\n    * Improve the list of notifications\n    * When editing a file in the web UI, allow for a preview whenever possible\n    * Make release download URLs human readable\n    * Add a tooltip to Publish Review explaining why they are disabled\n    * Show the file tree view by default when browsing the changes in a pull request\n    * Allow both fullname search in the author dropdown search of the issue list when DEFAULT_SHOW_FULL_NAME is true\n  * Performance\n\n    * Improve performances when listing issues\n    * Speedup loading the list of authors in the dropdown of the list of issues\n    * Use minio/sha256-simd for accelerated SHA256\n    * Speed up HasUserStopwatch & GetActiveStopwatch\n    * Do not create commit graph for temporary repos\n    * Faster git.GetDivergingCommits\n    * Order pull request conflict checking by recently updated, for each push\n    * MySQL integration tests run twice faster low end machines and use an order of magnitude less disk I/O\n  * Authentication\n\n    * Add ntlm authentication support for mail\n    * LDAP filters include both username and email address\n    * Allow for PKCE flow without client secret\n    * Add the ability to set multiple redirect URIs in the OAuth application UI\n  * Refactor: Many essential sub-systems were refactored: the queue system that handles background tasks such as checking pull requests, pull mirror, git internal API, routes and web routes, merge & update logic and git command calls, listing commits, cookie, issue stats, renaming users and organizations, app.ini handling, diffFileInfo / DiffTreeStore.... In theory these changes are transparent to the Forgejo user and admin but the risk of subtle regressions is real: do not hesitate to reach out if you suspect anything.\n  * RSS\n\n    * Support \".\" char as user name for User/Orgs in RSS/ATOM/GPG/KEYS\n    * Add RSS Feeds for branches and files\n  * API\n\n    * Add admin API for email\n    * Add admin API to rename a user\n    * Add login name and source id to admin user searching API\n    * Add missing units to create and edit repo API\n    * Add API to manage issue dependencies\n    * Add API for activity feeds\n    * Add API for license templates\n    * Add API for gitignore templates\n    * Add API to upuload a file to an empty repository\n    * Allow for --not when listing the commits of a repo\n    * Add files and verification parameters to improve performances when listing the commits of a a repo\n    * Allow for listing a single commit in a repository\n    * Create a branch directly from commit on the create branch API\n    * Add API for Label templates\n    * Add API for changing/creating/deleting multiple files\n  * Miscellaneous Features\n\n    * Any URL scheme may be used for links. Previously, non-standard URLs (like matrix:) were not rendered unless explicitly listed in markdown.CUSTOM_URL_SCHEMES.

It contains Forgejo specific additions such as offline registration\n    * Render list items when an org-mode file is displayed\n    * A user can follow an organization\n    * When playing a video in the web UI, the player control can be dragged to play on the specified position\n    * The commit status required for a pull request to be merged can now be specified as patterns instead of being a hard coded list\n    * Support wildcard in email domain allow and block lists. Read more about EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST and EMAIL_DOMAIN_BLOCKLIST.\n    * When installing with docker the value of a configuration variable can now be fetched from a file by adding the __FILE suffix. For instance FORGEJO__security__INTERNAL_TOKEN__FILE=/etc/forgejo/token can be used instead of FORGEJO__security__INTERNAL_TOKEN=tokenvalue.\n    * The new [git.config] section of app.ini is used to git set config. Read more about the defaults it contains.\n    * Issues and pull requests can be pinned. They will show on top of the list of issues (or pull requests) and can be re-arranged by dragging them.\n    * Implement systemd-notify protocol and allows for using Type=notify in service files.\n    * Provide more control over the repositories that are indexed. Read more about REPO_INDEXER_REPO_TYPES.\n  * Webhook\n\n    * Similar to organization wide webhooks, it is now possible to have user wide webhooks\n    * Add webhook trigger when a Pull Request review requests is created\n\n  * Container images upgraded to Alpine 3.18\n\nThe Forgejo container images are now based on Alpine 3.18 instead of Alpine\n3.17.\n\n## 1.19.4-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.4-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.3-0..v1.19.4-0\n\nThis stable release contains security fixes.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest\nversion.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated from 4.2.1+0-gitea-1.19.3 to\n4.2.2+0-gitea-1.19.4.\n\n  * Security fixes\n\n    * An additional verification was implemented to prevent open redirects.\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Fix an edge case where a user changing their username in their profile page could fail\n    * The secrets are only meaningful in the context of Frogejo Actions, do not display them if Forgejo Actions is disabled (patch 1, patch 2)\n    * Actions can now be triggered on mirrored repositories (patch 1, patch 2)\n    * Return 404 in the API if the requested webhooks were not found instead of 500\n    * Ensure topics deleted via the API are also deleted in the repository\n    * Tentative fix to suppress the JavaScript error TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '_i18n.textEdited') on safari. It is unclear if that fix is effective because it could not be reproduced, please report if it still happens for you.\n    * Respect original content when creating secrets\n    * If a mirror failed and left the database in an inconsistent state, make it so the repository page does not fail with an error 500\n    * If a user that triggered Actions is deleted, allow for the page listing the tasks it launched to show instead of failing with an error 500\n    * Allow the selection of milestones when acting on multiple issues in the issue list page\n    * Fix the API error message when trying to create a fork that already exists\n    * Don't display a create page button in a mirror wiki repository. A mirrored repository will also mirror a wiki and changes will be overridden.\n    * Do not allow for a repository to enable actions if it is not enabled in the configuration\n    * Allow for closed PRs to be re-opened and synchronize with the latest content of the head branch\n    * Fix the close button of projects within an organization. It was a noop and now effectively closes the project\n\n## 1.19.3-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.3-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.2-0..v1.19.3-0\n\nThis stable release contains security fixes.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest\nversion.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated from 4.2.0+0-gitea-1.19.2 to\n4.2.1+0-gitea-1.19.3 because of the rebuild with Go version 1.20.4.\n\n  * Security fixes\n\n    * Forgejo was recompiled with Go version v1.20.4 published 2 May 2023. It fixes three vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-29400, CVE-2023-24540, CVE-2023-24539) related to the html/template package. The Forgejo security team analyzed the security fixes it contains and concluded that Forgejo is not affected but recommended a rebuild as a precaution.\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent one is described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Allow users that are not signed in to browse the tag list. Requiring users to be signed in to view the tag list was a regression introduced in Forgejo v1.19.2-0.\n\n## 1.19.2-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.2-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.1-0..v1.19.2-0\n\nThis stable release contains important security fixes.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe strongly recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the\nlatest version as soon as possible.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated from 4.1.0+0-gitea-1.19.1 to\n4.2.0+0-gitea-1.19.2 because of the changes introduced in the internal CI.\n\n  * Security fixes\n\n    * Token scopes were not enforced in some cases (patch 1 and patch 2). The scoped token were introduced in Forgejo v1.19 allow for the creation of application tokens that only have limited permissions, such as creating packages or accessing repositories. Prior to Forgejo v1.19 tokens could be used to perform any operation the user issuing the token could.\n    * Permissions to delete secrets was not enforced. The experimental internal CI relies on secrets managed via the web interface, for instance to communicate credentials to a job. Secrets are only used in the context of the experimental internal CI.\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Restore public access to some API endpoints. When scoped token introduced in Forgejo v1.19, some API endpoints that were previously accessible anonymously became restricted: /orgs, /orgs/{org}, /orgs/{org}/repos, /orgs/{org}/public_members, /orgs/{org}/public_members/{username}, /orgs/{org}/labels.\n    * Fix 2-dot direct compare to use the right base commit. For 2-dot direct compare, the base commit should be used in the title and templates, as is used elsewhere, not the common ancestor which is used for 3-dot compare.\n    * Make CORS work. No CORS headers were set, even if CORS was enabled in the configuration.\n    * Fix issue attachment removal. When an attachment was removed from an issue or review comment, all of the image/attachment links were broken.\n    * Fix wiki write permissions for users who do not have repository write permissions. When a team member had write access to the wiki but not to the code repository, some operations (deleting a page for instance) were denied.\n    * Respect the REGISTER_MANUAL_CONFIRM setting when registering via OAuth. Contrary to the local registration, the OAuth registration flow activated a newly registered user regardless of the value of REGISTER_MANUAL_CONFIRM.\n    * Fix tags list for repos whose release setting is disabled. When releases was disabled the \"tags\" button led to a Not Found page, even when tags existed.\n  * Container image upgrades\n\nIn the Forgejo container images the Git version was upgraded to 2.38.5 as a\nprecaution. The Forgejo security team analyzed the security fixes it contains\nand concluded that Forgejo is not affected.\n\n## 1.19.1-0\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.1-0 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.0-3..v1.19.1-0\n\nThis stable release includes bug fixes. Functional changes related to the\nexperimental CI have also been backported.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all installations are upgraded to the latest version.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated from 4.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0 to\n4.1.0+0-gitea-1.19.1 because of the changes introduced in the internal CI.\n\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThe most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of\ncommits included in the release as described above.\n\n    * Fix RSS/ATOM/GPG/KEYS path for users (or orgs) with a dot in their name. It is allowed for a user (or an organization) to have a dot in their name, for instance user.name. Because of a bug in Chi it was not possible to access /user.name.png, /user.name.gpg, etc. A workaround was implemented while a proper fix is being discussed.\n    * Creating a tag via the web interface no longer requires a title.\n    * Use fully qualified URLs in Dockerfile. The Dockerfile to create the Forgejo container image now uses the fully qualified image docker.io/library/golang:1.20-alpine3.17 instead of golang:1.20-alpine3.17. This allows for building on platforms that don't have docker hub as the default container registry.\n    * Redis use Get/Set instead of Rename when Regenerate session id. The old sid and new sid may be in different redis cluster slot.\n    * Do not escape space between PyPI repository url and package name. It also adds a trailing slash to the PyPI repository URL in accordance to Python PEP-503.\n    * Fix failure when using the API and an empty rule_name to protect a branch. The rule_name parameter for the /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branch_protections API now defaults to the branch name instead of being empty.\n    * Fix branch protection priority. Contrary to the documentation it was possible for a glob rule to take precedence over a non-glob rule.\n    * Fix deleting an issue when the git repo does not exist. If a project had an issue tracker (such as the Forgejo discussion) but no git repository, trying to delete an issue would fail.\n    * Fix accidental overwriting of LDAP team memberships. If an LDAP user is a member of two groups, the LDAP group sync only matched the last group.\n\n## 1.19.0-3\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.0-3 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.0-2..v1.19.0-3\n\nThis stable release includes security updates and bug fixes.\n\n  * Recommended Action\n\nWe recommend that all installations are upgraded to the latest version.\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Forgejo security team analyzed the vulnerabilities fixed in the latest Go\n1.20.3 packages and Alpine 3.17.3 and concluded that Forgejo is not affected.\n\nAs a precaution the Forgejo v1.19.0-3 binaries were compiled with Go 1.20.3\npackages as published on 4 April 2023 and the container images were built with\nAlpine 3.17.3 as published on 29 March 2023.\n\n  * Forgejo Semantic Version\n\nThe semantic version was updated from 3.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0 to\n4.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0 because of the breaking changes described below.\n\n  * Breaking changes\n\nThey should not have a significant impact because they are related to\nexperimental features (federation and CI).\n\n    * Use User.ID instead of User.Name in ActivityPub API for Person IRI\n\nThe ActivityPub id is an HTTPS URI that should remain constant, even if the\nuser changes their name.\n\n    * Actions unit is repo.actions instead of actions.actions\n\nAll instances of actions.actions in the DISABLED_REPO_UNITS or\nDEFAULT_REPO_UNITS configuration variables must be replaced with repo.actions.\n\n  * Bug fixes\n\nThey are for the most part about user interface and actions. The most\nprominent ones are:\n\n    * Do not filter repositories by default on the explore page. The behavior of the explore page is back to what it was in Forgejo v1.18. Changing it was confusing.\n    * Skip LFS when disabled in dump and doctor.\n    * Do not display own email on the profile.\n    * Make minio package support legacy MD5 checksum.\n    * Do not triggers Webhooks and actions on closed PR.\n\n## 1.19.0-2\n\nThe complete list of commits included in the Forgejo v1.19.0-2 release can be\nreviewed from the command line with:\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/ $ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges origin/v1.18/forgejo..origin/v1.19/forgejo\n\n  * Breaking changes\n\n    * Scoped access tokens\n\nForgejo access token, used with the API can now have a \"scope\" that limits\nwhat it can access. Existing tokens stored in the database and created before\nForgejo v1.19 had unlimited access. For backward compatibility, their access\nwill remain the same and they will continue to work as before. However, newly\ncreated token that do not specify a scope will now only have read-only access\nto public user profile and public repositories.\n\nFor instance, the /users/{username}/tokens API endpoint will require the\nscopes: ['all', 'sudo'] parameter and the forgejo admin user generate-access-\ntoken will require the --scopes all,sudo argument obtain tokens with ulimited\naccess as before for admin users.\n\nRead more about the scoped tokens.\n\n    * Disable all units except code and pulls on forks\n\nWhen forking a repository, the fork will now have issues, projects, releases,\npackages and wiki disabled. These can be enabled in the repository settings\nafterwards. To change back to the previous default behavior, configure\nDEFAULT_FORK_REPO_UNITS to be the same value as DEFAULT_REPO_UNITS.\n\n    * Filter repositories by default on the explore page\n\nThe explore page now always filters out repositories that are considered not\nrelevant because they are either forks or have no topic and not description\nand no icon. A link is shown to display all repositories, unfiltered.\n\n    * Remove deprecated DSA host key from Docker Container Since OpenSSH 7.0 and greater similarly disable the ssh-dss (DSA) public key algorithm, and recommend against its use. http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html\n\n    * Additional restrictions on valid user names\n\nThe algorithm for validating user names was modified and some users may have\ninvalid names. The command forgejo doctor --run check-user-names will list all\nof them so they can be renamed.\n\nIf a Forgejo instance has users or organizations named forgejo-actions and\ngitea-actions, they will also need to be renamed before the upgrade. They are\nnow reserved names for the experimental internal CI/CD named Actions.\n\n    * Semantic version\n\nSince v1.18.5, in addition to the Forgejo release number, a semantic version\nnumber (e.g. v3.0.0) can be obtained from the number key of a new\n/api/forgejo/v1/version endpoint.\n\nNow, it reflects the Gitea version that Forgejo depends on, is no longer\nprefixed with v (e.g. 3.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0), and can be obtained from the\nversion key of the same endpoint.\n\n  * Features\n\n    * Documentation The first version of the Forgejo documentation is available and covers the administration of Forgejo, from installation to troubleshooting.\n\nRead more about semantic versions\n\n    * Webhook authorization header Forgejo webhooks can be configured to send an authorization header to the target.\n\nRead more about the webhook authorization header\n\n    * Incoming emails You can now set up Forgejo to receive incoming email. When enabled, it is now possible to reply to an email notification from Forgejo and:\n\n      * Add a comment to an issue or a pull request\n      * Unsubscribe to the notifications\n\nRead more about incoming emails\n\n    * Packages registries\n\n      * Support for Cargo, Conda and Chef\n      * Cleanup rules\n      * Quota limits\n    * Option to prohibit fork if user reached maximum limit of repositories It is possible for a user to create as many fork as they want, even when a quota on the number of repositories is imposed. The new ALLOW_FORK_WITHOUT_MAXIMUM_LIMIT setting can now be set to false so forks are prohibited if that means exceeding the quota.\n\nRead more about repository configurations\n\n    * Scoped labels Labels that contain a forward slash (/) separator are displayed with a slightly different color before and after the separator, as a visual aid. The first part of the label defines its \"scope\".\n\nRead more about scoped labels.\n\n    * Support org/user level projects It is now possible to create projects (kanban boards) for an organization or a user, in the same way it was possible for an individual repository.\n\n    * Map OIDC groups to Orgs/Teams When a user logs in Forgejo using an provider such as Keycloak, they can now automatically be part of a Forgejo team, depending on the OIDC group they belong to. For instance:\n        \n                {\"Developer\": {\"MyForgejoOrganization\": [\"MyForgejoTeam1\", \"MyForgejoTeam2\"]}}\n\nMeans that the user who is in the OIDC group Developer will automatically be a\nmember of the MyForgejoTeam1 and MyForgejoTeam2 teams in the\nMyForgejoOrganization organization. This mapping is set when adding a new\nAuthentication Source in the Site Administration panel.\n\n...\n\nRead more about OIDC groups mapping\n\n    * RSS feed for releases and tags\n\nA RSS feed is now available for releases at /{owner}/{repo}/releases.rss and\ntags at /{owner}/{repo}/tags.rss.\n\n    * Supports wildcard protected branch\n\nInstead of selecting a branch to be protected, the name of the branch must be\nspecified and can be a pattern such as precious*.\n\nRead more about branch protection.\n\n    * Garbage collect LFS Add a doctor command for full garbage collection of LFS: forgejo doctor --run gc-lfs.\n\n    * Additions to the API\n\n      * Management for issue/pull and comment attachments\n      * Get latest release\n      * System hook\n    * Option to disable releases on a repository\n\nIt is now possible to disable releases on a repository, in the same way it is\npossible to disable issues or packages.\n\n    * Git reflog support The git reflog are now active by default on all repositories and kept around for 90 days. It allows the Forgejo admin to recover the previous tip of a branch after an accidental force push.\n\nRead more about reflog\n\n    * Actions: an experimental CI/CD\n\nIt appears for the first time in this Forgejo release but is not yet fit for\nproduction. It is not fully implemented and may be insecure. However, as long\nas it is not enabled, it presents no risk to existing Forgejo instances.\n\nIf a repository has a file such as .forgejo/workflows/test.yml, it will be\ninterpreted, for instance to run tests and verify the code in the repository\nworks as expected (Continuous Integration). It can also be used to create HTML\npages for a website and publish them (Continous Deployment). The syntax is\nsimilar to GitHub Actions and the jobs can be controled from the Forgejo web\ninterface.\n\nRead more about Forgejo Actions\n\n  * User Interface improvements\n\n    * Review box on small screens The rendering of the review box is improved on small screens.\n\n    * Video element enabled in markdown The <video> HTML tag can now be used in MarkDown, with the src, autoplay, and controls attributes.\n\n    * Copy citation file content in APA and BibTex format If a BibTeX file named CITATION.bib is at the root of the repository, it can be conveniently copied and converted in APA by following the Cite this repository link.\n\nIt will open a dialog box with the available formats and a preview of the\ncontent.\n\nThe CFF format is also supported when a CITATION.cff file used instead.\n\n    * Display asciicast\n\nFiles with the .cast extension are displayed in the Forgejo web interface as\nasciicast v2 using asciinema-player.\n\n    * Attention blocks Note and Warning\n\nFor each quote block, the first **Note** or **Warning** gets an icon prepended\nto it and its text is colored accordingly.\n\n    * Support for commit cross references\n\nA commit hash can now be prefixed by the repository to be referenced from a\ncomment in another repository: owner/repo@commit.\n\n    * Preview images for Issue cards in Project Board view\n\nIf the card preview in the project is set to Images and Text, it displays\nimages found in the corresponding issue. The most recent is displayed first,\nup to five images.\n\nRead more about card preview images.\n\n    * Add \"Copy\" button to file view of raw text\n\nIf a raw text file is displayed, a copy button of the text is enabled.\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n    * Setting to allow edits on PRs by maintainers\n\nAdd setting to allow edits by maintainers by default, to avoid having to often\nask contributors to enable this.\n\n  * Container images upgraded to Alpine 3.17\n\nThe Forgejo container images are now based on Alpine 3.17 instead of Alpine\n3.16. It includes an upgrade from git 2.36.5 to git 2.38.4 and from openssh\n9.0p1 to openssh 9.1p1.\n\n## 1.18.5-0\n\nThis stable release contains an important security fix for Forgejo to raise\nthe protection against brute force attack on hashed passwords stored in the\ndatabase to match industry standards, as described in detail in a companion\nblog post.\n\n### Recommended Action\n\nWe strongly recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the\nlatest version as soon as possible.\n\nIf PASSWORD_HASH_ALGO is explicitly set in app.ini, comment it out so that the\nstronger algorithm is used instead.\n\nAll password hashes stored with another algorithm will be updated to the new\nalgorithm on the next usage of this password (e.g. a user provides the\npassword to the Forgejo server when they login). It does not require manual\nintervention.\n\n### Forgejo\n\n  * SECURITY\n\n    * Upgrade the default password hash algorithm to pbkdf2 with 320,000 iterations (#407)\n  * BUGFIXES\n\n    * Return the Forgejo semantic version instead of \"development\" (#381)\n\n### Gitea\n\n  * SECURITY\n\n    * Provide the ability to set password hash algorithm parameters (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22942) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22943)\n  * BUGFIXES\n\n    * Use --message=%s for git commit message (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23028) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23029)\n    * Render access log template as text instead of HTML (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23013) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23025)\n    * Fix the Manually Merged form (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23015) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23017)\n    * Use beforeCommit instead of baseCommit (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22949) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22996)\n    * Display attachments of review comment when comment content is blank (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23035) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23046)\n    * Return empty url for submodule tree entries (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23043) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23048)\n    * Notify on container image create (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22806) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22965)\n    * Some refactor about code comments(https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20821) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22707)\n\nNote that there is no Forgejo v1.18.4-N because Gitea v1.18.4 was replaced by\nGitea v1.18.5 a few days after its release because of a regression.

It was possible to reveal a\nuser's email address, which is problematic because users can choose to hide\ntheir email address from everyone. This was possible because the notification\nemail for a repository transfer request to an organization included every\nuser's email address in the owner team. This has been fixed by sending\nindividual emails instead and the code was refactored to prevent it from\nhappening again.\n\nWe strongly recommend that all installations are upgraded to the latest\nversion as soon as possible.\n\n### Gitea\n\n  * BUGFIXES\n\n    * When updating by rebase we need to set the environment for head repo (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22535) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22536)\n    * Mute all links in issue timeline (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22534)\n    * Truncate commit summary on repo files table.

On 17 January 2023, Git published the maintenance release\nv2.39.1, together with releases for older maintenance tracks v2.38.3, v2.37.5,\nv2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, and v2.30.7. All major\nGNU/Linux distributions also provide updated packages via their security\nupdate channels.\n\nWe strongly recommend that all installations running a version affected by the\nissues described below are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n  * When using a Forgejo binary: upgrade the git package to a version greater or equal to v2.39.1, v2.38.3, v2.37.5, v2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, or v2.30.7\n  * When using a Forgejo container image: docker pull codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:1.18.1-0\n\nRead more in the Forgejo blog.\n\n#### Release process stability\n\nThe release process based on Woodpecker CI was entirely reworked to be more\nresilient to transient errors. A new release is first uploaded into the new\nForgejo experimental organization for testing purposes.\n\nAutomated end to end testing of releases was implemented with a full\ndevelopment cycle including the creation of a new repository and a run of CI.\nIt relieves the user and developer from the burden of tedious manual testing.\n\n#### Container environment variables\n\nWhen running a container, all environment variables starting with FORGEJO__\ncan be used instead of GITEA__. For backward compatibility with existing\nscripts, it is still possible to use GITEA__ instead of FORGEJO__. For\ninstance:\n\n    \n    \n    docker run --name forgejo -e FORGEJO__security__INSTALL_LOCK=true codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:1.18.1-0\n\n#### Forgejo hook types\n\nA new forgejo hook type is available and behaves exactly the same as the\nexisting gitea hook type. It will be used to implement additional features\nspecific to Forgejo in a way that will be backward compatible with Gitea.\n\n#### X-Forgejo headers\n\nWherever a X-Gitea header is received or sent, an identical X-Forgejo is\nadded. For instance when a notification mail is sent, the X-Forgejo-Reason\nheader is set to explain why. Or when a webhook is sent, the X-Forgejo-Event\nheader is set with push, tag, etc. for Woodpecker CI to decide on an action.\n\n#### Look and feel fixes\n\nThe Forgejo theme was modified to take into account user feedback.\n\n### Gitea\n\n  * API\n\n    * Add sync_on_commit option for push mirrors api (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22271) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22292)\n

CI\n\nA new CI configuration based on Woodpecker CI was created. It is used to:\n\n  * run tests on every Forgejo pull request (compliance, unit tests and integration tests)\n  * publish the Forgejo v1.18.0-1 release, as binary packages for amd64, arm64 and armv6 and container images for amd64 and arm64, root and rootless\n\n#### Look and feel\n\nThe default themes were replaced by Forgejo themes and the landing page was\nmodified to display the Forgejo logo and names but the look and feel remains\notherwise identical to Gitea.\n\n#### Privacy\n\nGitea instances fetch https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/version.json weekly by\ndefault, which raises privacy concerns. In Forgejo this feature needs to be\nexplicitly activated at installation time or by modifying the configuration\nfile. Forgejo also provides an alternative RSS feed to be informed when a new\nrelease is published.\n\n### Gitea\n\n  * SECURITY\n\n    * Remove ReverseProxy authentication from the API (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22219) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22251)\n    * Support Go Vulnerability Management (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21139)\n    * Forbid HTML string tooltips (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20935)\n  * BREAKING\n\n    * Rework mailer settings (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/18982)\n    * Remove U2F support (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20141)\n    * Refactor i18n to locale (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20153)\n    * Enable contenthash in filename for dynamic assets (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20813)\n  * FEATURES\n\n    * Add color previews in markdown (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21474)\n    * Allow package version sorting (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21453)\n    * Add support for Chocolatey/NuGet v2 API (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21393)\n    * Add API endpoint to get changed files of a PR (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21177)\n    * Add filetree on left of diff view (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/21012)\n    * Support Issue forms and PR forms (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20987)\n    * Add support for Vagrant packages (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20930)\n    * Add support for npm unpublish (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20688)\n    * Add badge capabilities to users (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20607)\n    * Add issue filter for Author (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20578)\n    * Add KaTeX rendering to Markdown.
