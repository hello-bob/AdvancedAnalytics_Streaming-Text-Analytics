It\nallowed me to peek into my past self and retrospect my life.\n\nIf you're like me and haven't quite found your mojo in keeping a daily\njournal, this lightweight and semi-automatic journaling system might be what\nyou need.\n\nAnd this doesn't have to be on YouTube or any social media.\n\nYour browser bookmarks, read-later list, email inbox or even your Amazon\npurchase history can tell you more about your interest and behavioural changes\nover the years.\n\nWe have already given these big tech companies our daily activity data in\nexchange for using their services.\n\nWhy don't we leverage their well-crafted tools and some of the collected data\nto learn more about ourselves?\n\nFind your accidental journal.\n\nShare this article on /\n\nSubscribe for more like this \u2192\n\n## Be 1% better every week\n\nJoin 3,862 others & continue your Firesides journey with more articles like\nthis one and hand-picked:\n\n  * Apps\n  * Books\n  * Videos\n  * Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nMore on this topic\n\n### 5-4-3-2-1\n\nA quick 2-minute exercise to pull you back to reality from anxious thoughts.\n\n3 min read\n\n### Chasing Speed Breakers\n\nHow I intentionally slow down every day to progress faster in the long run.\n\n2 min read\n\nUp next\n\n### Anticipating Regret Led To Quitting My Job\n\nRegret is a powerful tool.
