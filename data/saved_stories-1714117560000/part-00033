According to the EIA, crude inventories rose 5.84 mb w/w and\noil product inventories rose 6.57 mb; however, the builds relative to the\nfive-year average were modest, at just 0.11mb for crude oil and 1.24mb for\nproducts. U.S. commercial inventories now stand 16.47mb below the five-year\naverage, with crude inventories at Cushing 7.35 mb below the five-year\naverage. The EIA also estimates U.S. crude oil output clocked in at 13.1 mb/d\nfor a fifth consecutive week, 0.8 mb/d higher y/y but 0.2 mb/d lower than\nDecember 2023 production.\n\nWhereas the short-term oil price outlook appears murky, leading oil agencies\nremain largely bullish about the long-term outlook. Last week, the\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) published its latest monthly Oil Market\nReport (OMR), including its first detailed 2025 forecast. The Paris-based\nenergy watchdog predicted that global oil demand in 2025 demand will be 1.147\nmb/d higher than 2024 levels, higher than the 1.0 mb/d estimate it had\nreleased in June 2023. Other leading agencies have predicted even higher\ndemand growth in 2025: the EIA forecast is 1.351 mb/d, Standard Chartered\u2019s\nforecast is 1.444 mb/d while the OPEC Secretariat has predicted a 1.847 mb/d\nincrease in demand. Related: World Oil Demand Jumped To 5-Year Seasonal High\nin February\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInterestingly, over the medium-and long-term, only the IEA sees global oil\ndemand peaking before 2030, even in its most optimistic forecast (high\ngrowth). However, the IEA says an oil demand peak doesn't necessarily mean a\nrapid plunge in fossil fuel consumption is imminent, adding that it will\nprobably be followed by \u201can undulating plateau lasting for many years.\u201d\n\nThe EIA is the most bullish on long-term oil demand, and has predicted a\ndemand peak will come in 2050 while the OPEC Secretariat sees it coming five\nyears earlier. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has predicted global oil demand\nwill hit 110.2 mb/d in 2030 and increase further to 113.5 mb/d in 2035.\nHowever, the commodity experts have not projected a demand peak beyond the end\nof their modeling horizon in 2035. According to StanChart, a structural long-\nterm peak is very unlikely within 10 years despite a high probability of\ncyclical downturns over the period. StanChart has argued that the current gulf\nbetween demand views creates significant investment uncertainty which that\u2019s\nlikely to force longer-term prices higher.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn other words, the energy agencies appear to agree that an oil demand peak is\nnowhere on the horizon.\n\nSource: Standard Chartered Research\n\nTraders Still Betting On The Energy Sector\n\nThe energy sector has been a standout performer in the current year, managing\na 15.8% return in the year-to-date, the second highest amongst 11 U.S. market\nsectors. However, the sector has slipped nearly 5% over the past week with\nWall Street experts warning that oil prices sit in a precarious position,\nwhich could lead to price swings as geopolitical tensions continue to escalate\nall throughout the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThankfully, traders are still betting on the energy sector.\n\nLast week, U.S. fund assets (exchange-traded funds and conventional funds)\nrecorded $29.7B in net outflows--in large part to money market funds--marking\nthe third week in four that money flowed from the space. Money market funds\nrecorded $35.3B in net outflows, equity funds lost $1B, commodities funds gave\nback $207M, and mixed-assets funds observed outflows of $168M.\n\nInterestingly, two funds that recorded the most significant amount of capital\ninflows on the week were the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP)\nat $2.8B and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) at $756M.\n\nOil and gas stocks also remain among the least shorted. Last month, average\nshort interest across energy stocks in the S&P 500 index increased 14 basis\npoints to 2.56% of shares floating at the end of the month. APA Corp.\n(NYSE:APA) was the most-shorted energy stock, with 22.1 million shares sold\nshort as of March 31, or just 5.98% of the shares float. EQT (NYSE:EQT) was\nthe second most shorted energy stock at 5.85% of shares float, while\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Valero (NYSE:VLO) were in third and fourth\nplace with 5.58% and 3.35%, of their floats sold short, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn comparison, medical services company IMAC Holdings Inc. is the most shorted\nstock in the S&P 500 with nearly 95% of its float sold short.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Should We Keep Investing in Oil and Gas?
