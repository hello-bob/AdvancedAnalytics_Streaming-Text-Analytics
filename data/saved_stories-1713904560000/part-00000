The continual decay\nprocess means the generators produce slightly less power each year.\n\nHow much longer the Voyagers can continue is uncertain, but engineers have\nuntil now always come up with strategies to eke out a few extra years of\noperations.\n\nVoyager-2 is a little behind its twin and moving slightly slower.\n\nIt's just over 20 billion km (13 billion miles) from Earth.\n\nEven though both are travelling at over 15 km per second (9 miles/s), they\nwould not approach another star for tens of thousands of years.\n\nThe Sun\n\nNasa\n\nSpace exploration\n\nRelated\n\nWATCH\n\n## A look inside the Nasa jet chasing the solar eclipse\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\nUS & Canada\n\nWATCH\n\n## Here's how you can safely watch solar eclipse\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## India's Sun mission reaches final destination\n\n6 Jan 2024\n\nIndia\n\nMore\n\n1 day ago\n\n## European astronaut rookies make the grade\n\nThe European Space Agency's latest intake of astronauts complete their basic\ntraining.\n\n1 day ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Preventing space contamination rises up the agenda\n\nAgencies and scientists from around the world head to the UK to share space-\nexploration techniques.\n\n1 day ago\n\nBeds, Herts & Bucks\n\n7 days ago\n\n## Nasa says part of ISS station hit Florida home\n\nThe 0.7kg metal object tore through man's roof after re-entering Earth's\natmosphere.\n\n7 days ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n7 days ago\n\n## Meteorite 'repeatedly transformed' on space journey\n\nResearchers say the Winchcombe meteorite is \"a remarkable piece of space\nhistory\".\n\n7 days ago\n\nGloucestershire\n\n8 days ago\n\n## Nasa: 'New plan needed to return rocks from Mars'\n\nThe US space agency is seeking a cheaper, faster solution to bring Martian\nrocks to Earth for study.\n\n8 days ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
