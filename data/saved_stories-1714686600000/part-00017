Unique\n> passwords installed by default are still permitted.\n>\n> The Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022 (PSTI)\n> introduces new minimum-security standards for manufacturers, and demands\n> that these companies are open with consumers about how long their products\n> will receive security updates for.\n\nThe UK may be the first country, but as far as I know, California is the first\njurisdiction. It banned default passwords in 2018, the law taking effect in\n2020.\n\nThis sort of thing benefits all of us everywhere. IoT manufacturers aren\u2019t\nmaking two devices, one for California and one for the rest of the US. And\nthey\u2019re not going to make one for the UK and another for the rest of Europe,\neither. They\u2019ll remove the default passwords and sell those devices\neverywhere.\n\nAnother news article.\n\nTags: botnets, Internet of Things, passwords, UK\n\nPosted on May 2, 2024 at 7:05 AM \u2022 6 Comments\n\n  * Two clicks for more privacy: The Facebook Like button will be enabled once you click here.

The real damage is\nvendor backdoor default passwords, not user facing ones.\n\nJos \u2022 May 2, 2024 8:12 AM\n\n@Peter IOT devices are also a tool to obfuscate identity, if I am a foreign\nstate actor I can all of a sudden make my actions appear from my target\ncountry, making it far less suspicious. Using several compromised IOT devices\nI might even go entirely below radar when I\u2019m able to work my attack from\nseveral IOT sources scattered in the country in sequence. While it\u2019s marketed\nas \u201cconsumer protection\u201d that\u2019s not what drives the legislation.\n\nGilbert \u2022 May 2, 2024 10:50 AM\n\nI am afraid this might not work. A lot of politicians think you can use laws\nto fix problems. But criminals do not obey law. Chinese companies that put\nhardcoded root passwords into products they sale.. They don\u2019t even tell\ncustomers that those passwords do exist. And the UK government is not going to\nunpack, disassemble and study each appliance firmware to check that, because\nit takes time, money and needs to be done on each update.\n\nBig sellers of hardware might follow the law because they have a huge market\nand don\u2019t want their products to be sale-forbidden in UK. But IoT appliances\nare numerous, companies come and go, and they don\u2019t really care. Most of them\neven put \u201cEC\u201d marks on their products and they don\u2019t even follow european\u2019s\ncertifications.\n\nWhat the UK is really doing is asking people that put hardcoded, default\npasswords into their products to stop doing it ? They already know it\u2019s not a\ngood idea to hardcode those things. Just look at Cisco : how many times did\nthey got burned with security issues because of those hardcoded \u201croot level\u201d\npasswords in their products ? Again, and again and they keep hardcoding those\n: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/10/cisco-cant-stop-using-hard-\ncoded-passwords.html\n\nThose that do that in covert will surely not obey nor follow those laws.\n\nThis is one serious issue with politicians : they think complex problems have\nsimple solutions. And they believe that making a law will fix the problem.\n\nIt won\u2019t.\n\nHans \u2022 May 2, 2024 11:03 AM\n\n@Gilbert And the UK government is not going to unpack, disassemble and study\neach appliance firmware to check that, because it takes time, money and needs\nto be done on each update.\n\nThat is not the job of the government. That is the executive branch and even\nthey can delegate to private control organizations. The Law makers have to\ncreate the basis for the executive to work on.\n\nAnd they believe that making a law will fix the problem.\n\nNot arguing wit the \u201csimple solutins\u201d complaint. But those laws give a basis\nfor the executive or judicative to work on. Cisco might forget passwords if\nthere is no real risc. But they will not risk getting banned from the british\nmarket. Even a thread of a large fine may be enough for a money oriented\nbusiness. Without laws at such, that threat does not exist.\n\nWho? \u2022 May 2, 2024 11:09 AM\n\nA nightmare for Fortinet, even if not exactly an IoT manufacturer. They are\neven worse than Cisco in this area.\n\nnoname \u2022 May 2, 2024 11:16 AM\n\nWord is if you come across a default password to first tell the manufacturer.\n\nAlso the Office for Product Safety Standards (OPSS).\n\nHope, where applicable, users feel empowered to make passwords random.\n\n(2) Passwords must be\u2014 (a)unique per product; or (b)defined by the user of the\nproduct.\n\nhttps://www.centerforcybersecuritypolicy.org/insights-and-research/the-uk-\npsti-act-comes-into-effect\n\nSubscribe to comments on this entry\n\n## Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\u2190 AI Voice Scam\n\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis.\n\nPowered by WordPress Hosted by Pressable\n\n### About Bruce Schneier\n\nI am a public-interest technologist, working at the intersection of security,\ntechnology, and people.
