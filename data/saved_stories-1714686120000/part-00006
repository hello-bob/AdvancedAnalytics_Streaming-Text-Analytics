The adjustable Quest head strap and connected battery\nreplace the traditional helmet insert, and additional components were\n3D-printed with PLA filament.

The discovery of\nacetylene in the early days of the industrial revolution added a versatile new\nfuel to welding. At the end of the 19th century, two engineers invented metal\narc welding, and more recently, the rise of robotic welding systems and\nadvances in high-strength alloys expanded welding applications.\n\nDespite a long history of technological improvements, welding remains a\nchallenging skill to learn. It requires a combination of technical knowledge\nand manual dexterity. And given its prevalence throughout numerous industries,\nincluding manufacturing, construction, aerospace and automotive, the need for\nskilled welders remains strong. According to the American Welding Society,\nU.S. employers are now facing a deficit of 375,000 welders.\n\nAt Carnegie Mellon University, researchers are addressing the problem by\ndeveloping a new way to train welders that once again applies an emerging\ntechnology. Dina El-Zanfaly, an assistant professor in the School of Design,\nand Daragh Byrne, an associate teaching professor in the School of\nArchitecture, worked with a team of researchers to develop an extended reality\n(XR) welding helmet and torch system to help welders acquire the embodied\nknowledge they need to master the challenging skill.\n\n\"Not only is this a really cool project, but it also incorporates the key\nobjectives of the MFI mission,\" said Sandra DeVincent Wolf, the executive\ndirector of MFI. \"It is groundbreaking research that advances manufacturing\ntechnology, contributes to workforce development and engages partners from the\nlocal community.\"\n\nExtended reality combines virtual reality (VR), which is a computer-generated\nenvironment that simulates a realistic or imaginary experience; augmented\nreality (AR), which combines computer-generated information with a user's\nreal-world environment; and mixed reality (MR), where real-world and digital\nobjects coexist and interact in real time. Together, these features create an\nimmersive experience that allows users to interact with information,\nenvironments and digital content in real-time.\n\nTraining welders requires the development of hand-eye coordination and a keen\nperception of the position and movement of the body in space. This embodied\nknowledge is acquired through hands-on interactions with tools, and materials\nand can be difficult to replicate in training scenarios.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon researchers worked to better understand the training\nchallenges by organizing a series of co-design workshops. They worked with\neight instructors and four students at the Industrial Arts Workshop (IAW), a\nnonprofit youth welding training program in the Hazelwood neighborhood of\nPittsburgh, to develop a system that integrates a welding helmet and torch\nwith a Meta Quest Pro and a machine learning model that enhances the embodied\nlearning of welding in three key ways.\n\n## Visual XR guides and integrated motion sensing\n\nThe highly immersive and embodied nature of welding practice makes it\nexceptionally difficult for an instructor to visually monitor the process and\nprovide feedback to the student in a timely, safe and audible manner. Neither\nwritten instruction nor feedback can convey the nuanced, hands-on skill in\nreal-time.\n\nThe researchers overcame these obstacles by modifying a welding helmet with a\nMeta Quest headset that displays a series of visual feedback mechanisms, which\nguide the student during training sessions and provide a record of their\nperformance that instructors can assess during or after the session.\n\nTwo separate XR indicators within the welding helmet show the slight changes\nand adjustments the welding student should make to maintain the correct angle\nof the welding gun that is connected to the Quest Touch controller. The status\nicons, which are near the top of the headset viewport, allow users to see the\nfeedback without taking their focus away from the active weld. The status\nicons also give a much clearer overview of performance for instructors and\nusers while viewing the live playback.\n\nThe researchers leveraged feedback from the workshop instructors to determine\nhow to calibrate the XR representation of the weld to a real workpiece so that\nusers can set the start and endpoints of the weld line with the welding gun to\nset the position of the scrolling guideline they need to follow.\n\nA welder uses the gun to place coordinate locations for the start and end of\nthe weld, linking the real-world weld line to a graphic representation in the\nXR display. Credit: Carnegie Mellon University\n\nSensing sonic cues during welding practice\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon researchers learned from workshop instructors that\nexperienced welders are able to assess welds through active listening. So\ninstead of evaluating welds visually after they are completed, their system\ncan use an auditory-based method to diagnosis the weld in real time.\n\n\"For example, a good welding speed should sound like sizzling bacon, not\npopcorn, according to the instructors,\" explained El-Zanfaly.\n\nMetal inert gas welding involves extruding a metal wire through the tip of the\nwelding gun, shielding the wire with inert gas, and using the heat generated\nby short-circuit current between the wire and the workpiece to fuse the two\nmetals together. Incorrect settings of this system result in poor-quality\nwelds. For example, if the amperage of the welder is set too low, it will\nresult in an excessively thin weld bead and lead to inconsistent penetration\nof the working plate.\n\nAccording to prior research and feedback from the AIW instructors, different\nsettings result in changes of the welding sound, which offers potentially\nimportant training feedback. But the extreme heat, light and sound conditions\nin the welding space\u2014together with the bulky welding helmet and other personal\nprotective gear needed to guard against the intense heat, sparks, ultraviolet\nradiation and metal splatter\u2014limits the welder's ability to perceive this\nauditory stimulus.\n\nBy employing tiny machine learning (TinyML) enabled sound detection to\nrecognize key factors such as settings and tip distance, the researchers\ntrained and deployed their model to provide visual feedback that indicates\nerrors detected by sounds, such as those made when the tip of the gun is held\ntoo far away from the welding plate.\n\nThe researchers asked experienced welders to repeatedly perform the same\nwelding movement, only changing one setting per weld. They collected more than\n20 minutes of audio data, evenly distributed across the category settings to\nuse in training and testing a TinyML classification model.\n\nTinyML focuses on deploying and running machine learning models on resource-\nconstrained devices, such as a microcontroller, which in this case was\nconnected to the augmented helmet to provide feedback. The researchers trained\nthe TinyML model to alert trainees to attend to common errors, such as\nincorrect settings and gun tip distance.\n\nSound was also used to detect the beginning and end of welds. Researchers\ncollected 19 minutes of welding sound using recordings from five different\ndevices simultaneously\u2014two microcontrollers, two Samsung smartphones and a USB\nmicrophone\u2014to train a classification system that could detect welding with 97%\naccuracy. This classifier replaced the need to electromechanically detect\ninteractions with the physical button on the welding gun, which was used to\ninitiate welding tracking and to make the system more portable.\n\n## Pre-welding meditation\n\nDuring the workshops, researchers saw that instructors encouraged students to\nuse mediation and breathing exercises before starting to weld as a way to\ninduce relaxation and foster a sense of focus to offset the effects of the\nwelding environment, which can be overwhelming due to loud noises, sparks,\nheat and the smell of burning.\n\nIn order to enhance mindfulness practices, the researchers programmed the\nplatform to begin each welding session by encouraging trainees to engage in\nbreathing exercises. They also placed an anemometer near the mouth and nose\ninside the welding helmet to measure the exhaled wind speed of breath and\ntrack the breathing pattern over time in order to develop system prompts to\nhelp welding students regulate their breathing for improved task performance.\n\nThe system's ability to sense motion, detect sound and enhance users' focus\nthrough mediation and breathing exercises can help students transfer the\nskills they acquire in the virtual training to actual welding practice. Its\nability to provide guidance in real time provides numerous advantages for both\nstudents and instructors who otherwise must rely on information derived after\na weld is complete to assess the performance. The overall approach could also\ninform crafts and skill training in XR systems beyond welding training.\n\n\"A really exciting aspect of our work is the ability of our system to enable\nin-situ welding experiences using a lightly modified off-the-shelf XR and\nwelding setup,\" explained El-Zanfaly.\n\nTheir work has already received recognition\u2014receiving awards at the 2023\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Interactive Surfaces\nand Spaces and at the 2024 ACM Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied\nInteractions.\n\nMoving forward, the team plans to pursue numerous opportunities to improve\nboth the technical dimensions of the work and the embodied experience. They\nplan to deploy the platform in A/B lab studies and over multiple weeks at IAW\nto assess how extended use of this device contributes to the formation of\nskills, habits and the novice experience.\n\nProvided by Carnegie Mellon University\n\nCitation: Machine learning and extended reality used to train welders (2024,\nApril 25) retrieved 2 May 2024 from\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-machine-reality-welders.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
