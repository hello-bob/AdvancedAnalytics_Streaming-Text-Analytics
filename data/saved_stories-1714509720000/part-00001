The researchers say AF needs to be treated as a chronic illness with\nserious long-term consequences.\n\nAF, or AFib, and its close medical cousin, atrial flutter, are associated with\ncomplications such as stroke, heart failure, and heart attack. While there\u2019s\nan understandable focus on treating these conditions to prevent acute\ncomplications, less research has looked at what\u2019s happening in the long term.\n\nNow, a study led by researchers from the University of Queensland\u2019s (UQ)\nFaculty of Medicine examined clinical outcomes up to 10 years after an acute\nhospital admission for AF or atrial flutter. The findings are rather grim.\n\nMore Stories\n\nEnvironment\n\nPlastic embedded with plastic-eating spores is degradable \u2013 and tougher\n\nBiology\n\nT.

AF or atrial flutter\nwas the primary diagnosis. The primary outcome was death from all causes,\nincluding deaths that occurred in the community. Secondary outcomes were loss\nin life expectancy attributable to AF or flutter, associated outcomes (e.g.,\nstroke, heart failure, heart attack) linked to AF or flutter, re-\nhospitalizations for AF or flutter, and whether the patient was treated by\ncatheter ablation or cardioversion.\n\nCatheter ablation, or cardiac ablation, involves guiding a thin, flexible tube\n(catheter) to the heart via a blood vessel. Heat or extreme cold is applied to\nthe area that is causing the irregular heart rhythm, forming scars that block\nthe irregular beats. Electric cardioversion is far less invasive. It uses\nquick, low-energy electric shocks applied to the chest to revert the heart\nback into a regular rhythm. Chemical or pharmacological cardioversion uses\ndrugs to return the heart to a regular rhythm.\n\nOne year after discharge, 91.4% of patients survived, dropping to 72.7% at\nfive years. At 10 years, the survival rate had fallen to 55.2%. Compared with\nan age, sex, and region-matched general population, patients hospitalized for\nAF or atrial flutter had, on average, a 2.6-year loss in life expectancy. When\ndifferent age groups were considered, the loss in life expectancy ranged from\n1.6 years in those aged 80 and over to 3.4 years in 35-to-49-year-olds.\n\nAn ECG showing atrial fibrillation (AF) and the closely related rhythm\ndisturbance, atrial flutter\n\nDepositphotos\n\nIn terms of AF-related complications, over the 10-year period, 11% of patients\nwere re-hospitalized for a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), a brief\nblockage of blood flow to the brain that may warn of a future stroke. Some\n16.8% were re-hospitalized for heart failure, making it the most common AF-\nassociated outcome. Re-hospitalization because of a recurrence of AF or\nflutter was 21.3% at one year, 35.3% at five years, and 41.2% by 10 years.\n\nDuring the initial hospitalization, only 0.3% of patients underwent catheter\nablation for AF. After discharge and within the 10-year study period, that\nnumber rose to 6.5%. Considering catheter ablation is one of the most\neffective treatments for the condition, that number is both curious and\nconcerning.\n\n\u201cIt may mean this procedure [catheter ablation] was underused in Australian\nand New Zealand hospitals,\u201d said cardiologist Isuru Ranasinghe, a study co-\nauthor.\n\nFor comparison, a US study published in 2009, a year after the current study\ncommenced, reported that the rate of catheter ablation in AF patients\nincreased from 0.06% in 1990 to 0.79% in 2005.\n\nThe study does indicate, said the researchers, that there needs to be a\ngreater focus on the long-term sequelae of AF and atrial flutter.\n\n\u201cClinicians currently primarily focus on preventing the risk of stroke, but\nthese findings emphasize the need to consider atrial fibrillation as a chronic\ndisease with multiple serious downstream consequences,\u201d Ranasinghe said.\n\u201cThere needs to be a greater focus on preventing recurrent hospitalizations\nand heart failure.\u201d\n\nThey suggest another way to bring down these stark numbers is by enhancing\npatient education.\n\n\u201cBetter patient education in areas such as blood pressure control and weight\nloss, as well as appropriate preventative therapy in hospital and primary care\ncould improve outcomes for people with AF,\u201d said Ranasinghe.\n\nAmericans, while this may be an Australia-New Zealand study, you're not out of\nthe woods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that,\nin 2019, AF was mentioned on 183,321 death certificates and was the underlying\ncause of death in 26,535 of those deaths. And it's estimated that 12.1 million\npeople in the US will have AF by 2030.\n\nThe study was published in the European Heart Journal.\n\nSource: UQ\n\n## Tags\n\nMedicalHeartHeart FailureUniversity of Queensland\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n2 comments\n\nPaul McClure\n\nBefore realizing his writing passion, Paul worked as an intensive care nurse\nand a criminal defense lawyer for many years.

Sounds as if it would also make\nsense to catch and manage atrial fibrillation earlier so that emergency\nhospital admissions aren't the beginning of the therapeutic window.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
