However, Snap has\nbeen improving its advertising targeting capabilities, with the number of\nsmall and medium advertisers on the app rising 85% in the last year.\n\n### Filtering through\n\nAlthough its appeal may have peaked in the US \u2014 where users haven\u2019t really\ngrown for years \u2014 Snap has found success overseas. Early last year, the app\nreached 200M monthly active users in India, home to an estimated 20% global\nshare of Gen Z, Snapchat\u2019s primary user base. And, with TikTok caught in\nCongress\u2019s crosshairs, Snap could find itself perfectly placed to win a larger\nshare of eyeballs in its most lucrative market.\n\n### More Business\n\nSee all Business\n\nJack Raines\n\nMore Ads\n\n5h\n\nTesla said advertising was useless.

According to a memo sent to\nplayers by the players union, the MLB plans to modify its heavily ridiculed\nuniforms that \u201ceveryone hates\u201d by next year.\n\nOn the way out: too-small lettering, mismatched tops and bottoms, the\nopposite-of-sweat-wicking fabric, and the much-mocked nearly see-through pants\nthat don\u2019t fit.\n\nThe pants, likened to toilet paper at a highway rest stop, are reportedly\nthinner for performance reasons \u2014 but if performance is at the root of the\nredesign, they probably shouldn\u2019t rip during games. Players largely aren't\nbuying the rationale, arguing the jersey changes are a money-saving measure.\n\n\"This has been entirely a Nike issue,\" the memo read, laying blame for the\nuniforms, created by Nike and manufactured by Fanatics (which the league owns\na small stake in), entirely on Nike.
