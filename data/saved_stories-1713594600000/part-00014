Now they want serendipity.\n\nBy Faith Hill\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nListen to this article\n\n00:00\n\n14:47\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.\n\nSay you\u2019re in a bar. You see someone across the room who looks appealing. But\ndo they think the same of you? You don\u2019t want to stare for too long, so you\nturn back to your drink. No worries\u2014the electronic tentacles attached to your\nshoulders give a wiggle, indicating that the hottie, mercifully, has glanced\nyour way.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of a device called \u201cRipple,\u201d named, I guess, for the\nundulating sensation triggered by a stranger\u2019s horny gaze. Equipped with two\ncameras, it connects computer-vision technology with sensors to detect when\nsomeone is looking at you. (Unfortunately, it can\u2019t really distinguish between\nthe eyes of an admirer and someone noticing you because you\u2019re wearing\ntentacles out to the bar.) Ripple\u2019s creators pitched it as a way to help\npeople meet in person\u2014the old-fashioned way, with, um, one minor difference.\n\nIt was developed in 2017\u2014five years after Tinder and Hinge launched, when\npeople were getting nervous about the effects of dating apps. They\u2019d created a\nsociety-wide experiment: \u201cWhat if we stopped dating people we meet in our\nregular lives and started building some other system, where major corporations\nuse algorithms to figure out how we meet?\u201d Eli Finkel, who studies romantic\nrelationships at Northwestern University, told me. What would it mean for\ntechnology to mediate romantic connection? Would it make us all irreparably\nincapable of courting on our own?\n\nRead: The rise of dating-app fatigue\n\nRipple never got big, but it was only the most memeworthy in a long line of\nsimilar offerings made for people both sick of and dependent on dating apps.\nThere\u2019s the \u201cpear ring,\u201d designed to be worn by mingling singles to signal\ntheir eligibility. Or speed-dating events, an old concept that\u2019s become newly\npopular. Some dating apps are, paradoxically, designed to combat your dating-\napp fatigue. Take Thursday, which unlocks swiping for one day a week\u2014and then\nholds a real-life soiree for people to meet. Or Strike, which notifies you\nwhen someone you\u2019ve matched with is nearby. Or Happn, which shows you users\nyou\u2019ve physically crossed paths with, and promises to \u201cuse technology to\nimprove real life, not to replace it.\u201d\n\nIf \u201creal life\u201d means finding love face-to-face, rather than through a screen,\nyou can\u2019t blame people for wanting to return to it\u2014especially considering how\nmany shows and movies involve soulmates connecting via fluke run-ins, reaching\nfor the same pair of gloves or physically running into each other on the\nsidewalk. More than a decade after the dawn of dating apps, we\u2019re seeing the\nemergence of a strain of meet-cute nostalgia. Perhaps more than ever, singles\ntoday idealize romance that doesn\u2019t involve the internet\u2014the kind that\u2019s\nphysical and visceral, and that finds you.\n\nBut people aren\u2019t so used to waiting around for love to find them anymore, and\nthey seem less willing to risk rejection by putting themselves out there in\nperson. And anyway, the utopia of serendipitous encounters exists only in our\nimagination. Meet-cutes won\u2019t fix modern dating.\n\nFor much of human history, single people couldn\u2019t usually just decide to go on\na date. Before the Industrial Revolution, your family or another trusted\ncommunity member would likely set you up with the person you\u2019d marry. Later,\npeople commonly met through their social circles or at places of worship,\nschool, or eventually work; you could try to be flirty and open to connection,\nor put yourself in situations to meet new people, but you could only control\nso much. You were under the heel of fate.\n\nDating apps radically upended that powerlessness. They created a practical\nkind of agency\u2014the ability to \u201cgo out and make it happen,\u201d Paul Eastwick, a UC\nDavis psychologist, told me. They also created another issue entirely: the\nburnout that comes from sorting through a deluge of options, many of them far\nfrom ideal. Still, that\u2019s arguably preferable to having no options at\nall\u2014which could happen pretty quickly if you\u2019d exhausted your pool of friends-\nof-friends (and you weren\u2019t going around spilling orange juice on charming\nstrangers). \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bummer, even today, to not have found somebody after\nworking at it,\u201d Finkel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly nice to know that those 100\ndates were available, even though they weren\u2019t great.\u201d And online dating has\nled to a ton of successful relationships. In fact, it\u2019s the most common way\nthat American couples now meet. The people complaining about apps, Finkel\nsaid, \u201cdon\u2019t know what it was like to be single in 1980.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just it\u2014many of them literally don\u2019t. Plenty of young people dating\ntoday have never done so offline. They\u2019re used to having the agency that was\nso novel when apps first emerged. Now some of them, tired of the\nresponsibility that comes with being in the driver\u2019s seat, want to let go of\nthe wheel. What they covet is just the opposite of pragmatic efficiency:\nserendipity.\n\nRead: America is sick of swiping\n\nMedia outlets have proclaimed for a while now that young people are turning\naway from online dating\u2014but it\u2019s unclear to what degree that\u2019s actually\nhappening. One commonly cited study found that 79 percent of college students\ndon\u2019t use dating apps regularly. That makes sense, though: College students\nare meeting people on campus. Whether or not the apps are dying, they\u2019re not\ndead yet\u2014and definitely not for young people. In 2023, 60 percent of Tinder\u2019s\n75 million monthly active users were younger than 35.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re enjoying it. In one 2022 survey, nearly 80\npercent of 18-to-54-year-old respondents reported feeling emotional burnout or\nfatigue when online dating. Liesel Sharabi, a communications professor at\nArizona State University, has found that meeting on an app still carries some\nstigma, despite how common it is. \u201cI think people like the idea of having that\nlove story to tell,\u201d she told me. Perhaps young daters especially. They seem\nto be romantics: A 2024 Hinge report found that Gen Z participants were 30\npercent more likely than Millennials to believe each person has one soulmate\nand 39 percent more likely to consider themselves romantically idealistic. For\nthem, Sharabi told me, the old meet-cute ideal is particularly intriguing:\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like nostalgia for a dating experience that they\u2019ve never had.\u201d\n\nIt might also be harder for them to get that experience if they want it. Young\nAmericans are hanging out less on average, so they have fewer opportunities to\nchat someone up in a social setting. And less practice might mean doing so\nfeels more intimidating. Sharabi recalled one Gen Z research participant\nsaying they probably would never approach someone intriguing at a party;\ninstead, they told her, \u201cI might see if they\u2019re online.\u201d Of course, if you\nslide into someone\u2019s DMs or find them on an app, you could still get snubbed.\nBut a nonresponse is harder to interpret than a verbal \u201cno thank you\u201d in a way\nthat can be comforting: Perhaps the other person didn\u2019t see the message, or\nthey got too busy to respond. Even a clear \u201cno\u201d stings less through the\ndistance afforded by a screen. The Hinge survey found that Gen Z daters fear\nrejection \u201cmost acutely\u201d: More than half of them said that concern has kept\nthem from pursuing a possible relationship, and they\u2019re 10 percent more likely\nthan Millennial respondents to say they\u2019ve missed out on a romantic\nopportunity because of it.\n\nThat helps explain the meet-cute-nostalgia industry offering to make in-person\nencounters easier. Yet most of those efforts, frankly, are flops\u2014ineffective,\nimpractical, even bizarre ways to force romance to unfold in a manner that\nisn\u2019t natural to modern courtship. Happn, designed for finding \u201cyour crush in\nthe places you love,\u201d presented me with a bevy of people who lived around\nme\u2014which is pretty much what every other dating app does. It kept proclaiming\nthat a user \u201clives in New York City too,\u201d as if that was a profound, romantic\ncoincidence. The app Strike hypothetically lets you buy a \u201cwearable\u201d (a little\nrectangular device that fits in your pocket) to notify you when a match is\nnearby\u2014in real time, so you can actually approach them\u2014but I couldn\u2019t set up\nan account, nor could I reach anyone at the company to help me. The major\nonline-dating companies are trying to join the trend too; Hinge is offering\ntens of thousands of dollars in grants to any organization that can help \u201cGen\nZ find belonging and community in person,\u201d and Bumble is hosting \u201cIRL\u201d dating\nevents. But when I searched for one in New York\u2014the Big Apple!\u2014I was told, \u201cNo\nresults match your search.\u201d I would have tried speed-dating, but I couldn\u2019t\nswallow paying $30 just to sit through two hours of awkward conversations. (I\nwould, however, be willing to bet $30 that I\u2019ll never see anyone wearing a\npear ring.)\n\nOn TikTok, real-life-chat gurus promise lessons like teaching \u201cthe most\nnatural, non-awkward way to approach that cute stranger.\u201d (The channel \u201cHow to\nTalk to Strangers\u201d had 61.6 million views at the time of my writing this.)\nCommon advice is to ask for directions, make eye contact, give a compliment,\nor pose a specific question\u2014like what someone\u2019s favorite nearby coffee shop\nis. But it seemed to me that this might have a higher success rate for a\nnotably hot person than for most everyone else. \u201cIt literally doesn\u2019t matter\nwhat you look like\u201d as long as you\u2019re confident, one TikToker proclaimed\nbefore adding, \u201cI mean, obviously you have to look, like, somewhat pretty.\u201d\nEastwick also pointed out that this brand of how-to romantic instruction is\n\u201ctailored to pick up certain kinds of people attending certain kinds of\nestablishments at a particular period of time.\u201d It might have worked for\nsomeone else, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work for you.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t wrong to crave in-person connection. The shortcomings of dating\napps have been, at this point, well covered: They can encourage shallowness,\nfor one thing. They\u2019re rife with harassment, for another. And they often set\nyou up with people whom you share no context with beyond geographical\nproximity. Sharabi has found that on average, relationships that start on\ndating apps are slightly less stable than those that begin in person, and\npartners are slightly less satisfied. Her explanation: \u201cYou\u2019re meeting people\nwho you have no prior connection with. That can have long-term effects when\nyou try to integrate them into your network.\u201d That is to say, you\u2019re dating\nstrangers.\n\nThe solution to those problems is probably not finding strangers to date in\nperson rather than online. Doing so would still mean going for someone who\nremains mostly mysterious except for their appearance, and you still might not\nshare anything beyond proximity. Besides, random meet-cutes were never the\n\u201cnatural\u201d way to find a partner, or even the most common way. Before apps,\nmost couples met through friends or family. When Eastwick hears that people\nfeel guilty for not wanting to chat someone up in public, he tells them:\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. That\u2019s a skill that you can learn if you want, but it\u2019s really\nnot central to the way that we meet each other.\u201d On the phone with me, he\nlaughed about the idea of, say, striking up conversation with a lone bombshell\nat the end of the bar. \u201cIs this bar in an airport? Like, where is this\nhappening? This is very odd to me.\u201d\n\nRead: The golden age of dating doesn\u2019t exist\n\nNow the airport-bar kind of encounter is probably even less likely to happen\nthan in the past\u2014not just because dating apps have made people unaccustomed to\ntaking romantic risks, but also because they\u2019ve (fortunately) let us\nprioritize consent, at least in the realm of early propositions. Society has\nlargely become more attuned to the discomfort that unwanted advances can\ncause, Finkel told me. The notion of a loose, spontaneous culture of in-person\nflirting sounds nice\u2014except that it would entail some interactions you never\nwanted.\n\nOf course, it is possible to approach a stranger of interest respectfully.\nSeveral dating coaches told me they work with clients who are hungry for real-\nlife romance to teach them how to do so. Jayda Shuavarnnasri, a sex and\nrelationship educator, suggests that people always give the other person an\nout\u2014for instance: \u201cIf you want to sit in silence to eat your meal, please let\nme know.\u201d It\u2019s tricky, though, because some people will have a harder time\nlanding all of this smoothly, not necessarily because they\u2019re pushier but\nbecause they struggle more with social cues. \u201cIs it okay with us if a guy\nwho\u2019s kind of on the autism spectrum\u201d gets called out for hitting on someone,\nFinkel asked me, \u201cbut people who are Brad Pitt don\u2019t get sanctioned for the\nsame behavior?\u201d\n\nNone of this means that you should never talk to strangers. It just means that\ndoing so is a delicate way to find love, and it\u2019s certainly not the only way\nthat can lead to something genuine. We shouldn\u2019t put it on a\npedestal\u2014especially if we\u2019re not ready to accept what it would really mean for\nsociety to embrace it. If you do want to seek connection with the people you\nsee out and about, Shuavarnnasri advised taking some pressure off by not\nexpecting the interaction to be necessarily romantic. Maybe you\u2019ll have a\npleasant conversation and then never see each other again. But you\u2019ll still\nhave opened yourself up to a bit of playful uncertainty\u2014the kind that comes\nwhen you have no agenda and no idea how things might play out.\n\nMeet-cute nostalgia raises the question of how much ambiguity we can\ntolerate\u2014whether a serendipitous spark with a stranger is worth the potential\nfor awkwardness and misinterpretation, or whether boundaries and clarity are\nworth some lost opportunities for connection. \u201cDo we want a society where\nthere\u2019s an excess number of people being hit on and having to say no ... or do\nwe want a society where there\u2019s an excess amount of people not initiating\nrelationships that would have been desirable?\u201d Finkel asked. We can\u2019t have it\nboth ways\u2014not perfectly.\n\nEither way, mystery and doubt will always be part of romance. You could follow\na TikToker\u2019s advice to a T, march proudly into a caf\u00e9, and ask the person next\nto you about their oatmeal\u2014just to get a short response and a turn away. You\ncould also get ghosted by someone whose app profile says they\u2019re looking for a\nlife partner. In love, however you meet, you\u2019re always risking something\u2014and\neven a set of fancy flirting tentacles can\u2019t change that.\n\nFaith Hill is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
