Releasing software in to the wild that has\nimperfections annoys me. For that matter, doing anything that is imperfect\nannoys me.\n\nThankfully, there is this little thing called reality that I sometimes get\nsmacked around by and learn from. One of my more recent smacking and learning\nepisodes came in the form of realizing that I am not the only stakeholder\ninvolved in the release of software. There are business stakeholders who are\ndeeply vested in the timely delivery and success of a software project. The\noperative word in that phrase is \u201ctimely\u201d. There is also another piece of\nreality that I had seemed to forget in my time here on earth \u2013 nothing is\nperfect (and definitely no piece of software will ever be perfect).\n\nI was speaking with a lead QA guy for my software shop at work about three\nmonths ago about a relatively high profile software release that was about to\ngo live. The project had several problems \u2013 no showstoppers, but lots of\nwarts. I was griping about the still open bugs and continuously asking why on\nearth we were pushing out something that, in my estimation, did not seem ready\nfor primetime nor would I want my name associated with it in its current\nstate. I was so adamantly opposed to finishing the release, albeit internally\nas I certainly was not going to publicly stand in front of a moving locomotive\nto try and stop it, that it put me in a very negative and unproductive mood.\nIn the midst of my griping to my fellow QA guru, he enlightened me to another\ntrain of thought \u2013 what are those business stakeholders thinking? How are the\nbusiness stakeholders managing the risks associated with releasing software.\n\nIn short here is what I learned from that conversation \u2013 it is not up to me in\nthe role of an engineer of an organization that finds itself in a rapid\nbusiness climate to worry about the risks associated with releasing software\nin a certain state. My job is simply to make sure that software is releasable\ngiven the business\u2019 definition of what is releasable, and to improve it in the\nfuture in such ways the business sees fit. Building on that concept, it is\neven more important that it is not my job as an engineer to assess the risk of\nreleasing a piece of software to the public as I, and other engineers are\n(typically) unqualified to do so.\n\nIf it were left to (perfectionist) engineers, software would never be released\nas we would be trying to tweak and work on it until it is just right. But what\nis gained in quality will be lost by not actually having the software being\nused by its user base. Software is quite useless unless it is actually being\nused by someone. Software has to be released at some point to deliver needed\nfeatures to users in the timely fashion that the business expects \u2013 and they\nare the ones who live with the possibility of whether the realized risks of\nbugs making it out into the wild outweigh or are dwarfed by the benefit of\ndelivering new features to the client base.\n\nThe open-source mantra for such a concept is \u201crelease early, release often\u201d.\nEver since the point in which I had that conversation with my QA guy, I have\npersonally become considerably less uptight regarding releasing buggy software\n\u2013 and as a result I feel more comfortable working in this fast paced climate\nof frequent releases. Releasing imperfect software is just the nature of our\nlives. Our strive for creating something and moving it as close to perfection\nas we humanely can under realistic constraints is still the impetus driving us\nas software engineers \u2013 that will never be taken away regardless of how soon\nor how unready our released product is when others see it.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPrevious\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n### Hey!\n\nI\u2019m Mamddoh.
