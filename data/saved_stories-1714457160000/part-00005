On top of that,\nalmost every Supabase Launch Week brings in additional frameworks to work with\nSupabase.\n\nFor Supabase, maintaining each individual framework became a huge burden. As\nsuch, they introduced a new package: @supabase/ssr. This package not only\nprovides a single package for Supabase to maintain, but also a single package\nfor developers to work with across all platforms.\n\nLet's look at the Clients that the new package creates:\n\n  * Server Client\n  * Browser Client - Also known as 'Client Client'\n\nThat's it. One package with two client to create both a server and a browser\nclient, which both connect to Supabase. The functionality contains Pages\n(ssr/client), Components, Middleware and API Routes.\n\nWhile you can simply copy and paste the middleware, the others are a bit\nharder. That is why we created templates for you to simply copy and paste.\n\nThe best thing? It is completely free\n\n## What is included in the template?\n\n3\n\n### Templates\n\nEach to use, drag and drop templates which you can use to directly create a\nPage, Component or API Route specifically for the Supabase Server Side\nRendering package.\n\n2\n\n### Examples\n\nWithin the free templates we have also included two examples. These examples\ncontain both a Server and Client page, to show what is possible and give more\ninsight into the new Supabase SSR package.\n\n## Useful Resources and Tools\n\nSaaS Name GeneratorWhat is a SaaS Starter KitSupaboost DocumentationSetting up\nLemon Squeezy Interface\n\n## Get your Supaboost\n\n### Supaboost\n\nBlog\n\nDocumentation\n\nGuides\n\nRoadmap\n\nFacebook\n\n### Blog\n\nSaaS Starter Kit\n\nComparing Payment processors\n\nSupabase/SSR\n\nSupabase Auth\n\n### Legal\n\nPrivacy and Cookies\n\nEULA\n\nBecome an affiliate\n\n### Tools\n\nFree Supabase SSR Template\n\nSaaS Name Generator\n\nSupaboost\n\n\u00a9 Supaboost 2024.
