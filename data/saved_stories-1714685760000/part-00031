Around March 6 of that year, it ceased to be so.\n\nGenghis Khan had taken its golden throne and ordered the city burned to the\nground. Its sweet watermelons were no longer cut into strips and dried on its\nwashing lines; scholars put down their pens and abandoned its libraries;\nastronomers scattered from the observatory; poets forgot their words; and\nweavers left their looms still interlaced with unfinished fabrics of silk and\ncotton and ran from their workshops along the still waters of the Majan Canal.\nAll Mongol soldiers were issued a decree from the khan such that each was to\nend the lives of three to four hundred distraught souls.\n\n\u201cThat city,\u201d it was said, \u201cwhich had been embellished by great men of the\nworld, became the haunt of hyenas and beasts of prey.\u201d Smoke rose over its\npalaces and groves, gardens and streams. Books that had held the learnings of\ncenturies blackened and curled in the intense heat, before crumbling into ash.\nIts canals were destroyed, orchards of its celebrated fruit trees felled,\noasis fields that produced its sweetest watermelons salted.\n\nGenghis Khan ordered a call to prayer from a minaret to root out anyone who\nhad found a clever place to hide and had them slaughtered; and then he ordered\na count of the dead that came in at 700,000 bodies of all ages\u2014or, perhaps,\nparts thereof. \u201cIt was the last day of the lives of most of the inhabitants of\nMerv,\u201d pronounced a Persian historian who had allied with the Mongols. By the\nend, only a small number of its sophisticated citizens would survive. Those\nwho did had been intentionally kept alive. And all of them, it is said, were\nartisans.\n\nFor Genghis Khan, such people as he had studiously kept alive in Merv\u2014its\nartisans\u2014may also have had a significance beyond the spoils of war.\n\nOver its long history, many had seen and coveted the bountiful treasures of\nMerv. Occasionally, its walls had failed to deter these others who, before the\nMongols, had also sought its wealth or its political prestige. Some seventy\nyears before Genghis Khan and his son plundered and murdered their way through\nMerv, it had been the turn of the Oghuz, or Ghuzz Turks, a people whose\ndescendants would found the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFor three days they helped themselves to the contents of Merv\u2019s treasury and\nstores. Nothing of any value was overlooked, but it was on the first day that\ntheir chests were filled with what they considered most precious. Along with\nthe city\u2019s gold, the very first things to be pillaged were its famed silks,\nloomed of threads pulled from boiling cocoons between the long fingers of its\nartisans.\n\nWhen Genghis Khan died in 1227, perhaps even greater than the vast empire he\nhad forged was the complete dominion of the network of roads that came with\nmilitary conquest. Across these silk roads\u2014as, many years later, they would\ncome to be known\u2014traders\u2019 caravans traveled no less efficiently than the\nMongol blade, moving porcelain and jewels, gunpowder and horses, people to be\nenslaved, Marco Polo and the bubonic plague. There was also paper, an\nincredibly valuable commodity that had been invented in China some thousand\nyears before Genghis Khan was born. And, of course, traded along these roads\nfor magnificent profit were bales of perfectly crafted silks from China, as\nwell as from wherever Bombyx mori feasted on mulberry leaves across Central\nAsia.\n\nBut for Genghis Khan, such people as he had studiously kept alive in Merv\u2014its\nartisans\u2014may also have had a significance beyond the spoils of war and the\ntrappings of wealth, one upon which the very survival of his warriors might\ndepend. Theirs were swords that would not rust and horses that could not rest,\nand their soldiers\u2014all males older than fourteen who were neither doctors nor\npriests\u2014were provided with armor designed to keep them light enough to stay\nagile and yet strong enough to return safely to the horde, to prevent\ncasualties among their own. Breastplates and backplates of leather were sewn\ntogether like scales, with a leather-covered shield and helmet usually made of\nmuch the same. The outfit weighed nowhere near the fifty kilograms or so of\nthe iron mail worn by European cavalry at that time, putting additional weight\non their already burdened horses.\n\nMuch of a battle against Genghis Khan\u2019s hordes would take place after a\nsoldier dismounted\u2014or was dismounted by the iron tip of a Mongol javelin, the\nterrifying momentum of a swinging axe, or any of the sixty arrows with which\nGenghis\u2019s men were also armed. If this Mongol armor that speeded them onto\ngolden thrones had no need of chains wrought from iron wires it was because of\nwhat was under their leather-scaled cuirass. It was something better than\nother types of underarmor that were made of linen quilted with wool or horses\u2019\nhair because it was smarter.\n\nThe idea for the Mongols\u2019 choice of fabric had been appropriated from Chinese\nwarcraft. It was to take the extraordinarily light thread extruded from the\ninsect that Neolithic China\u2019s farmers had domesticated so long before, and\nwith it craft an undershirt, standard issue, of tightly woven Bombyx mori\nsilk. Compared to the promise of cold, hard metal armor, and although it may\nhave been layered, the sheerness of silk cloth seemed to offer little\ndeterrent against the sharp ends of enemy weapons, even if it did allow them\nmore rapid onslaughts and escapes. But it was extraordinarily effective.\n\nWere the leather body armor to be penetrated, the fine silk undergarment would\nwind tightly around the heads or points of sharp missiles that might otherwise\nhave pushed deeper into limbs or through them. More often than not, an arrow\nwould not actually break through this fabric so surprisingly delicate to the\ntouch. Removing an arrow, particularly one that was barbed, inevitably caused\na larger wound than the offending object itself had, and, with it, extensive\nbleeding out.\n\nBut when an arrow had embedded itself first in silk, the tightly woven threads\naround the wound would be pulled instead, turning the arrowhead, gently\nteasing the weapon out and minimizing further damage. As the Mongols herded\nthe newly enslaved or slaughtered those who were unfortunate enough to be in\ntheir way, the lives of their own soldiers were much less likely to be lost\nthanks to their undershirts.\n\nBut the doctors serving the armies of the khan may also have noted that wounds\ninto which fine Bombyx mori silk was dragged by the sharp end of an arrow\nmight also have been better equipped to mend themselves. Simply breaking the\nskin is to create a crack in the wall of the body\u2019s strategic defense, an\nopening of which the forces of infection take full advantage. Where there is a\nwound\u2014warm and moist, divested of the first line of defense of intact\nskin\u2014there is also an ideal opportunity for bacteria to invade and colonize.\nThis attack the immune system must find a mechanism to avert.\n\nUnder the broken surface, the journey of a physical trauma that heals is an\nintricate, programmed process built of an exact sequence of steps that the\nbody completes through the conversations of myriad cells. Here are hormones,\nsignals, and the fine architecture of tissues that must work in concert in a\nprecise order. There is constriction of blood vessels, a spike in heart rate\nand in the cells that work to inflame and so repair, cells that move and\nrecruit others to help, that rebuild broken blood vessels and new tissue in\nthe place of the old; the matrix that formed the cavity of the wound slowly\nremodels into a new structure that seals, regenerates, and binds broken muscle\nand nerves, bone and skin.\n\nThe simple silk underclothes of the Mongols had only been intended to prevent\nthe death of one more fighter.\n\nIn one sense, the cocoons of Bombyx mori are not so different from skin. The\ncocoon exists to protect, not just because it forms an impenetrable layer that\ncovers important structures within, but because in the deep structure of silk\nappear to be embedded proteins that are antiviral, and yet others that can\ndamage the fortressing walls of bacterial cells. These are defenses that\nprotect the silkworm pupa as it metamorphoses into its adult form, but they\nare also retained in the silk unreeled from its cocoon, spun by human hand\ninto yarn; the fabric of silk woven from those threads made in exactly the\nsame way that the Chinese had developed it so long before: first stripping\nfrom it, by special boiling, the part called sericin, the cement that binds\nthe strands of silk protein as it emerges from its silkworm, so that silk can\ninteract with every stage of the complex healing process. Both the fibroin\nthat forms the silk and the sericin that binds it can hasten the healing of\nwounds.\n\nBut with sericin intact, an inappropriate, heightened immune response might be\nsparked in the injured, one that could induce an allergic reaction. The\nChinese, already having removed this cement, as far as can be told, had been\nspinning silk threads to suture wounds for around two thousand years by the\ntime the Mongol campaigns began; the silk also served as dressings whose\nthreads could stimulate the cells that repair and rebuild to convene and\nproliferate in the wound bed.\n\nIn a future time, some eight hundred years after the death of the khan, silk\nwithout sericin, and even the sericin routinely discarded in the manufacture\nof silk, would be manipulated by doctors and engineers. They would create\nsponges and gels; films and mats of silk as scaffolds seeking to support\nwounds that struggle to heal; matrices for the regrowth of blood vessels and\nbroken skin; formulations to attract cells as they migrate and regenerate. And\nall of this from the sophisticated manipulation of the extracts of a little\nsilkworm.\n\nBut before all that, the simple silk underclothes of the Mongols had only been\nintended to prevent the death of one more fighter, to stem the catastrophic\nloss of blood from an agile horseman riding into the path of an enemy arrow.\nThat it was even possible for the fine threads of an insect\u2019s cocoon to halt\nthe flow of blood, and even the flight of a missile designed to kill, would be\nbacked up by observations made, quite by chance, and published exactly 660\nyears after the death of Genghis Khan, over six thousand miles away, in\nArizona Territory in the American Old West.\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom Silk: A World History by Aarathi Prasad.
