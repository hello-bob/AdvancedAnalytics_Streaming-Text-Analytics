It aims to be fast and functional, and its open source nature lends\nit to being customizable to individual use cases.\n\nCompared to paid alternatives, you can save money, at the cost of having to\nmanage details yourself, as paying for the aggregator API (eg Plaid) directly\nis cheaper than paying the $4-$10 a month full services cost. Unlike free\nservices, your data is private, and not sold.\n\n## Architecture\n\n  * Python backend, using the Django framework.\n  * HTML, CSS, and Javascript frontend\n  * PostgreSQL database, although this can be swapped out easily due to Django's ORM. You may wish to use SqLite instead if for personal use.\n  * Plaid to connect to financial institutions.\n  * Sendgrid as an email provider. (Sends verification and password reset emails, and emails administrators with errors and debug information.)\n\n## Lines of effort\n\nThe webapp is functional in its current state (See our official webapp\nimplementation above), but can be improved in a number of ways. Here are some\nexamples:\n\n### Support aggregators other than Plaid\n\nThis would allow for connecting to a broader range of institutions, and better\ninternational support\n\n### Better international support\n\nThis is currently only tested in the US; it could use support for mixing\ndifferent currencies, and aggregators that work better in other countries\n\n### Budgeting features\n\nBudget support is currently nascent.\n\n### 2 factor authentication (Eg with an authenticator phone app)\n\n### More insightful reports\n\n### Better documentation\n\nIncluding examples\n\n### Decoupled architecture\n\nMake swapping in and out aggregators easier, through a decoupled API.\n\n### Internal code cleanup\n\nThe frontend code is currently repetative and messy in places; there is room\nfor improvement in terms of making it faster\n\n### Smaller plotting libraries\n\nThe plotting libraries used on the Spending page (Plotly and plot.js) are\ncurrently large and bloated: Especially Plotly. A more compact, faster\nalternative would be a better match for this application's otherwise\nstreamlined architecture.\n\n## Configuring for deployed, vice development environments.\n\nIf the environment variable DATABASE_URL is present, this application is\nconsidered to be deployed, which has several implications for how it operates.\n(See settings.py for details.) If this is present, the the following\nenvironment variables should be set up (if available):\n\n    \n    \n    SECRET_KEY PLAID_CLIENT_ID PLAID_SECRET SENDGRID_KEY\n\nIf not deployed (DATABASE_URL is not present), create a file called private.py\nin the main folder.\n\nprivate.py You must create a file main/private.py in order to connect to\nplaid, and the email server. It will include several variables, provided by\nPlaid and Sendgrid, through their accounts. Note that you if you leave these\nblank, support for Plaid and/or email will be disabled.\n\nExample contents:\n\n    \n    \n    PLAID_CLIENT_ID = \"abc\" PLAID_SECRET_SANDBOX = \"abc\" PLAID_SECRET_PRODUCTION = \"abc\" SENDGRID_KEY = \"abc\"\n\n## Database setup:\n\nThe Database is configured via a URL. In production, this is configured via\nthe DATABASE_URL environment variable. In dev use, it's configured by the\nDATABASE_URL variable in settings.py.\n\n### Notes\n\nCurrently, the frontend code is written in plain Javascript. This has the\ndistinct advantage of avoiding a build step and configuration. However: The\nlack of strict typing and module support, makes the code fragile: We may\nchange to Typescript in the future.\n\n## About\n\nView net worth, account values, financial transactions\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 57.0%\n  * JavaScript 21.3%\n  * HTML 20.2%\n  * CSS 1.4%\n  * Other 0.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
