Since high school,\nI\u2019ve struggled with migraines, and because caffeine is a well-known trigger, I\nstayed away from it as much as possible.\n\nIn college, I remember feeling jealous of people using and abusing caffeine.\nTo be able to legally ingest a substance that helped you stay awake and\nfocused before exams almost felt like an unfair advantage to me.\n\nA year and a half ago, noticing a decrease in my migraine frequency, I became\ncurious about the real-world benefits of caffeine. Based on what I saw in\ncollege and finding out that Bill Gates and John Carmack are both Diet Coke\naddicts, I had high expectations.\n\nSo I went and got a can of Coke and drank it during work. As this was\nessentially my first caffeine experience, I was highly sensitive and became\ninstantly wired. The hype in my head was real. I got so much work done that\nday and I couldn\u2019t help but feel that all this time I\u2019d been operating in a\nslower-paced, less-focused universe compared to my peers.\n\nI was so excited that I raved about my experience with a few people I knew.\nMost people laughed and many were envious about how effective one can of coke\nwas to me. I soon came to find that a lot of my peers require far more\ncaffeine just to be at a baseline level of operation.\n\nI decided to do some research on YouTube where I found people like Wheezy\nWaiter, Beau Miles, and Christian Schaffer all suffering from caffeine\nwithdrawals during experiments where they stopped drinking coffee.\n\nI realized that caffeine addiction is real, and once you are hooked, the\npowerful benefits that I experienced are far less potent. So I came up with a\nplan to manage my caffeine intake that I\u2019ve stuck to for over a year now.\n\nMy general rules are the following:\n\n  * I don\u2019t exceed 60 mg of caffeine in one day. To give perspective, a can of Diet Coke is 46mg. A grande latte from Starbucks is 150mg. Therefore, I cannot drink a fully caffeinated latte drink.\n  * I only drink caffeine on days that I need the extra boost to be productive. I am very intentional about not wasting it on days that require less productivity.\n  * I limit myself to a maximum of four caffeine days per week, ideally fewer.\n  * I avoid caffeinated drinks that are customized. Starbucks gives the option to get 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, caffeinated beverages. This is great because it opens up many caffeine options, but I don\u2019t like to do it too often as I\u2019ve had a few too many times where the barista makes the drink incorrectly. Because of my high caffeine sensitivity, I realize quickly when a drink has more caffeine than I\u2019m used to. For this reason, when I do go to Starbucks, I tend to get a Tall Matcha Latte (55mg of caffeine).\n  * I do my best to keep caffeine sources out of immediate reach. I have some green tea at home, but generally, I make it so I have to leave the house to source my caffeine. This makes me intentional about marking a day for more-than-normal productivity needs.\n\nFollowing these rules, I can effectively micro-dose caffeine, enjoying its\npotent effects from just a can of Coke without any dependency side effects.\nIt\u2019s great to have something that can reliably increase my mental performance\nwhen I need it.\n\nI know caffeine affects people differently, so I\u2019d love to hear how other\npeople manage their caffeine intake (even if it is complete dependence).\nPlease email me at ashleynewman@protonmail.com to start a conversation.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
