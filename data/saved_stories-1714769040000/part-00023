It is funded by a grant from the Walton Family Foundation.\n\nStanding amid rows of juicy, lime green lettuce and chunky florets of\nbroccoli, Jose Paiz appears as if he could be the owner of a modern, high-tech\nfarm. But the crops thriving here, in the suburbs of Mexico City, are part of\na 1,000-year-old tradition.\n\n\u201cMy ancestors were doing this before even the [Spanish] Conquistadors arrived\nin Mexico [in 1519],\u201d says Paiz, while crouching down to pick up a handful of\npowdery soil from the chinampa, or \u201cfloating garden,\u201d on which we are both\nstanding.\n\nThese highly productive man-made island-farms, which can be found floating on\nlakes across the south of Mexico\u2019s capital, date back to the time of the\nAztecs or perhaps even earlier \u2014 and now proponents say that these ancient\nengineering wonders could provide an important, sustainable food source as the\ncity faces historic drought.\n\nAs a chinampero, Jose Paiz is carrying on a tradition that goes back\ncenturies. Credit: Peter Yeung\n\n\u201cMy grandparents taught me the methods,\u201d adds Paiz, 32, who is the fifth\ngeneration of his family to be a chinampero working in San Gregorio Atlapulco,\na traditional working-class neighborhood about 10 miles south of the center of\nMexico City.\n\nExperts say that these chinampas, which have been recognized as a UNESCO World\nHeritage site, are considered one of the most productive agricultural systems\nin the world. The artificial islands are built by gathering large amounts of\nsoil from the bottom of the lake and placing it on top of reeds, grasses and\nrushes in a mass that rises above the water. Farmers then plant a fence of\nahuejotes, Mexican willow trees, around the plot to naturally protect against\nerosion. This system means that the chinampa\u2019s soil is constantly enriched by\nnutrient-filled sediment flowing in from the surrounding ditches and canals,\nyielding multiple harvests every year.\n\nAhuejotes, Mexican willow trees, are planted around the plots to protect\nagainst erosion.

There,\nthey founded the settlement of Tenochtitl\u00e1n \u2014 which would become one of the\nmost powerful cities in all Mesoamerica \u2014 in the Valley of Mexico.\n\n### Crushed by negative news?\n\nSign up for the Reasons to be Cheerful newsletter.\n\nBut as the Aztecs soon discovered, the valley\u2019s boggy, lake-filled landscape\nwas difficult to cultivate or build on. So they devised an ingenious plan to\nadapt to the surroundings: the chinampas.\n\nA 2013 paper by North Carolina State University professor Matthew Teti found\nthat in the 16th century, chinampa farms could produce 13 times as much crop\nas dry-land farming in the same area \u2014 a system that provided food for\nhundreds of thousands of people. Chinampas, the study said, are \u201cone of the\nmost intensive and productive agricultural systems ever devised.\u201d\n\nCredit: Peter Yeung\n\nGreens and other vegetables flourish on the chinampas, which are considered\none of the most productive agricultural systems in the world.\n\n\u201cAztec planners created these vital waterways as integral to the existence of\nits cultural, physical, and spiritual, urban identity, rather than draining\nthe water and excluding it from the urban experience,\u201d it continued.\n\nIn the case of Jose Paiz, the age-old system is still reaping rewards today.\nHe says that his 7,000 square meters of chinampa, for example, can produce as\nmuch as 100 kilograms of broccoli per day \u2014 which is sold alongside the yields\nof fresh herbs, spinach, chard, radishes, corn and kale at local markets in\nthe south of Mexico City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be continuing the tradition of my ancestors,\u201d he says.\n\nProduce grown on the chinampas is sold at bustling markets in the south of\nMexico City. Credit: Peter Yeung\n\nMeanwhile, according to Arca Tierra, their network of seven producers in the\nregion cultivates over 40,000 square meters of land, employing a total of 27\nworkers in the field and producing 3,650 kilograms per month. At some farms,\nas many as 95 varieties of vegetables and herbs are cultivated, underlining\nthe fertility of the method. The production brings in over $4,000 per month in\ncrop sales.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was mainly a commercial endeavor to source organic\nproduce close to the city,\u201d says Usobiaga, who supplies restaurants in Mexico\nCity and began working with chinamperos in 2009. \u201cBut I learned they are very\nimportant in many regards and have historical and cultural importance.\u201d\n\nThe design of the chinampas is particularly efficient in its use of water,\nwhich it can absorb and retain from the surrounding canals for long periods as\nwell as allowing crops to draw from the groundwater directly, reducing the\nneed for active irrigation.\n\nCredit: Peter Yeung\n\nWhen it comes to farming, according to Lucio Usobiaga, founder of Arca Tierra,\nthe chinampas \u201care one of the best examples of how humans can work with\nnature.\u201d\n\nThis could prove hugely valuable for Mexico City and its 22 million residents,\nsince water supplies have fallen to historic lows due to abnormally low\nrainfall partly attributable to climate change. And lessons learned from the\nchinampas could potentially help cities around the planet: the UN World Water\nDevelopment 2024 Report found the number of people lacking access to drinking\nwater in cities will likely reach two billion by 2050.\n\n\u201cThe technical aspects of agriculture are innate to every place,\u201d says\nUsobiaga. \u201cBut the way of thinking that created the chinampas, that\nsensibility, has to be appreciated and valued: To work with the flow of\nnature, the flow of the seasons. That is what we have to use to get us out of\nthe problem we are in.\u201d\n\nThe endangered axolotl is only found in the waterways of southern Mexico City.\nCredit: Peter Yeung\n\nThe unique wetlands ecosystem is also home to two percent of the world\u2019s and\n11 percent of Mexico\u2019s biodiversity, including the critically endangered\naxolotl, or Ambystoma mexicanum, an incredible salamander-like amphibian that\nis able to regenerate every part of its body \u2014 even parts of its vital organs\nsuch the heart and brain.\n\nMeanwhile, the chinampas also provide a host of other benefits: they filter\nwater, cool the city, sequester carbon, offer green space for locals, and are\nnow a popular destination for tourists who take boats along the picturesque\nwaterways.\n\nThe value of the chinampas was underlined during the Covid-19 pandemic, when,\nas the city\u2019s major markets ground to a halt, the chinampas were able to\nprovide healthy, locally-grown food. In some cases, sales more than doubled.\n\n\u201cPeople began to search for healthier food,\u201d says David Monachon, a social\nsciences researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has\nresearched the chinampas as a sustainable food source. \u201cThere was this focus\non local economy and community. Many people didn\u2019t make this connection\nbefore.\u201d\n\nYet despite their immense value, the chinampas are under threat: rising\nurbanization means the chinampa landscape is being built on; pollution is\ndirtying the waters that feed them; younger generations are losing interest in\nagriculture; and agro-industry is under-cutting the small-scale producers in a\nprice war.\n\nCredit: Peter Yeung\n\nFor chinamperos like Jose Paiz, the age-old agricultural system is still\nreaping rewards today.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of challenges and problems,\u201d says Monachon, who is supporting\na local cooperative of chinamperos to sell their goods via the Mercado\nUniversitario Alternativo, or Alternative University Market. \u201cBut chinampas\ncould feed the city.\u201d\n\nNow, only 20 percent of the 2,200 hectares of chinampas are in use, and only\nabout 2.5 percent are being actively cultivated for farming food \u2014 the rest is\nbeing used for growing flowers and tourism. But Arca Tierra is helping to\nrestore the chinampas \u2014 five hectares to date \u2014 and is training 15 young\nstudents in the required skills to cultivate them \u2014 the second, six-month\ncohort \u2014 while also carrying out research on the most effective techniques and\nproductive crops to use on them.\n\nArca Tierra is currently helping to restore the chinampas and training young\nstudents in the required skills to cultivate them. Credit: Antoli Studio /\nArca Tierra\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated that it can be done on a small scale,\u201d says Usobiaga,\nwho believes chinampas have the potential to produce enough of crops like\nlettuces, herbs and broccoli for all of Mexico City. \u201cBut the chinampas need\nsupport and investment from the government to scale up production.\u201d\n\nAt Xochimilco market, the largest in the area, there is clear evidence of\nappetite for a resilient, local food system and signs that this ancient Aztec\ntradition can still bear fruit. The market bustles with traders and customers,\nspilling from the covered area out onto the streets.\n\nRosa Garcia sells the produce that she grows on her family\u2019s one-hectare\nchinampa at Xochimilco market.

The produce, grown at her one-hectare\nchinampa at San Gregorio Atlapulco, is in high demand. Garcia says that each\nday her family-run farm can earn as much as 1,000 to 1,500 Mexican pesos ($60\nto $90).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was a girl,\u201d says Garcia, ticking off the orders\nas they are dispatched. \u201cIt\u2019s a system that works.
