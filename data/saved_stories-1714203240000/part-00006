While traditional approaches and deep learning models have shown\n> promise, they cannot often capture complex relationships between entities.\n> In this paper, we propose leveraging Relational Graph Convolutional Networks\n> (RGCNs) for sentiment analysis, which offer interpretability and flexibility\n> by capturing dependencies between data points represented as nodes in a\n> graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using pre-trained\n> language models such as BERT and RoBERTa with RGCN architecture on product\n> reviews from Amazon and Digikala datasets and evaluating the results. Our\n> experiments highlight the effectiveness of RGCNs in capturing relational\n> information for sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.13079 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.13079v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.13079arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zahed Rahmati [view email] [v1] Tue, 16 Apr 2024 07:27:49 UTC (1,458 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Relational Graph Convolutional Networks for\nSentiment Analysis, by Asal Khosravi and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
