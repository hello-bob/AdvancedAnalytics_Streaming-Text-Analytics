Drawing on recently published Chinese texts,\nWendi\u2019s reporting provides a more comprehensive telling of this discovery than\nhas previously been described.\n\nWhen her father gave Tu the name \u201cYouyou,\u201d he started with characters from the\nChinese classic Book of Odes: \u201cThe deer bleat: \u2018y\u014du y\u014du\u2019 while eating wild\n\u2018h\u0101o\u2019\u201d (\u5466\u5466\u9e7f\u9e23,\u98df\u91ce\u4e4b\u84bf). The next line, he composed himself: \u201cGreen as the h\u0101o\ngrass, repaying the spring sun\u201d (\u84bf\u8349\u9752\u9752,\u62a5\u4e4b\u6625\u6656).\n\nEerily predictive in hindsight, the \u201chao\u201d in these lines stood for the plant\nqinghao, or Artemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood), from which artemisinin, the\nantimalarial drug, was first isolated. Little did her father realize that Tu\nYouyou would eventually be internationally known for discovering the\nantimalarial properties of artemisinin, a molecule that inhibits the parasite\nand is directly responsible for saving the lives of millions of people.\n\nHowever, the blandly clinical package of artemisinin and artesunate tablets\nreveals little about how the key compound was first discovered. Chinese\nresearchers scoured ancient medical texts containing written records of\nmalaria outbreaks and the plant-derived recipes that were used to treat them\nnearly two thousand years ago. It was from these texts that artemisinin was\nrediscovered.\n\nSubscribe to receive essays from Asimov Press.\n\n\u201cCumulatively the deadliest of the human infectious diseases,\u201d malaria has\nbeen documented throughout recorded history. It is caused by Plasmodium\nparasites, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected\nmosquitoes. Multiple species of Plasmodium infect humans, but P. falciparum is\nthe most prevalent and has killed more people than any other. The complex life\ncycle and genetic diversity of Plasmodium make malaria especially difficult to\neradicate. Current vaccines and medicines work by intervening against these\nlife phases. Artemisinin-based drugs work by causing Plasmodium proteins to\nunfold and by inhibiting new proteins from folding properly, which eventually\ndestroys the parasite.\n\nArtemisinin was unearthed as part of a secret Chinese military project between\n1967 and 1981, with the most significant milestones overlapping with the\nCultural Revolution (1966-1976). But how did a time period historically\nassociated with political frenzy and the persecution of intellectuals,\nresearchers, and academics give birth to one of the world\u2019s most successful\ndrugs?\n\nThe existing literature written in English on this story tends to attribute Tu\nYouyou\u2019s achievements to a solo discovery, an understandable consequence of Tu\nreceiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015. But with the help\nof newly published Chinese volumes on artemisinin\u2019s discovery in China, we can\nuncover a more complex picture that situates Tu within the context of a\nformative moment for the resurgence of Chinese medical traditions during the\nfinal decade of Mao\u2019s rule.\n\nTu Youyou (right) trained as a pharmacognosist under Lou Zhicen (left) at\nPeking University. Photo taken in 1951.\n\n##\n\nDiscovery\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, malaria was a major health concern for soldiers. While\nit's challenging to confirm exact numbers, it has been cited that nearly\n82,000 cases of malaria occurred within the U.S. Army and Marines between 1965\nand 1971. In response to the precipitous rise in incidence, governments on\nboth sides of the Pacific began a systematized search for antimalarial\ntreatments. The U.S. focused on developing artificial substances, such as\nmefloquine, a synthetic analog of quinine, an antimalarial compound derived\nfrom the bark of cinchona trees. Over the course of 12 years, the Walter Reed\nArmy Institute of Research (WRAIR) screened more than 250,000 compounds in\nsearch of an efficacious treatment.\n\nNorthern Vietnam, in turn, sought help from China, which was also experiencing\na significant malaria burden, with around 10 million people infected each\nyear. Upon being asked for aid in 1964, the communist leader Mao Zedong\nresponded: \u201cSolving your problem is also solving ours.\u201d\n\nThus began Project 523, named after the date of a secret national meeting held\nin Beijing between May 23 and 30, 1967. Organized by the National Commission\nof Science and Technology and the General Logistics Department of the People\u2019s\nLiberation Army (PLA), the purpose of the meeting was to form a combined\nmilitary and civilian program dedicated to malaria prevention and control. It\nestablished the Leading Group of the National Malaria Research Team, with\nmembers from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and\nthe Chinese Academy of Sciences. Regional 523 offices were set up to\ncoordinate activities with the national team under military supervision, to\nwhich affiliated institutions around the country would report.\n\nThe 1967 meeting outlined three main objectives: To develop anti-malarial\ntherapeutic drugs, anti-malarial preventive medicine, and mosquito repellent.\nResearch activities began around the country under four coordination groups:\nchemical synthesis, Chinese medicine, repellent, and on-site prevention. Due\nto the Cultural Revolution, a turbulent period of violence and ideological\nupheaval, most of the scientific research taking place in China had been put\non pause in 1967. As it fell under the aegis of the military, Project 523\nbecame a fortunate anomaly. In January 1969, Tu Youyou joined Project 523 as a\ngroup leader at the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica (ICMM). Tu had been\nworking at the ICMM ever since graduating from Peking University in 1955 with\na degree in pharmacognostical study.\n\nAmerican troops returning from Vietnam often had malaria, and 98 percent of\nall cases were caused by P. falciparum.\n\nAt Project 523, Tu spent her first few months consulting traditional Chinese\nmedical texts. By reading old books, collecting historical remedies, and\ntalking to Chinese medicine experts, she gathered more than 2,000 possible\ntreatments, summarized 640 prescriptions, and submitted her compiled report,\ntitled \u201cAntimalarial Collections of Recipes and Prescriptions\u201d(Kangnue danmi\nyanfangji) to the Project 523 Office in April of 1969.\n\nQinghao, the plant from which artemisinin is derived, had already been\nidentified by the Project as one of the important subjects of the study. Even\nso, it received little research attention. In oral interviews conducted by\nhistorians at Peking University, many researchers responded that they might\nhave screened qinghao but failed to notice its special efficacy amongst the\nlarge number of candidates.\n\nTu\u2019s focus first fell on pepper (hujiao), as it had been a common Chinese\nherbal ingredient and a folk antimalarial remedy. In August and September of\n1969, she and Lang Linfu, a core member of her group, carried out clinical\nexperiments in Hainan, with pepper-based tablets (\u201cjiugao wanji\u201d) that the duo\nhad made based on folk traditions and historical records. Their results\nsuggested that pepper helped to mask some of the symptoms of malaria, but did\nnot effectively inhibit Plasmodium, the root cause.\n\nIn 1970, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, Project 523 was paused at\nICMM as the whole institute became enveloped in the nationwide campaign of\ncatching \u201cMay Sixteenth elements\u201d\u2014people suspected of acting as\ncounterrevolutionaries. After a brief hiatus, ICMM formed a new research group\nin July 1971 and resumed work under Tu\u2019s leadership.\n\nAs part of this work, they consulted herbal recipe books once again, scouring\ninstructions for details that they had previously missed. One of these\nseemingly small yet critical details about preparation involved temperature.\nIn Emergency Prescriptions Kept up One\u2019s Sleeve (Zhouhou Beijifang), China\u2019s\nfirst emergency manual, Jin Dynasty physician and alchemist Ge Hong (284-363)\nwrote: \u201cQinghao, one bunch, take two sheng [2 x 0.2 l] of water for soaking\nit, wring it out, take the juice, ingest it in its entirety.\u201d Most Chinese\nherbal recipes would have mentioned heating, which was the conventional way to\nextract compounds. But in Ge Hong\u2019s instructions, there was no mention of\nheating.\n\nBecause it was convention, scientists at the ICMM typically extracted their\ncompounds by heating up plants and herbs. However, Tu\u2019s research group was\nwilling to reconsider whether this was the proper way to treat A. annua\n(Qinghao) leaves. Their use of a cooler temperature was directly reflected in\nthe efficacy of the samples.\n\nRecords from ICMM confirm that the effectiveness of artemisinin-based samples\nfrom Tu\u2019s group was consistently less than 50 percent until October 4, 1971.\nBut shortly after, sample number 191 was prepared using ethyl ether\nextracts\u2014with no heating\u2014and reached 100 percent inhibition of Plasmodium.\n\nBeginning December 6, experimental results consistently showed 100 percent\nefficacy in rodents. The main change Tu\u2019s group made was largely inspired by\nthe Jin dynasty instructions, and it was simply to use ether for a cold soak\nof the Qinghao leaves. In addition to the low temperature, their use of ethyl\nether\u2014instead of ethanol\u2014also significantly contributed to the extract\u2019s\nefficacy, as the active compound in qinghao is lipophilic. From there, more\nqinghao extracts were made that took away possible acidic and alkaline\ningredients. The neutral sample was deemed the most stable and effective\nextract.\n\nTu\u2019s laboratory record lists Artemisia annua L. as Experiment No. 191, with a\nparasite inhibition ratio of 100 percent. Credit: Tu Youyou\u2019s Journey in the\nSearch for Artemisinin, pp. 58.\n\nOn March 8, 1972, Tu Youyou attended a meeting held by the National Project\n523 Office, as the representative of ICMM. Titled \u201cDiscovery of Antimalarial\nChinese Herbal Medicine Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong\u2019s Thoughts,\u201d her\npresentation reported the 100 percent efficacy rate of the sample crude ether\nneutral extract from qinghao in both rodent and simian (primate) malaria\nexperiments.\n\nHer team\u2019s success is even more impressive in light of the fact that their\ndiscovery was, in some capacity, a low-probability event. As it turned out, A.\nannua L. was a particularly tricky plant to work with. Most of the plant does\nnot contain artemisinin, but only a small part of its leaves. Additionally,\nthe concentration of artemisinin contained in the plant is heavily influenced\nby the location in which it is grown and the season in which the plant is\nharvested. In their original experiments, Tu\u2019s team selected their leaves from\nmature Beijing A. annua L., which generally contained a very low concentration\nof artemisinin.\n\nThrough the collaborative efforts of more Chinese institutions, it would take\nanother half a year to isolate the active component of artemisinin, and an\nadditional three years to determine its chemical structure.\n\n##\n\ntu Science\n\nEven with refinements owed to modern chemistry, Tu's identification of A.\nannua L. was simply a rediscovery of ancient knowledge. Qinghao has been\nrecorded in Chinese books for two thousand years, with the earliest being\nRecipes for Fifty-Two Ailments (Wushi\u2019er Bingfang, dated to around 215 BCE), a\ntext written upon silk discovered in a Han dynasty tomb in Mawangdui. The\nemergency manual that gave Tu the key insight as to the successful extraction\nmethod was the earliest record in China for using qinghao to treat malaria.\nLater medical books, including the famous encyclopedia Bencao Gangmu\n(Compendium of Materia Medica), also recorded use cases for qinghao.\n\nBefore Tu\u2019s group joined the Project in 1969, the Shanghai Research Institute\nof TCM Literature had already compiled a Compendium of Malaria in 1965. A\nfoundational text during Project 523, it compiled anti-malarial therapeutics\nfrom traditional methods, based on classical texts and expert experiences.\nTu\u2019s group consulted this compilation when they re-screened experimental\ncandidates in 1971, just before their critical discovery.\n\nThis research method was an expression of how medicine in China was practiced\nat the time. For almost two decades prior, the new nation had experimented\nwith integrations of Western biomedical and traditional Chinese medical\ntraditions, thus creating a lineage of medical workers trained\u2014to varying\ndegrees\u2014in both.\n\nAfter four years of a national effort to \u201cscientize Chinese medicine\u201d (zhongyi\nkexuehua), which designated Chinese doctors to study Western biomedicine, Mao\nZedong reversed course in 1954, setting a new priority of \u201cWestern doctors\nstudy Chinese medicine (xiyi xuexi zhongyi).\u201d The goal, as expressed by the\npresident of the Chinese Medical Association in response to Mao, was to create\n\u201cChina\u2019s New Medicine\u201d that \u201cwill possess a basis in the natural sciences,\nwill have absorbed the ancient and the new, the Chinese and the foreign, all\nmedical achievements.\u201d\n\nAfter working at the ICMM for four years, Tu Youyou joined the third class of\nthe special training program created under Mao\u2019s new priority. From 1959 to\n1961, she studied classical Chinese medical texts, learned theories, and\nshadowed experts in their clinical practice. In her Nobel biography, Tu would\nrefer to this program as a formative experience for her lifelong work with\nartemisinin.\n\nProject 523 bore a particular political and cultural significance for Chinese\nmedicine at a time when debates of what constituted science and scientific\npractice went hand in hand with ideological struggles. Historian Jia-Chen Fu\nwrote that Project 523 served as a great opportunity for \u201cideological\ncelebration of, as well as practical necessity for, self-reliance,\u201d a value\ncelebrated in Mao\u2019s China.\n\nIn this light, scouring old Chinese remedies for new treatments for a disease\nspecifically troublesome during war was entirely intuitive for Chinese\nbiomedical scientists like Tu Youyou in the mid-20th century. Fu also\nsuggested clinical experimentation was close to the experiential nature of\ntraditional Chinese herbal medicine, while an extract produced through\nchemical analysis would have been more epistemologically foreign to the\ndoctors predominantly trained in Chinese medicine.\n\nArtemisia annua in the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland. Credit:\nKrzysztof Ziarnek, Kenraiz.\n\nArtemisinin was not the first case of biomedical extraction based on Chinese\nmedical recipes. In 1926, Kehui Chen and Carl Schmidt from Peking Union\nMedical College had isolated ephedrine from the common Chinese herb Mahuang.\nThis discovery \u201cignited a research fire\u201d on ephedrine for the relief of\nasthma, with more than 500 scientific papers published around the world by\n1929.\n\nWhat differed in the period of Project 523 was a socialist struggle of\nconnecting and integrating \u201ctu\u201d and \u201cyang\" sciences, with tu embodying the\ntradition and experimental values of Chinese medicine and yang representing\nthe professional research and theoretical focus of Western medicine. Under\nMaoist socialism, tu science came to symbolize the mass participation in, and\nthe restoration of, native Chinese knowledge.\n\nThus, Project 523 mainly encapsulated the values represented by tu science.\nEconomic challenges during the project also meant that Tu\u2019s group had to be\ncreative with their material practices. Instead of working with proper\nextracting containers, she and her colleagues used seven large water vats to\nmake the extracts in large quantities in a short time, embracing the Maoist\nnotion of \u201cmaterial challenges through self\u2013reliance.\u201d\n\nTu\u2019s husband recalled how she often came home smelling of alcohol and diethyl\nether. Due to a lack of ventilation and protection equipment, Tu even got\ninfected with toxic hepatitis. After successful testing on animals, Tu and her\ncolleagues volunteered to test the drug sample on themselves, spending a week\nin a Beijing hospital to do so. After confirming they experienced no side\neffects, Tu and her colleagues carried out the first clinical trial on human\npatients in Hainan between August and October 1972, which continued to\ndemonstrate qinghao extract\u2019s high efficacy.\n\nFor a country with poor research conditions, this level of voluntary\nindividual sacrifice was made possible by the strong motivational role\nideology played, emphasizing collective goals.\n\n##\n\nDelays\n\nIn the early 1980s, eager to push artemisinin onto the international market,\nChina turned to the World Health Organization (WHO). At the fourth meeting of\nthe Scientific Working Group on the Chemotherapy of Malaria, held in Beijing\nin 1981 and sponsored by the WHO, the World Bank, and the UN Development\nProgramme (UNDP), Chinese scientists presented their research on artemisinin.\nThe next year, hoping to receive support from WHO\u2019s experts, Chinese\nscientists showed TDR (the Special Programme for Research and Training in\nTropical Diseases, co-sponsored by WHO, World Bank, UNICEF and UNDP)\nrepresentatives around factories in multiple cities, only to be disappointed\nto learn that none met the F.D.A.\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practice standards for\ndrug production.\n\nTDR-Chemal (the Scientific Working Group on the Chemotherapy of Malaria in\nTDR) recommended that Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) work with\nChina in 1983, but the collaboration gradually fell apart due to a host of\nfactors, including a lack of trust between the U.S. and China, as well as\nmisunderstandings between TDR and China on the intentions of the\ncollaboration.1 At the same time, the U.S. WRAIR had discovered A. annua in\nWashington, D.C. while China had missed the opportunity to apply for patents,\nultimately prompting the U.S. to conduct its own artemisinin research.2\n\nChinese scientists presented their findings on artemisinin at the 1981 meeting\nof the Scientific Working Group on the Chemotherapy of Malaria, held in\nBeijing.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s hesitation to quickly adopt artemisinin, in part, came from the\nneurotoxicity of other artemisia species used for making absinthe. As a\nresult, only Vietnam, Cambodia, and Burma chose to use artemisinin and its\nderivatives manufactured in Vietnam and China without WHO approval,\ndramatically reducing malaria cases with few, if any, reports of harmful\neffects.\n\nIt was only in 2005, after the emergence of widespread resistance of P.\nfalciparum to monotherapy with conventional drugs like chloroquine and\nsulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, that the WHO recommended treating malaria with\ndrugs in combination with artemisinin. With help from the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM), artemisinin-based combination therapy\nbecame much more economically accessible worldwide. Anthropologist Elizabeth\nHsu, who did her fieldwork on artemisinin in East Africa, noted that the WHO\u2019s\nrecommendation made a significant difference in the local perception of\nartemisinin, transforming it from a Chinese \u201cwonder drug\u201d to a Western\nmedicine.\n\nKeith Arnold, who had worked on malaria research at the WRAIR during the same\ntime as Project 523, concluded that the world would have benefited if\nartemisinin adoption happened much earlier, and that \u201cmillions of dollars\n[...] have been poured into replicating work already done\u201d by Chinese\nscientists decades ago.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Pacific, the U.S. Department of Defense\nadministered mefloquine, the synthetic drug developed at Walter Reed in the\nU.S., to its soldiers for nearly a quarter century. Despite the Pentagon and\nhealth professionals\u2019 awareness of its significant neuropsychiatric side\neffects, which include vertigo, tinnitus, insomnia, vivid nightmares, visual\nand auditory hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, mood swings, and suicidal\nideation, the F.D.A. only issued \u201cthe strongest \u2018black box\u2019 warning\u201d against\nthe drug in 2013.\n\nFrom its initial discovery in the early 1970s to the WHO\u2019s official\nrecommendation in the early 2000s, artemisinin took more than a quarter\ncentury to become a globally adopted drug.\n\n##\n\nRediscovery\n\nAs long as it took for artemisinin to become widely adopted, though,\nrecognition of Tu\u2019s name and contribution to its widespread use took over a\ndecade longer. Few journal articles were written about the project using her\n(or anyone\u2019s) name before 2010. When Louis Miller, now Chief of Malaria Cell\nBiology at the NIH, attended a malaria conference in Shanghai in 2008, he\nasked: Who discovered artemisinin? Nobody had an answer.\n\nExtensive research into previously confidential documents led Miller and his\ncolleague Xinzhuan Su to Tu Youyou. Miller and Su published an article on Tu\u2019s\nstory in Cell in 2011. This gesture of attaching Tu\u2019s name with the discovery\nof artemisinin would be responsible for Tu winning the Lasker in 2011 and the\nNobel in 2015.\n\nWhen asked why he insisted on finding Tu\u2019s name, Miller invoked the discovery\nof Quinine from Peruvian Indian knowledge: \u201cThis discovery was one of the\nmajor life saving discoveries in medicine. I am afraid that [it] is lost and\ndidn\u2019t want this second important discovery of Artemisinin to be lost.\u201d\n\nEven so, the attribution of artemisinin\u2019s discovery to Tu Youyou alone has\nbeen contested and criticized by historians, as well as mainstream media in\nChina. Historians at Peking University\u2014Zhang Daqing, Li Run, and Rao\nYi\u2014explained that Tu\u2019s group and Project 523 happened under a different system\nfrom common Western research protocols. Instead of the Principal Investigator,\nTu served as a Principal Director, carrying out a project assigned to her by\nthe State. This categorical misattribution under-credits the massive\ncollective effort and coordination that made artemisinin the globally\nrecognized drug today.\n\nEmergency Prescriptions Kept up One\u2019s Sleeve was China\u2019s first emergency\nmanual. Inside, Jin Dynasty physician, Ge Hong (284-363), described a method\nto prepare an extract from qinghao plants. This book was the inspiration for\nProject 523\u2019s rediscovery of artemisinin. Credit: Tu Youyou Nobel Lecture\n\nAs part of their effort to thoroughly document this project, Zhang, Li, and\nRao published a 500-page oral history in 2015 and a monograph on the Project\nin 2017 that addressed sources in both Chinese and English. Extensive research\nled to their emphasis that Project 523 was an early example of what was dubbed\nthe \u201cBig Science\u201d of medicine in China. From its inception, dozens of\ninstitutions across the country coordinated to work toward the single goal of\nmaking antimalarial drugs as hastily as possible. Given China\u2019s limited\neconomic power and scientific research experience in the '60s and '70s, the\nProject mobilized the most human and material resources possible at the time.\n\nThe reason Project 523 was able to mobilize massive resources was because it\nwas a covert state project born out of an urgent mission to aid a political\nally during wartime. By 1971, more than 70 research institutions across a\nrange of sectors joined the effort. Medical research groups were joined by\npharmaceutical companies, chemical and spice factories, botany institutes, and\ninsect science institutes. Alongside Tu\u2019s group at ICMM were many other\nresearch groups in hospitals and universities that worked on making mosquito\nrepellents from a wide range of plants, developing antimalarial acupuncture,\ndeveloping quinine and quinidine, isolating compounds from yingzhao\n(Artabotrys uncinatus (L.) Merr.), isolating zinc pyridinethione from\nlingshuianluo (Polyalthia nemoralis), and more. It was within this nexus of\nideas and materials that Tu worked.\n\nEven while schisms about how much credit to bestow individually on Tu Youyou\nremain, the story surrounding the discovery of Artemisinin deserves to be more\nwidely known. Precipitated by the dire consequences malaria caused to soldiers\nin a complex war and Mao\u2019s agenda to merge Chinese and Western medicine, or tu\nand yang sciences, artemisinin traversed through a vast range of actors,\ngeographies, and methodologies. The principal discovery happened during the\nthick of the Cultural Revolution in an episode of history commonly connoted as\nanti-science. A single sentence regarding the temperature at which to process\na plant from a 1700-year-old Chinese text made possible the isolation and\nproduction of a now globally consumed drug.\n\nAlthough unlikely to serve as a model for any future drug discovery due to its\nunique configuration of historical circumstances, artemisinin\u2019s (re)discovery\nin Cold War China is a story of how an uncommon arrangement of human and\nmaterial resources and methodologies gave rise to one of the most important\nmedical breakthroughs of the 20th century.\n\nWendi Yan is a researcher and artist.

China wanted to limit\nthe collaboration to the technical realm and lead the key tasks in research,\nand proposed to amend certain clauses in the agreement drafted by the U.S\nDepartment of Defense, including letting Chinese scientists bring artemisinin\nto the U.S (instead of having them handed over by WHO).\n\n2\n\nIn 1985, Daniel Klayman published an article in Science about Chinese\nscientists\u2019 discovery of artemisinin and WRAIR\u2019s investigation on A. annua\nthat began in 1983.
