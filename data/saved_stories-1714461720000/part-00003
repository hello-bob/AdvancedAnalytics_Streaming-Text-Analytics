Many experts said that could not happen\nwithout widespread layoffs and a downturn. The economy has gained 2.4 million\njobs so far this year, and growth has accelerated, with an annualized rate\ntopping 5 percent in the third quarter. The good news has also fueled a stock\nmarket rally. In polls, people are downbeat about this economy, but their\nactions don\u2019t match their words. There has been a consumption boom this year.\nAmericans continued to spend heavily on apparel, concerts and vacations. In\nmany ways, this is the year the economy finally returned to something close to\nnormal. But many people seem to have forgotten what normal looks like after a\ntraumatic few years.\n\n  * Opinion|Is another Trump coup case really necessary? Yes.
