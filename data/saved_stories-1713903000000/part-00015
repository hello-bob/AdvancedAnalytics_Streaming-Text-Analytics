Oxford\nEconomics\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 22 20248:45 PM EDT\n\nLee Ying Shan@in/ying-shan-lee@LeeYingshan\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * The world's food prices are expected to decline and see a bottom this year, offering some relief for shoppers' wallets, said Oxford Economics.\n  * \"Our baseline forecast is for world food commodity prices to register an annual decline this year,\" said the economic advisory firm.\n\nA food shopper searches for vegetables July 1, 2023 at the Hannaford\nsupermarket in South Burlington, Vermont.\n\nRobert Nickelsberg | Getty Images\n\nRising food prices around the world may finally be seeing a bottom this year.\n\nAccording to Oxford Economics, global food prices are expected to decline in\n2024, offering some relief for shoppers.\n\n\"Our baseline forecast is for world food commodity prices to register an\nannual decline this year, reducing pressure on food retail prices further\ndownstream,\" the economic advisory firm wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe key driving force behind the decline in food commodity prices is the\n\"abundant supply\" for many important crops, especially wheat and maize.\n\nBumper harvests in recent months for both staple crops led to a steady decline\nin prices. Wheat futures have fallen almost 10% year-to-date, while maize\nfutures lost about 6% over the same period, according to FactSet data.\n\nFarmers ramped up production of both wheat and corn grains following higher\nprices after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAs a result, global maize harvests for the marketing year ending August this\nyear are likely to come in at record levels, according to Oxford's analysis.\nWheat harvests are also forecast to come in high, although slightly lower than\nthe record level in marketing year 2022 to 2023, the Oxford report said.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine war\n\nSupply pressures of grains in Russia and Ukraine have also eased.\n\nDespite the collapse of the Black Sea Grain initiative in July last year,\nUkrainian agricultural exports have been holding up well, Oxford Economics'\nLead Economist Kiran Ahmed wrote.\n\nRussian wheat exports have also been flooding international markets, keeping\nprices low, he added.\n\nPrices of wheat and maize since the start of the year\n\nWheat and maize, along with rice, account for over half of global caloric\nintake. That means the direction of their prices will critically influence\nconsumers' food budgets around the world, the report pointed out.\n\nEven though wheat and corn prices have seen a robust decline, rice prices have\nbeen steadily climbing, with global supplies hampered by export restrictions\nimposed by India, which accounts for around 40% of the world's rice\nproduction. Poor harvests in the country last year also pushed prices higher.\nContrary to the slump seen in wheat and maize prices, rough rice futures have\ngained over 8% year-to-date.\n\nGlobal food prices registered a decline of 9% in 2023, according to the World\nBank. Similarly, the United Nations food agency's world price index hit a\nthree-year low in February, but saw a slight rebound in March, lifted by\nincreases for dairy products, meat and vegetable oils.\n\n\"We expect prices to fall a further 5.6% this year before picking up on an\nannual basis next year,\" said Ahmed.\n\nThat said, Oxford Economics noted that risks to its food price forecast are\nstill \"overwhelmingly skewed to the upside,\" with adverse weather conditions\non the cards.\n\nBad weather has been denting confidence of agribusinesses and crop outlooks,\nwith cocoa recently soaring to record levels as West African farmers battle\nwith inclement weather and disease. If poor weather conditions persist,\nharvest prospects could be impaired in other key crop growing regions, the\nnote added.\n\n\"However, we think prices are now near a floor and will begin to rise\ngradually through [the second half of] 2024,\" the report said.\n\nBuyers in Africa and Asia have also held back from purchasing wheat on hopes\nof even lower prices \u2014 and their return to the market could drive a recovery\nin prices, Ahmed said. Additionally, rice prices, which remain high, could\nalso encourage more export restrictions coming out of India.\n\n\"Thus, while our base case is for food prices to remain subdued this year, the\nrisks are building that prices could rebound more sharply than anticipated.\nThis could keep food price inflation higher than in our base case, maintaining\npressure on the consumer,\" he concluded.\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
