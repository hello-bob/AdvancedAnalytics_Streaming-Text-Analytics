Today, wolves, foxes, and\nsnakes inhabit the cave, but it was once a popular spot for human pastoralists\nand their domesticated animals. The new study, published today in the journal\nPLoS One, examined faunal remains and rock art in the region and adds to a\ngrowing body of research into the system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHyenas Left a Massive Pile of Bones in a Saudi Arabian Lava Tube\n\nEarth's 8 Weirdest Cave Systems\n\n\u2018It\u2019s About Reporting, It\u2019s About Doing Good Journalism\u2019 | Civil War Interview\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\n\u2018It\u2019s About Reporting, It\u2019s About Doing Good Journalism\u2019 | Civil War Interview\n\n\u201cThe findings at Umm Jirsan provide a new type of archaeological site in the\nregion, and one where organic material like bone and deeply layered sediments\nare much better preserved,\u201d said Mathew Stewart, a zooarchaeologist at\nGriffith University in Australia and the study\u2019s lead author, in an email to\nGizmodo. \u201cWe had no expectations to find archaeology at Umm Jirsan. In fact,\nwe were mostly interested in seeing the large caches of bones that had been\npreviously reported.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, a team that included Stewart found evidence in 2021 that striped\nhyenas were creating bone caches in the back of the cave. There are hundreds\nof thousands of bones in Umm Jirsan, the team found, belonging to at least 40\nspecies and dating from the Neolithic to as recently as the Victorian Era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the oldest dated faunal remains in the cave are about 7,000 years old,\nStewart told Gizmodo that animals have likely used the lava tubes since they\nformed, millions of years ago. Seven of the lava flows in Harrat Khaybar are\nless than 1,500 years old, according to the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Global\nVolcanism Program, and the region still has the potential for activity,\naccording to a 2022 study.\n\nThe interior of the lava tube.Photo: Green Arabia Project\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their new paper, the researchers reported evidence for human occupation of\nthe lava tube between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age\u2014in other words, humans\nmade use of the tube for millennia. Isotopic analysis of the human remains in\nthe cave revealed an increase of foods in their diet that had high levels of a\ncertain isotope of carbon associated with oasis agriculture.\n\nBut the team concluded that Umm Jirsan was probably not permanently occupied.\nRather, they think it was a convenient spot for herders to stop and provide\ntheir flocks with shade and water. Based on human use of the surrounding\narea\u2014evinced by nearby rock art and other faunal records\u2014the team posited that\nthe lava tube \u201cwas situated along a pastoral route linking key oases.\u201d So you\ncan think of Umm Jirsan more as an ancient truck stop than a place of\nresidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rock art described by the team was found at a nearby collapsed lava tube\nnortheast of Umm Jirsan. The researchers reported 16 rock art panels depicting\ncattle, sheep, goats, and possibly ibexes.\n\nEven though humans didn\u2019t have a permanent presence in the lava tube, the\nnatural structure provided shelter for people and their herds for thousands of\nyears. In the harsh desert environment, the promise of a break from the sun,\nwind, and heat would\u2019ve made Umm Jirsan a perfect prehistoric pit stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Hyenas Left a Massive Pile of Bones in a Saudi Arabian Lava Tube\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
