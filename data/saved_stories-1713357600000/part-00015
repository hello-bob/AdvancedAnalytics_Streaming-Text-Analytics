One theoretical weakness of\n> transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential\n> computation and state tracking (Merrill and Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are\n> explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to\n> recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over\n> transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the\n> answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is\n> limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation\n> outside the complexity class \\mathsf{TC}^0. In particular, this means they\n> cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It\n> follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with\n> certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To\n> supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-\n> style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent\n> formulation, the \"state\" in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar\n> expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which\n> may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking\n> problems.\n\nComments:| Preprint  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Complexity (cs.CC);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08819 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08819v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08819arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: William Merrill [view email] [v1] Fri, 12 Apr 2024 21:30:06 UTC (69 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Illusion of State in State-Space Models, by\nWilliam Merrill and Jackson Petty and Ashish Sabharwal\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CC cs.CL cs.FL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
