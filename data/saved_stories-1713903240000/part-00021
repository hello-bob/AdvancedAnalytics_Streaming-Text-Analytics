outcomes.\n\nThe data, released by the Community College Research Center and the Aspen\nInstitute College Excellence Program, found about one-third of community\ncollege students transfer to a four-year school with less than half graduating\nwithin six years \u2014 equating to the net completion rate of 16 percent.\n\nBut the report, in collaboration with the National Student Clearinghouse\nResearch Center, saw even smaller completion rates for students who are Black,\nLatino and low-income at 9, 13 and 11 percent respectively.\n\nJohn Fink (Community College Research Center)\n\nJohn Fink, a senior research associate at the Community College Research\nCenter, said this is because the transfer system is \u201criddled with barriers\u201d\nfrom the historic lack of collaboration between community colleges and four-\nyear schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an equitable system when we rely on [community college] students to\ncome in with knowledge of this hidden curriculum on how to transfer instead of\nholding institutions responsible for creating clear pathways and adequate\nadvising along the way,\u201d Fink said.\n\nThe confusion and lack of clarity has added to students\u2019 growing disdain for\nworking towards a four-year degree as recent enrollment gains come\nparticularly from community colleges with a vocational program focus, Fink\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe [transfer system] largely replicates existing societal inequities,\u201d Fink\nsaid. \u201cThe folks who are going to community college in large numbers are from\ncommunities that have historically had less access to bachelor and graduate\ndegrees \u2014 like low-income and students of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no additional resources and support to make up for this, you can\nexpect to see these disparities in completion outcomes,\u201d Fink said.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Job Focused Community College Programs Grow \u2014 But Grim Transfer Trend\nContinues\n\n### Disparate Bachelor\u2019s Degree Outcomes\n\nThe report showed mixed four-year completion outcomes from community college\ntransfers demographically, Fink said.\n\nLow-income, Black and Latino students saw completion rates below the national\naverage, in addition to men and students 25 years or older.\n\nBut high-income, Asian and White students saw completion rates above the\nnational average, in addition to women and students 18 to 19 years old.\n\nA Flourish chart\n\nFink said completion rates have increased slightly compared to previous years\n\u2014 jumping from 14 percent in 2016.\n\nBut he noted the increase is \u201cnot a lot [and] definitely not where we need it\nto be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is so much potential here to create greater economic mobility, to\nfurther diversify student bodies and to bring in community college transfers\nthat can perform at the same if not higher rates than non-transfer students,\u201d\nFink said.\n\nFink said creating a \u201csense of belonging\u201d on campus and expanding core\npractices such as dual enrollment will greatly improve transfer completion\noutcomes.\n\n\u201cVisibility, belonging and inclusion are important things to think about in\norder to change some of these dismal outcomes nationally,\u201d Fink said.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Stress Leading Cause Why Black and Latino Students Leave College\n\n### \u2018Exclusionary\u2019 Transfer Practices\n\nDr. Marielena DeSanctis, president of the Community College of Denver, said\nthe completion disparities for students from low-income backgrounds are\ntroubling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of data that speaks to more and more jobs requiring a\nbachelor\u2019s degree, so it\u2019s concerning when you start limiting the number of\npeople that can attain one,\u201d DeSanctis said.\n\nDr. Marielena DeSanctis (Community College of Denver)\n\nDeSanctis, who previously worked at Broward College, said Florida has a very\ndifferent landscape for students to transfer from a community college to a\nfour-year school compared to Colorado.\n\n\u201cThere was no question that the courses you were taking were going to transfer\nand that it was going to be equivalent credits [but] here in Colorado that\u2019s\nnot the case,\u201d DeSanctis said, noting the harm of \u201cexclusionary\u201d transfer\npractices she\u2019s noticed from four-year schools.\n\n\u201cBecause community colleges tend to be more racially and ethnically diverse,\nwe should be telling students that community college is a vehicle to transfer\nto a university \u2014 particularly students that are ready to change the\ntrajectory of their lives,\u201d DeSanctis said.\n\nDebi Gaitan, vice president of student services at Northwest Vista College,\nagreed with DeSanctis, adding that constraints placed on students from low-\nincome backgrounds shouldn\u2019t hinder them from having access to a four-year\nschool whether they decide to transfer or go straight into the workforce.\n\n\u201cSan Antonio is very much a city where we can see where our communities of\npoverty reside and they feed directly into our institutions,\u201d Gaitan said,\nnoting that her students are often part-time, caring for family members and\nworking to make ends meet.\n\nDebi Gaitan (Northwest Vista College)\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure the stigma of not completing is not placed on this\npopulation,\u201d Gaitan said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about \u2018did they reach their goal of being\nable to get a better job with better income to get out of poverty.\u2019\u201d\n\nGaitan said it\u2019s important for both community colleges and four-year schools\nto actively reach out to students from low-income backgrounds.\n\n\u201cStudents that have choices and are resourced know about us and know what we\nhave to offer,\u201d Gaitan said. \u201cTherefore we need to shift to the communities\nthat don\u2019t know we\u2019re here...[because] students from intergenerational cycles\nof poverty need those same resources our upwardly mobile, higher income\ncommunities already have.\u201d\n\nGaitan said resources that have been effective in her community include\ncounseling programs and \u201capartment starters\u201d where students have access to\nmicrowaves, washing machines and other household needs so they can focus on\ntheir studies.\n\n\u201cThese are communities that need us to be different and need us to be doing\nmore,\u201d Gaitan said. \u201cWe want as many people in higher education to know this\nas possible because that\u2019s how we have learned and that\u2019s how we have adopted\nand adapted some really promising practices.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\n#### On-The-Job Training Prevails as Students\u2019 Disinterest in College Grows\n\nThis article is
