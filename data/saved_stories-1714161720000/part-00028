Clem over at element14presents shows\nus how.\n\n##\n\nSmart Fart Glasses\n\nFed up with nasty whiffs assailing your nostrils? Mellow Labs has you covered\nwith their latest invention - Smart Fart Glasses!\n\n##\n\nWho Needs a Tesla?\n\nBleep Track certainly doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s got an electric car that was made back in\n1993 - all it needs is a bit of TLC to bring it back to life.\n\n##\n\n1,200 LED Speed Build!\n\nThe amazing Becky Stern had just one week to pull this off - Build 1,200 LED\nlight display that would be robust enough to float on a raft containing\nfireworks!\n\n##\n\nLook at My Balls!\n\nThat\u2019s right, atomic14 has been playing with his balls - and he invites you to\ntake closer look at them...\n\n##\n\nCreative LEDs: The Series!\n\nWant to get cracking on a project involving LEDs, but don\u2019t know where to\nstart or need a refresher? TechnoChic has a new series starting that is right\nup your street.\n\n##\n\nCustom Cables\n\nMultiple modules, multiple motors, cameras, sensors? You\u2019re going to have to\ndesign a cable harness to plug it all together. Stephen Hawes shows us how\nit\u2019s done and demonstrates the WireViz tool.\n\n#\n\nThings To Read\n\n##\n\nGiant 6502 Project\n\nMeet the MOnSter 6502, a grand-scale, working replica of the iconic MOS 6502\nmicroprocessor, familiar to many from the Apple II, Commodore PET, and more.\n\n#\n\nOptiGap Sensor System\n\nIn very general terms, this sensor is basically a rope that if bent can tell\nyou where along its length you bent it. The fancy term for that is \u201cbend\nlocalization.\u201d\n\n##\n\nGlobal Plug Parade\n\nTake a tour through the electrifying world of plug sockets and switches with\nthe Electrical Items Collection.\n\n##\n\nGPS Receiver From Scratch\n\nThis is a four part series on receiving GPS signals using Software Defined\nRadio - fascinating stuff!\n\n##\n\nMini Wii\n\nI thought that the Wii was already pretty small - but this is amazing - no\nlarger than a deck of playing cards!\n\n#\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWhether it's through breathing new life into vintage technology, pushing the\nboundaries of modern engineering, or simply crafting something silly yet\nsurprisingly functional, each project tells a story of passion, perseverance,\nand creativity.\n\nRemember, the maker journey is one of endless learning and discovery. Every\nresistor soldered, every line of code written, and even every \"oops\" moment\nthat sends you back to the drawing board, is a step towards becoming a more\nskilled and inspired creator.\n\nWho knows what incredible projects we'll get to feature in next month's\nedition? Until then, keep making magic happen. And if you stumble upon a\nproject or idea that lights up your circuit board, don't keep it to yourself \u2014\nshare it with us for a chance to be featured in a future newsletter.\n\nHere's to a fantastic month ahead, full of innovation, inspiration, and, most\nimportantly, fun.\n\nShare\n\nShare this post\n\n#### April 2024 Maker News Roundup\n\nmakernews.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nJuly Update\n\nIt's the first edition - keep this as it may be worth something one day...\n\nJul 31, 2022\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### July Update\n\nmakernews.substack.com\n\n2\n\nAugust Update\n\nSecond edition - this could be worth even more than the first edition!
