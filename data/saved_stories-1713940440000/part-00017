The final rule is expected to\nresult in higher earnings for workers, with estimated earnings increasing for\nthe average worker by an additional $524 per year, and it is expected to lower\nhealth care costs by up to $194 billion over the next decade. In addition, the\nfinal rule is expected to help drive innovation, leading to an estimated\naverage increase of 17,000 to 29,000 more patents each year for the next 10\nyears under the final rule.\n\nImage\n\nNoncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing\ncontractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting\na new business. Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they\nwant to leave or bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced\nto switch to a lower-paying field, being forced to relocate, being forced to\nleave the workforce altogether, or being forced to defend against expensive\nlitigation. An estimated 30 million workers\u2014nearly one in five Americans\u2014are\nsubject to a noncompete.\n\nUnder the FTC\u2019s new rule, existing noncompetes for the vast majority of\nworkers will no longer be enforceable after the rule\u2019s effective date.\nExisting noncompetes for senior executives - who represent less than 0.75% of\nworkers - can remain in force under the FTC\u2019s final rule, but employers are\nbanned from entering into or attempting to enforce any new noncompetes, even\nif they involve senior executives. Employers will be required to provide\nnotice to workers other than senior executives who are bound by an existing\nnoncompete that they will not be enforcing any noncompetes against them.\n\nIn January 2023, the FTC issued a proposed rule which was subject to a 90-day\npublic comment period. The FTC received more than 26,000 comments on the\nproposed rule, with over 25,000 comments in support of the FTC\u2019s proposed ban\non noncompetes. The comments informed the FTC\u2019s final rulemaking process, with\nthe FTC carefully reviewing each comment and making changes to the proposed\nrule in response to the public\u2019s feedback.\n\nIn the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair method\nof competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for\nemployers to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce certain\nnoncompetes.\n\nThe Commission found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive\nconditions in labor markets by inhibiting efficient matching between workers\nand employers. The Commission also found that noncompetes tend to negatively\naffect competitive conditions in product and service markets, inhibiting new\nbusiness formation and innovation. There is also evidence that noncompetes\nlead to increased market concentration and higher prices for consumers.\n\n## Alternatives to Noncompetes\n\nThe Commission found that employers have several alternatives to noncompetes\nthat still enable firms to protect their investments without having to enforce\na noncompete.\n\nTrade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) both provide employers\nwith well-established means to protect proprietary and other sensitive\ninformation. Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a noncompete\nalready have an NDA.\n\nThe Commission also finds that instead of using noncompetes to lock in\nworkers, employers that wish to retain employees can compete on the merits for\nthe worker\u2019s labor services by improving wages and working conditions.\n\n## Changes from the NPRM\n\nUnder the final rule, existing noncompetes for senior executives can remain in\nforce. Employers, however, are prohibited from entering into or enforcing new\nnoncompetes with senior executives. The final rule defines senior executives\nas workers earning more than $151,164 annually and who are in policy-making\npositions.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission has eliminated a provision in the proposed rule\nthat would have required employers to legally modify existing noncompetes by\nformally rescinding them. That change will help to streamline compliance.\n\nInstead, under the final rule, employers will simply have to provide notice to\nworkers bound to an existing noncompete that the noncompete agreement will not\nbe enforced against them in the future. To aid employers\u2019 compliance with this\nrequirement, the Commission has included model language in the final rule that\nemployers can use to communicate to workers.\n\nThe Commission vote to approve the issuance of the final rule was 3-2 with\nCommissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew N. Ferguson voting no. Commissioners\u2019\nwritten statements will follow at a later date.\n\nThe final rule will become effective 120 days after publication in the Federal\nRegister.\n\nOnce the rule is effective, market participants can report information about a\nsuspected violation of the rule to the Bureau of Competition by emailing\nnoncompete@ftc.gov.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission develops policy initiatives on issues that affect\ncompetition, consumers, and the U.S. economy.
