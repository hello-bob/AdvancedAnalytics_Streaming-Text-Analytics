Three non-expert participants create a three-\ndimensional \u201chologram\u201d of a fourth participant\u2019s physical, psychological and\nsocial health, and each becomes, the focus of three other people\u2019s care in an\nexpanding network.\n\nWhat is The Hologram? The premise is simple: three people \u2013 the \u2018Triangle\u2019 \u2013\nmeet on a regular basis, to listen to and support the physical, mental and\nsocial health of a fourth person \u2013 the \u2018Hologram\u2019.\n\nThe Hologram, in turn, teaches these listeners how to give and also receive\ncare. When they are ready, the Hologram will support them to each set up their\nown triangle, and so the system expands.\n\nThis social technology is based on the experimental care models developed in\nthe Social Solidarity Clinics in Greece during the height of the financial and\nmigration crisis. The result is the construction of a robust multidimensional\nhealth network, collectively-oriented social practices, and trust that can\noutlive capitalism.\n\nIts protocol ensures that all caretakers are cared for, and regards properly\nsupporting someone else\u2019s wellbeing as therapeutic in itself. The Hologram is\na mythoreal viral distribution system for non-expert healthcare, practiced\nfrom couches around the world.\n\nSign up to the community of practice newsletter here!\n\nHow to start your own Hologram\n\nEmail cooperativespecies@gmail.com with any questions\n\nT&Cs\n\n", "frontpage": false}
