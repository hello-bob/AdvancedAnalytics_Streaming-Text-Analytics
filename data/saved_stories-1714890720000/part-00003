X user HXL made the rare find and posted\nscreenshots of the Bilibili video with the reported specifications.\n\nWhile we expected to see a CPU with a 128MB L3 cache, we observed different\nspecs. According to both Windows Task Manager and CPU-Z, the reported capacity\nof the L3 cache was 192MB. All of the other specifications look normal. AMD\ndesigned the Ryzen 9 7950X3D for gamers who wanted to enjoy CPU-limited games\nwhile still enjoying the productivity benefits of a 16-core CPU. It utilizes\nAMD\u2019s second-gen 3D V-Cache and, according to our testing, surpasses Intel\u2019s\nfastest chip.\n\nSome responses to HXL\u2019s screenshots suggested a bug in Windows. One user\nbelieves that it\u2019s an old CPUID bug that erroneously reports 192MB on the L3\ncache. Others suggested that the builder lucked out and got an engineering\nsample, such as a prototype with a double 3D V-Cache die. Unfortunately, the\nuser didn\u2019t perform any benchmarks to verify the integrity of the amount of\nreported L3 cache.\n\n(Image credit: X user HXL)\n\nWhile a software bug is possible, we can\u2019t discard the fact that the Ryzen 9\n7950X3D could be an early engineering sample that AMD was playing with. The\ntechnology is there, where the chiplets add 64MB of 7nm SRAM cache stacked on\ntop of each core complex die (CCD). It can produce up to 192MB of L3 cache per\nRyzen processor.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nBefore AMD released the Ryzen 9 7950X3D in 2023, Gamers Nexus visited the\ncompany\u2019s campus in Austin, Texas. During that visit, the team discussed the\ndifferent configurations tested with AMD. Among these were samples with\nmultiple 3D stacked cache dies, which could lead to the 192MB L3 cache\nconfiguration being considered. The chipmaker demonstrated an unreleased Ryzen\n9 5950X3D with a 192MB L3 cache to Gamers Nexus, so we know at least one\nexists.\n\nUltimately, AMD may have opted not to manufacture the Ryzen 9 7950X3D in that\nconfiguration to maintain a uniform L3 cache pool. The engineers found that\nhaving multiple cache pools caused increased latency in most games, decreasing\nperformance rather than increasing it. If an engineering sample is created,\nthere\u2019s always a chance of it slipping through the cracks. These prototypes\nare supposed to be recycled or destroyed, of course, but mistakes happen. It\nseems most likely this extremely rare CPU with an extra L3 cache is one of\nthose engineering samples.\n\nAlternatively, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D with 192MB L3 cache may be an engineering\nsample of AMD\u2019s upcoming EPYC 4004 series, which are server-grade Zen 4 chips\nwith 3D V-Cache for the mainstream AM5 socket.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

If you\nwant \"it all\", gaming, professional workloads, it delivers like no others. I\nam looking forward to seeing the 8000 series and its comparative performance.\nMaybe an 8800X3D?\n\nReply\n\n  * Vanderlindemedia\n\nThe amount of cache may simply line-up.
