I started out in September 2003\nat avc.typepad.com but moved to avc.com a few years later.\n\nAVC.com has been my home for blogging for over twenty years.\n\nAVC.com has served me very well over the years but it lacks a few things that\nreally matter to me.\n\nFirst, the posts are stored in a closed database hosted by me in the cloud.\n\nSecond, the services that I use to create AVC.com are not \u201ccomposable\u201d meaning\nthat others cannot build things on top of AVC.com and the services that create\nand display the posts I create here.\n\nThird, the identities of the authors (me) and readers (you) here at AVC.com\nare not tied to any sort of portable identity and reputation system.\n\nWhile none of these issues may seem like a big deal to you, they are huge deal\nto me as I will explain in a bit.\n\nSo when web3 blogging services started cropping up, I started to use them.\n\nMy first rodeo was at Mirror.xyz where I kept avc.mirror.xyz for most of 2021,\n2022, and 2023. This was my first post at avc.mirror.xyz on March 18, 2021.\n\nI really wanted to blog at AVC.xyz and that became an option for me in\nNovember 2023 when I joined Paragraph.xyz and wrote this Hello World post.\n\nThese web3 blogging platforms store all of my posts onchain at Arweave. These\nposts are available to anyone to read regardless of what blogging platform I\nuse. And if I get abducted by an alien and fail to pay my hosting service,\nthey will still exist onchain. Forever. That\u2019s a huge deal to me.\n\nThey are also composable web3 services. Any developer can take what I create\nat AVC.xyz and build on top of it. That\u2019s also a huge deal to me. My partner\nNick describes the composability benefit so well in his post today on USV.com.\n\nAnd my identity and the identity of my readers are mapped to a web3 wallet\naddress that authenticates who they are, what they do onchain, and allows\ndevelopers to create reputation systems on everyone. Given my fight with spam\nand trolls and jerks and assholes that largely drove me away from blogging and\ncommenting in the latter part of the last decade, this last bit really matters\nto me.\n\nAt the start of this year, I took everyone who receives an email when I post\nhere at AVC.com and imported that email list to Paragraph.xyz. So a lot of the\nAVC readers have been getting emails of my posts at AVC.xyz this year. But\neven so, I still get a ton of daily traffic here at AVC.com and I have not\nposted anything new here since January 10, 2024.\n\nI do not plan to post here at AVC.com going forward, but I will keep the\narchive up and I may choose to cross-post a thing or two here whenever I want\nto reach the broadest audience.\n\nMy home for blogging is and has been onchain for a while now and if you want\nto follow my writing, please go visit avc.xyz and subscribe to receive my blog\nposts via email by clicking the green subscribe button on the upper right.\n\nBut what about Mirror.xyz and avc.mirror.xyz? you might ask.\n\nWell, I am also thrilled to be able to say that Mirror and Paragraph have\nmerged and these two leading web3 blogging services will now be one. And, as\nyou may know or suspect, USV has invested in both of them and now will be a\nmajor shareholder in the merged company. I am very excited about that. Here is\nParagraph\u2019s blog post about the transaction and here is Mirror\u2019s.\n\nThe team that built Mirror.xyz is now turning their attention to a new app\ncalled Kiosk and they blogged about that today. So USV is now also an investor\nin that project.\n\nOver the last thirty years, our lives moved from offline to online. They are\nnow moving onchain. That\u2019s a wonderful thing and I hope you will join me in\nmoving onchain as well.\n\nCollect this post to permanently own it.\n\nSubscribe to AVC and never miss a post.\n\n### What's your email?\n\nSubscribe to never miss a post.\n\nNo thanks\n\nRSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 AVC\n\n", "frontpage": false}
