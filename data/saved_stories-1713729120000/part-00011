Just ask anyone who\u2019s ever held a quiz created from the\nchemicals of a ditto machine.\n\nBut the 1942 invention of xerography, the dry-photocopying technique that made\nit possible to easily reprint documents, had a strange effect on society. It\nmade the reproduction of printed material not only easy, but cost-\neffective\u2014particularly in offices.\n\nAnd for businesses that relied on the scarcity of information as a business\nmodel, the photocopier was bad news\u2014and, in many ways, it showed cracks in the\ncopyright system.\n\nA 1975 Supreme Court decision, Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States,\ncreated a \u201cfair use\u201d gap for copying in some cases\u2014and that gap wasn\u2019t wide\nenough to answer every question about this disruptive technology. (It was one\nof the first examples of the court taking a cautious approach to disruptive\ntechnology, a trend that would continue in the decades to come.)\n\nThe somewhat narrow finding of Williams & Wilkins meant that copyright\nchallenges around the copier often played out in public, in the media, and in\nthe courtroom. And even the Copyright Act of 1976, which codified the common\nlaw doctrine of \u201cfair use,\u201d didn\u2019t fully clear up the details of an emerging\narea of law.\n\nStrangely enough, one of the first places where these problems showed\nthemselves wasn\u2019t in a library or in a giant office\u2014but in the Catholic\nChurch.\n\n###\n\nThe music publisher that sued the Catholic Church\n\nSome might see suing a religious institution claiming copyright infringement\nas unsavory. FEL Publications would disagree.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the tiny religious music publisher sued 15 separate\nAmerican Roman Catholic archdioceses\u2014including the Archdiocese of Chicago\u2014for\nsharing copies of the publisher\u2019s music with their parishioners without\npermission.\n\nDennis Fitzpatrick, the company\u2019s president, made a religious argument for the\nlawsuits in a UPI story:\n\nI believe on the Day of Judgment I will be asked\u2014like the servant entrusted\nwith the silver pieces (Matthew 25:14-30)\u2014what I did with the copyrights that\nwere entrusted to my care. Did I sue to protect them?\n\nUnfortunately for Fitzpatrick, a federal judge disagreed with FEL, dismissing\nthe claims in its lawsuit against the Catholic Bishop of Chicago, on grounds\nthat it used its position in the market to monopolize access to songs. (The\nruling is interesting, by the way\u2014apparently, FEL required churches to destroy\nevery copy of the music at the end of the license period\u2014which seems\nparticularly wasteful!)\n\nThe ripple effects of the lawsuit, even with FEL\u2019s loss, showed themselves\nthroughout the religious field. Protestant churches also had to navigate this\nmessy mix of legal precedent and morality. As one pastor put it in a 1983\nAtlanta Constitution piece: \u201cThe rationalization is this: \u2018God gave you a\nsong. You don\u2019t have the right to charge for it.\u2019\u201d\n\n###\n\nPublic enemy No. 1: the university copy center\n\nOf course, churches weren\u2019t the only institutions struggling with the\ncomplexities the copier created for its vendors. Also in this category were\nuniversities, which, as anyone who has paid hundreds of dollars for a textbook\ncan tell you, suffer from a captive-audience problem that professors and\nstudents alike spent years trying to work around.\n\nWhether the play is buying used books, purchasing books online at cheaper\nprices than in-person bookstores can offer, or \u201crenting\u201d books, there is a\ndesire not to pay publishers tons of money for books that add significant\ncosts to higher education. And copyright regulations, such as fair use and the\nfirst sale doctrine, were the cudgels that students, whether they realized it\nor not, were leveraging.\n\nAlso an important tool for cost-conscious students? Copy machines. Copiers\nmade it possible to work around this system in a fair-use way. Here\u2019s how: One\nstudent buys the book, then copies a single chapter\u2014the only one on the\nsyllabus. Someone makes a copy of the copy, and suddenly, the whole class has\na copy. Heck, maybe the professor is the one that makes the copy. It doesn\u2019t\nlook as good as the original, but as long as they get the necessary\ninformation, does it really matter?\n\nThe answer to whether copying a textbook is fair use is somewhat complicated,\nbut the short answer is essentially this: Yes, but only an excerpt. If you\ncommandeered a copier for three hours to copy the whole thing, that wouldn\u2019t\nbe allowed.\n\nThe risk of such willing infringement, though, created a lasting problem.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, these suddenly ubiquitous machines became a\nliability for universities and the businesses that served them.\n\nAnd the publishing industry, suddenly concerned that this was going to affect\ntheir bottom line, looked to legal action to resolve some of these issues.\n\nOne of the first conflicts of its kind emerged at New York University in the\nearly \u201980s, when numerous publishers\u2014backed by the Association of American\nPublishers\u2014sued the university, along with a handful of professors, for using\ncopies as teaching materials. Eventually, the threat of legal action led to an\nagreement\u2014the publishers would drop the suit if the school agreed to prudent\ncopying limitations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out to hang faculty members from a lamppost and cut out all\nphotocopying,\u201d said Jon A. Baumgarten, a lawyer for the association, in\ncomments to The New York Times in a 1983 article. \u201cThe assumption is not that\nphotocopying should be stopped, but that the rights of copyright owners should\nbe respected.\u201d\n\nBut the concern wasn\u2019t just professors\u2014also a major worry were nearby \u201ccopy\nshops,\u201d which allowed students to copy to their heart\u2019s content. One could\nimagine the model: A student buys a used book, goes to a copy shop, spends a\nfew hours copying, then returns and sells the book back, saving lots of money\nin the process. Eventually, the bookstores realized they could cut out the\nmiddle man and do the copying themselves, which they then turned into a\nservice called \u201ccourse packs.\u201d Professors eventually got in on the scheme, and\nboom, nobody has to buy the book this semester.\n\nThis model put a target on the back of these copy centers, and\npublishers\u2014whether focused on books or periodicals\u2014were ready to sue to\nprotect their copyrights.\n\nThe most dramatic such case came about in the mid-1990s, when Michigan\nDocument Services, a copy shop serving the University of Michigan, was sued by\nPrinceton University Press and other publishers for offering a service that\ncopied different books and other reading materials into inexpensive \u201ccourse\npacks.\u201d Unlike the NYU case, this one actually went to trial.\n\nEventually reaching the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court sided with\nthe publishers, finding the use case was not fair use, because Michigan\nDocument Services was willfully copying materials for profit-making\npurposes\u2014rather than what the Archdiocese of Chicago was doing, which was\nmaking copies for its own parishioners to sing.\n\nBut even that decision wasn\u2019t cut and dry, with the ruling only coming after\nthe full Sixth Circuit ruled on the case\u2014an appellate panel originally favored\nthe copy center, 2-1, meaning that things could have played out much\ndifferently.\n\nThe case, among others, helped give momentum to legal arguments against copy\nshops. By the early 2000s, publishers were aggressively going after \u201ccourse\npack\u201d businesses. Even the Times got in on the action, taking part in a\nlawsuit against a San Diego copy shop in 2004. During the late 2000s, when the\ninternet had already supplanted aggressive copying, publishers were still\ngoing after copy shops.\n\nStudents, for obvious reasons, sided with the copy shops. As Noam B. Katz\nwrote in a 2002 essay in The Harvard Crimson: \u201cBarring a change in legislation\nor jurisprudence, then, we must strive for creative, effective and legal\nsolutions to lift these crushing and senseless financial burdens from our\nstudent body.\u201d\n\nEveryone wants their piece.\n\n###\n\nWhy the newsletter was ground zero for photo-copying\n\nThese days, newsletters like this one are seen as easy-to-copy digital\nworks\u2014after all, you just need to forward one to share it\u2014but that\u2019s actually\nonly been a recent part of the newsletter\u2019s history.\n\nIn the past, newsletters were treated as more exclusive works, sent via the\nmail. They were often much more niche and exclusive\u2014and expensive\u2014in nature.\n\nAnd of course, newsletter publishers hated copying machines. These newsletters\nfocused on extremely niche information that their recipients paid top-dollar\nfor. And in some offices, that one newsletter could spread to numerous\npeople\u2014and cut them out of a bunch of revenue.\n\nThe Newsletter Association, a trade group for newsletter publishers, actually\nconsidered using its lobbying might to push for increased fines\u2014something the\nCopyright Act of 1976 didn\u2019t give strong-enough teeth in the view of\nnewsletter publishers.\n\n\u201cThis is from our standpoint one of the most important issues in the\nnewsletter industry,\u201d said Paul Warren, who led the association\u2019s copyright\ncommittee, in a 1986 UPI interview.\n\nSometimes, the newsletter publishers would get litigious. The UPI story\ndiscussed a $130 million lawsuit the company Princeton Economic Consultants\nfiled against a Toronto brokerage firm.\n\nEven law firms felt the wrath of the newsletter industry. A May 1991 ABA\nJournal story told the story of the law firm Collier, Shannon & Scott, the\ntarget of a $14 million lawsuit for willfully making copies of the $675-per-\nyear Product Safety News and sharing them around the office. Unlike most of\nthe companies Product Safety News\u2019 publisher, Washington Business Information,\nInc. sued, the law firm refused to settle.\n\nPerhaps this stance explains why the printed newsletter industry largely\ndisappeared when the internet came about, making this kind of reproduction\nissue nearly impossible to police.\n\n###\n\nDid copiers leave us awash in information?\n\nUltimately, copying changed culture for ways better and worse, depending on\nyour vantage point. It gave people access to information they would have had\nto pay good money for previously.\n\nIt led to some complaints of overexposure to information. Jerry V. Wilson, a\nformer Washington, D.C. police chief who later served as a Washington Post\ncolumnist while working at American University, called the Supreme Court\u2019s\nthen-recent Williams & Wilkins ruling a \u201cnon-decision\u201d and pointed out how\ncommittee meetings were often filled with wasteful copying that wasted\npeople\u2019s resources and time.\n\n\u201cMuch of the copyright infringement of photocopy is probably of that sort\u2014the\ncareless broadcast of matter only marginally or not at all wanted by the\nrecipient,\u201d he wrote in a piece titled \u201cThe Plague of the Photocopier.\u201d \u201cA\nplausible argument might be made that this is practically no infringement at\nall, since it doesn\u2019t supplant a sale.\u201d\n\n(Wilson would most assuredly find the internet\u2019s natural information overload\nparticularly problematic.)\n\nThe copy machine, in many ways, was an appetizer for the main course of\ndecaying copyright\u2014the internet, where restrictive approaches to publishing\nrun head-first into the chaotic winds of digital media, where laws like the\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act are less effective rule-making and more\nbandages on a restrictive approach to copyright law.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that companies once sued churches for making copies.\n\nSubscribe to Newart\n\n7 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Copier Wars: Fair Use\u2019s Rude Awakening\n\nnewart.press\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nPhotocopiers Terrified the Publishing World\n\n\u201cWhat Hath Xerox Wrought\u201d asked a 1976 Time Magazine headline, the proceeding\narticle prompted readers to imagine if: \u201csome inventive and omnipotent god...\n\nJul 25, 2023 \u2022\n\nLouis Anslow\n\n26\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Photocopiers Terrified the Publishing World\n\nnewart.press\n\n3\n\nArt Has Always Been Artificial\n\nFrom paint in tubes to typewriters to photography to digital art, the history\nof creativity is a history of disruptive technologies.\n\nJun 7, 2023 \u2022\n\nLouis Anslow\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Art Has Always Been Artificial\n\nnewart.press\n\n3\n\nWhen the Mac 'Ruined' Writing\n\n\ud83e\udeb6 Quills were once the default writing tool, when pens rose to prominence\ntheir impact on writing would be a hot debate in the literary world, one\nthat...\n\nSep 19, 2023 \u2022\n\nLouis Anslow\n\n22\n\nShare this post\n\n#### When the Mac 'Ruined' Writing\n\nnewart.press\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
