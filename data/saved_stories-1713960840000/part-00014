Founded in 1980,\nBeckhoff implements open automation systems using proven PC-based control\ntechnology. Their portfolio includes industrial PCs, I/O and fieldbus\ncomponents, drive technology, automation software, control cabinet-free\nautomation, and hardware for machine vision. Beckhoff has continually pushed\nthe boundaries of automation with its PC-based control systems, EtherCAT\nfieldbus technology, and TwinCAT automation software. These offerings empower\nindustries worldwide to achieve higher efficiency, flexibility, and precision\nin their processes. Beckhoff\u2019s commitment to open standards and modular\narchitecture fosters seamless integration and scalability, enabling tailored\nsolutions for diverse applications across various sectors, from manufacturing\nand automotive to energy and beyond.\n\n## The Need For Change\n\nFor more than 25 years, Beckhoff has used Windows as the exclusive operating\nsystem for its industrial PC products. As a result, Windows CE served as the\nbase for all of Beckhoff\u2019s smaller automation devices. In 2015, Beckhoff\u2019s\ncustomers noted ransomware attacks on their Windows-powered devices. With the\nend-of-life of Windows CE on the horizon, Beckhoff started to look elsewhere\nfor an operating system.\n\nBeckhoff needed a proven and reliable operating system that would support\ntheir product line\u2019s full range of hardware, from ARM to Intel Xeon.\nPreferring open standards, Beckhoff first looked at Linux as a choice to\nreplace Windows CE but was deterred due to The GNU General Public License that\nwould create additional legal complications for Beckhoff\u2019s customers as well\nas force Beckhoff to share their proprietary real-time, TwinCAT, which runs in\nkernel-mode. As a result, Beckhoff determined the need for an open source\noperating system with a permissive license, allowing them to adapt the kernel\nto accommodate the TwinCAT real-time without needing to contribute TwinCAT\u2019s\nsource code.\n\nA permissive license is a type of software license that grants recipients\nextensive rights to modify, use, and distribute software, often with minimal\nrestrictions. These licenses typically allow the software to be used in\nproprietary or closed-source projects without requiring those projects to\nrelease their source code. Permissive Licenses contrast with copyleft\nlicenses, which impose more stringent requirements on how the software can be\ndistributed and modified.\n\n## Identifying and Building a Solution\n\nBeckhoff turned to FreeBSD for its industrially proven and reliable reputation\nand its permissive licensing structure, which would allow Beckhoff to add\nTwinCAT to the kernel. FreeBSD has a healthy and active developer community\nthat has driven innovation for over 30 years and continues to do so. In\naddition, FreeBSD supports some of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands, like\nNetApp, Netflix, Netgate, Juniper, and more.\n\nWith help from FreeBSD\u2019s permissive licensing structure, Beckhoff combined\ntheir proprietary TwinCAT real-time with FreeBSD to create TwinCAT/BSD, a\npackaged-based operating system that provides an alternative to Windows.\n\nTwinCAT/BSD supports all TwinCAT 3 runtime functions and provides Beckhoff\nwith a low-cost and low-footprint solution that fits Beckhoff\u2019s smallest\ndevices. Heiko Wilke, Senior Product Manager at Beckhoff, notes that with\nWindows, Beckhoff used 1.5 gigabytes of memory in their devices for Windows\ninstallation alone. By comparison, Beckhoff\u2019s smallest device has only 2\ngigabytes of RAM.\n\nBecause FreeBSD doesn\u2019t include processes that aren\u2019t needed, Beckhoff can\nreduce its use to about 200 megabytes of RAM usage, according to Heiko Wilke,\nleaving much more room for additional programs on top of their operating\nsystem. In addition, Beckhoff also deploys TwinCAT/BSD as a package-based\nsystem to enable easier updates and to allow the removal of even more\nunnecessary programs. Because of their package-based approach, Beckhoff\u2019s\nTwinCAT/BSD has about half the footprint of standard FreeBSD installations.\n\n## Getting Started with FreeBSD\n\nBeckhoff\u2019s parting words of wisdom for any organization looking to implement\nFreeBSD are to consult The FreeBSD Foundation early and often. The FreeBSD\nFoundation can assist not only with technical and implementation questions but\nalso with networking and connecting members of the community. If your\norganization is thinking about getting started with FreeBSD, send The FreeBSD\nFoundation an email using the Contact Us page of their website, or download\nFreeBSD to get started today.\n\nTwinCAT\u00ae, TwinCAT/BSD\u00ae, and EtherCAT\u00ae are registered trademarks of Beckhoff\nAutomation GmbH.\n\nDownload the PDF  \n---  \n  \n3980 Broadway Street STE #103-107 Boulder CO 80304\n\n1-720-207-5142\n\ninfo@freebsdfoundation.org\n\n  * Forms\n  * Finances\n  * Legal\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Advocacy\n\nInstagram Facebook Twitter LinkedIn\n\n\u00a92001-2024 The FreeBSD Foundation.
