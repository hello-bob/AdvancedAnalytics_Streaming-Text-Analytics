Schmidt is an insider with 25+ years in the\nindustry, while Griffin is an outsider who has done well for herself by\nserializing two novels on her Substack. Neither makes one right or wrong, and\nboth have important thoughts to share. But Griffin\u2019s piece has achieved exit\nvelocity and been shared by several people in big-deal media; for example, the\npiece was linked to in Ross Douthat\u2019s NYT newsletter today. Here\u2019s her\nsummation:\n\n> The Big Five publishing houses spend most of their money on book advances\n> for big celebrities like Britney Spears and franchise authors like James\n> Patterson and this is the bulk of their business. They also sell a lot of\n> Bibles, repeat best sellers like Lord of the Rings, and children\u2019s books\n> like The Very Hungry Caterpillar. These two market categories (celebrity\n> books and repeat bestsellers from the backlist) make up the entirety of the\n> publishing industry and even fund their vanity project: publishing all the\n> rest of the books we think about when we think about book publishing (which\n> make no money at all and typically sell less than 1,000 copies).\n\nI\u2019ll tell you upfront that I think that Schmidt has a better grasp of the\nfacts, and I think Griffin\u2019s stance, while emotionally understandable, is\nreally an expression of a particular culture war rather than an honest survey\nof the industry. You may note that Griffin\u2019s last sentence here self-\ncontradicts; if there exists a \u201cvanity project\u201d of literary novels then\ncelebrity books and the backlist cannot make up \u201cthe entirety of the\npublishing industry.\u201d If you want to say that it\u2019s just exaggeration for\neffect\u2019s sake, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t do that, here, in this piece - if you\u2019re\nthrowing out numbers based on court testimony and professing to share the\nhidden secrets of an industry\u2019s economics, you can\u2019t allow yourself that kind\nof imprecision. And is it in fact true that all of the sales go to celebrities\nand the backlist? Of course not. Hanya Yanigahara\u2019s A Little Life sold a\nmillion and a half copies, and it\u2019s a relentlessly bleak literary novel by a\nwoman who was plugged in but not famous. Yanigahara\u2019s first novel The People\nin the Trees would probably slide comfortably into Griffin\u2019s definition of the\nvanity project side of publishing, but her more ambitious - and not at first\nglance any more commercial - second novel sold insanely well. Of course, now\nthat it\u2019s been a few years, Griffin might be tempted to relegate A Little Life\nto the backlist, but that wouldn\u2019t be very sensible. Every book on the\nbacklist was once a new book, after all. If Griffin will concede that the\nbacklist grows over time, that there are always new old books helping a\npublishing company\u2019s bottom line, her claims don\u2019t add quite add up. Somebody\nwho isn\u2019t a celebrity is selling books. Not many people, but enough.\n\nThe very fact that Griffin\u2019s piece went so viral is a good reason you should\nbe skeptical of it. A fairly dry discussion of publishing\u2019s sales numbers\nseems unlikely to attract that kind of attention. But Griffin is no dummy, and\nI think she was very deliberately courting an audience that the online\nnewsletter industry is absolutely stuffed with: people who carry around\nbitterness and resentment towards the traditional routes through which people\nachieve success in writing. Which might sound dismissive, but I don\u2019t mean it\nto be. There are very many reasons to hold resentment towards the people who\nhold the cards in publishing, and I myself carry around a degree of that\nbitterness and resentment myself. As I\u2019m still fairly new to publishing books,\nI don\u2019t have a lot of angst about that world yet. But I\u2019m 15 years into a\ncareer in media, and a lot of the frustrations, tensions, and bullshit are the\nsame. There\u2019s every chance for me to grow disenchanted by publishing the way\nothers have. I know that I\u2019ve enjoyed good fortune with books so far, despite\ntepid sales, and I know that I may not in the future. I understand the\nresentment.\n\nStill. The trouble with writing towards that kind of resentment is that, while\nit\u2019s a good way to juice subscriptions, it carries with it this inherent\ntendency to sacrifice what\u2019s accurate in favor of what\u2019s inflammatory. While\nGriffin never directly suggests that writing for big publishing houses has no\nadvantages, many on social media have taken exactly that point. One of the top\ncomments on Griffin\u2019s piece, which reflects the overall reaction, reads\n\n> Your report confirms all that I have long suspected as agents and the big\n> houses go. A very knowledgeable person told me recently that Hemingway and\n> McCarthy would not get published today were they just starting out. IMO you\n> waste valuable talent, time, and energy pursuing an agent and a big house.\n> Worthless now.\n\nWell, maybe Hemingway and McCarthy wouldn\u2019t get published today, no. You can\nnever be confident of that sort of thing, which is an indictment that applies\nto any of the creative industries. But I can only tell you that, personally,\nthe advantages of having an agent and a publishing house are considerable.\n\nI shopped my first novel (which I serialized here and may resurrect in some\nform someday) for over a year without success. I thought the process of\nselling a book was hopeless and opaque and hopelessly opaque. Then I got an\nagent, took meetings to try and sell my first book, and said \u201coh, dang,\u201d\nbecause I saw how necessary good representation is in the industry. You can\ncertainly say that this is all a part of the same problem, that agents are\nonly necessary because publishing is broken. But in the world of publishing\nthat we actually have, my agent has been invaluable. Meanwhile, the simple\nfact of the matter is that my first two books are better books because of all\nthe resources I had available to me. Having other people to shape the project\nis an advantage that cannot be replicated any other way. The teams I\u2019ve worked\nwith have been filled with talented people. The editing was often annoying and\noccasionally wrong but always valuable. The work dedicated not to composing or\nediting but to producing and marketing the book was valuable. Getting set up\nwith various podcasts and shows and book talks and events was valuable. Of\ncourse I understand that not everyone gets those affordances, and that that\u2019s\npart of the anger. But when you\u2019re specifically saying \u201cthis stuff has no\nvalue,\u201d I just think that\u2019s crazy. It certainly has had value for me.\n\nThe guy who bought my first book left St. Martin\u2019s three months after he\nbought it, under what I understood to be acrimonious terms. The imprint was\nfolded. (I think mine was the last book to appear with its logo.) This all\nshould have been bad news for The Cult of Smart; I mean, it was bad news, any\nway you slice it. The book was an orphan before I had written any of it. And\nyet I never felt badly served by the publishing house. To their eternal\ncredit, St. Martin\u2019s put their entire back into that book. It didn\u2019t sell\ngreat; as of last September it was at about 7500 copies moved, although I know\nthe marketing push for the second book has helped move some copies since.\nEither way, I\u2019m confident I got the best experience I could have expected\nunder those circumstances.\n\nAlso, you know... there\u2019s the money. The advance for my first book kept me\nalive when I was recently fired, broke, and hopeless in 2020. The advance for\nmy second book bought the house I\u2019m currently sitting in. This is life-\naltering stuff. Perhaps it\u2019s unwise for me to express the value of advances\nthat didn\u2019t earn out, but had I been on a self-publishing model and sold\nexactly as many copies as I did, I don\u2019t know how I would have made it in the\n2017-2021 period. Again, I understand that this is privileged territory I\u2019m\noccupying, but it\u2019s privileged territory I\u2019m in because I worked within those\ndisdained traditional publishing structures. Some people make immense amounts\nof money in self-publishing, too, and they\u2019re just giving a little cut to\nAmazon or whoever, not watching the agent take 15% and the publishing house\ntake most of the rest. It\u2019s all a series of tradeoffs and judgment calls. The\npoint is that there actually are tradeoffs to be made, and it\u2019s not at all\nclear to me that Griffin\u2019s rundown works for everyone, even while I\nacknowledge that it\u2019s working for her.\n\nAnd, look - I was negotiating with Simon & Schuster over my next nonfiction\nbook for four months, battling over tweaks to the proposal and to the slant of\nthe project that I found to be rather ancillary, and that was unpaid labor\nthat I found frustrating. Book promotion is a grind, though I can\u2019t imagine\nany scenario in which it wouldn\u2019t be. I am 0 for 2 when it comes to getting\nthe title I wanted, and while the novel carries the name I chose I will not be\nsurprised if I go 0 for 3 on nonfiction. (To be fair I don\u2019t even know what I\nwant the name to be for that book at present.) In general I think I\u2019ve lost\nevery argument that I\u2019ve had with a publishing company, and I doubt that will\nchange much over time. Which is fine -when you take people\u2019s money, it\u2019s no\nlonger just your book, and there are key decisions (such as losing six pages\nof scientific detail in The Cult of Smart) that are going to be frustrating.\nMeanwhile you\u2019ll recall that I said that nobody wanted to buy my first novel,\nand then I got my agent; funnily enough, he wasn\u2019t interested in that book\neither, and I was in a state in my life when I could not have had less juice\nabout such things, so I dropped it. If I chose to revamp the novel and try to\nself-publish it digitally, which I\u2019ve thought about, I would have to at least\ncheck my contract and maybe fork over a portion of the proceeds to my agency,\ndepending. There are complications and a loss of autonomy that come with all\nof this. But, for me? It\u2019s all been worth it, easily, and I say that as\nsomeone whose first two books sold well enough to not be embarrassing but are\nstill far from earning out their advances.\n\nForgive me for burying the lede to this degree, but - Griffin is not wrong\nthat celebrity books (almost never actually written by the celebrities) sop up\na distressing amount of book sales, that a huge portion of books don\u2019t make a\nprofit, or that in general publishing is a winner-take-all economy. But it is\na mistake to suggest that this is a new phenomenon.\n\nWhen I signed my first book deal, a friend who is himself a 20-year veteran of\npublishing sent me an email that included this sobering passage:\n\n> you have to understand, let\u2019s say a Big Five house puts out 75 books in a\n> year\n>\n> typical year? - 50 don\u2019t sell at all and are a clear financial loss; 15 sell\n> enough to recoup the advance and maybe the overhead for all the work that\n> went in; 5 are profitable but max out at modestly-to-moderately so; 5 are\n> big hits that, along with all the ancillaries and back catalog, make the\n> house\u2019s nut for that year\n\nThose are obviously loose and hypothetical numbers. But they match everything\nI\u2019ve heard anecdotally, and jibe with Griffin\u2019s figures from the trial. Again,\nthough, I think that this has always been more or less the plan for publishing\nhouses. It\u2019s a boom-or-bust business on the individual book level but a fairly\nsteady one on the macro level. Part of what\u2019s weird about Griffin\u2019s piece is\nthat it represents some realities that will be unfortunate for individual\nauthors, then uses them to suggest that they show that the industry is in\ntrouble; she in fact predicts the imminent death of the big houses. But\nliterally none of the specific observations that she makes suggest that the\npublishing houses have a broken model. She fixates on the inequality in\npublishing, the small number of authors whose books earn out, but doesn\u2019t at\nall engage with the fact that this reality works for the industry if not the\nindividual author. And in a piece that\u2019s titled \u201cNo One Buys Books,\u201d she\nleaves out any mention at all of book sales trends! Bonkers.\n\nIf you asked the publishing industry if they\u2019d take the past five years of\nsales, with no context, they\u2019d say absolutely. The pandemic years of 2020 and\n2021 were great, 2022 was eh, 2023 was worse, who knows about 2024. This is\nall to say that there have been cyclical fluctuations common to any industry\nand no sign of the structural collapse that Griffin so clearly wants to find.\n\nSo as not to bury my headline here, it is certainly true that business as\nusual for the publishing houses leaves a majority of writers feeling life\nfailures. That\u2019s unfortunate, and even worse, I don\u2019t think many literary\nagents prepare their clients for the reality that most books don\u2019t sell. You\nsell a book and feel great, you go through the process because you\u2019re\ninspired, you labor over the text, the money isn\u2019t great when you do the math,\nand then it comes out, and there\u2019s no big event; it just appears on bookstore\nshelves. \u201cPub day\u201d is structurally anticlimactic unless you\u2019re JK Rowling. If\nyou\u2019re lucky, there will be a round of reviews, and you\u2019re left wondering what\nhappened when your agent euphemistically tells you that the thing ain\u2019t\nselling. And, again, structurally, by design!, there will always be more\ndisappointed writers than happy writers.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t this all an endorsement of Griffin\u2019s point? Why isn\u2019t it clear\nthat self-publishing is the way to go? Because there\u2019s no denominator in\nGriffin\u2019s essay, none. That is to say, she is suggesting a comparison\n(traditional publishing houses vs self-publishing) when she has no numbers\nwith which to make the comparison. There\u2019s no big self-publishing merger that\nproduced lots of public data to crunch. Against the hard numbers that make\npublishing look bad, she can only pitch broad waves to conditions in self-\npublishing. That\u2019s because we simply don\u2019t have the necessary information. But\nit is a certainty that self-publishing follows a Pareto distribution as well.\nThere is no doubt that the vast majority of people trying to make it in self-\npublishing are failing. There is no doubt that the vast majority working on\nnewsletters will not have the success Griffin has had. Success in creative\nfields is hard to come by no matter what the model. That\u2019s always been true of\nthe arts! There\u2019s no halcyon days when most artists made a living, and every\nreason to believe that creators of all types face markets defined by immense\ninequality. This Pareto distribution seen in Patreon patrons, put together by\nStephen Follows, is a stark statement, especially given that the Pareto effect\nis fractal:\n\nAlmost no one who tries to make it in the crowdfunded economy succeeds,\nwhatever the medium or genre they work in. Just like most published books\nfail. Griffin and others who inveigh against the gatekeepers, for all of their\ngood points, consistently mistake the gatekeepers as the source of all that\nfailure. But the source of that failure is that the public has a finite\nappetite for media, tends to mostly like the same things, and has limited time\nto discover new artists. With self-publishing, we can indulge in survivorship\nbias by looking at various flourishing independent writers and saying \u201caha!,\u201d\nbut that\u2019s not sensible. Meanwhile, the publishing houses are a convenient\nreceptacle for anger, whereas even if writers are inclined to be angry about\ntheir lack of success in self-publishing, since there\u2019s no central self-\npublishing entity, there\u2019s no one to get mad at. None of that helps us with\nthe only question that really matters here: for any individual writer, is\nself-publishing better than going with a traditional publishing house? For me,\nit\u2019s a certainty that the answer would have been no. As I said, I did self-\npublish that first novel, serially, and even paid an illustrator who came up\nwith gorgeous artwork for. The novel was attached to my main newsletter, which\nhad a mailing list of 50,000. Even with that marketing advantage, the average\nview count for each of its fifteen chapters was about 2,000. I understand that\nthe novel could just suck, but the point remains that self-publishing is no\nguarantee of anything even with a large built-in audience. Meanwhile,\npublishing house money has made a huge difference in my life.\n\nThis entire conversation is, of course, colored by various forms of status\nanxiety. Self publishing involves the usual complications of artforms\npracticed outside of traditional types of gatekeeping. Though I am a\nlongstanding skeptic of liberatory narratives regarding the technology-\nassisted demise of gatekeepers - some gates are meant to be kept - I will say\nupfront that there are definitely major advantages to undermining the old\nsystem. Traditional systems through which people have advanced in artistic\nfields have failed to provide talent with opportunity, time and again. Surely\nthere are all manner of painters and writers etc. over the course of history\nwho had all the talent necessary to succeed but never got a chance because\nwhoever the relevant gatekeepers were at the time didn\u2019t recognize their\npotential. (We don\u2019t know who because they never got the chance!) The\ntraditional Hollywood system seems absolutely intent on demonstrating the\nworst elements of gatekeeping in the creative arts, falling deeper and deeper\ninto shameless nepotism. It is indeed true that traditional publishing, like\nthe music business and Hollywood and journalism, has done a lot over the\ndecades to deepen historical inequalities of sex and race and class.\n\nAnd they just get it wrong, all the time, even when doing their best. My\ngodfather is one of the smartest guys (and best novelists) I know, but when he\nworked at the bottom level at G.P. Putnam he was the one who pulled Watership\nDown off of the slush pile and rejected it, sure that his bosses would get\nangry if he passed along a book about rabbits. It has gone on to sell more\nthan 50 million copies. That sort of thing is inevitable. (Sorry Flip!)\n\nWriting is also an intensely personal endeavor, and so rejection by the\nvarious apparatchiks who decide who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out can feel especially\ncruel. Of course, rejection by the audience is cruel whether you publish with\na house or self-publish; there is, however, the fact that when you do it the\ntraditional way, you\u2019re disappointing more people than just yourself. (I\nreally encourage book writers to absorb what a large percentage of books don\u2019t\nsell, and similarly encourage agents to make that clear too.) As in any\ncreative field, the monetization of writing is always far easier if you write\nparticular kinds of things in particular kinds of ways for particular kinds of\naudiences and in particular genres. The new frightens those who make those\ndecisions because the new does not have a track record. And there are all\nsorts of exploitative and unfortunate dynamics in publishing specifically and\ncreative industry gatekeepers generally.\n\nBut... none of that proves what Griffin is trying to prove. She\u2019s championing\na different model but presents no data that suggests that writers are more\nlikely to succeed according to that model. If you think that it\u2019s lonely and\nsad to put out a book that nobody buys, I invite you to search around for the\nthousands of blogs and newsletters and self-published novels out there, some\nof them written by very talented people, that have gone nowhere either. I\nactually think it can be crueler when you\u2019re doing it on your own, as many\npeople have found themselves in a place where their writing is not remotely\nable to pay their bills but still commands more and more of their attention,\nand they\u2019re stuck in a perpetual state of not knowing if they\u2019re a happy\namateur or a disgruntled professional, if they should give up or keep going.\nSubstack has championed writing and writers, for which I\u2019m very grateful, but\nof course it\u2019s a financial necessity for them to oversell the amount of\nopportunity out there on their platform. Here\u2019s the reality: there\u2019s always\nbeen far more entrants into creative fields than those industries can bear in\nterms of providing people with a living, and the digital tools that have torn\ndown barriers to entry have simply increased the competition and made the\noverall Pareto distribution even more brutal. That\u2019s not gonna change, no\nmatter how many of the gatekeeping industries go down. You can\u2019t have a\nsociety where no one feels fulfilled unless they\u2019re an actor or a musician or\na novelist, but that appears to be the exact culture we\u2019re building, and it\u2019s\ntough.\n\nI am, however, very happy to live in a society in which self-publishing is\npossible, and I am myself obviously a product of the independent publishing\ntools the internet has afforded. Nobody was ever going to give me a staff job.\n\nGriffin\u2019s post is not without merit, and obviously it\u2019s been compelling for\nmany people. The problem is that it\u2019s an argument about values masquerading as\nan argument about facts. Like absolutely everything else in 2024, it\u2019s a\nlittle slice of culture war. Seeing yourself in terms of a binary divide can\nhelp with the loneliness and aimlessness of a lonely and aimless industry. I\u2019m\ncertain that many of the people who have made the piece go viral have never\ngotten a fair chance in publishing a book the traditional way, and also that\nsome are those who have published books, seen them fail, and nurtured the\nwound. (Many of those people are in media, which helps explain the visibility\nof this animosity.) I have sympathy for them all. It\u2019s a brutal business,\nselling words. But people still buy books. People still read them. People will\ngo on writing and buying and reading books. Though the Big Five might collapse\nand the terms of the game might change, there will still be big corporations\npicking winners, putting together books, and acting as gatekeepers.\n\nMy own books haven\u2019t really sold, and with a couple coming out in the next two\nyears, I could find myself unable to sell one in the near future. But I will\nwrite them while I can, if only because of the odd chance that someone might\ndiscover a book I wrote years after it came and went, and in that way connect\nwith me, another version of me. As a young reader I was always delighted to\nfind a book in the library that had not been checked out in 10 or 15 or 20\nyears, which was an affordance of the paper era of library recordkeeping. I\nwould then dive into it and disappear into the ideas and arguments of someone\nwho never could have counted on me as a reader when they set out to write it.\nThis blog will be deleted when I\u2019m through with it, and I will click the\nbutton lustily when I do. A physical book of mine might by some crooked\naccident find its way into the hands of a reader in 2124, and even if it\u2019s\njust one person, that one time, that\u2019s more than I could have once hoped for.\nIt\u2019s not much, but there are few things for human beings to hang a life on,\nwhen you think about it.\n\nAnd if you write and struggle, I have great sympathy. The path of success is\nfickle and strewn with random chance. The cream doesn\u2019t always rise. There is\nalways a chance you\u2019ve been denied success because of unfair bullshit. You do,\nhowever, have to consider the possibility that the problem is you.\n\n### Subscribe to Freddie deBoer\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\ncool but rude\n\n250 Likes\n\n250\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Publishing is Designed to Make Most Authors Feel Like Losers Even While\nthe Industry Makes Money\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n57\n\nShare\n\n57 Comments\n\nAndy in TXApr 26this was great!
