This drives global temperature increase, and if we don't do\nanything, it could cause irreversible ecosystem changes that will impact not\nonly biodiversity, but also human wellbeing and the economy.\n\nMany governments and businesses pledge that they will decrease their\nemissions, but it may not be enough, as we also have to recapture CO2 already\nemitted.\n\nCurrently, the global average share of greenhouse gas emissions exceeds 4,5\ntons per capita, with over 10 tons in some countries. This seems a lot, but\nthese quantities may be offset by each of us through systematic action, and a\ncritical mass of individual action could lead to global change! It won't be\ninstant, but nevertheless it is an investment in our future.\n\n## Emissions per capita as an estimation for personal carbon footprint\n\nA carbon footprint is the amount of CO2 emitted by the all activities\nundertaken by an individual or a company. Although in the case of businesses\nthere is a reliable methodology for calculating emissions, there is no\nstandardized approach for calculating individual footprints. There are many\nonline tools which could help assess this, but in our opinion a pretty good\napproximation comes from nationwide emissions per capita, which averages all\neconomic activity (including, energy, transport, goods, services and\ninfrastructure) that constitutes our lifestyle, opportunities and overall\nprosperity. This is why we also encourage taking not only individual, but also\norganized action, and pressing climate issues on decisionmakers and\nlegislature. In the meantime, each of us could make a tangible impact on\nbalancing our share of emissionsby restoring ecosystems to scale.\n\n### Emission estimator\n\nEven if you cancel your subscription after a while, we will still track the\nimpact of already planted trees! As for now, we plan to track it for 20 years,\nbut working to extend it significantly.\n\n## How much CO2 could a tree recapture?\n\nThe answer varies depending on the tree species and if they are solitaire or\nin a forest.\n\nAlthough an adult tree could even recapture over 20 kg of CO2 per year, using\nthis figure to assess the climatic impact of tree planting is misleading, as\nnot every tree will reach such an age, due to natural disasters, diseases,\nadverse conditions or competition from other trees.\n\nThis is why we have opted for a top-down approach, starting with the standard\ncarbon recapture value per hectare of forest, as assessed by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and dividing it by initial planting\ndensity. This gives an approximate long-term average amount per planted tree,\ntaking into account their survival rate, which in case of our broadleaf\ntemperate forests is approximately 3 kg of CO2 per year from seedling until\nreaching carbon balance of the forest.\n\nCarbon recapture figures could be further verified by conducting field\nresearch in planted forests.\n\n## Why plant trees?\n\nRestoring ecosystems, especially forests is deemed to be the most effective\nway to remove atmospheric carbon, which could allow us to mitigate the effects\nof climate change. There is also enough suitable land worldwide to do so on\nthe required scale. Beside direct carbon recapture there are a lot additional\nbenefits to ecosystem restoration such as regenerating soil, improving water\nretention and filtration, increasing biodiversity, creating habitats and\nmigratory routes for plants and animals, regulating microclimates, or offering\nsocio-cultural benefits such as recreation and improving public health and\nwellbeing.\n\n## How could greenwashing impact climate action?\n\nGreenwashing is an intended, or sometimes unintended, action that aims to\nportray a product or service as more environmental friendly than it actually\nis.\n\nUnfortunately, even though acting in good faith, the effectiveness of many\nclimate endeavours tends to be significantly overestimated, which means that\nany action taken could well prove insufficient. Carbon credits also spark some\ncontroversies, as they are often based not on carbon recapture, but on\nemission avoidance associated with some new projects such as renewable energy\nproduction, which some interpret as simply buying peace of mind, as it doesn't\neven reduce the amount of CO2 currently emitted.\n\nThat's why we base our project solely on direct carbon removal and we strive\nnot to overestimate its effectiveness.\n\n## What Green Wedge means\n\nGreen Wedge is a concept from urban and regional planning, meaning the\nprotection of existing natural or semi-natural environments or their\nintroduction in developed areas, to improve air quality, access to recreation,\nbiodiversity and microclimate moderation.\n\nOur initiative is similarly aimed at reclaiming overexploited lands for\nnature, which will offer multiple benefits, both for restored ecosystems and\ntheir surroundings.\n\nJoin our afforestation projects\n\n## Project supported by\n\nResources\n\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nContact\n\nGreen Wedge P.S.A.\n\nKijowska 44\n\n85-703 Bydgoszcz, Poland\n\ninfo@greenwedge.eco\n\nPayments\n\nGreen Wedge use only required cookies to perform essential website functions\nand to provide the services.\n\nTo learn more, check our Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
