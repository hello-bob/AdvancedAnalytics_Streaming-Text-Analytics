In Ireland and across\nearly modern Europe, beer was integral to social life and a vital source of\nnutrition. But up to now we have had little sense of what that beer was like,\nhow strong it really was, and how much energy it provided. By reconstructing\nthe recipes, equipment, and techniques used at Dublin Castle four hundred\nyears ago, FoodCult set out to answer these important questions.\n\nThis virtual exhibition will lead you through the project, from the rationale\nto the reconstruction to the results. It is organized in five chapters, which\nyou can follow sequentially or by clicking on the individual links below.\n\nFoodCult is grateful to all our research partners and our hosts for the\nproject, the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex, UK. For\nphotography, thank you to Robert Hoare, Ugne Jurgaityte, Marc Meltonville,\nJanet Montgomery, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, Shreepali\nPatel, the University of Nottingham, and Warminster Maltings.\n\nEnter the exhibition\n\n### Chapters\n\n#### Why we brewed\n\n#### Sourcing ingredients\n\n#### Building the brewhouse\n\n#### The brewing process\n\n#### Studying the results\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 Trinity College Dublin | Privacy policy\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\nGo to Top\n\n", "frontpage": false}
