You\u2019ll learn how these techniques power modern security, and how\nto apply them to your own projects. Alongside modern methods, the book also\nanticipates the future of cryptography, diving into emerging and cutting-edge\nadvances such as cryptocurrencies, and post-quantum cryptography. All\ntechniques are fully illustrated with diagrams and examples so you can easily\nsee how to put them into practice.\n\n## about the technology\n\nCryptography is the essential foundation of IT security. To stay ahead of the\nbad actors attacking your systems, you need to understand the tools,\nframeworks, and protocols that protect your networks and applications. This\nbook introduces authentication, encryption, signatures, secret-keeping, and\nother cryptography concepts in plain language and beautiful illustrations.\n\n## about the book\n\nReal-World Cryptography teaches practical techniques for day-to-day work as a\ndeveloper, sysadmin, or security practitioner. There\u2019s no complex math or\njargon: Modern cryptography methods are explored through clever graphics and\nreal-world use cases. You\u2019ll learn building blocks like hash functions and\nsignatures; cryptographic protocols like HTTPS and secure messaging; and\ncutting-edge advances like post-quantum cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\nThis book is a joy to read\u2014and it might just save your bacon the next time\nyou\u2019re targeted by an adversary after your data.\n\n## what's inside\n\n  * Implementing digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs\n  * Specialized hardware for attacks and highly adversarial environments\n  * Identifying and fixing bad practices\n  * Choosing the right cryptographic tool for any problem\n\n## about the reader\n\nFor cryptography beginners with no previous experience in the field.\n\n## about the author\n\nDavid Wong is a cryptography engineer.
