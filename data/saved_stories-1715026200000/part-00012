Macworld, October 1986\n\nWe often remember March 1987 as the start of the era of external displays on\nthe Macintosh. With the enormous size of the Mac II came expandability of six\nNuBus slots, as well as the software flexibility of System Software 2.0\n(System 3.3/Finder 5.4) with the Monitors control panel.But large additional\nmonitors actually predated the \u201copen Mac\u201d by a good half-year.\n\nIn October 1986, Macworld magazine heralded \u201cThe Two-Headed Macintosh\u201d in a\nstory that highlighted Apple veterans Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfield\u2019s\ncontributions to this new combination of hardware and software. (Farber, 1986,\n67) The magazine was excited about two features: the near-match to the\ninternal screen\u2019s 72dpi, and the possibility of using both the new and the old\nscreen simultaneously. Both the article itself and the caption to the\naccompanying press photograph (reproduced above) highlighted the ability to\nmove windows freely between the two screens in a new kind of virtual two-\ndimensional space. All the standard software niceties that would become\nhallmarks of Radius\u2019 premium experience make their debut here \u2014 detachable,\n\u201ctear-off\u201d menus that could be repositioned anywhere on the screen; a larger\nfont size for those menus; a screen dimmer, and control over the size of the\ncursor to reduce the possibility of losing the mouse in such a large field of\nvision.\n\nEnabling all this took a new Motorola 68000 processor \u2014 perhaps running at a\nhigher clock frequency? \u2014 that completely replaced the Mac\u2019s original CPU. A\nrequirement of \u201cthe new Macintosh ROM\u201d meant that this product was restricted\nto Mac Plus and 512kE models, which would have been clear to any Mac Pro in\n1986. And the price? A mere $2,000 \u2014 two thirds as much as any Mac in which it\ncould be installed. The November issue of MacUser gave the entire cover over\nto the new display, proclaiming \u201cBigger is Better!\u201d (Bobker, 1986) Wikipedia\ngoes so far as to call the Full Page Display the \u201cfirst large screen available\nfor any personal computer.\u201d\n\nRadius Full Page Display on a Mac Plus (InfoWorld)\n\nLooking at this picture you probably have two questions: How could this\npossibly have made sense financially? How could this possibly have worked\ntechnically?\n\n#### Hardware\n\nThe second question is easy enough to answer. Radius was made up of ex-Apple\nhardware engineers, and they pulled quite a few rabbits out of their\ncollective hat. The FPD used the security slot, of all possible things, to\nroute the cable for external video out of the case. Notice the small video\nconnector in the photo to the right:\n\nThis was was routed through the small security slot on the back of the classic\nMac case. The Full Page Display interface sat right on top of the 68000\ncentral processor, with additional connections to the FB1 and C35 resistors.\nOriginally this internal card originally had to be installed in the Sunnyvale\nfactory, and the process took a week to complete. An easier clip-on\ninstallation method was released in Q2 1987.\n\nPermanent changes to the motherboard were also made. These presumably included\nthe Radius ROM, which obviated the need for a special boot-up disk \u2013 a\nrequirement of other vendors\u2019 solutions. The integration between the Radius\nROM and the Apple motherboard was evidently pretty deep: as an example, the\nlarger PRAM in a Mac Plus allowed the precise vertical alignment between the\ntops of the internal and external screens to be memorized, but the 512KE had\nto be set manually at every boot time.\n\n#### The Economics of Desktop Publishing\n\nThe financial question is more interesting. Who was spending $2,000 to add an\nexternal monitor onto a Mac Plus \u2014 let alone a 512KE?\n\nThe portrait display as a form factor, though gone from the market today,\nactually was quite popular in the late 80s and early 90s. The reason was\nsimple: as the name implied, it could display a full 8.5\u00d711 page on the screen\nat one time with its 640\u00d7864 pixels. This was in an era of Aldus PageMaker:\nDesktop Publishing was saving the entire Mac ecosystem (and arguably Apple)\nfrom being a footnote in computing history.\n\nThere are two interesting things about this FPD ad from 1988:\n\nRadius Full Page Display Flanked by a Mac and LaserWriter (InfoWorld)\n\nThe first is that the LaserWriter Plus flanks the monitor to the left: Radius\nenvisioned the FPD as an essential part of a complete DTP setup. The second is\nthat there\u2019s a humble classic Mac to the right. Even in 1988, when the Mac II\nhad been shipping for a while (notice the picture of that expandable machine\nlower in the ad copy), Radius still saw a market in upgrading Classic Macs\nwith external displays for the Desktop Publishing market.\n\n#### The Shock of Multiple Screens\n\nAt 15\u2032\u2032 diagonally, the FPD had nearly the same 72 dpi pixel density as the\nMac CRT, a big selling point. In fact, Radius was the only player in this\nnascent market who could actually both screens at the same time. Other\nvendors, including E-Machines and Micrographic Images, shut down the internal\nscreen completely. This simultaneous use of both workspaces, which we all take\nfor granted today, was as revolutionary as capacitive touch was in 2007. \u201cAs\nthe mouse reaches the right- hand edge of the Radius, the image suddenly\nappears on the Mac\u2019s screen, jumping right across the gulf between the two\nmachines,\u201d gushed InfoWorld. \u201cThis behavior invariably startles people the\nfirst time they see it.\u201d Here\u2019s Stewart Cheifet being startled this feature\nduring a demo by Radius co-founder Mike Boich on Computer Chronicles:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty impressive!\u201d\n\nOf course, application compatibility was hit-and-miss. Even an app as\ncanonical and central to the Macintosh as MacPaint wasn\u2019t written to take\nadvantage of the greater screen space. Excel would crash if you made the\nwindow too large, and MacWrite wouldn\u2019t properly redraw the screen after\nformatting changes which extended off the original 512\u00d7342 pixels. Updates\nfixed some of these problems, but there was a reason that Radius demo\u2019d the\nscreen with T/Maker\u2019s WriteNow: it was written according to the guidelines in\nInside Macintosh and worked well. Raines Cohen, co-founder of the Berkeley\nMacintosh Users Group, saw the display at MacWorld Boston 1986 and noted \u201cThe\nFinder doesn\u2019t know about the Macscreen, but can use the entire Radius.\nMacPaint doesn\u2019t know about it, of course; FullPaint does, sort of, I think...\nSuperPaint will let you put your pallette at top of the screen to take\nadvantage of MOST of the screen. ComicWorks is the best; it lets you put your\ntools onthe Mac screen & dedicate the whole page to graphics.\u201d\n\n#### Blazing a Trail with Software\n\nThe reason for all these problems was simple: the FPD shipped well before\nofficial support for multiple displays and the accompanying Monitors control\npanel (which wouldn\u2019t have appeared on the Plus and previous models anyway).\nThus Radius had to write their own software to manage this radical peripheral.\nLarger cursors, a screensaver, double-height menu bars, and other\nmagnification features debuted here, to be further developed as Radius shipped\ncountless color cards for NuBus in the years ahead. Radius even programmed an\nextension to add Zoom button to the top-right corner of Mac windows which\nlacked them. Cohen: \u201cAndy\u2019s software teaches most applications to have a \u2018zoom\nbox\u2019 (like MacDraw), and cmd-zoom will zoom a window to the full Mac main\nscreen.\u201d The Mac\u2019s screen capture feature also had to be re-written, and even\nRadius\u2019 own feature only grabbed 90% of the large screen. This software\nconsistently earned rave reviews, and probably explains the leadership\nposition which the company had in the external display market into the 1990s.\n\nThe FPD cost $1,995 retail. And for all that money, you only got a 3-month\nlimited warranty!\n\nReferences:\n\n{555715:IQKWAQWU};{555715:QCKZIMM9} chicago-fullnote-bibliography author asc\nno 1 title 4\n\n%7B%22status%22%3A%22success%22%2C%22updateneeded%22%3Afalse%2C%22instance%22%3A%22zotpress-c244a3aa7eb0660513ed9493a1072320%22%2C%22meta%22%3A%7B%22request_last%22%3A0%2C%22request_next%22%3A0%2C%22used_cache%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22data%22%3A%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22QCKZIMM9%22%2C%22library%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A555715%7D%2C%22meta%22%3A%7B%22creatorSummary%22%3A%22Bobker%22%2C%22parsedDate%22%3A%221986-11%22%2C%22numChildren%22%3A0%7D%2C%22bib%22%3A%22%3Cdiv%20class%3D%5C%22csl-\nbib-body%5C%22%20style%3D%5C%22line-height%3A%201.35%3B%20padding-\nleft%3A%201em%3B%20text-\nindent%3A-1em%3B%5C%22%3E%5Cn%20%20%3Cdiv%20class%3D%5C%22csl-\nentry%5C%22%3EBobker%2C%20Steven.%20%26%23x201C%3BThe%20Big%20Picture.%26%23x201D%3B%20%3Ci%3EMacUser%3C%5C%2Fi%3E%2C%20November%201986.%3C%5C%2Fdiv%3E%5Cn%3C%5C%2Fdiv%3E%22%2C%22data%22%3A%7B%22itemType%22%3A%22magazineArticle%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22The%20Big%20Picture%22%2C%22creators%22%3A%5B%7B%22creatorType%22%3A%22author%22%2C%22firstName%22%3A%22Steven%22%2C%22lastName%22%3A%22Bobker%22%7D%5D%2C%22abstractNote%22%3A%22%22%2C%22date%22%3A%221986-11%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%22%2C%22collections%22%3A%5B%22TRRB4DF5%22%5D%2C%22dateModified%22%3A%222021-05-24T18%3A45%3A42Z%22%7D%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22IQKWAQWU%22%2C%22library%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A555715%7D%2C%22meta%22%3A%7B%22creatorSummary%22%3A%22Farber%22%2C%22parsedDate%22%3A%221986-10%22%2C%22numChildren%22%3A0%7D%2C%22bib%22%3A%22%3Cdiv%20class%3D%5C%22csl-\nbib-body%5C%22%20style%3D%5C%22line-height%3A%201.35%3B%20padding-\nleft%3A%201em%3B%20text-\nindent%3A-1em%3B%5C%22%3E%5Cn%20%20%3Cdiv%20class%3D%5C%22csl-\nentry%5C%22%3EFarber%2C%20Daniel.%20%26%23x201C%3BMacworld%20View.%26%23x201D%3B%20%3Ci%3EMacworld%3C%5C%2Fi%3E%2C%20October%201986.%3C%5C%2Fdiv%3E%5Cn%3C%5C%2Fdiv%3E%22%2C%22data%22%3A%7B%22itemType%22%3A%22magazineArticle%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Macworld%20View%22%2C%22creators%22%3A%5B%7B%22creatorType%22%3A%22author%22%2C%22firstName%22%3A%22Daniel%22%2C%22lastName%22%3A%22Farber%22%7D%5D%2C%22abstractNote%22%3A%22%22%2C%22date%22%3A%221986-10%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%22%2C%22collections%22%3A%5B%22TRRB4DF5%22%5D%2C%22dateModified%22%3A%222021-05-24T18%3A27%3A56Z%22%7D%7D%5D%7D\n\nBobker, Steven. \u201cThe Big Picture.\u201d MacUser, November 1986.\n\nFarber, Daniel. \u201cMacworld View.\u201d Macworld, October 1986.\n\n## Information about Radius Full Page Display\n\nRadius Full Page Display  \n---  \nKind:| Two screens are better than one  \nSize:| 12930 bytes, accounts for 13K on disk  \nWhere:| Hardware, internal drive  \nCreated:| Tuesday, September 16, 1986 at 9:07 PM  \nModified:| Wednesday, November 8, 2023 at 12:48 AM  \nLocked  \n  \nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nEdi| Hello,I have this card but neither cable nor monitor.Maybe someone can\nhelp me with Pinout https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/54301-mac-plus-\nwith-radius-fpd-cpu-card-pinout-ask/  \n---|---  \nUbi| Me too, i have this Radius FPD 64khz in my SE, but i haven\u00e2\u20acTMt cable and\nmonitors for test it.  \nPete| the Killee clip which made all these Mac and SE Add ons possible appears\nmissing from all these histories.
