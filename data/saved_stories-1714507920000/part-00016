We show that by training a generative model\n> on long temporal contexts it is possible to produce long-form music of up to\n> 4m45s. Our model consists of a diffusion-transformer operating on a highly\n> downsampled continuous latent representation (latent rate of 21.5Hz). It\n> obtains state-of-the-art generations according to metrics on audio quality\n> and prompt alignment, and subjective tests reveal that it produces full-\n> length music with coherent structure.\n\nSubjects:| Sound (cs.SD); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech\nProcessing (eess.AS)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10301 [cs.SD]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10301v1 [cs.SD] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.10301arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Julian Parker [view email] [v1] Tue, 16 Apr 2024 06:09:33 UTC (306 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Long-form music generation with latent\ndiffusion, by Zach Evans and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SD\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG eess eess.AS\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
