A new regional refugee response\nplan for Sudan and the Emergency Response Plan for Lebanon also account for\nhigher requirements. Increased humanitarian needs were reflected in several\nother country plans, notably Chad, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Myanmar, Niger,\nSomalia, Syria and Sudan.\n\n##\n\nAppeal funding gap 2012 - 2023 (as of 4 December 2023)\n\nRecord amounts of additional funding were mobilized in 2022, primarily due to\nextraordinary efforts to fund the humanitarian response in Ukraine and\nmitigate the global economic and food security impacts of that crisis.\n\nThe first two quarters of 2023 saw higher absolute funding recorded, compared\nto the same time in 2022. However, this positive trend did not continue as the\nyear progressed, leading to rising concerns relating to covering even the most\nurgent and prioritised needs in crises around the globe.\n\nFunding received, as of 24 November 2023, against the GHO requirements amounts\nto $19.9 billion. This is 35 per cent, leaving a gap of almost $36.8 billion.\nTotal humanitarian funding, including for the GHO, has reached only $27\nbillion, significantly less than the $41 billion recorded last year.\n\nDespite efforts to diversify and expand the sources of humanitarian funding,\nthe outlook for 2024 is of serious concern, especially in light of growing\nneeds.\n\n##\n\nAppeal funding vs requirements (as of 4 December 2023)\n\n##\n\nAppeal funding coverage 2012 - 2023 (as of 4 December 2023)\n\nFacts and figures\n\n## High-level resource mobilization events coordinated by OCHA: High-level\nevents were held in 2023 to raise awareness of and mobilize financial\nresources for major crises\n\nThe Lake Chad Basin High-Level Conference was held on 23-24 January.

The team brought life-detecting\ntechnology to facilitate their search-and-rescue work in the aftermath of the\nT\u00fcrkiye-Syria earthquake, collaborating with local groups such as CINER, a\nTurkish conglomerate working in energy and mining.\n\nCENACED\n\nIn September 2023, a United Nations Security Council debate underscored the\nincreasing importance of public-private partnerships and the critical role\nplayed by businesses in supporting humanitarian response. Member networks from\nthe OCHA/UNDP Connecting Business initiative (CBi) responded to 15 crises in\n2023, mobilizing over $14 million and reaching more than 7.8 million people.\n\nIn Peru, Hombro a Hombro supported the Government in managing historical\ndengue fever cases, following floods, by providing logistical support and\ntraining on resource management and reporting. After Hurricane Otis in Mexico,\nCENACED worked with the Government and other allies to restore access to\naffected areas and provide humanitarian relief.\n\nAfter the T\u00fcrkiye-Syria earthquakes in February 2023, CBi coordinated in-kind\nsupport from business networks such as the Turkish Enterprise and Business\nConfederation (T\u00dcRKONFED), mobilizing over $11 million. CBi worked with\nT\u00dcRKONFED, Business 4 Goals (B4G) and other business associations to\nfacilitate engagement between business and the UN and leverage resources and\nexpertise for the most effective and efficient response possible. A workshop,\nheld in September 2023, provided an opportunity to reflect on what went well\nand areas for improvement in terms of business engagement in emergency\nresponse, emphasizing the importance of data collection and sharing and\nfostering trust between partners.\n\nOther entities such as Miyamoto International, DHL Group, and AirLink\ncontributed skills and resources to the humanitarian response. Miyamoto\nInternational dispatched earthquake and humanitarian experts and collaborated\nwith Habitat for Humanity to provide shelter support.\n\nKey successes in private sector engagement included:\n\n  * Donations totalling $11 million in the form of 243 trucks with food and non-food items; over 21,000 blankets; 395 shelter containers; more than 1,000 tents and 15,000 beds; four soup kitchens; three mobile kitchens; 100 portable toilets and bathrooms; 53 generators and 1,000 heaters.\n  * Support to humanitarian partners through the provision of transportation and accommodation during the initial response week.\n  * Search and rescue support provided by CBi Member Networks in Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka alongside donations and medical supplies.\n\nThese actions not only strengthen engagement with business but also enhance\nrecognition of the private sector as part of the solution to deliver better\nhumanitarian response.\n\n## OCHA Services\n\nRelated Platforms\n\n  * Financial Tracking Service\n  * Humanitarian Data Exchange\n  * ReliefWeb\n  * OCHA website\n\nOther OCHA Services\n\n  * Humanitarian ID\n  * ReliefWeb Response\n\n  * Inter-Agency Standing Committee\n  * Virtual OSOCC\n\n  * More OCHA Services Opens in a new window\n\nService provided by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and\nprotect people in humanitarian crises.
