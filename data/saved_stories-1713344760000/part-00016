[+] Brooklyn. (Photo by Keith Torrie/NY Daily News\nArchive via Getty Images)\n\nNY Daily News via Getty Images\n\nAdmittedly, as a BIPOC female founder who didn\u2019t previously work at tech\ncompanies such as Google or PayPal, I\u2019m not the most networked in venture\ncapital circles. After trying the warm intro process, which is entrenched in\nthe established network of VCs and founders and exclusionary as Del Johnson\npointed out in his seminal article Ban Warm Introductions!, I\u2019ve found a\nfaster, better method for getting VC meetings. As a bonus, it also works for\ngetting organic press and customer connections.\n\nThe Inbound Lead Generation Process For Fundraising\n\nInbound lead generation focuses on attracting potential customers through the\ncreation of valuable content. As a marketer and writer, I embraced this\nstrategy and applied it to fundraising. My process has 4 steps:\n\n1) Build, Don\u2019t Wait for VC Funding,\n\n2) Make Them Read About You \u2013 Get Organic PR,\n\n3) Make Them Talk About You \u2013 Become a Thought Leader, and\n\n4) Build in Public.\n\nStep 1: Build, Don\u2019t Wait for VC Funding\n\nA prerequisite for inbound leads is building your product. You don\u2019t need\nvalidation or funding from VCs to build your product and launch. So, build,\ndon\u2019t wait. Having a product demonstrates that you are applying your skills\nand solving how to build initial proof points. Take a cue from bootstrapped\nstartups such as Shopify that found wild success by launching creatively.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Netflix s Best New Show Arrives With A Perfect 100 Critic Score\n\n### One Of The Best Spy Shows Ever Made Lands On Netflix Today For The Very\nFirst Time\n\n### Apple Watch Series 10 To Boast Welcome Upgrade Report Claims\n\nShopify: Leverage Content Marketing As A Customer Acquisition Vehicle\n\nCofounders Tobias L\u00fctke and Scott cleverly leveraged content marketing as a\nvehicle for Shopify\u2019s customer acquisition. The Shopify blog, which provided\nvaluable resources and advice for entrepreneurs looking to start their own\nonline stores, helped to build a loyal following. The founders doubled down on\ntheir content strategy by creating an extensive library of video tutorials,\nwebinars, and other resources to help their users succeed. This not only\nhelped them attract new customers, but it also helped them build a community\nof loyal users who were invested in their success.\n\nShopify thrived on its own earnings for one year before getting a small Seed\ninvestment of $250K in 2007 and then raising $7M in 2010, four years after\nlaunching. They focused on building a profitable market niche with organic\ngrowth. It raised a total of $122 million in private funding before going\npublic - NYS (SHOP). According to Pitchbook, it has a market cap of $98.13B\ntoday.\n\nThe lesson: Spend the bulk of your time building. Focus on your product.\nFigure out creative ways to launch, build brand awareness for your company,\nand scale your company while being bootstrapped. Keep your marketing spend as\nclose to zero as possible.\n\nStep 2: Make Them Hear About You \u2013 Organic PR\n\nIn the early stages of your company, you don\u2019t need to spend any money on a\nPR. Research your competitors, keep track of the publications that they are\ngetting featured in. Reach out to the writers and editors at those\npublications. Use Hunter.io to figure out their email addresses. Send hyper-\npersonalized cold emails explaining why you think they might be interested in\nyour company since they wrote about other companies in your vertical. You can\nalso try messaging the writers on LinkedIn and Twitter. Concisely pitch a\nstory idea. Use DocSend links to your website, a demo, and Press Kit. You can\ncreate your press kit yourself using this guide. If you have a differentiated\nproduct that has launched, publications will be interested.\n\nStep 3: Make them Talk About You: Become a Thought Leader\n\nThe way to become recognized as a thought leader on a topic is with 1)\ninsightful writing, and 2) speaking engagements. Write thought leadership\narticles and get them published in leading industry publications to reach\nright people and VCs in your industry. To reach VCs, submit OpEd articles to\nTechCrunch with this link. The key is to write thought leadership articles\nwith original insights and thoughtful analysis supported by research.\nContrarian articles are the best since they grab attention. The goal is to\ndemonstrate that you can analyze and can think smartly and differently. If you\nare a good marketer, use your copywriting and SEO skills to make your articles\ntrend on Google News, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn.\n\nGet speak engagements at leading conferences in your relevant verticals. If\nyou have developed an impressive personal brand and are considered a thought\nleader as a founder via your product, organic press your company has received,\nand your writing, you are likely to get contacted by conference organizers for\nkeynotes and to be on panels at conferences. If they don\u2019t reach out to you,\ncontact conference organizers. Introduce yourself and ask if you can be\ninvolved as a keynote speaker, panelist, or even as a moderator. At the very\nleast, you will be able to attend a conference for free and hopefully the\nconference will be good networking for your business development efforts as\nwell as a potentially good networking opportunity with press, VCs, and\nstrategics in the vertical.\n\nAs a result of my writing, I\u2019ve gotten more speaking engagements. And now I\u2019ve\nbeen getting inbounds from not just potential SaaS customers but also VCs.\n\nStep 4: Build in Public\n\nBuilding in public is the practice of sharing content about how you are\nbuilding your company\u2019s products or services with the goal of engaging with\nlike-minded people. It\u2019s content marketing and community building. By publicly\nsharing steps taken, progress made, and lessons learned along the way, you can\ngenerate buzz around your company and build engagement. Moreover, it\u2019s a\ntactic that can be used to attract investors.\n\nPublish a Manifesto, but Not as a Basic Launch Announcement\n\nWriting a company manifesto with your company\u2019s goals isn\u2019t a new concept.\nMany founders publish manifestos as launch announcements on their company\nwebsites, Medium, and/or LinkedIn about why they are starting a new company.\n\nI took a different approach with my company\u2019s manifesto and used it as part of\nmy process of building in public. I published an OpEd titled, Think Bigger\nThan Personalization \u2013 It\u2019s Time for Biohacking & Precision Skin Health in\nBeautyMatter, a leading global industry publication for the beauty, wellness,\nand health industries. Although I never mentioned my company\u2019s name in the\narticle, the article is my company Skin Dossier\u2019s manifesto and vision. I\nintroduced my contrarian view on the status quo of personalization and started\nusing the terms longevity and precision skin health long before global\nconglomerates such as L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder, or Shiseido. The article trended\non Google News\u2019 first page under the topics of \u2018personalization,\u2019 \u2018Precision\nSkin Health,\u2019 and \u2018longevity\u2019 for several weeks and trended on LinkedIn. When\nI shared a link to the OpEd in a LinkedIn post, I explicitly stated that the\nOpEd was my company\u2019s manifesto.\n\nIt was a calculated risk. While I shared the company vision with the world \u2013\nincluding competitors (some of which are very well-funded and one is a recent\npublic company) \u2013 the risk was minimized since we have already launched a\ndifferentiated product, have a solid team, and are continually making progress\nevery week. This was the final punch that helped me attract the most inbounds\nfrom VCs at top funds which also led to the fastest group partner meetings\nwith funds.\n\nShowcase Your Strengths and Create Your Own Strategy\n\nRemember, the closer a founder\u2019s existing connections are to a VC\u2019s network\nfor warm introductions, the less \u201cwork\u201d the founder has to do to secure an\nintroduction. For connected founders, there is literally no \u201cability\u201d to test.\nUnderdog founders, don\u2019t fret about warm intros.\n\nA true disruptor will figure out how to build and launch on their own terms\nand showcase their ability. The key is to personalize your launch and\nfundraising strategies to your strengths as a founder. My inbound lead\ngeneration strategy for launching my company and fundraising maps to some of\nmy strengths \u2013 strategy, marketing, innovations, and writing. Leverage your\nstrengths and get noticed as an innovative founder first, and you\u2019ll find\nyourself getting inbounded from press, investors, and customers alike.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nSindhya Valloppillil\n\nSindhya is the Founder & CEO of Skin Dossier, an AI-enabled Precision Skin\n\n...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
