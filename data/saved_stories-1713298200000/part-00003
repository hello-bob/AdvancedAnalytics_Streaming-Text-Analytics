You drop the tuppences onto an arm which\nslides backwards and forwards, the coin lands either on the arm, and gets\npushed off, or in front of the arm and gets pushed into the pile of coins. The\naim is to try and make the coins fall off the front edge, from where you can\ncollect them.| The frame is made from balsa wood, and the gear box is made\nfrom Knex. Very useful stuff Knex, it can do a lot more than be a kiddies toy.\nThe motor is geared down twice, giving it plenty of torque and not much speed.\nThe motion is then spread out between three arms which push the main arm\nbackwards and forwards like in the animated gif. In the photo, they are easily\nvisible as the big red cogs.  \n---  \n  \nHaving now made one of these machines, I can see how easy it is to tweak them\nto make it near impossible, or very easy to win. If the coin has enough space\nto fall flat, it will be pushed underneath the pile, which frequently pushes\ncoins off the edge. If the coin cannot lie flat, it will be pushed up on top\nor into the middle of the pile, doing very little at all. I have set my\nmachine in between, the coin can lie flat if timed correctly to be dropped\nonto the edge of the arm as it is coming towards you, when the arm moves back\nagain it will be pushed off onto the base ready to be pushed underneath the\npile. However if you just drop the coin in front of the arm it will almost\ncertainly be pushed into or on top of the pile.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
