Habib\n\nFeathers, such as those of the Lesser Flamingo shown here, are products of\nhundreds of millions of years of evolution.\n\nRobert Clark\n\nIn October 2022 a bird with the code name B6 set a new world record that few\npeople outside the field of ornithology noticed. Over the course of 11 days,\nB6, a young Bar-tailed Godwit, flew from its hatching ground in Alaska to its\nwintering ground in Tasmania, covering 8,425 miles without taking a single\nbreak. For comparison, there is only one commercial aircraft that can fly that\nfar nonstop, a Boeing 777 with a 213-foot wingspan and one of the most\npowerful jet engines in the world. During its journey, B6\u2014an animal that could\nperch comfortably on your shoulder\u2014did not land, did not eat, did not drink\nand did not stop flapping, sustaining an average ground speed of 30 miles per\nhour 24 hours a day as it winged its way to the other end of the world.\n\nMany factors contributed to this astonishing feat of athleticism\u2014muscle power,\na high metabolic rate and a physiological tolerance for elevated cortisol\nlevels, among other things. B6\u2019s odyssey is also a triumph of the remarkable\nmechanical properties of some of the most easily recognized yet enigmatic\nstructures in the biological world: feathers. Feathers kept B6 warm overnight\nwhile it flew above the Pacific Ocean. Feathers repelled rain along the way.\nFeathers formed the flight surfaces of the wings that kept B6 aloft and drove\nthe bird forward for nearly 250 hours without failing.\n\nOne might expect that, considering all the time humans have spent admiring,\nusing and studying feathers, we would know all their tricks by now. Yet\ninsights into these marvelous structures continue to emerge. Over the past\ndecade other researchers and I have been taking a fresh look at feathers.\nCollectively we have made surprising new discoveries about almost every aspect\nof their biology, from their evolutionary origins to their growth, development\nand aerodynamics.\n\nAmong the creatures we share the planet with today, only birds have feathers.\nIt makes sense, then, that for centuries scientists considered feathers a\nunique feature of birds. But starting in the 1990s, a series of bombshell\nfossil finds established that feathers were widespread among several lineages\nof the bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs known as theropods and that birds had\ninherited these structures from their theropod ancestors. The discovery of\nfeathered nonbird dinosaurs sent researchers scrambling to understand the\norigin and evolution of feathers, especially their role in the dawn of flight.\nWe now know many dinosaurs had feathers, and protofeathers probably go all the\nway back to the common ancestor of dinosaurs and their flying reptile cousins,\nthe pterosaurs. Bristles, fuzzy coverings, and other relatively simple\nfeatherlike structures probably decorated a wide array of dinosaurs\u2014many more\nthan we have been lucky enough to find preserved as fossils.\n\nBar-tailed Godwits undertake the longest nonstop migration of any land bird in\nthe world.\n\nrockptarmigan/Getty Images\n\nThe feathers on nonbird dinosaurs were not limited to bristles and fuzz,\nhowever. The flat, broad, flight-enabling feathers we see across most of the\nwings and much of the body surface of living birds are called pennaceous\nfeathers. (Fun fact: these are the feathers people used to make into quills\nfor writing, hence the word \u201cpen.\u201d) It turns out that these feathers, too,\nappeared before birds. In fact, there is an entire group of dinosaurs\ncomprising birds as well as species such as Velociraptor that takes its name\nfrom these very feathers: the pennaraptoran clade. Fossils of early\npennaraptorans show that they had feathery coverings that would have looked\nessentially modern at a quick glance.\n\nThe flight capacity of these early pennaraptorans has been hotly contested.\nSome species were clearly not fliers, given the small size of their \u201cwings\u201d\nrelative to their large bodies. For those animals, pennaceous feathers were\nprobably display pieces. But other pennaraptorans, such as the small, four-\nwinged, forest-dwelling Microraptor, are trickier to interpret. Many of the\narguments about whether this creature could fly have centered on something\ncalled vane asymmetry. The two flat \u201cblades\u201d of a feather on either side of\nthe main shaft are called vanes. In living birds that fly, the feathers that\narise from the hand, known as the primaries, have asymmetrical vanes: the\nleading vane is narrower than the trailing one. It stood to reason that vane\nasymmetry was important for flight. And because fossils of Microraptor and its\nkin show asymmetrical feathers, some researchers argued, these animals must\nhave been able to fly.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nRecent work by flight biomechanics experts, including me, has overturned this\nreceived wisdom about feather vane asymmetry. Our research shows that feather\nshape is largely optimized to allow the feather to twist and bend in\nsophisticated ways that greatly enhance flight performance. Merely being\nanatomically asymmetrical doesn\u2019t mean much. What matters is that the feather\nis aerodynamically asymmetrical, and for this to be the case, the vane\nasymmetry must be at least three to one\u2014that is, the trailing blade needs to\nbe three times wider than the leading one. Below this ratio, the feather\ntwists in a destabilizing rather than stabilizing way during flight.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nEarly pennaraptorans such as Microraptor didn\u2019t have aerodynamically\nasymmetrical feathers. But that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t fly. The tendency\nto twist (whether in a stabilizing or a destabilizing fashion) is only\nrelevant if the feathers are separated enough to do so. Keeping feathers in a\nwing tip tight and overlapping makes them stable, even if they\u2019re not\nasymmetrical. Asymmetry matters only if the flier spreads its primaries apart\nin flight like many modern raptors do\u2014a feature called slotting. So\nMicroraptor and its kin could probably use flapping flight, but their wing\nshape was necessarily different from that of today\u2019s forest-dwelling birds of\nprey. Specifically, Microraptor had relatively long, narrow wings with tight,\nunslotted wing tips\u2014anatomically distinct from the wings of Cooper\u2019s Hawks and\nother modern-day forest hawks but aerodynamically similar.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nAfter considering these findings on vane asymmetry, as well as new data on\nflight muscles in near-bird dinosaurs, a group of researchers (of which I was\nthe senior biophysicist) led by Michael Pittman of the Chinese University of\nHong Kong recently concluded that powered flight\u2014that is, flapping flight\nrather than gliding flight\u2014probably evolved multiple times in dinosaurs, with\njust one of those lineages surviving to the present in the form of birds. Yet\nonly in birds did flight feathers attain the degree of shape-shifting we see\ntoday. That ability of feathers to twist in just the right way is what enabled\nslotting, which makes the wing much more efficient at low flight speeds. In\nessence, a slotted wing behaves as if it is longer and narrower than it is\nanatomically. Slotting also makes the wing tip very resistant to stall,\nwhereby the airflow separates from the wing, causing a precipitous loss of the\nlift that keeps the bird in the air. It\u2019s a vital adaptation that underpins an\narray of aerial acrobatics.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Fiddler Crabs Unleash Special Vibrations to Attract Mates\u2014And Deter Foes\n\nKiley Price\n\n  * ### This Tiny Fish Makes an Ear-Blasting Screech for Love\n\nElizabeth Anne Brown\n\n  * ### Venomous Snakes Are Spreading because of Climate Change\n\nB\u00e1rbara Pinho\n\n  * ### 8 Ways to Protect Wildlife Near Your Home\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\nBirds typically need long, narrow wings to soar efficiently\u2014seabirds such as\nalbatrosses and petrels are perfect examples. The advent of wing-tip slots\nmade it possible to soar with broader wings, paving the way for evolution of a\ndiversity of broad-winged soarers, including vultures and hawks. The\naerodynamic advantages of slotting also permit the explosive flight\nperformance of sprinters such as grouses, which spend most of their time on\nthe ground but burst into flight for a short distance when startled. And wing-\ntip slots provide much greater maneuverability for a wide array of birds that\nlive in forests and other cluttered environments, from songbirds to toucans.\nIn fact, the maneuverability made possible by slotted wings might have helped\nbirds compete with pterosaurs and ultimately survive the end-Cretaceous\nextinction.\n\nThe pennaceous feathers we associate with flight aren\u2019t the only type of\nfeather birds possess. Feathers in different regions of the body vary in size,\nshape and function. You can think of feather form as a spectrum, with the\nlarge, relatively stiff flight feathers of the wing and tail at one end and\nthe short, fluffy down feathers that sit close to the body at the other. All\nof them have a central shaft and softer \u201cbarbs\u201d that branch out from the\nshaft. In flight feathers, the barbs interlock like Velcro teeth to form the\nsmooth, windproof surface of the vanes. In down feathers, the barbs are\nloosely structured and fluffy to trap heat. Many of the other kinds of\nfeathers combine aspects of these two types. The contour feathers that\nstreamline a bird\u2019s body, for example, have vaned tips like flight feathers\nand noninterlocking barbs like down ones. The bristle feathers that typically\noccur on the face and may serve protective and sensory purposes meld the\nflight feathers\u2019 stiff shafts (called rachises) with the down feathers\u2019 fluffy\nbase.\n\nThe wing of the Greater Prairie-Chicken, a type of grouse, has a slotted tip\nthat helps the bird burst into flight when startled.\n\nRobert Clark\n\nIn recent years researchers have begun to piece together the intricate process\nby which feathers develop. Like scales, spines and hairs, feathers are skin\nappendages. Scientists have known for a while that they arise from structures\nin the skin. But how can an animal produce feathers with different anatomies\nacross its body?\n\nMy colleagues and I, led by Cheng-Ming Chuong of the University of Southern\nCalifornia, related the developmental biology of various kinds of pennaceous\nfeathers to their mechanical properties. These feathers begin as a tube that\nessentially unzips along its length, forming the two vanes. Several genes and\nmolecules interact with one another and with the environment to determine the\namount of interlocking in the barbs that make up the vanes, the size and shape\nof the rachises, and whether the shaft is filled with a \u201cfoam\u201d that makes it\nstiff relative to its weight. We found that different feather types have\nvarying specializations in their overall stiffness, their tendency to twist,\nand the distribution of the foam in the shaft. These variations depend to some\nextent on the work of different genes, but most of the differentiation is the\nresult of changes in how the genes are regulated\u2014that is, when they are turned\non or off or how active they are during feather development.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nScientists have also shown a recent surge of interest in another category of\nfeathers: display feathers, the showy feathers that help to attract mates.\nDisplay feathers may dazzle an observer with their colors (think of a\nhummingbird\u2019s glittering throat), or they may attain eye-catching proportions,\nlike the feathers that make up a peacock\u2019s crest and train. The conventional\nwisdom about display feathers holds that they are strictly products of sexual\nselection, in which mate choice drives the evolution of a trait. These days,\nhowever, researchers around the globe, me included, are coming to see display\nfeathers not as exclusively sexually selected traits with no mechanical\nproperties of interest but instead as complex compromises between the\npressures of social biology and mechanobiology.\n\nTo wit: long display feathers don\u2019t grow just anywhere on the body. They most\noften occur on the lower back and tail, where they interfere comparatively\nlittle with flight performance. Take, for example, the Resplendent Quetzal, a\nsmall, colorful bird native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America\nwith tail feathers that can grow up to three feet long on males during the\nbreeding season. The tail streamers might not be shaped solely by sexual\nselection. Evidence indicates that the streamers of some birds produce at\nleast a little aerodynamic force, enough to support much of their added\nweight. The quetzal\u2019s streamers, for their part, lost their tight interlocking\nstructure, making the vanes a pennaceous-downy hybrid that lets much of the\nairflow pass through without producing much lift. This arrangement is most\nlikely an adaptation to prevent these feathers from being highly\ndestabilizing. These flashy feathers still increase the cost of flying because\nthey add drag, but that cost may well be less than has been assumed.\n\nThe Barn Owl\u2018s primary feathers have features that allow this bird of prey to\nfly silently.\n\nRobert Clark\n\nThe microstructure of display feathers, especially tail streamers, may also be\nmore finely tuned than previously thought. Feather structure provides a\nbalance of stiffness, weight and shape. The feathers must hold their shape\nwell enough, even at extreme lengths, to be effective signals. But they cannot\nbe so stiff as to destabilize the bird during gusty winds or tight maneuvers.\nThere\u2019s a particular range of flexibility that shows off the feather to best\neffect while minimizing detrimental impacts on flight performance.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nOne of the aspects of feathers that has long fascinated me is their\nadaptability. Under varying conditions and evolutionary pressures, they can\nbecome specialized for everything from speed and maneuverability to insulation\nor display. Some of the most fascinating adaptations can be found in owls.\n\nFacial disks are an especially conspicuous feature of owls. These broad,\nsemicircular fans of feathers around the eyes and ears give owls their\ndistinctive appearance. The skull of an owl is actually quite long and narrow,\nbut the feathers enveloping it completely change the contours of the animal.\nThese facial disks are not just for looks. They do a remarkably good job of\nfunneling sound to the owl\u2019s ears. The disks, along with vertically offset\nears and exceptionally sensitive middle and inner ear structures, make owls so\ngood at determining the origin of a sound that they can zero in on prey\nwithout seeing it at all (they still use vision to make the final capture,\nthough).\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nI have worked with quite a few owls over the years, particularly individuals\nbeing rehabilitated after injury. One such owl couldn\u2019t be released because a\ncar strike had left him completely blind. Yet if someone tossed food onto one\nof his perches, the gentle thud of it landing was enough for him to pounce on\nit perfectly. (Readers may also find solace in knowing that he still flew,\nhaving memorized his enclosure, and was regularly taken around for walks and\nneck scratches.)\n\nStill, that exceptional sense of hearing wouldn\u2019t get owls very far without\nsome additional feather adaptations. Other nocturnal creatures can also hear\nvery well, and an owl whose feathers were rustling in flight would be hard-\npressed to get close to its vigilant prey. Furthermore, owls might not hear\nquietly creeping prey if their own feather sounds covered the faint noises of\ntheir targets. Owls solved both problems by evolving feather traits that make\nthem inaudible during flight.\n\nThe extremely stiff feathers of hummingbirds such as Anna\u2019s Hummingbird help\nto support their distinctive, hovering flight.\n\nKathleen Reeder Wildlife Photography/Getty Images\n\nIt is hard to appreciate just how quiet owls are. Even ultrasensitive\nmicrophones, if properly calibrated, aimed exactly right and set to maximum\nsensitivity in a silent space, can just barely pick up sounds from a flying\nowl ... sometimes. For all practical purposes, owls are silent. They are so\neerily noiseless that even if they fly over your head close enough for you to\nfeel their wake, you will still hear absolutely nothing. In a dark space, they\nare essentially undetectable. All the owl wing sounds you hear in the Harry\nPotter movies and other films? Those are added in.\n\nOwls achieve this stealth with a few different feather adaptations. To start,\ntheir feathers have a \u201cvelvety\u201d surface that silences them when they move\nagainst one another. More important, the feathers on the leading edge of an\nowl\u2019s wing have a set of comblike structures, whereas those on the trailing\nedge have fluffy fringes. The leading-edge comb stirs the air in a specific\nway called micro vorticity. These tiny, swirling streams of air cause the main\nflow to stick to the wing. In aerodynamic speak, we say the combs \u201cinject\nvorticity into the boundary layer.\u201d When this modified flow then passes\nthrough the trailing-edge fringes, the net result is a wake that contains no\ncoherent waves of linear pressure and therefore no sound. Put another way,\nthere are no vibrations from the interactions between feathers and the air\ncapable of producing sound.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nThese specializations have deep roots. Modern-day owls belong to one of two\ngroups: the tytonids (represented by Barn Owls and Bay Owls) and the strigids\n(all other living owls). Their last common ancestor existed at least 50\nmillion years ago. Because owls in both groups exhibit silent flight, this\ntrait probably dates to their common ancestor. In other words, owls have been\nsurreptitiously coursing the night skies for more than 50 million years.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of the most extreme feather adaptations are found in\nbirds with the most extreme ecological specializations. One way feathers can\nadapt to a particular way of life is by increasing or decreasing in stiffness.\nCoincidentally, the stiffest feathers are found in two groups of birds that\nare otherwise as different as can be: hummingbirds and penguins.\n\nHummingbirds have ultrastiff feathers as an adaptation to the exceptionally\nhigh flapping frequencies and unusual flapping stroke they use to hover in\nfront of flowers while sipping nectar. Unlike most birds, hummingbirds can get\na substantial amount of weight support and thrust from their upstroke, not\njust their downstroke. They do this by rotating their shoulder to flip the\nwing over completely. The wing needs to be very stiff for this method to work.\nReinforcements in the bones of the hummingbird wing provide some of this\nrigidity; feathers with extremely firm rachises provide the rest.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nThe flightless penguins, in contrast, have adapted to life in the water and on\nland. They possess some of the most specialized plumage of all, having\nconverted their entire body covering into a densely packed mosaic of tiny\nfeathers. These feathers are individually quite stiff, and together they form\na textured surface over the wings and body that regulates the boundary layer\nof water against them while the penguin is swimming. In essence, they use a\nrough coat of feathers to catch and hold a smooth jacket of water. The net\neffect is a reduction in drag and therefore a lower energetic cost of\nswimming. The dense feathers also trap just enough air to provide some\ninsulation without making the penguin buoyant, supplementing the fat layer\nthat helps to keep the bird warm.\n\nIn the absence of any constraints posed by flight, penguins jettisoned the\nmore typical feather accoutrements of their ancestors in favor of a novel suit\nof drag-reducing, minimum-buoyancy feathers. These feathers are a key part of\nthe package of adaptations that have made penguins the undisputed diving\nchampions of the avian world, capable of reaching depths of more than 1,600\nfeet in search of krill, fish, and other aquatic prey.\n\nMaria Amorette Klos\n\nFeathers are a fantastic model system for understanding how complex structures\nevolve and how anatomy and behavior influence each other over time. It\u2019s no\nwonder that the applied science sector has taken note of feathers\u2019 many\nbrilliant features. Already they have led to successful technological\ninnovations. The Velcro-like mechanism that connects the barbs of pennaceous\nfeathers is the basis for an advanced temporary fastening system. The\nsilencing fringes of owl feathers have inspired ventilation-quieting systems.\nThe surface texture and boundary-layer-control principles of penguin feathers\nhave made their way into robotics, mostly in prototypes.\n\nNo doubt feathers will give rise to more clever inventions in the future. We\nhave only to let our creativity take flight.\n\nLong display feathers may be present on the wings, as happens in the Standard-\nwinged Nightjar (left) and Pennant-winged Nightjar (right center). But they\nusually grow on the lower back and tail, which minimizes any negative impact\non flight, as in the Stephanie\u2019s Astrapia (left center) and Resplendent\nQuetzal (right).\n\nRobert Clark\n\n### From Our Archives\n\nWhich Came First, the Feather or the Bird?
