Position\n  * Jovian Water\n  * More About the Mission\n  * News Media Contacts\n\nThis animation is an artist\u2019s concept of Loki Patera, a lava lake on Jupiter\u2019s\nmoon Io, made using data from the JunoCam imager aboard NASA\u2019s Juno\nspacecraft. With multiple islands in its interior, Loki is a depression filled\nwith magma and rimmed with molten lava. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS\n\nImagery from the solar-powered spacecraft provides close-ups of intriguing\nfeatures on the hellish Jovian moon.\n\nScientists on NASA\u2019s Juno mission to Jupiter have transformed data collected\nduring two recent flybys of Io into animations that highlight two of the\nJovian moon\u2019s most dramatic features: a mountain and an almost glass-smooth\nlake of cooling lava. Other recent science results from the solar-powered\nspacecraft include updates on Jupiter\u2019s polar cyclones and water abundance.\n\nThe new findings were announced Wednesday, April 16, by Juno\u2019s principal\ninvestigator Scott Bolton during a news conference at the European Geophysical\nUnion General Assembly in Vienna.\n\nJuno made extremely close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February 2024,\ngetting within about 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the surface, obtaining\nthe first close-up images of the moon\u2019s northern latitudes.\n\n\u201cIo is simply littered with volcanoes, and we caught a few of them in action,\u201d\nsaid Bolton. \u201cWe also got some great close-ups and other data on a\n200-kilometer-long (127-mile-long) lava lake called Loki Patera. There is\namazing detail showing these crazy islands embedded in the middle of a\npotentially magma lake rimmed with hot lava. The specular reflection our\ninstruments recorded of the lake suggests parts of Io\u2019s surface are as smooth\nas glass, reminiscent of volcanically created obsidian glass on Earth.\u201d\n\nThe JunoCam instrument on NASA\u2019s Juno captured this view of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io\n\u2014 with the first-ever image of its south polar region \u2014 during the\nspacecraft\u2019s 60th flyby of Jupiter on April 9.\n\nImage credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS. Image processing: Gerald\nEichst\u00e4dt/Thomas Thomopoulos (CC BY).\n\nMaps generated with data collected by Juno\u2019s Microwave Radiometer (MWR)\ninstrument reveal Io not only has a surface that is relatively smooth compared\nto Jupiter\u2019s other Galilean moons, but also has poles that are colder than\nmiddle latitudes.\n\n### Pole Position\n\nDuring Juno\u2019s extended mission, the spacecraft flies closer to the north pole\nof Jupiter with each pass. This changing orientation allows the MWR instrument\nto improve its resolution of Jupiter\u2019s northern polar cyclones. The data\nallows multiwavelength comparisons of the poles, revealing that not all polar\ncyclones are created equal.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most striking example of this disparity can be found with the central\ncyclone at Jupiter\u2019s north pole,\u201d said Steve Levin, Juno\u2019s project scientist\nat NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIt is clearly\nvisible in both infrared and visible light images, but its microwave signature\nis nowhere near as strong as other nearby storms. This tells us that its\nsubsurface structure must be very different from these other cyclones. The MWR\nteam continues to collect more and better microwave data with every orbit, so\nwe anticipate developing a more detailed 3D map of these intriguing polar\nstorms.\u201d\n\n### Jovian Water\n\nOne of the mission\u2019s primary science goals is to collect data that could help\nscientists better understand Jupiter\u2019s water abundance. To do this, the Juno\nscience team isn\u2019t hunting for liquid water. Instead, they are looking to\nquantify the presence of oxygen and hydrogen molecules (the molecules that\nmake up water) in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere. An accurate estimate is critical to\npiecing together the puzzle of our solar system\u2019s formation.\n\nCreated using data collected by the JunoCam imager aboard NASA\u2019s Juno during\nflybys in December 2023 and February 2024, this animation is an artist\u2019s\nconcept of a feature on the Jovian moon Io that the mission science team\nnicknamed \u201cSteeple Mountain.\u201d Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS\n\nJupiter was likely the first planet to form, and it contains most of the gas\nand dust that wasn\u2019t incorporated into the Sun. Water abundance also has\nimportant implications for the gas giant\u2019s meteorology (including how wind\ncurrents flow on Jupiter) and internal structure.\n\nIn 1995, NASA\u2019s Galileo probe provided an early dataset on Jupiter\u2019s water\nabundance during the spacecraft\u2019s 57-minute descent into the Jovian\natmosphere. But the data created more questions than answers, indicating the\ngas giant\u2019s atmosphere was unexpectedly hot and \u2014 contrary to what computer\nmodels had indicated \u2014 bereft of water.\n\n\u201cThe probe did amazing science, but its data was so far afield from our models\nof Jupiter\u2019s water abundance that we considered whether the location it\nsampled could be an outlier. But before Juno, we couldn\u2019t confirm,\u201d said\nBolton. \u201cNow, with recent results made with MWR data, we have nailed down that\nthe water abundance near Jupiter\u2019s equator is roughly three to four times the\nsolar abundance when compared to hydrogen. This definitively demonstrates that\nthe Galileo probe\u2019s entry site was an anomalously dry, desert-like region.\u201d\n\nThe results support the belief that the during formation of our solar system,\nwater-ice material may have been the source of the heavy element enrichment\n(chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium that were accreted by\nJupiter) during the gas giant\u2019s formation and/or evolution. The formation of\nJupiter remains puzzling, because Juno results on the core of the gas giant\nsuggest a very low water abundance \u2014 a mystery that scientists are still\ntrying to sort out.\n\nData during the remainder of Juno\u2019s extended mission may help, both by\nenabling scientists to compare Jupiter\u2019s water abundance near the polar\nregions to the equatorial region and by shedding additional light on the\nstructure of the planet\u2019s dilute core.\n\nDuring Juno\u2019s most recent flyby of Io, on April 9, the spacecraft came within\nabout 10,250 miles (16,500 kilometers) of the moon\u2019s surface. It will execute\nits 61st flyby of Jupiter on May 12.\n\n### More About the Mission\n\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena,\nCalifornia, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott\nBolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.
