That moat looks hard to cross\nin either direction! By WyrdLight.com, CC BY-SA 3.0,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7910287\n\nThe \u2018moat\u2019 is a familiar business concept. It\u2019s a barrier that protects you\nfrom would-be competitors. Everyone wants their business to be protected by a\nstrong moat.\n\nReal-life, physical moats can also stop defenders leaving the protection of\nthe fortress they encircle. But staying inside the moat can be risky. It lets\nwould-be attackers build strength outside, until they are ready to breach the\nmoat.\n\nIn this post we\u2019ll look at an example where a business moat has led to the\nsame phenomenon. It\u2019s the story of Intel\u2019s x86 Instruction Set Architecture\n(ISA).\n\nAn ISA, the set of \u2018instruction codes\u2019 that a microprocessor can understand\nand run, may seem like an arcane technical detail. As we\u2019ll discover though,\nit\u2019s been a key part of Intel\u2019s business for nearly five decades and is\narguably right at the root of the firm\u2019s current problems.\n\nThose problems have had major economic and geopolitical consequences as Intel,\nand by extension the U.S., have fallen behind in advanced semiconductor\nmanufacturing. This, in turn, has led to the U.S. government needing to\nprovide tens of billions of dollars of subsides to Intel and to TSMC and\nSamsung.\n\nOver the last week there has been lots of coverage of Intel\u2019s announcement of\nthe financial results of its newly defined and separated \u2018Intel Foundry\u2019\nbusiness. Intel Foundry is the part of Intel that makes chips both for use in\nIntel\u2019s own products and, Intel hopes, increasingly for external customers.\n\nSpoiler alert, they\u2019re not good. Not good at all.\n\nSource : Intel\n\nThat\u2019s a loss of $7.0 billion in 2023 for Intel Foundry.\n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t bad enough, Intel, as it now admits, lost manufacturing\nleadership with its 10nm fabrication process, around a decade ago.\n\nIntel expects (hopes) that it will overtake TSMC again with its Intel 18A\nprocess, but only after almost a decade trailing the Taiwanese firm.\n\nHow did Intel arrive at this position after leading for so many years? The\nfirm may blame a \u2018structurally more competitive environment\u2019, but that\u2019s not\nthe full picture.\n\nAs Intel admits, its old model for manufacturing relied on proprietary\nintellectual property and processes, focused on delivering only internal\nproducts and monetization of manufacturing through sales of those products.\n\nAs\n\nDylan Patel\n\nhas highlighted, this model allowed Intel to accumulate and hide numerous\ninefficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes.\n\nThese inefficiencies have now been exposed and Intel has (re)discovered that\nMoore\u2019s Law is at its core, about economics (headline below Intel).\n\nI wrote about the importance of economics to Moore\u2019s Law in Moore on Moore\nback in February. Quoting Intel founder Gordon Moore:\n\n> Moore\u2019s law is really about economics. My prediction was about the future\n> direction of the semiconductor industry, and I have found that the industry\n> is best understood through some of its underlying economics.\n>\n> Gordon Moore\n>\n> #### Moore on Moore\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> Jan 21\n>\n> Read full story\n\nNow Intel faces an uphill struggle. It needs to regain its process prowess,\ninvest many tens of billions in new fabs, and build a customer base for Intel\nFoundry.\n\nFor more on Intel\u2019s plans and challenges then please turn to the further\nreading at the end of this post.\n\nThe rest of this post, though, is going to dig into the history and origins of\nIntel\u2019s malaise. I believe that its origins can be seen much earlier, in two\nthings that happened (or rather, from Intel\u2019s perspective, didn\u2019t happen) in\n2007.\n\nShare\n\n####\n\nThe x86 ISA Moat\n\nThese problems have a single root cause, which also happens to be one of\nIntel\u2019s biggest strengths, a moat that has protected Intel\u2019s most important\nbusiness for over four decades: the x86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).\n\nAn ISA is the collection of machine instructions that a processor can execute.\n\nWhen we say \u2018the x86 ISA\u2019 we really mean the collection of ISAs for a range of\nprocessors starting with Intel\u2019s 8086 from 1976 (hence the name x86), leading\nto today\u2019s latest processor designs from Intel and AMD. As we saw in the\nTrillion Dollar Stopgap, the 8086 and its successors were only ever meant to\nlast for a few years.\n\n#### Trillion Dollar Stopgap: The Intel 8086\n\nBabbage\n\n\u00b7\n\nMarch 5, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nThe 8086 wasn\u2019t even a completely new design. As Intel\u2019s launch publicity\nstated the 8086 was an evolution of the earlier 8-bit 8080 microprocessor,\nwhich in turn was an evolution of Intel\u2019s first 8-bit microprocessor the 8008,\nwhich was an implementation of the architecture of DataPoint 2200 terminal\nfrom 1970.\n\nx86 has its origins in a very old design and one that Intel didn't even\ndevelop!\n\nOver the nearly five decades since the launch of the 16-bit 8086, the x86 ISA\nhas evolved hugely. Today\u2019s x86 code is 64-bit, and benefits from the addition\nof hundreds of new instructions that enhance its capabilities. Those designs\nhave consistently supported a high degree of \u2018backwards compatibility\u2019. Users\nhave been able to run their existing software on new designs, even as the x86\nISA has been evolved and been enhanced.\n\nAnd over those five decades, x86 has been enormously successful. Billions of\nprocessors have been shipped using the x86 ISA, generating over a trillion\ndollars in revenue for Intel. In part that\u2019s because consumers and businesses\nhave needed to buy an x86 compatible PC in order to run first MS-DOS and then\nWindows software. More recently, x86 designs have become dominant on servers\nas Intel\u2019s manufacturing prowess, supported by large volumes of PC sales, has\nenabled the company to create powerful designs that outperformed competitors.\n\nThe x86 ISA has acted as a \u2018moat\u2019 for Intel\u2019s business over four decades, as\nit\u2019s difficult, and has become much harder over time, to create a competitive\nx86 design from scratch.\n\nThis has always not always been impossible, as AMD, NEC, Via, and others, have\ndone so in the past. Over the years they have mostly fallen away, unable to\ncompete with Intel. Today though, as x86 has become more complex, AMD is left\nas the only other firm left making x86 designs that compete directly with\nIntel.\n\n> Read more about NEC\u2019s efforts to compete with Intel with its own version of\n> x86 in \u2018Intel vs NEC : The case of the V20\u2019s Microcode\u2019.\n>\n> #### Intel vs NEC : The Case of the V20's Microcode\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> November 5, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n\nThe \u2018x86 moat\u2019 sounds like it is a great asset, so why has it led to Intel\u2019s\nrecent problems?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Intel Foundry. To say that the success of Intel foundry is\ncrucial to Intel\u2019s future would be an understatement. Put simply, Intel is\nbuilding a lot of expensive fabs. It will use them to build its own x86\nproducts. But to fill them, and ultimately make them financially viable, it\nneeds lots of third party customers, and almost none of those customers will\nbe using x86 in their designs.\n\nIntel staged a lavish presentation on Foundry back in February. See the end of\nthe post for a link to a full recording of the event.\n\nOne moment stood out in the keynote. The appearance of Arm\u2019s CEO, Rene Haas.\n\nAs readers will know, Arm doesn\u2019t make chips. Instead it licenses its\nIntellectual Property to others to build into their own System-on-Chips\n(SoCs). That IP was originally processor designs using Arm\u2019s own ISA(s) - it\u2019s\ncommon to talk about \u2018The Arm ISA\u2019 (singular) but there are multiple current\nand legacy ISAs designed by Arm - but now extends to licensing of the ISAs\nthemselves to third parties. Major firms that license the Arm ISA and use that\nISA in their own CPU designs include Apple, Broadcom, Qualcomm and Nvidia.1\n\n> Readers can follow the Arm story from its origins in Acorn computers in\n> Cambridge in the UK, through the \u201cArm Barn\u201d and into Nokia 3G mobile phones\n> in the posts below.\n>\n> #### The Arm Story Part 1 : From Acorns\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> February 5, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n>\n> #### The Arm Story Part 2 : Archimedes to Advanced RISC Machines\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> February 19, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n>\n> #### The Arm Story Part 3 : Creating A Global Standard\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> March 19, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n\nToday, Arm\u2019s customers using Arm IP-based products completely dominate the\nmarket for smartphone SoCs. And they compete with Intel in servers and\nincreasingly on the desktop. Apple Silicon used in today\u2019s Macs uses the\n64-bit Arm ISA as Apple has moved away from x86.\n\n> More on Apple\u2019s leapt over the x86 moat and made the transition to Arm-based\n> Apple Silicon:\n>\n> #### Apple's Mac Transitions : 68k to PowerPC to Intel to Apple Silicon\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> October 22, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n\nAll three of the biggest US \u2018hyperscalers\u2019 starting with Amazon and now joined\nby Microsoft and most recently Google, with the launch of Axion, are now\nbuilding their own Arm based server CPUs.\n\n> More on how Arm found its way into Amazon Web Services:\n>\n> #### Arm at Amazon\n>\n> Babbage\n>\n> \u00b7\n>\n> July 18, 2023\n>\n> Read full story\n\nArm is a relatively small company with 2023 revenues of $2.8bn compared to\nIntel\u2019s $54bn, but customers using Arm IP have over $1.5 tn of revenue (yes\nthat\u2019s over one-and-a-half trillion dollars in revenue).\n\nInviting Haas onto stage here can be compared to letting down the drawbridge\nover the moat and asking the mastermind behind the invading forces to come in\nfor a polite cup of tea.\n\nBut Intel now needs Arm. Without Arm\u2019s CPU designs in Intel made SoC\u2019s then\nits Foundry business and its newly built fabs will struggle. Welcoming Haas to\nan Intel stage follows the partnership between the two firms announced last\nyear.\n\nWhich takes us to the first of the two things that didn\u2019t happen for Intel in\n2007. First let\u2019s provide some context for Intel\u2019s business in 2007.\n\nShare\n\n####\n\nTriumphs and Tragedies : 2006 and 2007\n\n2006 had been a year of triumph for Intel. After the mis-steps of Itanium and\nNetburst it had staged a comeback with the lower-power x86 Core architecture,\nvanquishing a temporarily resurgent AMD on the desktop, and continuing its\ntrajectory towards a dominant position in servers.\n\nAnd Intel gained a high profile new client when Apple switched from PowerPC to\nIntel\u2019s CPUs in the Mac.\n\nApple\u2019s Steve Jobs announces the Mac\u2019s transition from PowerPC to Intel\n\nBut Apple was the scene of the first major misstep for Intel in 2007.\n\nIntel passed on making the System on Chip for Apple\u2019s new iPhone, launched at\nthe start of 2007. Instead Apple used an Arm designed processor in an SoC\nbuilt by Samsung.\n\nToo late Intel realised the mistake. Over ten billion of dollars were spent on\nan, ultimately futile, attempt to gain a foothold in the smartphone SoC\nmarket. Intel finally gave up in 2016, ceding the market to Arm processors in\nSoCs made by Samsung and TSMC.\n\nToday, Apple is TSMC\u2019s biggest customer, and smartphones make up over 40% of\nthe Taiwanese company\u2019s revenues.\n\nIntel\u2019s then CEO, the late Paul Otellini gave a refreshingly direct mea-culpa\non Intel\u2019s missing the iPhone, in an interview with the Atlantic, shortly\nbefore his retirement from Intel in 2013:\n\n> \"The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was\n> introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do... At the end of the\n> day, there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a\n> certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our\n> forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can\n> make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the\n> volume was 100x what anyone thought.\"\n\nSo, the iPhone \u2018miss\u2019 was a straightforward forecasting error? And the\ndecision was driven purely by the financial outcomes indicated by those\nforecasts? In fact, I think it would be remarkable if this was the case, for\nreasons that we will discuss in a moment.\n\nIn any event, it was a huge lost opportunity. In 2007 Intel was clear process\nleader.\n\nIntel shipped its first 45nm chip in 2007. The iPhone 3GS, which shipped in\n2009, used an SoC built by Samsung using a 90nm process.\n\nLosing the iPhone and smartphones gifted hundreds of billions of dollars of\nbusiness to Samsung and TSMC, business that was crucial in their efforts to\ncatch-up with and then overtake Intel.\n\nThe second miss in 2007 was the lack of a direct response to CUDA, Nvidia\u2019s\nsoftware ecosystem for general purpose computing on its GPUs.\n\nIntel has a long, but sparse, history in discrete GPUs.\n\nGraphics Card with Intel i740 GPU - By Konstantin Lanzet - Own Collection,\nGFDL, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8400155\n\nThe rest of this post is for premium subscribers.
