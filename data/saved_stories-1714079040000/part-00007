Why Trust Us?\n\n  * Many philosophers and scientists have pondered if we live in a simulated universe, and University of Portsmouth scientist Melvin Vopson believes he has evidence.\n  * Using his previously formulated Second Law of Infodynamics, Vopson claims that the decrease of entropy in information systems over time could prove that the universe has a built-in \u201cdata optimization and compression,\u201d which speaks to its digital nature.\n  * While these claims warrant investigation, they\u2019re far from a discovery themselves, and would likely need rigorous proof for the scientific community at large to seriously consider this theory.\n\nIn the 1999 film The Matrix, Thomas Anderson (a.k.a. Neo) discovers a truth to\nend all truths\u2014the universe is a simulation. While this premise provides\nfantastic sci-fi fodder (and explains how Neo can learn kung-fu in about five\nseconds), the idea isn\u2019t quite as carefully relegated to the fiction section\nas one might expect.\n\nUniversity of Portsmouth scientist Melvin Vopson, who studies the possibility\nthat the universe might indeed be a digital facsimile, leans into the\ncinematic comparison. In an article published on website The Conversation this\npast October, Vopson invoked the Wachowskis\u2019 sci-fi masterpiece, and around\nthe same time, he published a book on the subject\u2014Reality Reloaded, a subtle\nhat tip to the title of the less successful Matrix sequel. While he is just\none among many who\u2019ve contemplated the idea, Vopson claims to have one thing\nthat those before him lacked: evidence.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Scientist Reveals How to Escape Our Simulation\n\n\u201cIn physics, there are laws that govern everything that happens in the\nuniverse, for example how objects move, how energy flows, and so on.\nEverything is based on the laws of physics,\u201d Vopson said back in 2022. \u201cOne of\nthe most powerful laws is the second law of thermodynamics, which establishes\nthat entropy\u2014a measure of disorder in an isolated system \u2013 can only increase\nor stay the same, but it will never decrease.\u201d\n\nBased on this famous law, Vopson similarly expected that entropy in\ninformation systems\u2014which his previous research defined as a \u201cfifth state of\nmatter\u201d\u2014should similarly increase over time. But it doesn\u2019t. Instead, it\nremains constant, or even decreases to a minimum value at equilibrium. This is\nin direct contrast to the second law of thermodynamics, which inspired Vopson\nto adopt the Second Law of Information Dynamics (or Infodynamics).\n\n\u201cWe know the universe is expanding without the loss or gain of heat, which\nrequires the total entropy of the universe to be constant,\u201d Vopson wrote in\nThe Conversation. \u201cHowever we also know from thermodynamics that entropy is\nalways rising. I argue this shows that there must be another\nentropy\u2014information entropy\u2014to balance the increase.\u201d\n\nVopson argues that this law plays a role in atomic physics (electron\narrangement), cosmology (see above), and biological systems. This last one is\nwhere Vopson makes a big claim: contrary to Charles Darwin\u2019s idea that\nmutations occur randomly, mutations actually occur so that information entropy\nis minimized. Vopson analyzed the constantly-mutating SARS-CoV-2 (a.k.a.\nCOVID-19) virus, and his paper on that investigation\u2014published this past\nOctober in the journal AIP Advances\u2014shows a \u201ca unique correlation between the\ninformation and the dynamics of the genetic mutations.\u201d\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Mathematician Trying to Hack Earth's Simulation\n\nWhat this all adds up to, in Vospon\u2019s estimation, is that the Second Law of\nInfodynamics could also be used to prove that we live in a simulation.\n\n\u201cA super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a\nbuilt-in data optimization and compression in order to reduce the\ncomputational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation,\u201d\nVopson wrote in The Conversation. \u201cThis is exactly what we are observing all\naround us, including in digital data, biological systems, mathematical\nsymmetries and the entire universe.\u201d\n\nAll of these claims require significant further testing and verification\nbefore even being considered plausible, and as IFLScience notes, there are as\nmany research papers refuting our digital existence as there are promoting its\nscientific inevitability. It\u2019s possible that Vopson\u2019s Second Law of\nInfodynamics could lead to some interesting discoveries, but the question\nfirst pondered by Plato remains unanswered.\n\nDarren Orf\n\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our\nworld works.
