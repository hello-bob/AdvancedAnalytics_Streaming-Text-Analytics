According to unnamed traders\nand refinery executives, these companies have made a substantial impact,\nalthough they are expected to be temporary solutions, lasting months but not\nyears.\n\nIn recent months, several cargoes of Russian oil bound for India got stuck as\nthe US ramped up sanctions.\n\nAs the US intensifies sanctions pressure on Moscow, Russia\u2019s crude trade with\nIndia has begun to resemble a game of oil whack-a-mole. Just as one trader\nbegins to lose prominence, another pops up. New firms, going by names\nunfamiliar to even the most experienced merchants across Asia, have been\nconstantly emerging to handle shipments between the the OPEC+ producer and the\nworld\u2019s third-largest importer and consumer, according to traders and Indian\nrefinery executives.\n\nHighlighting the difficulties of global sanctions enforcement, they are often\nconnected to the same individuals.\n\nMany of the new names have become marketers of Russian grades only in the past\nfew months, after the US slapped sanctions on Bellatrix Energy Ltd and Zeenit\nSupply and Trading DMCC, the people said.\n\nSponsored Links Sponsored Links\n\nPromoted Links Promoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nCheckfox\n\nSolar Eilmeldung: Staat \u00e4ndert 2024 Vorgaben f\u00fcr HausbesitzerCheckfox\n\nUndo\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nThese companies form an ever-evolving network of transporters, creating a\ngrowing challenge for the Biden administration as it seeks to punish those\nhelping to fund the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. The question of unintended\nsanctions consequences and of the industry\u2019s ability to adapt - including with\na churn of little-known entities - has long worried even sanctions advocates.\nThat is now playing out.\n\nBetween January and February this year, three previously unknown entities \u2014\nBlackford, Black Pearl and Vertex \u2014 have together played a significant role in\nsupplying India\u2019s private and state processors with Russian crude, said the\ntraders and refinery executives, who asked not to be named as they\u2019re not\nauthorized to speak publicly. They are likely to last months, but not years.\n\nTraders said the ease of incorporating new businesses in locations such as\nDubai and Hong Kong has been pivotal to the creation of pop-up firms. Most of\nthese names had not been seen or heard, even by those close to the trade, just\nmonths earlier. With the support of these merchants, as well as the ones that\ncame before, India\u2019s imports from Russia surged from almost zero pre-Ukraine\nwar to a peak of over two million barrels a day last year, before slipping a\nlittle from that level. The advantage of smaller trading companies is that\nthey\u2019re easily replaceable, with many firms existing for less than a year,\nsaid Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at commodity intelligence firm Kpler.\n\nThe turnover rate, however, is a headache for enforcers even as the US\nsanctions numerous traders, ships and shippers for their role in the Russian\noil trade \u2014 in particular, for transactions done above the $60-a-barrel price\nlimit. Indian refining executives told Bloomberg that their firms have been\ninundated by requests from new entities looking to register themselves as\napproved suppliers. The companies conduct due-diligence checks with the help\nof third-party firms, who help to confirm that the pop-up traders are genuine.\nThe executives said that, while the entities may appear new, checks show the\npeople behind them have typically sold Russian oil to India before. In recent\nmonths, several cargoes of Russian oil bound for India got stuck as the US\nramped up sanctions targeting traders and shipowners such as Sovcomflot PJSC.\nSome deliveries have been diverted to China as a result of these\ncomplications, while others attempted to transfer their cargoes onto other\nvessels at locations such as Oman.\n\nTreasury department officials, meanwhile, said Washington has never expected\nIndia to stop importing Russian oil as it\u2019s in the US\u2019s interest to keep\nenergy flowing to prevent any supply shocks. Russian flows to China,\nmeanwhile, have been less impacted by sanctions, traders said. That\u2019s because\nof the presence of more middlemen in the chain of supply from producer to end-\nuser, including some Chinese state and regional companies, they said.\n\u201cEverybody is trying to play hide and seek game as no one wants to be caught\nviolating sanctions,\u201d said Jayendu Krishna, director-deputy head at shipping\nconsultancy firm Drewry Maritime Advisors. India needs cheap crude oil to\ndampen inflationary pressures, and these intermediaries are crucial to help\nkeep oil flowing, he added.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nSponsored Links Sponsored Links\n\nPromoted Links Promoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nSpin-Power Schrubber\n\nNeues Reinigungsger\u00e4t bricht alle Verkaufsrekorde in DeutschlandSpin-Power\nSchrubber\n\nUndo\n\nSolaranlagen\n\nWas kostet eine Solaranlage mit Speicher 2024?Solaranlagen\n\nUndo\n\nH\u00f6rger\u00e4te Vergleich\n\nRiesa: Kein Geld f\u00fcr Mini-H\u00f6rger\u00e4te?
