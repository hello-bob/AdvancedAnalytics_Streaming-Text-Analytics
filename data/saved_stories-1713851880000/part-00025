In\nfighting that monster, the hero often gets help from their usual social\nallies, such as friends, family, and local authorities. In a more \u201cmodern\u201d\nstory, however, the villain may be a friend, parent, boss, teacher, police, or\ngovernment agency. The hero must now learn to distrust many usual authorities,\nand judge who are their real allies.\n\nSuch stories come from our usual cultural authorities, however, like those who\nmake our movies, TV shows, novels, and songs. And so these can be seen at a\nmeta level as the same simple hero story: our cultural authorities teaching us\nhow to anticipate and deal with the real villains we may encounter in our\nmodern world. So then a meta-modern story is when those cultural authorities\nbecome the villains. In such stories, heroes must learn to distrust many\ncultural authorities and decide which ones are their real allies.\n\nNow there are some movies roughly of this form. But they typically warn\nagainst trusting conservative cultural authorities. For example, Breaking the\nWaves and Handmaids Tale warn against trusting religious cultural authorities.\nVideodrome, Natural Born Killers, and Starship Troopers warn against trusting\nauthorities who promote violence. Pleasantville, Network, Stepford Wives, and\nThey Live warn against trusting older-era cultures. Movies like The Matrix and\nTruman Show do warn against trusting appearances, they don\u2019t warn about\nculture in particular.\n\nHowever, as our cultural elites are now dominated by non-conservatives, such\nmovies are now really just our usual cultural authorities warning against\ntrusting rebels who defy their cultural dominance. They are not really warning\nagainst trusting dominant cultural authorities. Any movies that do this must\nbe pretty far out into the long tail of niche products. But they might be the\nwarnings we really need.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n29 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n29\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Who Warns Of Warners?\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nCatherine Caldwell-HarrisHigher Cognition18 hrs ago\u00b7edited 7 hrs agoI\nappreciate the logic of this blog post. That logic suggests: Fictional\nnarratives should exist (or may need to be created) that sound the alarm about\nharms done by the currently dominant liberal (or non-conservative) cultural\nelites.I'm trying to think of possible harms to be warned against. It isn't\neasy to come up with anything. So, trying hard, I've thought of these\n3:\"Feminists told me I could be both a mother and have a career, but I waited\ntoo long and am childless...\" (this disappointment has been documented and\nparodied)\"Non-white males from historically marginalized groups are valued for\nall the important, high status jobs; as a white male I can't get ahead,\ntherefore, I succumb to depression and substance abuse...\" (the documented\n'deaths of despair' of middle-aged white males, reported in PNAS 12 years ago\napprox.)\"Liberal educators told me that emotional regulation, social skills,\nlearning-how-to-learn and finding out what I loved doing should be my\neducational goals.
