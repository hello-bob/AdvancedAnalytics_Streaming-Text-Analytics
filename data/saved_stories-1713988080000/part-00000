After that, a new defined period of cover kicks in.\n\nCPSM, like others in the upcoming ETF lineup, will primarily invest its assets\nin derivatives by buying and selling a combination of call and put options to\ncushion against market volatility, according to the fund\u2019s prospectus. A\nregulatory filing notes there\u2019s no guarantee the fund will be successful in\nproviding the much sought-after downside protection.\n\n\u201cWith risk-free rates north of 5% today, options-based product issuers are\nable to deliver meaningful upside participation with 100% capital protection,\u201d\nsaid Matt Kaufman, head of ETFs at Calamos. \u201cFor those issuing \u2018protective\u2019\nproducts, the cost of hedging by selling an option \u2014 or series of options \u2014 to\noffset the premium to buy a protective put becomes cheaper as rates rise.\u201d\n\nAssessing Appetite\n\nIssuers are testing demand for funds that offer equity exposure and downside\nprotection as investors grapple with elevated rates volatility. The Innovator\nEquity Defined Protection ETF (TJUL), which provides 100% downside protection\nover a two-year outcome period, has grown to $230 million since launching in\nJuly. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest ETF issuer, has also filed for funds they\nsay offer complete downside protection.\n\nThe 100% capital-protected funds offer investors an additional layer of\nprotection than so-called \u201cbuffer ETFs,\u201d which first came to the market in\n2018. Those funds offer downside risk protection to a certain buffer level,\nsay the first 10% of losses. But after that level, investors are still exposed\nto losses.\n\nThese new funds by Calamos will generally offer less upside exposure but also\nprovide more downside protection.\n\n\u201cFor people as they age, nearing retirement \u2014 they can\u2019t afford the\nsignificant drawdowns of the market, but they also can\u2019t afford to not be in\nthe market. So this gives them an opportunity,\u201d said Kaufman.\n\nCPSM is expected to launch on May 1. Calamos plans to roll out new funds every\nseveral months.\n\nThe investment firm, with roughly $37 billion in assets under management,\nspecializes in options-based strategies across various fund wrappers including\nETFs, separately managed portfolios and mutual funds.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n### Top Picks\n\n  * 5:50\n\nEric Nuttall's Top Picks: April 23, 2024\n\n  * 4:45\n\nBrett Girard's Top Picks: April 22, 2024\n\n  * 6:41\n\nMichael Hakes' Top Picks: April 19, 2024\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  *     * #### Economics\n\n5:21\n\n### Canada's retail sales flatlined in the first quarter of 2024\n\nCanadian consumers haven\u2019t tightened their belts this much in nearly a year,\nand there are no signs of spending growth since the start of 2024.\n\n  *     * #### Company News\n\n5:35\n\n### Rogers reports Q2 profit down from year ago, revenue up\n\nRogers Communications Inc. reported a first-quarter profit of $256 million,\ndown from $511 million a year ago, as it faced higher costs related to its\nShaw Communications acquisition and restructuring efforts.\n\n  *     * #### Economics\n\n6:01\n\n### Poll suggests half of Canadians have negative opinion of latest Liberal\nbudget\n\nA new poll suggests the Liberals have not won over voters with their latest\nbudget, though there is broad support for their plan to build millions of\nhomes.\n\n  *     * #### Company News\n\n    * #### News Wire\n\n8:23\n\n### Boeing's US$3.9 billion cash burn adds urgency to revival plan\n\nBoeing Co.
