Ron DeSantis signed the preemption into law\nThursday night.\n\nThis comes ahead of what's expected to be an even hotter summer than last\nyear\u2019s record-setting months. It\u2019s part of a warming trend brought by human-\ndriven climate change, as the burning of fossil fuels puts heat-trapping gases\ninto the atmosphere.\n\nLucia Lopez, 34, is a mother of four and works on a tomato farm in Parrish.\nShe came to Florida from Mexico when she was 10.\n\nLucia Lopez\n\n/\n\nCourtesy\n\n34-year-old Lucia Lopez working in the tomato field.\n\nShe said farmworkers have to wear a lot of gear to protect against the sun and\nthe chemicals used in the fields, like bandanas to cover their faces, hats,\nlong sleeve shirts, pants and special shoes. This can all feel suffocating,\nshe said.\n\nSome days in the heat are worse than others with headache and feeling\ndehydrated, Lopez said.\n\n\u201cThe ones that are not used to [the heat] sometimes they work half a day, and\nthe ones that can\u2019t really handle the heat are taken to the hospital or the\nclinic,\u201d she said, translated from Spanish.\n\nWorkers may then be on leave without pay for a week or two, Lopez said.\n\nThe way the pay system works for farmworkers, she said, is that the harder you\nwork, the more money you make, so voluntary breaks mean less income.\n\n### Heat illness\n\nShauna Junco, a clinical pharmacist and board president of Florida Clinicians\nfor Climate Action, said that Florida or Arizona are typically the states with\nthe highest number of emergency department visits due to heat illness.\n\n\u201cHeat illness is called the silent killer amongst the medical community\nbecause it's insidious, and it's not recognized as a cause of death. But when\nyou look at the data, it causes more deaths than any other type of natural\ndisaster really combined,\u201d said Junco.\n\n\u201cIt kills more people than floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornadoes, but\nit's just not recognized, especially in Florida where it's chronic, so we\u2019re\nseeing workers die from heat.\u201d\n\n### House Bill 433\n\nFlorida House Bill 433, which will go into effect July 1, prohibits cities and\ncounties from establishing protections, like water breaks, for outdoor workers\nin extreme heat.\n\nLopez said this legislation is bad news for her and her colleagues.\n\n\u201cI think that everyone that comes to this country comes to fight for our\nfamilies, and besides that, the laborious work is very harsh and underpaid,\u201d\nshe said.\n\n> > \u201cHeat illness is called the silent killer amongst the medical community\n> because it's insidious, and it's not recognized as a cause of death. But\n> when you look at the data, it causes more deaths than any other type of\n> natural disaster really combined.\u201d\n>\n> Shauna Junco, clinical pharmacist\n\nDeSantis\u2019 office did not immediately respond to WUSF\u2019s emailed request for\ncomment, but the governor was asked to comment on this legislation during a\nnews conference Friday morning for a different bill signing.\n\nHe said this measure didn\u2019t come from him, but out of concern for Miami-Dade\nCounty. It would have been the first county to establish a local heat\nordinance for outdoor workers, but backed out once the legislature approved\nthe state bill.\n\n\u201cI think they were pursuing something that was going to cause a lot of\nproblems down there. So I think a lot of the members of the Miami-Dade\ndelegation created that just to steer clear of those problems,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nBusiness interests have voiced opposition to local heat ordinances, like\nbillionaire Jorge Perez, known as the \u201cMiami condo king,\u201d who wrote an op-ed\nin the Miami Herald making the argument that heat regulations would cripple\nthe construction and agriculture industries.\n\n### Miami-Dade\u2019s ordinance\n\nThe ordinance in Miami-Dade would have required a notice of employee rights to\nbe provided to new employees in English, Spanish and Creole.\n\nIt would have also required outdoor employers who were in agriculture and\nconstruction to establish a mandatory heat exposure safety program, and\nprovide heat illness prevention practices and first aid practices,\nimplementing high heat procedures.\n\nEsteban Wood is with WeCount!, a membership-based organization in South\nFlorida made up of farm, plant nursery and construction workers, which has\nbeen an advocate for the ordinance in Miami-Dade.\n\nHe said the governor signing this into law is a \"disgrace\" and \"shameful.\"\n\n\"He will go down in history as taking part in the organized effort at blocking\nwater breaks for farmworkers,\" said Wood.\n\n> > \u201cUltimately, the county and the state has a responsibility to protect\n> these workers in this, in what will be a public health crisis.\"\n>\n> Esteban Wood\n\n\u201cWe think that this organized effort, this move not only risks lives, but it\nalso silences communities. And it really goes against Florida's sort of\nlongstanding principle of local control. And we believe that this is\nincredibly disappointing and unfortunate that legislators are siding with\ncorporate interests, while at the same time stifling local progress.\u201d\n\nHe said this issue is not going anywhere, as we\u2019re likely to experience record\ntemperatures, even more deaths and heat illness and occupational injuries this\nsummer.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the county and the state have a responsibility to protect these\nworkers in this, in what will be a public health crisis,\" Wood said.\n\nFor now, Wood said advocates will explore ways outside of the legislative\nprocess to protect outdoor workers, like modeling Immokalee's Fair Food\nProgram.\n\nThe program\u2019s website describes it as \u201ca partnership that benefits everyone in\nthe supply chain: workers, growers, retailers and consumers,\u201d in which\nfarmworkers can report issues without fear, growers can address any problems\nand buyers \u201ccan count on a secure and ethical supply chain.\u201d\n\nAs for what Lopez said she and her colleagues need: easier access to medical\ncare.\n\n\u201cI think that everything is too far from us ... to find the closest clinic you\nhave to drive 30 minutes to an hour,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI think there should be\nparamedics close by or medical assistance really close because on the farm our\ncolleagues are not trained for that.\u201d\n\nHB 433 sponsor Tiffany Esposito, R-Fort Myers, also did not respond to WUSF\u2019s\nemailed request for comment.\n\nTags\n\nHealth News Florida FarmworkersExtreme Heat2024 Florida LegislatureRon\nDeSantis\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\nJessica Meszaros\n\nMy main role for WUSF is to report on climate change and the environment,\nwhile taking part in NPR\u2019s High-Impact Climate Change Team.
