The funds announced today\nwill enable GPEI partners \u2013 the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Gavi,\nthe Vaccine Alliance, Rotary International, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 spearheaded by national governments, to\nprotect more than 370 million children with polio vaccines every year. It will\nalso facilitate the delivery of other life-saving interventions like\nnutritional supplements and bed nets to underserved communities and strengthen\nhealth systems to better prepare countries for emerging health threats.\n\nThe commitment was made as part of a broader more than US $620 million\npartnership by Saudi Arabia and BMGF to support polio eradication and\ncontribute to other global health initiatives, including the Lives and\nLivelihood Fund. The partnership was announced at the WEF Special Meeting by\nHis Excellency Dr. Abdullah A. Al Rabeeah, Advisor to the Royal Court and\nSupervisor General of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre\n(KSrelief) and His Excellency Fahad bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel, Minister of\nHealth of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the presence of Dr. Tedros Adhanom\nGhebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, and Bill Gates, co-chair of BMGF.\n\nH.E. Dr. Abdullah A. Al Rabeeah commented, \u201cIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, the\nlast remaining polio-endemic countries, we have seen significant progress, yet\nwork remains to be done as the world pushes towards making eradication\npossible. The pledge from Saudi Arabia today will enhance the innovation and\ncollaboration needed to eradicate this disease. Together with our partners,\nthe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative,\nthe Islamic Development Bank and key countries across the region, our support\nwill not only aim to end polio but to also strengthen health systems in these\ncountries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investment towards global health isn\u2019t just a good to have; it\u2019s a\nstrategic imperative for a thriving, more resilient future together,\u201d said\nH.E. Fahad bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel, \u201cthe world faces many health\nchallenges, and it is part of our responsibility and leadership to contribute\nwith our partners in bridging the gaps, and through concerted efforts, we will\nbe able to alleviate the suffering of many people.\u201d\n\nThanks to decades of country leadership and global collaboration in delivering\nlife-saving vaccines to billions of children, wild polio cases have fallen by\n99.9% since the GPEI was founded in 1988 under the leadership of the World\nHealth Assembly. More than 20 million people are walking today who would have\notherwise been paralyzed by the virus. Just four cases of wild poliovirus have\nbeen recorded this year and 12 cases recorded last year in the remaining wild\npolio endemic countries of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, outbreaks of variant poliovirus, which can emerge in places where\nnot enough children are vaccinated against polio, are increasingly confined to\nhigh-risk areas in just four countries \u2013 Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, Somalia, and Yemen. Still, in places where polio remains today,\nthere are serious challenges to reaching all children with polio vaccines and\nother life-saving interventions, including vaccine misinformation, political\ninsecurity, environmental disasters, and broader humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cFor decades, polio inflicted lifelong suffering on children and families.\nToday, we take another step toward finally eradicating it, thanks to the\ngenerous contributions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. When we invest in\neradicating polio, we make immunization and health systems more resilient, we\nequip nations to better respond to public health challenges, and most\nimportantly, we ensure that more children will be able to live healthy lives,\u201d\nsaid Bill Gates.\n\nThe announcement builds on a long history of support from Saudi Arabia and\nregional partners to the global polio eradication effort as well as across the\nEastern Mediterranean \u2013 the last region where wild polio is endemic. For more\nthan two decades, Saudi Arabia has not only financially supported the GPEI,\nbut has also advocated for polio eradication and access to other life-saving\nvaccines in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. This support ranges from\nchampioning the cause among communities and religious leaders to advocating\nwithin major global convenings like the G20 and regional forums like the World\nHealth Organization\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Subcommittee for Polio\nEradication and Outbreaks.\n\n\u201cReaching all children with lifesaving vaccines is critical to ending polio\nand protecting children and communities everywhere from other preventable\ndiseases and emerging health threats,\u201d said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\u201cWith this new funding, Saudi Arabia will help to protect children in even the\nhardest-to-reach areas, and move towards a healthier, polio-free world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis important support will help bring us one step closer to eradicating\npolio once and for all,\u201d said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director.\n\u201cTogether with communities, health workers, global partners, and donors like\nSaudi Arabia, we can help ensure that no child suffers from paralysis or dies\nfrom polio, and that more children have access to better health systems.\u201d\n\nTo strengthen Afghanistan\u2019s health systems and encourage a continued focus on\nachieving polio eradication in one of the world\u2019s last polio-endemic\ncountries, Saudi Arabia and the Gates Foundation have pledged US $3 million\nand US $15 million respectively over three years to support the Polio Legacy\nChallenge. This Challenge is a results-based financing initiative spearheaded\nby ministers of health in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab\nEmirates (UAE), and Qatar, under the auspices of the WHO EMRO Regional\nSubcommittee on Polio Eradication and Outbreaks.\n\nAlso today, as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) celebrates its 50th\nanniversary, Saudi Arabia announced US $100 million in new funding to support\nthe IsDB\u2019s Lives and Livelihoods Fund (LLF), which aims to lift the poorest\nout of poverty across 33 IsDB member countries through investments in primary\nhealth care, eliminating preventable infectious diseases like polio,\nsupporting smallholder farming and rural agriculture, and improving basic\ninfrastructure. This follows the UAE\u2019s renewed pledge of US $50 million to the\nLLF announced earlier this week, continuing its support for the largest\ndevelopment fund in the region, which aids millions in low-income communities.\n\nOn the occasion, IsDB President Dr. Muhammad Al Jasser stated: \u201cThe Islamic\nDevelopment Bank warmly welcomes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s generous\ncontribution to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. This vital support\nstrengthens GPEI\u2019s efforts to eliminate this devastating disease. We\u2019re proud\nthat IsDB and ISFD, our poverty alleviation arm, have been among the top\nfinanciers for Pakistan\u2019s polio eradication efforts, providing over US $555\nmillion since 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also applaud the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s new funding for the Lives and\nLivelihoods Fund. This innovative initiative tackles poverty barriers faced by\nfamilies, communities, and entire countries. We express our sincere gratitude\nto all partners, existing and new, for their continued collaboration and\ncommitment. Together, through these concerted efforts, we can achieve the\ncritical last-mile results needed to create a truly polio-free world,\u201d added\nthe IsDB President.\n\n### Additional quotes on the funding announcement:\n\nMike McGovern, Chair of the International PolioPlus Committee at Rotary\nInternational, said: \u201cI extend heartfelt gratitude to Saudi Arabia for their\ncommitment to the cause of polio eradication, which has been instrumental in\nadvancing our collective mission towards a polio-free world. Together, we\u2019ve\nwitnessed the remarkable resilience of the polio eradication program, proving\nthat with full support and collaboration, we can overcome any obstacle in our\npath. Let us continue to stand united in our efforts until polio is\neradicated, ensuring a healthier, safer future for generations to come.\u201d\n\nDr. Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: \u201cThis new\ncommitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not only help us achieve a\npolio-free world, it will help countries build stronger health systems,\nprotecting families, communities and economies from other existing and\nemerging health threats.\u201d\n\n#### About the Global Polio Eradication Initiative\n\nThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative is a public-private partnership,\nspearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates\nFoundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
