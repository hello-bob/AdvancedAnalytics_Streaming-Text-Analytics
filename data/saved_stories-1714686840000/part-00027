So much so that SK hynix this week is very publicly announcing\nthat the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) production capacity has already\nsold out for the rest of 2024, and even most of 2025 has already sold out as\nwell.\n\nSK hynix currently produces various types of HBM memory for customers like\nAmazon, AMD, Facebook, Google (Broadcom), Intel, Microsoft, and, of course,\nNVIDIA. The latter is an especially prolific consumer of HBM3 and HBM3E memory\nfor its H100/H200/GH200 accelerators, as NVIDIA is also working to fill what\nremains an insatiable (and unmet) demand for its accelerators.\n\nAs a result, HBM memory orders, which are already placed months in advance,\nare now backlogging well into 2025 as chip vendors look to secure supplies of\nthe memory stacks critical to their success.\n\nThis has made SK hynix the secnd HBM memory vendor in recent months to\nannounce that they've sold out into 2025, following an earlier announcement\nfrom Micron regarding its HBM3E production. But of the two announcements, SK\nhynix's is arguably the most significant yet, as the South Korean firm's HBM\nproduction capacity is far greater than Micron's. So while things were merely\n\"interesting\" with the smallest of the Big Three memory manufacturers being\nsold out into 2025, things are taking a more concerning (and constrained)\noutlook now that SK hynix is as well.\n\nSK hynix currently controls roughly 46% - 49% of HBM market, and its share is\nnot expected to drop significantly in 2025, according to market tracking firm\nTrendForce. By contrast, Micron's share on HBM memory market is between 4% and\n6%. Since HBM supply of both companies is sold out through the most of 2025,\nwe're likely looking at a scenario where over 50% of the industry's total\nHBM3/HBM3E supply for the coming quarters is already sold out.\n\nThis leaves Samsung as the only member of the group not to comment on HBM\ndemand so far. Though with memory being a highly fungible commodity product,\nit would be surprising if Samsung wasn't facing similar demand. And,\nultimately, all of this is pointing towards the indusry entering an HBM3\nmemory shortage.\n\nSeparately, SK hynix said that it is sampling 12-Hi 36GB HBM3E stacks with\ncustomers and will begin volume shipments in the third quarter.\n\nSource: SK Hynix Press Release\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 0 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n## PIPELINE STORIES\n\n\\+ Submit News\n\nSK hynix Reports That 2025 HBM Memory Supply Has Nearly Sold Out AMD Zen 5\nStatus Report: EPYC \"Turin\" Is Sampling, Silicon Looking Great PCI-SIG\nCompletes CopprLink Cabling Standard: PCIe 5.0 & 6.0 Get Wired\n\n  * Samsung Foundry Update: 2nm Unveil in June, Second-Gen SF3 3nm Hits Production This Year\n  * TSMC Readies 8x Reticle Super Carrier Interposer For Next-Gen Chips Twice as Large As Today's\n  * TSMC Jumps Into Silicon Photonics, Lays Out Roadmap For 12.8 Tbps COUPE On-Package Interconnect\n  * TSMC's System-on-Wafer Platform Goes 3D: CoW-SoW Stacks Up the Chips\n  * TSMC Preps Cheaper 4nm N4C Process For 2025, Aiming For 8.5% Cost Reduction\n  * TSMC 2nm Update: N2 In 2025, N2P Loses Backside Power, and NanoFlex Brings Optimal Cells\n  * Report: Seagate, Western Digital Hike HDD Prices Amid Surge In Demand\n  * Seagate: Mozaic 3+ HAMR Hard Drives Can Last Over Seven Years\n  * Samsung Starts Mass Production of 9th Generation V-NAND: 1Tb 3D TLC NAND\n\n## LINKS\n\n  * Home\n  * About\n  * Forums\n  * RSS\n  * Pipeline News\n  * Bench\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Contact Us\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\n## TOPICS\n\n  * CPUs\n  * Motherboards\n  * SSD/HDD\n  * GPUs\n  * Mobile\n  * Enterprise & IT\n  * Smartphones\n  * Memory\n  * Cases/Cooling/PSU(s)\n\n  * Displays\n  * Mac\n  * Systems\n  * Cloud\n  * Trade Shows\n  * Guides\n\n## FOLLOW\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
