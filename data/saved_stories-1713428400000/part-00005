Two weeks earlier, something \u2014 you rarely knew what \u2014 damaged\nthe 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point\nArena, California. Alarms went off; calls were made; and the next day, Hirai\nwas sailing out of the port in Yokohama to fix it.\n\nLoading ...\n\nThe repair was now nearly done. All that remained was to rebury the cable on\nthe seafloor, which they were doing using a bulldozer-sized remotely operated\nsubmersible named Marcas \u2014 and, of course, the paperwork.\n\nSuddenly, the ship began to shudder. Hirai got to his feet, found he could\nbarely stand, and staggered out of his cabin, grasping the handrail as he\npulled himself up the narrow stairway to the bridge. \u201cEngine trouble?\u201d Hirai\nasked the captain, who\u2019d already checked and replied that everything seemed\nnormal. The ship continued to tremble. Looking out from the bridge, the sea\nappeared to be boiling.\n\nLoading ...\n\nLoading ...\n\nLoading ...\n\nA sketch of the Ocean Link in port in Yokohama transitions into a video of the\nship. A bird flies overhead and waves lap at its hull.\n\nThey turned on the television. An emergency alert showed that an earthquake\nhad struck 130 miles northeast of their location. The shaking finally stopped,\nand in the silence, Hirai\u2019s mind leapt to what would come next: a tsunami.\n\nHirai feared these waves more than most people. He had grown up hearing the\nstory of how one afternoon in 1923, his aunt felt the ground shake, swept up\nher two-year-old brother, and sprinted uphill to the cemetery, narrowly\nescaping floods and fires that killed over 100,000 people. That child became\nHirai\u2019s father, so he owed his existence to his aunt\u2019s quick thinking. Now, he\nfound himself in the same position. He knew tsunamis become dangerous when all\nthe water displaced by the quake reaches shallow water and slows and grows\ntaller. The Ocean Link, floating in less than 500 feet of water, was too\nshallow for comfort.\n\nIn the family tree of professions, submarine cable work occupies a lonely\nbranch somewhere between heavy construction and neurosurgery. It\u2019s precision\nengineering on a shifting sea using heavy metal hooks and high-tension lines\nthat, if they snap, can cut a person in half. In Hirai\u2019s three decades with\nKokusai Cable Ship Company (KCS), he had learned that every step must be\nfollowed, no matter how chaotic the situation. Above all else, he often said,\n\u201cyou must always be cool.\u201d\n\nAcross Ocean Link\u2019s 400-foot deck, the ship\u2019s 50 crew members were emerging\nfrom their cabins and workstations, trying to figure out what had just\noccurred. Over the intercom, the captain announced that there had been an\nearthquake, a tsunami was coming, and the crew should ready the ship to\nevacuate to deeper water. The crew fanned out to check fuel tanks and lash\ndown machinery. Inside a darkened, monitor-filled shipping container on the\nstarboard deck, the submersible\u2019s pilot steered Marcas back toward the ship as\nfast as the bulky robot\u2019s propellers could carry it. Minutes later, the\nsubmersible was hoisted aboard and the Ocean Link was underway.\n\nThe tsunami passed under them imperceptibly on their way out to sea, and when\nthey came to a stop three hours later, the television was showing the first\nimages of destruction. Members of the crew who weren\u2019t working gathered on the\nbridge to watch the news, which continued to display a tsunami warning, a map\nof Japan with its eastern seaboard glowing red. They took turns trying to\nreach loved ones using the ship\u2019s satellite phone, but no calls went through.\n\nAs night fell, periodic aftershocks thumped against the hull. Hirai thought\nabout his wife, who was working at a department store in Yokohama near the\nOcean Link\u2019s port; his son, a junior in high school at the time; and his\nparents, whom the family lived with in his hometown of Yokosuka \u2014 none of whom\nhe\u2019d been able to reach. Everyone had someone they were worried about.\n\nBut Hirai also began to think about the work he knew lay ahead. The Ocean Link\nwas one of a small number of ships that maintain the subsea cables that carry\n99 percent of the world\u2019s data. Positioned in strategic locations around the\nplanet, these ships stand ready to sail out and fix faults the moment they are\ndetected, and most of the time, they are more than equal to the task. But\nearthquakes, Hirai knew from experience, were different. They didn\u2019t just\nbreak one cable \u2014 they broke many, and badly. If what he feared had happened,\nJapan risked being cut off from the world in its moment of need.\n\nSure enough, that night, a call came from headquarters confirming the Ocean\nLink was safe and directing them to remain at sea until further notice,\nfollowed by messages announcing cable failure after cable failure, including\nthe one they had just finished repairing.\n\nCable industry professionals tend to be pragmatic people, preoccupied with the\nmaterial realities of working planet-scale construction. But in conversations\nabout landing high-bandwidth cables in digitally neglected regions or putting\nmillions of people back in contact with every fiber strand melted together,\nthey often hint at a sense of larger purpose, an awareness that they are\nperforming a function vital to a world that, if they do their jobs well, will\ncontinue to be unaware of their service.\n\nFor the Ocean Link crew, this awareness was bound up in a still unfolding\nnational tragedy. They knew that whenever they returned to land, they would\nhave to care for their loved ones quickly, because they would soon be going\nback out to sea. For how long, no one knew.\n\nTheThe world\u2019s emails, TikToks, classified memos, bank transfers, satellite\nsurveillance, and FaceTime calls travel on cables that are about as thin as a\ngarden hose. There are about 800,000 miles of these skinny tubes crisscrossing\nthe Earth\u2019s oceans, representing nearly 600 different systems, according to\nthe industry tracking organization TeleGeography. The cables are buried near\nshore, but for the vast majority of their length, they just sit amid the gray\nooze and alien creatures of the ocean floor, the hair-thin strands of glass at\ntheir center glowing with lasers encoding the world\u2019s data.\n\nIf, hypothetically, all these cables were to simultaneously break, modern\ncivilization would cease to function. The financial system would immediately\nfreeze. Currency trading would stop; stock exchanges would close. Banks and\ngovernments would be unable to move funds between countries because the Swift\nand US interbank systems both rely on submarine cables to settle over $10\ntrillion in transactions each day. In large swaths of the world, people would\ndiscover their credit cards no longer worked and ATMs would dispense no cash.\nAs US Federal Reserve staff director Steve Malphrus said at a 2009 cable\nsecurity conference, \u201cWhen communications networks go down, the financial\nservices sector does not grind to a halt. It snaps to a halt.\u201d\n\nA map of the world showing the dozens of fibre optic cable systems which\nstretch across the oceans, connecting continents and island chains. Some of\nthese cables are extremely long.

Seemingly local institutions would be paralyzed as outsourced\naccounting, personnel, and customer service departments went dark.\nGovernments, which rely on the same cables as everyone else for the vast\nmajority of their communications, would be largely cut off from their overseas\noutposts and each other. Satellites would not be able to pick up even half a\npercent of the traffic. Contemplating the prospect of a mass cable cut to the\nUK, then-MP Rishi Sunak concluded, \u201cShort of nuclear or biological warfare, it\nis difficult to think of a threat that could be more justifiably described as\nexistential.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there is enough redundancy in the world\u2019s cables to make it\nnearly impossible for a well-connected country to be cut off, but cable breaks\ndo happen. On average, they happen every other day, about 200 times a year.\nThe reason websites continue to load, bank transfers go through, and\ncivilization persists is because of the thousand or so people living aboard\n20-some ships stationed around the world, who race to fix each cable as soon\nas it breaks.\n\nThe industry responsible for this crucial work traces its origins back far\nbeyond the internet, past even the telephone, to the early days of telegraphy.\nIt\u2019s invisible, underappreciated, analog. Few people set out to join the\nprofession, mostly because few people know it exists.\n\nHirai\u2019s career path is characteristic in its circuitousness. Growing up in the\n1960s in the industrial city of Yokosuka, just down the Miura Peninsula from\nthe Ocean Link\u2019s port in Yokohama, he worked at his parents\u2019 fish market from\nthe age of 12. A teenage love of American rock \u2018n\u2019 roll led to a desire to\nlearn English, which led him to take a job at 18 as a switchboard operator at\nthe telecom company KDDI as a means to practice. When he was 26, he\ntransferred to a cable landing station in Okinawa because working on the beach\nwould let him perfect his windsurfing. This was his introduction to cable\nmaintenance and also where he met his wife. Six years later, his English\nproficiency got him called back to KDDI headquarters to help design Ocean Link\nfor KCS, a KDDI subsidiary. Once it was built, he decided to go to sea with\nit, eventually becoming the ship\u2019s chief engineer.\n\nOthers come to the field from merchant navies, marine construction, cable\nengineering, geology, optics, or other tangentially related disciplines. When\nFumihide Kobayashi, the submersible operator \u2014 a tall and solidly built man\nfrom the mountain region of Nagano \u2014 joined KCS at the age of 20, he thought\nhe would be working on ship maintenance, not working aboard a maintenance\nship. He had never been on a boat before, but Hirai enticed him to stay with\nstories of all the whales and other marine creatures he would see on the\nremote ocean.\n\nOnce people are in, they tend to stay. For some, it\u2019s the adventure \u2014\nrepairing cables in the churning currents of the Congo Canyon, enduring hull-\ndenting North Atlantic storms. Others find a sense of purpose in maintaining\nthe infrastructure on which society depends, even if most people\u2019s response\nwhen they hear about their job is, But isn\u2019t the internet all satellites by\nnow? The sheer scale of the work can be thrilling, too. People will sometimes\nnote that these are the largest construction projects humanity has ever built\nor sum up a decades-long resume by saying they\u2019ve laid enough cable to circle\nthe planet six times.\n\nKCS has around 80 employees, many of whom, like Hirai, have worked there for\ndecades. Because the industry is small and careers long, it can seem like\neveryone knows one another. People often refer to it as a family. Shipboard\nlife lends itself to a strong sense of camaraderie, with periods of\ncollaboration under pressure followed by long stretches \u2014 en route to a\nworksite or waiting for storms to pass \u2014 without much to do but hang out.\nKobayashi learned to fish off the side of the ship and attempted to improve\nthe repetitive cuisine by serving his crewmates sashimi. (His favorite is\nsquid, but his colleagues would prefer he use the squid to catch mackerel.)\nHirai, an enthusiastic athlete, figured out how to string up a net on the\nOcean Link\u2019s helideck and play tennis. Other times, he would join the crew for\nkaraoke in the lounge, a wood-paneled room behind an anomalous stained-glass\ndoor containing massage chairs, a DVD library, and a bar. A self-described\n\u201cwalking jukebox,\u201d Hirai favored Simon & Garfunkel and Billy Joel, though he\nsaid the younger members of the fleet didn\u2019t go in for it as much.\n\nThe world is in the midst of a cable boom, with multiple new transoceanic\nlines announced every year. But there is growing concern that the industry\nresponsible for maintaining these cables is running perilously lean. There are\n77 cable ships in the world, according to data supplied by SubTel Forum, but\nmost are focused on the more profitable work of laying new systems. Only 22\nare designated for repair, and it\u2019s an aging and eclectic fleet. Often,\nmaintenance is their second act. Some, like Alcatel\u2019s Ile de Molene, are\nconverted tugs. Others, like Global Marine\u2019s Wave Sentinel, were once ferries.\nGlobal Marine recently told Data Centre Dynamics that it\u2019s trying to extend\nthe life of its ships to 40 years, citing a lack of money. One out of 4 repair\nships have already passed that milestone. The design life for bulk carriers\nand oil tankers, by contrast, is 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all happy to spend billions to build new cables, but we\u2019re not really\nthinking about how we\u2019re going to look after them,\u201d said Mike Constable, the\nformer CEO of Huawei Marine Networks, who gave a presentation on the state of\nthe maintenance fleet at an industry event in Singapore last year. \u201cIf you\ntalk to the ship operators, they say it\u2019s not sustainable anymore.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a case last year when four of Vietnam\u2019s five subsea cables went\ndown, slowing the internet to a crawl. The cables hadn\u2019t fallen victim to some\ncatastrophic event. It was just the usual entropy of fishing, shipping, and\ntechnical failure. But with nearby ships already busy on other repairs, the\ncables didn\u2019t get fixed for six months. (One promptly broke again.)\n\nBut perhaps a greater threat to the industry\u2019s long-term survival is that the\npeople, like the ships, are getting old. In a profession learned almost\nentirely on the job, people take longer to train than ships to build.\n\nKDDI Ocean Link\n\nDrum engine A powerful but delicate 12-foot diameter electro-hydraulic steel\ndrum used for paying out and recovering cables and grapnels during repairs.\n\nLinear cable engine A conveyor comprised of 21 pairs of cable-gripping tires\nused for laying and retrieving cables.\n\nCable control room A command center adjoining the bridge where cable tension\nis monitored and all cable operations are managed.\n\nCable tanks Three tanks capable of holding a total of 2,800 miles of cable.\n\nBow Sheave A rolling sheave that cables and grapnel ropes are passed over.\n\nThrusters Bow and stern thrusters are used to maneuver into wind, waves, and\ncurrents to keep the ship stationary during repairs.\n\nMARCAS ROV Remote submersible capable of operating at up to 8,000ft.

He recalled another panel he was on in Singapore meant\nto introduce university students to the industry. \u201cThe audience was probably\nabout 10 university kids and 60 old gray people from the industry just filling\nout their day,\u201d he said. When he speaks with students looking to get into\ntech, he tries to convince them that subsea cables are also part \u2014 a\nfoundational part \u2014 of the tech industry. \u201cThey all want to be data scientists\nand that sort of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, I find this industry\nfascinating. You\u2019re dealing with the most hostile environment on the planet,\neight kilometers deep in the oceans, working with some pretty high technology,\ntraveling all over the world. You\u2019re on the forefront of geopolitics, and it\u2019s\ncritical for the whole way the world operates now.\u201d\n\nThe lifestyle can be an obstacle. A career in subsea means enduring long\nstretches far from home, unpredictable schedules, and ironically, very poor\ninternet.\n\n\u201cEveryone complains about that,\u201d said Kaida Takashi, a senior advisor at KCS,\nwho is trying to get the Ocean Link set up with Starlink. It\u2019s a generational\ndifference, he said. For someone like him, a 62-year-old ham radio enthusiast,\nWi-Fi barely fast enough to email is a luxury. Other industry veterans\nreminisced about the days when they felt fortunate to get faxes on board, or\nwaiting for the mailbag in port, or the novelty of using the very cable they\nwere laying to make calls from the middle of the ocean. But for people who\ngrew up with an expectation of constant connectivity, the disconnection of\nshipboard life can cause visible discomfort. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of them,\u201d one\nindustry veteran marveled of his younger colleagues. \u201cThey can\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s biggest recruiting challenge, however, is the industry\u2019s\ninvisibility. It\u2019s a truism that people don\u2019t think about infrastructure until\nit breaks, but they tend not to think about the fixing of it, either. In his\n2014 essay, \u201cRethinking Repair,\u201d professor of information science Steven\nJackson argued that contemporary thinking about technology romanticizes\nmoments of invention over the ongoing work of maintenance, though it is\nequally important to the deployment of functional technology in the world.\nThere are few better examples than the subsea cable industry, which, for over\na century, has been so effective at quickly fixing faults that the public has\nrarely had a chance to notice. Or as one industry veteran put it, \u201cWe are one\nof the best-kept secrets in the world, because things just work.\u201d\n\nTheThe Ocean Link spent two nights at sea before receiving orders to return.\nAs they neared land, Hirai saw debris from the tsunami\u2019s backwash floating in\nthe water: fishing nets, tires, the roofs of buildings, the bloated body of\nwhat he guessed was a cow.\n\nThe earthquake measured 9.1 on the Richter scale, the fourth largest ever\nrecorded and the largest to ever hit Japan. But it was the series of tsunami\nwaves that arrived half an hour later that dealt the most destruction, surging\nmiles inland and sweeping buildings, cars, and thousands of people out to sea.\nThe death toll would eventually climb to nearly 20,000, and the day would\nbecome a national tragedy referred to simply as \u201c3/11.\u201d\n\nThe full extent of the devastation was still becoming clear when the Ocean\nLink returned, but the disaster had already entered a new phase. One hundred\nand sixty miles north of Tokyo, a 50-foot tsunami wave overtopped a seawall\nprotecting the Fukushima power plant, swamping the emergency generators that\nwere cooling the reactors through its automatic post-quake shutdown and\nprecipitating a nuclear meltdown.\n\nHirai\u2019s wife and son had made it back home to their house in Yokosuka, where\nthey lived with Hirai\u2019s parents. Kobayashi\u2019s family, too, was safe. Some crew\nlost loved ones; others sent family to stay with relatives in the south out of\nfear of radiation. They all knew that they had only a few days before they\nwould be sent back out to sea.\n\nLoading ...\n\nThe Ocean Link in a storm in the North Pacific. The ship pitches wildly in the\nheavy swell, the waves crashing over its bow.\n\nThe disaster had severed phone lines and wrecked cell towers, causing phone\nservice to cut out almost immediately after the earthquake struck. Instead,\npeople turned to email, Skype, and other online services that were mostly able\nto route around damage to the network. There was a sense, according to one\nengineer\u2019s postmortem presentation, that the internet was the only media that\nsurvived.\n\nBut its survival was more tenuous than the public knew. While the cables\nconnecting Japan to the rest of the world survived the initial destruction,\nlater that night, as millions of people tried to find their way home with\ntrains stopped and power intermittent, engineers in Tokyo network operation\ncenters watched as one cable after another failed. By the next morning, seven\nof Japan\u2019s 12 transpacific cables were severed. Engineers working through the\nnight and following days managed to shift traffic to those that remained, but\nthe new routes were near their maximum capacity. The head of telecom company\nNTT\u2019s operation center at the time estimated that if another cable failed, it\nwould have lost all traffic to the US. With servers for most major internet\ncompanies located there, Japan would have effectively lost the internet.\n\nNormally, the sequence of repairs would be determined by whichever cable owner\nreported the fault first, but given the extraordinary circumstances, the\nusually self-interested cable owners agreed to defer to KCS. The priority was\nto repair a cable \u2014 any cable \u2014 as fast as possible.\n\nIt was impossible to know the state of the cables on the ocean floor, so like\nforensic investigators, Hirai and the other engineers had to work with the\nsparse facts available. By having the cable landing stations on either side of\nthe ocean beam light down their end of the line and time the reflections back,\nthey were able to locate the faults nearest to them within a few meters. Most\nof the faults lay in deep water, in the canyons channeling into the Japan\nTrench. This, plus the timing of the faults, indicated it wasn\u2019t the quake\nthat broke them but the underwater avalanches it triggered.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed in 150 years... The Victorians did it that way and we\u2019re\ndoing it the same way.\u201d\n\nSubmarine landslides are awesome events whose existence was only discovered in\nthe 1950s, when scientists analyzed the timing of 12 cable faults that severed\ncommunication between Europe and North America two decades earlier. Before\nthen, according to oceanographer Mike Clare, \u201cIt was assumed that deep water\nwas boring and nothing happens down there.\u201d In fact, the ocean floor is riven\nwith mountains and canyons that experience avalanches that dwarf anything\nfound on land, cascades of sediment and debris racing for hundreds of miles.\nHirai had dealt with them in Taiwan in 2006, one of the most notorious events\nin the annals of cable repair.\n\nOn December 26th, an earthquake dislodged sediment on Taiwan\u2019s southern coast\nand sent it rushing 160 miles into the Luzon Strait, one of several global\ncable chokepoints. Nine cables were severed and Taiwan was knocked almost\nentirely offline. Banking, airlines, and communications were disrupted\nthroughout the region. Trading of the Korean won was halted. The cables,\nburied under mountains of debris, were nearly impossible to find. It took 11\nships, including the Ocean Link, nearly two months to finish repairs.\n\nOften in a multi-cable disaster like the Taiwan earthquake, every ship in the\nregion comes to assist. But with Japan, there was an unprecedented\ncomplication: the majority of the faults were located offshore of the ongoing\nnuclear meltdown at Fukushima. Ship operators deemed assistance too risky,\nwhich meant that, for the time being, the Ocean Link was on its own.\n\nThe crew felt not only duty bound to work but uniquely capable of doing so.\nThey had dealt with radiation before, though not at this scale. In 1993,\nshortly before the Ocean Link was to lay a cable linking Japan, Korea, and\nRussia, they learned the Soviets had dumped radioactive waste in the ocean\nalong the planned route. With some trepidation, KCS proceeded with the job.\nThey bought Geiger counters and protective gear, flew in nurses from the US\nwith chemical weapons training, and scanned the water for radiation as they\nwent. When none was detected, they put the gear in storage.\n\nNow, as they readied the ship for departure, an employee was dispatched to the\ndepot to find the old radiation gear. A local university donated a few more\nsensors and trained the crew on how to use them.\n\nThey decided to begin with the same cable they had just finished repairing\nwhen the earthquake struck. On a drizzling afternoon eight days after\nreturning to port, with smoke still rising from the Fukushima power plant, the\nOcean Link set back out to sea.\n\nToTo the extent he is remembered, Cyrus Field is known to history as the\nperson responsible for running a telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean,\nbut he also conducted what at the time was considered an equally great\ntechnical feat: the first deep-sea cable repair.\n\nField, a 35-year-old self-made paper tycoon, had no experience in telegraphy \u2014\nwhich helps explain why, in 1854, he embarked on such a quixotic mission.\nThough small bodies of water like the English Channel had been bridged by\ntelegraph, failure was routine and costly. Cables shorted out, snapped under\ntension, snagged on rocks, were sliced by anchors, twisted by currents,\ntangled around whales, attacked by swordfish, and devoured by a \u201cmiserable\nlittle mollusc\u201d called the Teredo worm with an appetite for jute insulation.\n\nField fared no better. Twelve years after he began, he had endured severed\ncables, near sinkings, and had one \u201csuccess\u201d: a cable laid in 1858 that\nprompted celebrations so enthusiastic that revelers set fire to New York City\nHall. The cable failed weeks later.\n\nField tried again seven years later only for the cable to snap halfway across\nthe Atlantic. The next year, he set out yet again, promising not only to\nfinally lay a working transatlantic cable but to recover the broken cable and\nfinish that one, too.\n\nBy that time, a crude method had been developed for fixing cables in shallow\nwater. A ship would drag a hooked grapnel anchor across the seafloor, until,\nlike the tremor of a fishing line, increasing tension showed they\u2019d caught the\ncable, which they would then haul on board to fix. Field\u2019s plan was basically\nthis but bigger: bigger hooks, stronger rope, more powerful winding engine,\nall aboard the largest ship afloat, a passenger liner called the SS Great\nEastern that had been retrofitted for the mission. William Thomson, the\nproject\u2019s scientific adviser and the future Lord Kelvin, did the math and\ndeemed it feasible.\n\n\u201cWhen it was first proposed to drag the bottom of the Atlantic for a cable\nlost in waters two and a half miles deep, the project was so daring that it\nseemed to be almost a war of the Titans upon the gods,\u201d wrote Cyrus\u2019 brother\nHenry. \u201cYet never was anything undertaken less in the spirit of reckless\ndesperation. The cable was recovered as a city is taken by siege \u2014 by slow\napproaches, and the sure and inevitable result of mathematical calculation.\u201d\n\nHumans continue to be by far the single greatest threat to cables\n\nField\u2019s crew caught the cable on the first try and nearly had it aboard when\nthe rope snapped and slipped back into the sea. After 28 more failed attempts,\nthey caught it again. When they brought it aboard and found it still worked,\nthe crew fired rockets in celebration. Field withdrew to his cabin, locked the\ndoor, and wept.\n\nCable repair today works more or less the same as in Field\u2019s day. There have\nbeen some refinements: ships now hold steady using automated dynamic\npositioning systems rather than churning paddle wheels in opposite directions,\nand Field\u2019s pronged anchor has spawned a medieval-looking arsenal of grapnels\n\u2014 long chains called \u201crennies,\u201d diamond-shaped \u201cflat fish,\u201d spring-loaded six-\nblade \u201cson of sammys,\u201d three-ton detrenchers with seven-foot blades for\ndigging through marine muck \u2014 but at its core, cable repair is still a matter\nof a ship dragging a big hook along the ocean floor. Newfangled technologies\nlike remotely operated submersibles can be useful in shallow water, but beyond\n8,000 feet or so, conditions are so punishing that simple is best.\n\n00 ft\n\nEuphotic (Sunlight) zone\n\n656 ft\n\nDysphotic (Twilight) zone\n\n3,280 ft\n\nBathypelagic (Midnight) zone\n\n13,123 ft\n\nAbyssopelagic (abyssal) zone\n\n19,685 ft\n\nHadopelagic (hadal) zone\n\nA schematic view of the ocean depths, with the Ocean Link at the surface.

Travelling further, the Abyssopelagic (abyssal) zone\nstarts at 13,123 ft, and features a couple of weird fish and cephalopods.\nFinally, the cable terminates in a grapnel in the Hadopelagic (hadal) zone at\n19,685 ft. It has hooked its target.\n\nThe deepest repair the Ocean Link conducted in the aftermath of the 2011\nearthquake was 6,200 meters (20,340 feet).\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed in 150 years,\u201d said Alasdair Wilkie, chair of the Atlantic\nCable Maintenance & Repair Agreement (ACMA). \u201cThe Victorians did it that way\nand we\u2019re doing it the same way. I just think it\u2019s one of those things that,\nif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\nNor have the causes of faults changed in the last century and a half. The\nfirst submarine cable, strung across the English Channel in 1850, survived for\na single day before \u2014 in what may be apocryphal cable industry slander \u2014 a\nFrench eel fisherman accidentally hooked it, sliced off a piece, and came\nashore bragging about his discovery of a new type of metal seaweed. In his\nhistory of global telecommunications, How the World Was One, Arthur C. Clarke\ndeclared this the first blow in a war between cable companies and other users\nof the sea that has continued to this day.\n\nLoading ...\n\nLoading ...\n\nLoading ...\n\nA sketch of the Ocean Link from the foredeck transitions into a video of the\nship in port.\n\nHumans continue to be by far the single greatest threat to cables. Fishing\naccounts for about 40 percent of faults, according to the International Cable\nProtection Committee (ICPC). Bottom trawling, particularly as it extends into\nnew regions and deeper water in pursuit of depleting fish stocks, is\nespecially damaging. Last year, Chinese fishing vessels severed cables to one\nof Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands, triggering an international incident. (Severing\nTaiwan\u2019s cables is one of the first moves in war games of a Chinese siege.)\nThe year before, trawlers cut multiple cables off the coast of Scotland,\nknocking several islands offline. Dragged anchors from cruise ships, cargo\nvessels, and pleasure boats are another common culprit. Last year, an\nimproperly moored mega yacht knocked out all communication for the Caribbean\nisland of Anguilla.\n\nOne thing that is not a threat to cables, many in the industry are eager to\nemphasize, is sharks. The idea that sharks eat submarine cables \u2014 repeated in\nnews stories and even some government reports \u2014 stems from an incident in the\nlate 1980s when AT&T was testing one of the first subsea fiber optic cables\noff the coast of the Canary Islands. The cable kept suffering mysterious\nfaults, and when a repair ship hauled it up, teeth were found embedded near\nthe breaks. A study was launched. Bell Labs scientists measured jaw radii and\nbite strength and, at one point, tried to feed captured sharks samples of\ncable. The culprit turned out to be a deepwater crocodile shark, possibly\nattracted to the electromagnetic field emitted from the power repeaters.\n\nWrapping cables in metal tape seems to have solved any shark problems.\nNevertheless, when an old YouTube video of a shark biting a cable went viral\nin 2014, it incited global news coverage. The ICPC issued a statement (\u201cSharks\nare not the nemesis of the internet \u2014 ICPC findings\u201d) saying that it didn\u2019t\neven look like a data cable, fish bites haven\u2019t caused a fault in many years,\nand that humans are almost always to blame. Yet the myth endures, possibly\nbecause there is something satisfying about the idea of the modern world being\nbrought down by the appetites of a prehistoric creature, and possibly because\nthe idea of sharks eating the internet seems only slightly less improbable\nthan the internet consisting of tubes on the bottom of the sea.\n\nOnOn March 22nd, with the world\u2019s attention fixed on the crisis at Fukushima,\nthe Ocean Link reached its worksite 160 miles to the south. They had chosen\none of the faults farthest from the meltdown, but the winter wind was blowing\nfrom the north and the crew remained inside the ship until it was deemed safe\nto go outside.\n\nAs the chief engineer and one of the oldest members of the crew, Hirai felt it\nwas his duty to perform the radiation checks. He pulled on the slick yellow\ncoveralls and boots, strapped on a mask and goggles, and opened the heavy\nsteel door leading to the foredeck.\n\nThe sky was overcast and low, and the ship rocked on a building swell as Hirai\nwalked out onto the pocked green-painted deck and held out the wand of his\nGeiger counter to see what the wind carried. To his relief, it registered only\nbackground radiation. Next, he walked to the side and lowered a sensor into\nthe sea. Again, nothing. He would do it all again in two hours, but for now,\nwork could begin.\n\nThey spent the first day and night surveying the worksite, moving slowly along\nthe cable route while measuring the depth and current. Conditions worsened\novernight and dawn greeted them with 15-foot waves and gale-force winds, too\nviolent for delicate cable work. They would have to wait.\n\nAt the most basic level, a broken cable is fixed by patching the break with a\npiece of new cable, but because the break is miles away on the ocean floor,\nthis must be done in several steps. The first step is to cut the cable near\nthe break (often, the cable will have been damaged but not cleanly severed,\nand cables are laid with so little slack that they cannot be pulled to the\nsurface in one piece). This is done by dragging a bladed grapnel across the\ncable in a so-called \u201ccutting drive.\u201d The ship then swaps the bladed grapnel\nfor a hooked one and catches one end of the severed cable, hoists it to the\nsurface, and attaches it to a buoy. Then they catch the other cable end,\nsplice the spare cable to it, and tow the spare cable back to the first buoyed\ncable to complete the patch. The ship is now holding a working cable but one\nthat is considerably longer than it used to be. This process of bringing each\ncable end to the surface separately means that every repair makes a cable\nlonger \u2014 in deep water, by several miles. In order to minimize slack that\ncould get tangled and snagged, the loop of new cable is towed to the side of\nthe original route until it can lay taut on the ocean floor once again.\n\nThe Ocean Link had repaired this same stretch of cable five years earlier,\nwhich meant they had already added the slack required to bring it to the\nsurface, no cutting required. It should have been sitting on the seafloor in\nthe form of a 12-mile loop. If they could catch it, Hirai reasoned, they would\nsave time and \u2014 this was important \u2014 precious spare cable. Every cable ship is\nstationed next to a depot with a certain amount of spare cable for each system\nin its jurisdiction. If the Ocean Link used too much on their first repair, it\nwould take six months to manufacture and deliver enough new cable to fix the\nremaining faults.\n\nBy the afternoon, the Ocean Link was still plunging through heavy seas, but\nwith the storm predicted to pass overnight, they decided to begin. From the\narsenal of yellow-enameled grapnels strapped to the foredeck, Hirai selected a\n\u201cjamming-type sliding prong,\u201d a mace-like implement comprised of two metal\nbars studded with foot-long barbs, well suited for dragging across rocky\nseabed without getting stuck. They lowered it over the bow sheave and into the\nwater. The ocean floor was more than three miles down, and it took the grapnel\nmore than six hours to hit bottom. The Ocean Link began to move slowly\nforward.\n\nFrom this point onward, Hirai or another engineer would be in the cable\ncontrol room \u2014 an instrument-filled command center behind the bridge \u2014 their\nattention fixed on the tension meter, a circular dial set into a pale green\nwall. The retro-looking analog gauge was less precise than a digital one but\nfar better for intuitively conveying changes in tension than a jittery\nnumerical readout. The steady wavering of its arm would mean the grapnel was\nplowing through the gray ooze of the ocean floors. A staccato spike; they had\nhooked a rock. A steady rise; the cable had been caught. Part of being an\neffective chief engineer, Hirai found, was the ability to read what was\nhappening on the ocean floor from the limited information of the moving dial.\n\nAt 6AM the next day, the engineer on duty saw the telltale rise of a caught\ncable, and the Ocean Link came to a stop. They had hooked the cable on the\nfirst run \u2014 rare in an earthquake repair \u2014 and began to reel it in.\n\nThe ships are aging; the people are aging; and it\u2019s unclear where the money\nwill come from to turn things around\n\nAlmost immediately, there was a sign something was amiss. The tension was\nrising too high too fast. The cable must be pinned under debris, Hirai\nthought. He ordered the winding engine to slow lest the cable snap, reeling in\nthe grapnel at a grinding 10 feet per minute.\n\nThe morning passed, then the afternoon, Hirai suiting up every few hours to\ncheck for radiation. The drum engine continued its slow rotation. Night fell.\nHalf past midnight, after 19 hours of winding, the cable reached the surface.\n\nThe grapnel came over the bow and was illuminated by the deck lights. Hirai\nwas horrified at what he saw. They had caught the cable, but it was mangled\nunlike anything he had seen before. Hooked around one of the grapnel\u2019s lower\nbarbs, the cable\u2019s polyethylene and wire sheath had been stripped by extreme\ntension and sprang in coiled loops like Slinkys put through a dryer.\n\nIt was a dangerous situation. There was no telling how much tension a cable\nthis badly damaged could withstand. It was like a three-mile rubber band\nstretched tight from the ocean floor, being tested with every rocking wave. If\nit snapped, the grapnel would fly across the deck, killing anyone it hit\nbefore smashing into the cable engine room.\n\nThey had to get the cable off the ship, but doing so involved working closely\nwith the explosive bundle hovering, taut, above the deck. First, crew members\nlashed chains to either end of the cable to take the tension off the grapnel,\nwhich they then swapped for a version with a sharp blade at its center,\ntypically used for severing cables on the ocean floor. This done, they\nevacuated the foredeck.\n\nThe grapnel, cable, and chains were slowly lowered back over the prow and into\nthe sea, the ship maneuvering delicately to minimize any sudden changes in\ntension. Once the cable was safely beneath the waves, they released the\nchains. Suddenly, pulled tight over the blade, the cable split and sank back\nto the ocean floor.\n\nFor Hirai, relief at a disaster averted was soon followed by foreboding. The\nlandslides created by the earthquake must have been far greater than he had\nimagined, dragging the cable for miles, mangling it, and burying it beneath\nwho knew how much debris. He couldn\u2019t think how to proceed.\n\nDebatesDebates about the future of cable repair have become a staple of\nindustry events. They typically begin with a few key facts: the ships are\naging; the people are aging; and it\u2019s unclear where the money will come from\nto turn things around.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, cable maintenance wasn\u2019t a distinct business; it\nwas just something giant, vertically integrated telecom monopolies had to do\nin order to function. As they started laying coaxial cables in the 1950s, they\ndecided to pool resources. Rather than each company having its own repair\nvessel mostly sitting idle, they divided the oceans into zones, each with a\nfew designated repair ships.\n\nWhen the telcos were split up at the turn of the century, their marine\ndivisions were sold off. Cable & Wireless Marine became Global Marine. AT&T\u2019s\ndivision is now the New Jersey-based SubCom. (Both are now owned by private\nequity companies; KCS remains a subsidiary of KDDI.) The zone system\ncontinued, now governed by contracts between cable owners and ship operators.\nCable owners can sign up with a nonprofit cooperative, like the Atlantic Cable\nMaintenance & Repair Agreement, and pay an annual fee plus a day rate for\nrepairs. In exchange, the zone\u2019s three ships \u2014 a Global Marine vessel in\nPortland, UK, another in Cura\u00e7ao, and an Orange Marine vessel in Brest, France\n\u2014 will stand ready to sail out within 24 hours of being notified of a fault.\n\nThis system has been able to cope with the day-to-day cadence of cable breaks,\nbut margins are thin and contracts are short-term, making it difficult to\nconvince investors to spend $100 million on a new vessel.\n\n\u201cThe main issue for me in the industry has to do with hyperscalers coming in\nand saying we need to reduce costs every year,\u201d said Wilkie, the chair of the\nACMA, using the industry term for tech giants like Google and Meta. \u201cWe\u2019d all\nlike to have maintenance cheaper, but the cost of running a ship doesn\u2019t\nactually change much from year to year. It goes up, actually. So there has\nbeen a severe lack of investment in new ships.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, there are more cables to repair than ever, also partly a\nresult of the tech giants entering the industry. Starting around 2016, tech\ncompanies that previously purchased bandwidth from telcos began pouring\nbillions of dollars into cable systems of their own, seeking to ensure their\ncloud services were always available and content libraries synced. The result\nhas been not just a boom in new cables but a change in the topology of the\ninternet. \u201cIn the old days we connected population centers,\u201d said Constable,\nthe former Huawei Marine executive. \u201cNow we connect data centers. Eighty\npercent of traffic crossing the Atlantic is probably machines talking to\nmachines.\u201d\n\nMaintenance providers regard these changes with ambivalence. The cable boom\nmeans there will be no shortage of cables to fix, but it also means a future\nof negotiating with a handful of tech giants that can use their tremendous\nbuying power to squeeze ship operators further.\n\nMarket forces pose one challenge; geopolitics another. Tensions with China,\nincluding the increasing difficulty of getting permission to repair cables in\nthe contested waters of the South China Sea, are contributing to decisions to\nroute new systems through the Philippines and other less direct passages.\nConflict in the Middle East has the industry looking nervously at the Red Sea,\nan infamous cable chokepoint: in February, a freighter struck by Houthi\nrockets dragged its anchor across three crucial connections between Asia and\nEurope, degrading connectivity and raising the frightening prospect of\nconducting repairs under fire. The Red Sea vulnerability has in turn renewed\ninterest in an Arctic route, made potentially feasible by melting sea ice,\nthough, for years, one of the fatal flaws of this proposal has been the\nquestion of who would repair such a cable, there being no ice-capable\nmaintenance vessels.\n\nThese and other recent events, like the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosion,\nhave led governments to take a greater interest in cable security, often\nfocusing on the specter of a deliberate attack. Late last year, NATO convened\na symposium on undersea infrastructure and the future of \u201cseabed warfare,\u201d\nwhile the UK commissioned naval vessels to patrol their subsea connections.\nMeanwhile, the European Union, India, and other governments have proposed\ninvesting in maintenance vessels directly.\n\n\u201cThe amount of ships is relatively limited, and there are a number of places\nwhere it could get critical,\u201d said Christian Bueger, the lead author of a 2022\nEU Parliament study on threats to subsea data infrastructure. As part of the\nstudy, he visited a cable repair ship in Cape Town, South Africa. It was old,\nhe said, with oily, clanging machinery demanding hard physical labor \u2014 the\nopposite of the clean digital space he associated with the internet. One of\nhis recommendations was that governments figure out a way to invest in cable\nfleets rather than rely on companies focused on cost cutting and efficiency.\n\nThe situation of SubCom illustrates the industry\u2019s strange moment. The company\nhas been withdrawing from maintenance work, according to industry sources, in\norder to focus on more lucrative installations, many of which are for Google.\nAt the same time, the company is increasingly intertwined with the US\ngovernment, which waged a pressure campaign to help SubCom beat China\u2019s HMN\nTech for the contract to build a major Asia-to-Europe cable, according to\nReuters. SubCom also recently won a contract to operate the US\u2019s first \u201ccable\nsecurity fleet.\u201d\n\nLike the involvement of the tech giants, industry veterans regard this new\ngovernment interest with ambivalence. More funding would be welcome, but the\nworld of subsea cables is one of unforgiving tradeoffs, and it\u2019s easy for\nwell-intentioned policies to go awry. One often proposed solution, for\nexample, is to corral cables into protected corridors, which can make them\neasier to guard against malicious actors but also makes it possible for a\nsingle landslide to take them all out at once.\n\n\u201cDid any of us know that we went viral on TikTok?\u201d\n\nSecrecy, too, is a double-edged sword. Classifying cable locations might make\nthem more difficult to attack while worsening exposure to what is their actual\ngreatest threat: fishing accidents and other forms of human negligence.\nGreater secrecy could also heighten the tension between the industry\u2019s near-\ntotal obscurity and its need for new recruits. Ships are a relatively easy\nproblem to solve; they just take money. People take years to train.\n\nThe submarine cable world has never been particularly public. The industry is\nsmall and competitive, and cable owners don\u2019t want their cables to get a\nreputation for breaking, so they bind maintenance providers with nondisclosure\nagreements. The result is that in the rare case that a fault reaches public\nawareness, ship operators almost never talk about it. Add in national security\nconcerns, and the result is a code of silence that pervades the entire\nbusiness. (Which is also why many of the sources in this story are \u201cindustry\nveterans\u201d or other anonymous descriptors.) The industry has begun to recognize\nthat this poses a recruiting challenge.\n\nIn 2022, the industry organization SubOptic gathered six cable employees in\ntheir 20s and 30s for a panel on the future of the industry. Most of them had\nstumbled into their jobs inadvertently after college, and the consensus was\nthat the industry needed to be much better about raising public awareness,\nespecially among the young.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone saw, but during the pandemic, submarine cables\nactually went viral on TikTok,\u201d said one panelist, a young cable engineer from\nVodafone. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know they existed, and then suddenly, out of nowhere,\nthey were viral. I think it\u2019s engaging with youth and children through their\nown avenues \u2014 yes, you can have science museums and things like that, but they\nare online, they are on their iPads, they\u2019re on their phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some pretty senior decision-makers and influencers in the subsea\ncable industry here,\u201d said one audience member. \u201cDid any of us know that we\nwent viral on TikTok?\u201d he asked, to laughter.\n\n\u201cAs this panel rightfully said upfront, it\u2019s not that we have a brand\nproblem,\u201d said another audience member, \u201cwe just don\u2019t have a brand at all.\u201d\n\nItIt took the Ocean Link a month to complete its first repair. Failed grapnel\nruns, fishing gear entanglements, repeated radiation checks, and storms: it\nhad been among the most difficult repairs Hirai had faced. They continued to\nwork through the spring, but by June, they faced a dilemma.\n\nMany of the remaining faults lay 50 miles off the coast of Chiba, deep in the\nJapan Trench, where eight different cable lines passed near and sometimes over\neach other. It was a cable chokepoint, and a landslide must have crashed down\nand wrecked them all. It would be difficult to catch one without cutting its\nneighbor. Even if they could, it wasn\u2019t clear they had enough spare cable to\nfix each fault individually, with all the loops of slack they would need to\nadd to bring the cables to the surface.\n\nHirai decided the only solution was to abandon the tangled mess and lay a new\nsystem on top of it. It would mean abandoning miles of cable as well as a\nbranching unit: a 2,000-pound device that splits one cable into two different\nlines going to two destinations. But by reducing the number of loops, it would\nreduce the amount of cable required. Even then, it wasn\u2019t clear they had\nenough. They did, however, have a lot of small bits of cable they had been\ncareful to salvage during previous repairs \u2014 three miles here, five miles\nthere. With a lot of work, they could be spliced together.\n\nTakashi Kurokawa had joined KCS 12 years earlier, after hearing about the\ncompany from a teacher while in engineering school. Unlike many of his\ncolleagues who moved roles every few years, after Kurokawa learned to joint,\nhe just kept jointing. He enjoyed the way jointing\u2019s strict rules and\nstandards for success created a structure within which he could push himself\nto attain ever greater precision and speed.\n\nThe work is extraordinarily delicate. Cables must be stripped of their\npolyurethane sheaths, copper conducting tubes, wire armor, and enamel coating\nuntil the clear glass threads themselves are exposed. Kurokawa then takes a\nglass strand from each cable, cleans them in a sonic bath (touching them risks\ndamage and splinters), cleaves their ends at perfect right angles, and places\nthem inside a black toaster-sized box called a fusion splicer, their ends\nalmost but not quite touching. In an instant, the device aligns the ends and\nzaps an electric arc between them, melting the glass together. Kurokawa then\nwinds the newly spliced fiber into a metal tube called a joint box and does it\nall again for the next fiber strand. The entire process can take 20 hours,\nwith Kurokawa and his team working in shifts. Every step demands hunched,\njeweler-like focus as they seek perfect precision \u2014 not in a seismically\nisolated clean room but in the belly of a rocking ship. Each joint is expected\nto function untouched under crushing pressure for at least 25 years.\n\nTo speed matters, they decided to assemble what they could in port at\nYokohama, with the Ocean Link moored and relatively stable. Working in shifts\nover 10 days, Kurokawa and his colleagues spliced 10 joints, four repeaters,\nand a branching unit \u2014 assembling a three-part, 100-mile system from the spare\nbits of cable they had on hand. At night, he dreamed of winding cables back\nand forth between storage tanks to get at the segments he needed. On June\n26th, they tested the apparatus. It worked. They set sail the same day, with\nno estimate for how long it would take.\n\nHirai had mapped out the plan to a meticulous 23 steps. They began by severing\nthe cable running from the branching unit to Murayama in the south, catching\nthe landward end, splicing the new cable to it, and sailing northward to the\npoint where they planned to deposit the new branching unit. There, they\nattached the cable to a buoy and lowered it into the ocean. Then they were off\nto the northern cable, which they caught, spliced, and pulled back to the\nbuoy. It took 12 days to get here, and now came the difficult part.\n\nThe final splice is the most precarious moment of the repair. On the first\nsplice, the ship can pivot 360 degrees around the dangling cable in order to\nangle into the wind and waves and maintain position. But on the second splice,\nthere are two cables hanging off the prow, and the ship\u2019s maneuverability is\nfar more restricted should the weather turn foul.\n\nWith the branching unit, they had to complete two final splices \u2014 one for each\nleg \u2014 then deposit the whole apparatus to the ocean floor intact. This, the\nOcean Link crew knew, would be its own challenge. A 2,000-pound weight\ndangling for miles through the water column can do funny things. In 2008, the\nOcean Link was called to recover a branching unit that another cable ship\naccidentally dropped into the Japan Trench while trying to deploy it. With a\ntyphoon approaching, they caught the cable, brought up the unit, and fashioned\na webbing loincloth-like harness between the unit\u2019s two legs for additional\nsupport before lowering it back to the bottom.\n\nThey would again be working in deep water \u2014 nearly four miles \u2014 but what\ntroubled Hirai was the current. A powerful river of warm water called the\nKuroshio Current snakes unpredictably up from the south along Japan\u2019s coast,\nand it happened to be racing through the worksite at four knots, aquamarine\nand glittering in the summer sun. The Ocean Link would have to constantly\nadjust its thrusters to maintain position against the stream and prevent the\nbranching unit from banging against the hull as it descended. But the weather\nwas fair and the swell was light, so they decided to proceed.\n\nHirai, Kurokawa, Kobayashi, and more than a dozen other members of the crew\nassembled on the foredeck. The white-painted prow glared bright in the sun as\nthe branching unit was brought out, a metal tube with two black accordion legs\nthat tapered to slender cables. They had drilled this maneuver before leaving\nport. Clad in hard hats, the crew gingerly placed it on a metal dolly and\nstrapped it down. Hirai tied yellow webbing between its legs to form a harness\nand affixed a safety rope. Kurokawa stood by the prow, watching the unit as it\nwas rolled toward him. Kobayashi stood back by the drum engine, watching the\ncable unspool and worrying what would happen if it snapped, envisioning weeks\nof splicing plunging to the ocean floor.\n\nThe ship\u2019s thrusters hummed and moved the Ocean Link ever so slowly backward.\nOne end of the branching unit lifted off the dolly as it was pulled up onto\nthe bow sheave. To an observer, the ship would look nearly stationary as the\ncurrent flowed around it. The unit went over the top of the prow and\ndescended, hanging from its harness, until it slipped below the surface and\nout of sight.\n\nIt was August by the time the Ocean Link finished the branching unit repair.\nOther ships, deeming the crisis at Fukushima stable enough to work, had\narrived to help. Hirai sometimes advised them on the area\u2019s tricky currents\nand rugged bathymetry, but mostly, they stayed out of each other\u2019s way; the\nlast thing you want to do is tangle two grapnels.\n\nThe final repair was an easy one. They had to finish the job that had been\ninterrupted by the earthquake nearly five months earlier. They returned to the\nsite where they had made their rushed escape, deployed the submersible, and\nburied the rest of the cable beneath the sand.\n\nThe repair was so close to port that there was no time to celebrate during\ntheir return, nor was there much of a mood to do so. The earthquake had caused\nmore than 20 faults, and the Ocean Link had repaired 11 of them. It had taken\n154 days of continuous work. They had missed a time of national mourning,\nschool graduations, harvest celebrations, and the slow resumption of normalcy.\n\nAfter they docked, the crew departed for their homes. Hirai stayed behind to\nfinish writing his final daily report, then made for home as well. As he rode\nthe train back to Yokosuka, he watched his fellow passengers absorbed in their\nphones. We completed the job, he thought with satisfaction, and they have no\nidea.\n\nCreative Director: Kristen RadtkePhoto Editor: Amelia Holowaty KralesEngineer:\nGraham MacAree\n\n## More from World wired\n\n  * Congress called Huawei a national security risk \u2014 it\u2019s still in US networks\n  * How to hardwire your home without ethernet in the walls\n  * Why 2.4GHz Wi-Fi is both the savior and the scourge of the smart home\n  * Plugged in and logged on: a history of the internet on film and TV\n  * We\u2019ll always have Mario Kart: the short-lived joy of console LAN parties\n  * The fight for net neutrality is forever\n  * A history of metaphors for the internet\n  * Our walled gardens\n\nVerge Homepage\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a Vox Media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a92024 Vox Media, LLC.
