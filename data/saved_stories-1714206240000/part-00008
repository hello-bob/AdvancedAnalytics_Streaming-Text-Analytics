Not a year later, and that pack's\npowering actual cars. This year, the company has rolled the tech into an even\nmore impressive pack it calls the Shenxing Plus, a battery that not only\npushes into four-figure range territory but also charges in 600 km (373 miles)\nof range in the time it takes for a bathroom-and-snacks run.\n\nIf CATL's claim of a 1,000-km (620-mile) battery pack with 10-minute charging\nsounds familiar, that's because the battery-maker had the same specs for the\nQilin battery it introduced in 2022. So what's the big deal? The Qilin uses\nnickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry, whereas the new Shenxing Plus becomes\nthe first lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery to push past the 1,000-km mark.\n\nMore Stories\n\nAutomotive\n\nWorld's slipperiest car brings land speed record aero to the big stage\n\nMotorcycles\n\nThe world\u2019s first million dollar motorcycle?\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nBoth NMC and LFP chemistries are versions of the well-known lithium-ion\nbattery, but NMC offers superior weight-based energy density versus LFP.\nStill, LFPs have gained momentum in EV design because of their more easily\nsourced materials, thermal stability and longer lifespans.\n\nA rendering of the Shenxing Plus battery sitting below the floor of a\npassenger car\n\nCATL\n\nTypical LFP packs have an energy density ranging between 90 and 160 Wh/kg, but\nCATL claims that the Shenxing Plus surpasses the 200 Wh/kg threshold for the\nfirst time, topping out at 205 Wh/kg. That's still short of NMC densities,\nincluding the 255 Wh/kg of CATL's Qilin, meaning the 1,000-km Plus pack will\nweigh more for the same capacity, but it's a brilliant achievement that\npromises to bring together some best-of-both-worlds attributes.\n\nCATL explains that it achieves its superior energy density with a mix of new\nmaterials and structure, relying on a 3D honeycomb-shaped material for the\nanode and granular gradation technology for the cathode. In addition to\nimproving energy density, the 3D honeycomb material controls volume expansion\nduring charge and discharge cycles. A single-piece cell casing the company\ncalls an industry first optimizes internal space utilization to help achieve\nthe new energy density high.\n\nEven 1,000-km battery packs need to be recharged eventually, and the Shenxing\nPlus shines there, too. It offers even faster charging than the original\nShenxing, zapping in 600 km of range in an estimated 10 minutes \u2013 in other\nwords, that's 1 km per second of charge time.\n\nCATL credits that groundbreaking charging speed to a fast lithium-ion\nconductive coating, addition of transition metal elements, and a new nanometer\nencapsulation for creating smoother, more efficient transmission between anode\nand cathode materials. Expansion of the overcurrent area ensures the heat of\nhigh-current charging dissipates rapidly and safely.\n\nCATL CTO Gao Huan introduces the extra-long-range, ultra-fast-charging\nShenxing Plus battery at Auto China 2024\n\nCATL\n\nCATL doesn't say when the Shenxing Plus batteries might find their way to\nproduction, but it's worth noting the company launched the original Shenxing\nbattery just eight months after first showing it last August. In today's Auto\nChina show presentation, it described crunching a year's worth of work into\nfour months in order to make the Shenxing a production reality for cars like\nthe Zeekr 01 and GAC Aion Y Plus.\n\nSource: CATL\n\nView gallery - 6 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.

That is cost less than other packs make it\neven better, under $55/kwh, ICEs won't e able to compete. EV MCs will never go\nfar until they have an aero faring, easily doubling, tripling range at speed.\nThere is always a need for faster charging and range depends on the EV it is\nput in. Even better and a good article would be CATL's skateboard chassis with\nthis auto, truck companies can build their own bodies on.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
