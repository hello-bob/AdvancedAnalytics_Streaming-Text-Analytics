The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections.

Frequent Hardship.\n\nComparing 30,000 years of human history, researchers found that surviving\nfamine, war or climate change helps groups recover more quickly from future\nshocks.\n\nThe city of Caral thrived in Peru between about 5,000 and 3,800 years ago. It\nwas then abandoned for centuries before being briefly\nreoccupied.Credit...Wirestock, Inc., via Alamy\n\nBy Carl Zimmer\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nFrom the Roman Empire to the Maya civilization, history is filled with social\ncollapses. Traditionally, historians have studied these downturns\nqualitatively, by diving into the twists and turns of individual societies.\n\nBut scientists like Philip Riris have taken a broader approach, looking for\nenduring patterns of human behavior on a vaster scale of time and space. In a\nstudy published Wednesday, these methods allowed Dr. Riris and his colleagues\nto answer a profound question: Why are some societies more resilient than\nothers?\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, compared 16 societies scattered\nacross the world, in places like the Yukon and the Australian outback. With\npowerful statistical models, the researchers analyzed 30,000 years of\narchaeological records, tracing the impact of wars, famines and climate\nchange. They found that going through downturns enabled societies to get\nthrough future shocks faster. The more often a society went through them, the\nmore resilient it eventually became.\n\n\u201cOver time, you will suffer less, essentially,\u201d said Dr. Riris, an\narchaeologist at Bournemouth University in England. \u201cThere tends not to be\nwholesale collapse.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tracked the history of societies by taking advantage of the\nway archaeologists tell time. Most organic material, whether it\u2019s charcoal or\nmussel shells, contains trace amounts of radioactive carbon-14, which\ngradually breaks down over thousands of years. By measuring the carbon-14 left\nat an archaeological site, researchers can estimate its age.\n\n## Uncovering the Past, One Discovery at a Time\n\n  * Ancient Pompeii: A frescoed dining room is the latest find in an excavation campaign to shore up an area of a site, which was destroyed by a powerful volcanic eruption, and better preserve it.\n  * Village Life: The superbly preserved remains of a Bronze Age settlement in Britain offer a glimpse of domestic life circa 850 B.C.\n  * A Treasure Hunter's Find: Trevor Penny was magnet fishing in an English waterway when he pulled out a rusty sword. Experts say the weapon is probably more than 1,000 years old.\n  * A Mysterious Finding: A marble Roman head from the first or second century was found buried in England. How did it get there?\n\nThis approach can also track population changes. As human groups get bigger,\nthey burn more wood, eat more food and leave behind more garbage, all of which\ncan be dated. When those groups shrink, their sites become rarer.\n\nDr. Riris and his colleagues gathered information on more than 40,000\ncarbon-14 measurements from 16 populations. They then looked at all of the\nsocieties for signs of sudden crashes and major rebounds.\n\nEvery population suffered downturns. Some lasted only a few generations, while\nothers went on for far longer. Around 8,200 years ago, the Near East suffered\na population crash and did not recover for more than 2,000 years.\n\nThe ways in which people had lived led to different rhythms of collapse and\ngrowth. Societies that had raised livestock or farmed the land grew more\nquickly, but they also became more prone to downturns. Dr. Riris speculated\nthat growing crops or tending herds of animals had made people more vulnerable\nto changes in the climate.\n\nJohn Haldon, a historian at Princeton who was not involved in the new study,\nwas struck by how many of the downturns coincided with climate change. \u201cWhat\nit tells us is that climate is our biggest weak spot,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Riris and his colleagues looked for factors that explained why societies\nin some cases suffered long, deep downturns, while others experienced smaller\ndrops in their populations and bounced back more quickly.\n\nOne feature that stood out was the frequency of downturns. You might expect\nthat going through a lot of them would wear societies down, making them more\nvulnerable to new catastrophes. But the opposite seems to have occurred;\nsocieties that experienced frequent downturns went on to become more\nresilient, experiencing less severe falls and faster recoveries.\n\nThe study suggests that societies in the Korean Peninsula, the central plains\nof China and the Caribbean, in particular, displayed an enhanced ability to\nrecover.\n\nThe pattern of increased resilience in the face of repeated stressors is\nsimilar to what ecologists see when they look at the history of forests.\nEcosystems that go through frequent disturbances become the most resilient.\nPeople are not trees, of course, and so Dr. Riris and his colleagues are not\nsure why societies also show this pattern.\n\nDr. Riris speculated that during downturns, societies learn how to survive,\nand then pass that knowledge down to future generations.\n\n\u201cThat led to innovations \u2014 or technologies or practices or behaviors or know-\nhow or traditions \u2014 being adopted that enabled them to do better the next time\nsomething bad rolled around,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, as the planet enters a climate emergency, a number of researchers are\nlooking for lessons from history. Dr. Riris was reluctant to give any advice\nbased on the new analysis. If civilization is on the verge of a 500-year\ncollapse, it won\u2019t be much comfort to know that it could have been 1,000\nyears.\n\n\u201cWe need to be clear about the success we\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Haldon agreed that it\u2019s hard to use such deep history to make decisions\nabout current policies, which tend to focus on the near term.\n\n\u201cThey may be completely correct that this is the way societies behave over\n100,000 years, but it\u2019s not going to help us at present,\u201d Dr. Haldon said. \u201cIf\nwe could plan 50,000 years ahead, we\u2019d be in a great place.\u201d\n\nCarl Zimmer covers news about science for The Times and writes the Origins\ncolumn.
