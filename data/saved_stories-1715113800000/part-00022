With the crew at the launch pad, the proper action was\nto scrub.\u201d\n\nThe next opportunity to launch Starliner on its first crew test flight will be\nFriday night at 9 pm EDT (01:00 UTC Saturday). NASA announced overnight that\nofficials decided to skip a launch opportunity Tuesday night to allow\nengineers more time to study the valve problem and decide whether they need to\nreplace it.\n\n## Work ahead\n\nEverything else was going smoothly in the countdown Monday night. This mission\nwill also be the first time astronauts have flown on ULA's Atlas V rocket,\nwhich has logged 99 successful flights since 2002. It is the culmination of\nnearly a decade-and-a-half of development by Boeing, which has a $4.2 billion\ncontract with NASA to ready Starliner for crew missions, then carry out six\nlong-duration crew ferry flights to and from the International Space Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis crew test flight will last at least eight days, taking Wilmore and\nWilliams to the space station to verify Starliner's readiness for operational\nmissions. Once Starliner flies, NASA will have two human-rated spacecraft on\ncontract. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has been in service since 2020.\n\nWhen officials scrubbed Monday night's launch attempt, Wilmore and Williams\nwere already aboard the Starliner spacecraft on top of the Atlas V rocket at\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The Boeing and ULA support team\nhelped them out of the capsule and drove them back to crew quarters at the\nnearby Kennedy Space Center to wait for the next launch attempt.\n\n\u201cI promised Butch and Suni a boring evening,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's CEO. \"I\ndidn\u2019t mean for it to be quite this boring, but we\u2019re going to follow our\nrules, and we\u2019re going to make sure that the crew is safe.\u201d\n\nWhen the next launch attempt actually occurs depends on whether ULA engineers\ndetermine they can resolve the problem without rolling the Atlas V rocket back\nto its hangar for repairs.\n\nThe valve in question vents gas from the liquid oxygen tank on the Centaur\nupper stage to maintain the tank at proper pressures. This is important for\ntwo reasons. The tank needs to be at the correct pressure for the RL10 engines\nto receive propellant during the flight, and the Centaur upper stage itself\nhas ultra-thin walls to reduce weight, and requires pressure to maintain\nstructural integrity.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n30\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
