Stop watching\nlectures and start solving real problems!\n\n### Learn by doing\n\nThe core of CS Primer is a sequence of programming problems designed to teach\nyou foundational computer science. Why even \u201clearn\u201d CS if you can\u2019t put your\nknowledge to use? This is not a spectator sport!\n\n### Feedback loop\n\nAs you attempt each problem, staged walkthrough videos can help you make\nprogress or show you a better approach. When you\u2019re finished, submit your\nsolution for feedback from Oz and other students.\n\n### Explanations in context\n\nConcepts are explained in short supplementary videos and linked precisely when\nthose explanations would help you make progress on the problems. Concept\npresented in a motivating context like this are easier to retain and apply in\npractice.\n\n### Focus on what matters\n\nInstead of teaching you frameworks or technologies you could easily learn\nabout yourself, we focus on foundational topics rarely taught outside of top\nuniversities. Subjects are mostly systems focused given their outsized\nrelevance to software engineers.\n\n### Guided by experience\n\nProblems and explanations are drawn from Oz\u2019s experience teaching CS to 1,000+\nsoftware engineers in small classes as lead instructor of Bradfield School of\nComputer Science.\n\n### Support as needed\n\nOz is available via live weekly office hours and Discord, as is the growing CS\nPrimer community of motivated students just like you.\n\n## Now live!\n\nCS Primer is now open for registration. The Algorithms and Data Structures,\nComputer Systems, Computer Networks and Operating Systems courses are all\navailable, with the remainder to be released over the coming 12 months.\n\nSubscribe Explore\n\nDear prospective student,\n\nI started Bradfield School of Computer Science in 2015 after a decade as a\nsoftware engineer and startup CTO. Since then it has been my mission to help\nsoftware engineers increase their impact, by teaching the foundational CS that\nmatters most to them.\n\nI am immensely proud of my students and grateful to have played a role in\ntheir success, but have long sought to extend my own impact beyond those who\ncould access Bradfield courses. In 2017, I wrote teachyourselfcs.com to at\nleast help self-learners find a meaningful path through the ominous maze of CS\ntopics and resources. Millions of people have found this guide useful, but\nI've always held a more ambitious goal: to provide CS learners with a self-\npaced offering that's just as effective as a live, small-class environment.\n\nI am thrilled to present CS Primer as the program that I believe will do this,\ncovering all of the topics suggested in teachyourselfcs.com, structured as a\nsequence of interesting programming problems as motivating context,\nsupplemented with all of my best demos and explanations from in-person\nteaching.\n\nGiven the ambitious scope, this has been an immense undertaking. By the end, I\nanticipate over 200 worked problems, 1,000+ explainer videos, and over 200\ntotal hours of recorded content. Having now produced around half of that, I\nhave opening up registration, and plan to continue releasing content as fast\nas you can work through it.\n\nBased on my experience, I am confident that this is the best way for\npracticing software engineers to learn CS. I hope you will try it, and agree.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOz Nova\n\nIt's difficult to express just how game-changing is the wealth of knowledge Oz\nhas bottled up in CS Primer. It's no exaggeration to say that pretty much\nevery substantial technical contribution I've made, or will ever make, will be\nbuilt on the foundations of one of Oz's courses. If you're looking for the\nbest way to get deep into CS, stop looking\u2014this is it.\n\n##### Rohan Rogers\n\nL5 SWE at Google\n\nBradfield courses have been the best educational experience of my career. The\nfirst-principles, project-oriented approach has significantly improved my\nability to make better technical decisions, articulate my reasoning, and teach\nmy peers. CS Primer offers the same experience at your own pace.\n\n##### Jake Shasteen\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer at Autodesk\n\nOz turns \"intimidating\" computer science topics into fascinating rabbit holes\nthat might otherwise seem too recondite, or complex, or somehow \"off limits\",\nfor a self-taught developer like me. His courses and teaching style help me\ntap in to the same sense of curiosity and drive I had back when I was first\nlearning to program, and I'm confident that I would not be even half the\nengineer I am today if it weren't for Oz.\n\n##### CJ Apel\n\nStaff Software Engineer at LiveRamp\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an impact in your engineering career, you should put\nthat new JS framework tutorial aside and focus on foundational computer\nscience. There's no better resource for this than CS Primer.\n\n##### Patcharapon Neranartkomol\n\nL5 Engineer at Amazon\n\nAs a bootcamp grad, I've subsequently taken a whole host of university and\nonline courses\u2014as well as self-studied from textbooks\u2014to develop the CS\nunderstanding I've needed to progress in my career. CS Primer tops them all.\nIt's the only option that combines the deep CS that's typically only taught in\nuniversities with the hands-on project oriented approach that best suits\nsomeone who's already in the industry.\n\n##### Jessica G\n\nSenior Software Engineer at Reddit\n\nOne of the major challenges in my career has been deciding how to grow. I\nfound teachyourselfcs.com to be one of the rare resources that focus on the\nfoundational systems understanding that really matters. Now CS Primer adds the\nthree things that I was missing: motivating problems, help when I get stuck,\nand a community of like-minded students.\n\n##### Bharat Agarwal\n\nSoftware Engineer at Atlassian\n\nParticipating in Oz's courses has been one of the most meaningful experiences\nin my professional life and has fundamentally changed the way I look at\ncomputing problems. I love how CS Primer delivers his excellent curriculum in\na self-paced manner that allows me to revisit challenging topics but is also\nmeaningfully cross-referenced in a way that helps to reinforce concepts and\nbetter appreciate their context.\n\n##### Antoni S\n\nEngineering Manager at Skyscanner\n\nCS Primer is the resource I\u2019ve been looking for for the past two years. You\nget practical, project-based exercises to build the kind of computer science\nunderstanding that you need to solve the more challenging problems you\nencounter as a software engineer. Not long after starting CS Primer, I found\nmyself stepping through the Golang source code to solve a problem at work! I\ncould not have imagined doing that kind of thing previously.\n\n##### Jake Gutierrez\n\nSoftware Engineer at Clever\n\nHave questions?
