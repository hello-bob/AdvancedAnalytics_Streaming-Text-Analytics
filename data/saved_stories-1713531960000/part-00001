Inverters in particular are subject to a high thermal load,\nwhich is why they have to be actively cooled. In the Dauerpower project,\nFraunhofer IZM is working with project partners from the automotive industry\nto develop an electric inverter that can work at a lower operating temperature\nthanks to optimized cooling management, resulting in a lower power loss. In\naddition to longer full-load utilization, the required semiconductor area can\nalso be reduced as a result, which can further decrease the costs of the\nelectric mobility transition.\n\n\u00a9 Fraunhofer IZM\n\nModel of the inverter prototype.\n\n\u00a9 Fraunhofer IZM\n\nEfficient powertrains for electric vehicles are of great importance in driving\nforward the phase-out of fossil fuels, but the performance of these\npowertrains strongly depends on the thermal properties of the installed\ncomponents. In addition to the battery and motor, the thermal performance of\nthe inverter is particularly important for the highest possible efficiency: It\nconverts the direct current from the battery in the alternating current\nrequired by electric motors and supplies the entire drive unit with energy.\n\nIn cooperation with Porsche and Bosch, Fraunhofer IZM is now developing a\ncompact three-phase drive inverter with a high continuous output of 720\nkilowatts or 979 horsepower and a rated current of 900 amperes. Eugen Erhardt,\nhead of the project at Fraunhofer IZM, assesses the performance of the new\nsystem: \u201cCompared to existing silicon-based inverters, our approach achieves\nan increase in performance of between 20% and 30%.\u201d The researchers achieved\nthis increase in power density through the thermal optimization of advanced\nmaterials and optimized embedding processes in production. Erhardt's group had\nalready dealt with these in the SICefficient predecessor project.\n\n### Transistors made of heat-resistant silicon carbide\n\nTo prevent the passive components of an inverter, such as capacitors and\ncopper elements, from being damaged by heat build-up, conventional systems\nthrottle their maximum output in continuous operation. This process is also\nknown as \u201cderating\u201d: Chips made of silicon carbide allow a smaller cooling\nsurface while maintaining the same performance, which means that semiconductor\nmaterial can be saved compared to silicon chips, as more optimum cooling is\nprovided.\n\nThe system developed by Fraunhofer IZM uses modern silicon carbide\ntransistors, which are more efficient and more temperature-resistant than pure\nsilicon. Two of these silicon carbide transistors are applied directly to a\nceramic substrate at Fraunhofer IZM using an innovative prepackaging process.\nThese prepackages can then be flexibly embedded in conventional PCBs. Thanks\nto the thin design and a reduction in the materials required, less mechanical\nstress and more uniform deformation behavior occurs in case of heat exposure.\nIn addition, the segmented ceramic substrates make optimum use of the limited\nspace available to best meet the specific requirements of the automotive\nindustry.\n\n### Copper cooling elements from the 3D printer\n\nIn addition to the optimized materials, the researchers also looked at how to\ncool the individual components more efficiently. The better the cooling\neffect, the less expensive semiconductor material is required, as the chips\ncan be arranged even more compactly. The researchers' aim is to achieve a high\nlevel of thermal integration of the various semiconductor elements, as well as\npassive components such as capacitors and copper conductors. For this purpose,\nthe temperature-critical components are connected directly to the cooling\nsystem via silver sintered connections and thermally integrated in the best\npossible way: Thanks to a parallel arrangement, the cooling liquid reaches all\nheat sinks and connected semiconductor elements simultaneously, and the\nthermal energy is dissipated evenly. Copper is also being used for the first\ntime in a 3D printing process to manufacture the cooling elements, allowing\nthe excellent thermal conductivity of copper to be combined with the full\nflexibility of 3D printing, instead of only being able to access aluminum heat\nsinks as before. Compared to CNC milling processes, 3D printing allows a great\ndeal of freedom with regard to the design of the cooling channel and, in turn,\noptimum utilization of the limited installation space.\n\n### High modularity of the prototype\n\nIn addition to advances in materials and production processes, the scientists\nwere also able to achieve greater modularity of the individual elements for\nthe prototype. While the concept envisaged in the previous project was still\nbased on a solution in which all components were permanently connected to each\nother, the elements of the inverter can now be replaced and repaired more\neasily as sub-modules. As a result, electric vehicles can be produced even\nmore resource-efficiently and can also be operated longer. Especially in a\nresource-critical industry such as the automotive industry, low material costs\nare an important factor in being able to manage the energy transition cost-\neffectively.\n\nFollowing a simulation phase, the prototype is currently under construction\nand will ultimately undergo an extensive testing process at Porsche AG in\norder to one day find its way into series production. The Dauerpower project\nwas successfully launched in 2021 and received funding of EUR 1.2 million from\nthe German Federal Ministry of Economics under the reference number 19I21023C.\nIn addition to Fraunhofer IZM, other project partners include Porsche AG and\nRobert Bosch GmbH.\n\n## Download\n\n  * PR - Dauerpower [ PDF 0.16 MB ]\n\n  * Download center - images in print quality\n\nLast modified: April 18, 2024\n\nKey Research Areas\n\n### SiCefficient: increase of efficiency and range\n\nThe use of SiC semiconductors in drive inverters is becoming increasingly\npopular.
