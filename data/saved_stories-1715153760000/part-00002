Creating such\n> complex structures combining soft and rigid features and actuating them with\n> artificial muscles would further our understanding of natural kinematic\n> structures. We printed a biomimetic hand in a single print process comprised\n> of a rigid skeleton, soft joint capsules, tendons, and printed touch\n> sensors. We showed it's actuation using electric motors. In this work, we\n> expand on this work by adding a forearm that is also closely modeled after\n> the human anatomy and replacing the hand's motors with 22 independently\n> controlled pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). Our thin, high-strain (up to\n> 30.1%) PAMs match the performance of state-of-the-art artificial muscles at\n> a lower cost. The system showcases human-like dexterity with independent\n> finger movements, demonstrating successful grasping of various objects,\n> ranging from a small, lightweight coin to a large can of 272g in weight. The\n> performance evaluation, based on fingertip and grasping forces along with\n> finger joint range of motion, highlights the system's potential.\n\nSubjects:| Robotics (cs.RO)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.19077 [cs.RO]  \n(or arXiv:2404.19077v1 [cs.RO] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.19077arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Thomas Jakob Konrad Buchner [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 19:44:00\nUTC (15,590 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Replicating Human Anatomy with Vision\nControlled Jetting -- A Pneumatic Musculoskeletal Hand and Forearm, by Thomas\nBuchner (1) and 11 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.RO\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
