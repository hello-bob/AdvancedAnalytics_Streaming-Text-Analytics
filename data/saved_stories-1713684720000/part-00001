The problem was in deciding which ones; even with\nsomething as unimportant as a t-shirt, it can be hard to decide to let go.\nNonetheless it seemed to me that, given any two shirts, I could easily say\nwhich I\u2019d prefer to keep.\n\nSo the problem was one of finding a ranking based on either-or choices. This\nput me in mind of the film The Social Network, in which Mark Zuckerberg takes\nan algorithm designed for rating chess players, and uses it to build a website\nallowing visitors to rate the \u2018hotness\u2019 of female Harvard students.\n\nWhen watching the film, I assumed this was artistic license on the part of the\nwriters, but it turns out that no, FaceMash was a real thing, and it seems\nlike Mark Zuckerberg is actually that much of a douche (or at least was while\nat university).\n\nAnyway, it seemed to me that if I could have my own local FaceMash-like image\nrater, I could just take a quick photo of each of my t-shirts, load them all\nin, and vote for a while until a clear ranking was established. Then I could\njust get rid of the lowest ranked t-shirts until I had the number I wanted.\n\nThere are a lot of public sites that do Elo rating for photos (many of them\nevery bit as creepy as Zuckerberg\u2019s original), but cursory googling revealed\nno simple desktop systems to do the same job, so I decided to write my own.\nIt\u2019s called elosort, and you can get it from github right now.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nUsing the tool is pretty simple. You run elosort in the directory containing\nthe images. This starts a little webserver, serving a site that you can look\nat by pointing your browser at http://localhost:8080. The page is basically\njust two photos from the directory, side by side. Click the one you like more\n(or use the left and right arrow keys if you prefer), and elosort registers\nthe vote and displays two more photos to compare. It stores the calculated\nratings in an sqlite3 database file (called .elosortdb.sql3), and you can look\nat the rankings at http://localhost:8080/results. That\u2019s it - it\u2019s simple, and\nugly as hell, but it works.\n\nI sat there re-watching The Social Network and idly playing 'hot or not\u2019 with\nmy t-shirt photos, and by the time the film was done, I had a nice stable\nranking, and I could get rid of the lowest rated. Now I only have t-shirts\nthat I really like - t-shirts that have proven themselves in single combat.\n\nTo be honest I really doubt I had to keep at it for the whole duration of a\nfilm, but there\u2019s something kind of mesmerising about rating things in this\nway that means you don\u2019t really notice time passing while you\u2019re doing it.\n\n## Other uses\n\nThis oddly addictive property makes elosort useful for much more than just\nsorting t-shirts. It\u2019s great for basically any collection of files that you\nmight enjoy browsing through at random, but that you might also want sorted by\nquality; it lets you sort them by quality by browsing through them at random.\n\nI elosorted a load of my holiday photos - it\u2019s pretty fun to look over old\nphotos, and as a nice side-effect, they\u2019re now on the way to being sorted by\nquality. I mean, how often do people actually look through their holiday\nphotos? I basically never do, and maybe that\u2019s partly because the good ones\nare buried under all the mediocre ones. elosort attacks both sides of the\nproblem, by making it more fun to browse them at random, and simultaneously\nsorting them so you can browse them not-at-random.\n\nDo you have a rarely-looked-at directory of funny images downloaded from the\ninternet? Elosort it!\n\n## Future uses\n\nRight now elosort only handles images, but I\u2019d like to extend it to other file\ntypes. For example, for the last few years I\u2019ve kept a diary in the form of a\nload of plaintext files, one for each day. I sometimes like to read these at\nrandom, \u201cflipping through the pages\u201d as it were, and reading my thoughts from\nrandom days in my past. Some entries are a straightforward account of a fairly\nuninteresting day, others capture important events, interesting ideas, or the\nfirst thing that I ever wrote about a person who grew to be a big part of my\nlife. When I\u2019m randomly browsing my diary, why not be sorting it by\ninterestingness at the same time?\n\nWhat else might elosort work for? Videos? Music? Bookmarks? Try it out and let\nme know what you think!\n\n0 Comments\n\n", "frontpage": false}
