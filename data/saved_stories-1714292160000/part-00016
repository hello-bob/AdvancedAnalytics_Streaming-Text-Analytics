The announcement was made at the 2024 Zhongguancun Forum\nin Beijing, where they tried to position Vidu as a strong competitor to\nOpenAI's Sora.\n\nLike Sora, Vidu is capable of producing 16-second clips at 1080p resolution.\nVidu is based on a Universal Vision Transformer (U-ViT) architecture, which\nthe company says allows it to simulate the real physical world with multi-\ncamera view generation. This architecture was reportedly developed by the\nShengshu Technology team in September 2022 and as such would predate the\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) architecture used by Sora.\n\nAccording to the company, Vidu can generate videos with complex scenes\nadhering to real-world physics, such as realistic lighting and shadows, and\ndetailed facial expressions. The model also demonstrates a rich imagination,\ncreating non-existent, surreal content with depth and complexity. Vidu's\nmulti-camera capabilities allows for the generation of dynamic shots,\nseamlessly transitioning between long shots, close-ups, and medium shots\nwithin a single scene.\n\nThe company, in its demo, attempted to recreate similar scenes that were\npreviously shared by OpenAI during the release of Sora. And while Vidu is an\nimpressive accomplishment and a testament to China's rapid progress in AI\nresearch, a side-by-side comparison with Sora reveals that the generated\nvideos are not at Sora's level of realism. The output, while impressive, falls\nshort in terms of visual fidelity. Don't take my word for it, here are some\nexamples from Sora:\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the temporal consistency achieved\nby Vidu is commendable, and this technology has the potential for further\nrefinement and improvement over time.\n\n### Subscribe to Maginative Plus\n\nGet smarter about the most important stories in AI with insightful commentary\nand analysis of the strategy, business, and impact of AI\n\nSubscribe\n\n### AI Workshops and Training\n\nLevel up your own knowledge and skills, or empower your teams with our AI\nadvisory and training solutions.\n\nLearn More\n\n### Recent Articles\n\nRobotics China\n\n## Stardust Intelligence's Impressive S1 Robot Demo Raises Eyebrows\n\nBy Chris McKay \u2022 Apr 26, 2024\n\nApple\n\n## Apple Reopens Talks with OpenAI for iOS 18 AI Features\n\nBy Chris McKay \u2022 Apr 26, 2024\n\nGoogle\n\n## Google Invests $3 Billion in U.S. Data Centers, Launches $75 Million AI\nOpportunity Fund\n\nBy Richard Banfield \u2022 Apr 26, 2024\n\nRobotics\n\n## Sanctuary AI Unveils 7th Generation Phoenix Robot with Advanced AI and\nHardware Upgrades\n\nBy Richard Banfield \u2022 Apr 26, 2024\n\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.
