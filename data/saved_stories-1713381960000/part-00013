As leading economies\naround the world race to install more and more renewable energy production\ncapacity, the nature of our energy landscape is changing, and the grid will\nneed significant advances and infrastructural supports to keep up. One of\nthese key supports is energy storage, which can manage and even out the\nvariable flow of renewable energy to and from the grid. Due to its central\nrole in energy security in an increasingly decarbonized world, the energy\nsecurity sector could double in size over the course of 2024.\n\nThe majority of energy storage is currently accomplished with the use of\nlithium-ion batteries, but there are a few problems with the wide-scale\nemployment of this technology. First, lithium is a highly sought-after finite\nresource that is yielding an increasingly negative environmental and health\nimpact in the places where it is mined. Moreover, it\u2019s an essential component\nof electric vehicle batteries and photovoltaic solar panels, meaning that\ncompetition over lithium resources is already fierce and heating up. A 2023\nreport from Popular Mechanics estimates that \u201can electrified economy in 2030\nwill likely need anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes of lithium.\u201d For\nreference, \u201cin 2021, the world produced only 105\u2014not 105,000\u2014tonnes.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, lithium-ion batteries just aren\u2019t great at\nstoring energy. They can only hold onto excess renewable energy production for\na matter of hours, when what the sector really needs is months or even years\nof storage capability. As such, there is a huge gap \u2013 and therefore a huge\nopportunity \u2013 in the energy storage market, and researchers around the world\nare rushing to fill it.\n\nWhile energy storage development is still in early stages, it\u2019s set to be a\nwildly lucrative industry, and has been touted as \u201cthe technology that will\ncash the checks written by the renewable energy industry,\u201d according to law\nfirm Morgan Lewis. As the renewable energy sector grows, the firm anticipates\nthat energy storage capacity will balloon by a factor of 15 by 2030.\nAccordingly, lots of research and development dollars are currently being\npoured into discovering the future of long-term energy storage, and many\nelegant and innovative solutions have been proposed. But so far, none have\nachieved employment at a commercial scale.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe long-term energy storage solutions that are currently emerging represent a\nvast range of technologies, from futuristic green hydrogen schemes to some of\nthe simplest and most prehistoric tools: pulleys, weight, and gravity. And\nnow, thermal batteries are the hottest new thing in energy storage startups.\nHeat already provides over 50% the total industry energy demands, but has been\nrelatively overlooked as an energy storage alternative. But its deployment\ncould be relatively rapid and simple, as it depends not on rare earth metals\nbut on comparatively accessible and abundant resources such as salt, air, and\nbricks, all of which are excellent at retaining thermal energy.\n\nRelated: Cesium Wars: China and America Battle for the Future of Big Tech\n\n\u201cThermal energy storage has the potential to greatly contribute to\ndecarbonizing global heat and power, while helping to ensure the energy system\noperates affordably, reliably, and efficiently,\u201d states a 2022 report from\nglobal management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. The affordability factor\nis huge. McKinsey estimates that the operational cost of a heat pump with\nthermal storage is only $15-$25 per megawatt hour. By comparison, energy\nstorage through producing steam heat from hydrogen costs $65-$100 per megawatt\nhour and gas with carbon capture and storage costs $45-$55.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe biggest challenge facing thermal energy storage is lack of publicity in a\ncrowded and noisy market. The McKinsey report identifies raising awareness\namongst industry leaders as the key bottleneck for industrial-scale thermal\nenergy storage deployment. Many startups are already successfully storing\nenergy in molten salt, compressed air, and bricks, technologies which could be\nadopted practically anywhere at any time. Crucially, thermal energy storage\n\u201ccould be among the most cost-effective routes to decarbonization of heating\nif applied at scale, while also providing stability and resilience for heat\nand power sectors as they transition to net-zero.\u201d\n\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Breakthrough in OLED Technology Could Revolutionize Tech Displays\n  * Afghanistan's Qosh Tepa Canal Project Faces Scrutiny After Water Leak\n  * The Next Gold Rush: Lithium Surge Creates New Investment Opportunities\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\nFACEBOOK Twitter GOOGLE+ LINKEDIN REDDIT PRINT\n\nPrevious Post\n\nBreakthrough in OLED Technology Could Revolutionize Tech Displays\n\nNext Post\n\nThe Rare Metal Keeping Biden and Xi Awake at Night\n\n### Haley Zaremba\n\nHaley Zaremba is a writer and journalist based in Mexico City.

The batteries\nwere heavy and took a long time to recharge and they wore out after awhile.\n\nAnytime you convert heat energy into mechanical energy into electrical energy,\nthere is a significant loss with each transfer. Put that electricity into a\nbattery, or thermal storage, or into hydrogen, or into mechanical movement\nsuch as a massive fly wheel, and there is loss. While it stays in that\ncondition, there is more loss. Turn it back into electricity later on when you\nneed it, and there is more loss.\n\nBy 1903, ALL of the electric taxis had been replaced with taxis using gasoline\nmotors, because they were so much more economical and convenient. And the laws\nof the universe have not changed at all since then......\n\n### Most Popular\n\nA Rarely Used Technique Could Double U.S. Grid Capacity\n\nTriple Junction Solar Cell Sets World Record Efficiency\n\nBanks Unwilling To Finance $5 Trillion Global Nuclear Development\n\nIs Gold Heading to $3,000?\n\nM&A Fever Hits Canada's Oil and Gas Industry\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Trending Discussions\n\n  * #### GREEN NEW DEAL = BLIZZARD OF LIES\n\nPosted by JoMack\n\nAs Biden, the President of Climate Change, and Kerry, our fabulous Climate\nCzar, who just gave...\n\n  * #### The United States produced more crude oil than any nation, at any time.\n\nPosted by turbguy\n\nSo, Sleepy Joe is responsible, no? \\html\\core\\globalditor\\attach...\n\n  * #### E-car Sales Collapse\n\nPosted by markslawson\n\nThe story below, which appeared in...\n\nEXXON Mobil -0.35\n\nOpen57.81 Trading Vol.6.96M Previous Vol.241.7B\n\nBUY 57.15\n\nSell 57.00\n\n  * More About Us\n  * About Us\n  * Site News\n  * Sitemap\n  * Advertise with us\n\n  * Site info\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 OilPrice.com\n\nThe materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational\npurposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment\nadvice.\n\nNothing contained on the Web site shall be considered a recommendation,\nsolicitation, or offer to buy or sell a security to any person in any\njurisdiction.\n\nMerchant of Record: A Media Solutions trading as Oilprice.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
