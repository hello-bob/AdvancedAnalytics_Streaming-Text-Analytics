Biotech Company Says It Has The Technology\n\nBiotech company Colossal Biosciences has announced plans to bring back the\nextinct woolly mammoth by 2028. They think Yellowstone could be a good place\nfor reintroduction as the environment is pristine and isolated enough for them\nto thrive.\n\nAR\n\nAndrew Rossi\n\nApril 27, 202415 min read\n\nThis illustration generated by PhotoShop's artificial intelligence generator\nshows what it could look like if prehistoric wooly mammoths were introduced\ninto Yellowstone National Park. (Cowboy State Daily Illustration by Greg\nJohnson)\n\nIf returning the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\u2019s native species is truly a\npriority, the nation\u2019s first national park would be teeming with more than\ngrizzly bears, wolves and huge bison with prehistoric genes.\n\nThere also would be a thriving population of giant mammoths calling the\necosystem home.\n\nAnd if a group of ambitious genetic scientists have anything to say about it,\nYellowstone tourists will one day have to navigate mammoth jams on their trips\nthrough the park along with its majestic bison and bears.\n\nThat now-extinct mammoths could have a future home in Yellowstone isn\u2019t just a\nsci-fi fantasy, it could happen. But whether it should is a conundrum as hairy\nas the prehistoric pachyderms, and some scientists think that concept should\nbe kept on ice.\n\nColossal Biosciences surprised many with its recent commitment to \u201cresurrect\u201d\nthe woolly mammoth by 2028. After years of research, Colossal believes it has\nthe technology to bring back the extinct species by creating viable hybrid\ncalves of mammoths and modern elephants.\n\nBut Colossal claims it isn\u2019t doing such complex science solely to achieve\nanother scientific milestone for humanity. Once resurrected, the company hopes\nto integrate the mammoth hybrids into existing ecosystems and resume the\necological roles they filled before their extinction.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many pristine environments where resurrected woolly mammoths\ncould thrive since most of their habitat has been lost to a warming planet\nsince the ice age and human civilization over the past 20,000 years. However,\none possible place might be the 3,472-square-mile corner of northwest Wyoming.\n\n## Call Of The Wild\n\nRegarding the logistics of resurrecting woolly mammoths, Colossal\u2019s team of\nscientists and supporters have spent several years and millions of dollars\nfiguring it out. They\u2019re so confident in their success that they\u2019ve set a\ndeadline.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are currently on track for a 2028 birthing,\u201d Ben Lamm, CEO and\nco-founder of Colossal, told Cowboy State Daily. \u201cWe recently were able to\ncreate an elephant iPSCs (stem cells) that is a global, world-first\nbreakthrough and a significant step toward our woolly mammoth project.\nColossal is also in the editing in the elephant cell phase of the project and\nleveraging the knowledge gained from the computational analysis of our now 60\nmammoth genomes.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, Colossal finished assembling complete genomes for extant\nAsian and African elephants, a significant step since mammoths and Asian\nelephants share 99.6% of the same DNA.\n\nColossal intends to alter elephant iPSCs to carry mammoth DNA, then grow a\nmammoth-elephant hybrid in artificial wombs or elephant surrogates. The result\nwill be a living animal that physically and genetically resembles an extinct\nwoolly mammoth.\n\nThis illustration generated by PhotoShop's artificial intelligence generator\nshows what it could look like if prehistoric wooly mammoths were introduced\ninto Yellowstone National Park. (Cowboy State Daily Illustration by Greg\nJohnson)\n\n## A Real Jurassic Park?\n\nBut then what?\n\nLamm said the first mammoth hybrids will be kept \u201cin a state-of-the-art,\nsecure, animal-certified private nature preserve under the care of leading\nanimal care professionals and elephant specialists.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are focused on ensuring the health and well-being of mammoth calves from\ninfancy through adulthood,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we monitor their health and\nhappiness, we will be able to make more decisions about when and how to bring\nin new generations. In this special location they can be allowed to grow and\ndevelop in a safe, respectful and secure environment while preparing to\ngraduate to rewilding sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cRewilding\u201d is Colossal\u2019s ultimate goal. Lamm said the company wants its\nmammoths and other resurrected animals to function and thrive in the real\nworld, filling the ecological roles left vacant since their extinction.\n\n\u201cOur long-term goal for all of our rewilding projects is to create self-\nsufficient, sustainable populations back in the wild,\u201d he said. \u201cColossal is\nworking with numerous conservation partners, indigenous people groups, and\nagencies to develop plans for the reintroduction of our rebuilt de-extinct\nspecies to their natural habitats.\u201d\n\nThe entire state of Wyoming is within the historic ranges of mammoths. Does\nthat mean it could be within their future range?\n\n## Wyoming\u2019s Mammoths\n\nDespite their prehistoric reputation, mammoths existed in distant human\nmemory. They were roaming Wyoming as recently as 13,000 years ago.\n\nTodd Surovell is an archaeologist and director of the Frison Institute at the\nUniversity of Wyoming who has worked at the famous La Prele Mammoth Site in\nConverse County. He recently published a paper on a 13,000-year-old bone bead\nfound at La Prele, where prehistoric people butchered a mammoth carcass.\n\nFrom his perspective, the landscape of modern-day Wyoming is pretty similar to\nwhat it was 13,000 years ago. The biggest difference is the lack of giant\nmammals, like mammoths and mastodons.\n\n\u201cWhen the first people arrived, there would have been horses, camels,\npeccaries and various carnivores like direwolves, cheetahs, lions, giant\nshort-faced bears and giant ground sloths,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would have been the\nmost noticeable difference about Wyoming 13,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cBut ecologically, if you're looking at like the landscape, the plant\ncommunities would have been pretty similar.\u201d\n\nDr. Julie Meachen is a mammalian biologist who specializes in paleoecology.\nHer extensive career studying Pleistocene mammals includes excavations and\nresearch in the famous Natural Trap Cave outside Lovell.\n\nThe limestone cave in the Bighorn Mountains contains the bones of many extinct\nNorth American megafauna, including American cheetahs and lions, short-faced\nbears, camels and mammoths. Cold conditions inside the cave keep the bones so\nwell preserved that prehistoric DNA has been extracted and studied.\n\nBased on her research at Natural Trap Cave and elsewhere, Meachen also\nbelieves that the Wyoming landscape today is essentially the same as it was\nduring the last days of the mammoths. In theory, mammoths could quickly make\nthemselves at home in Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cThese are animals adapted to an open habitat,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ecosystem is\nsimilar enough to what they had back in the Pleistocene that I don't think the\necosystem itself would be an issue.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s already an elephant in the room: No woolly mammoth specimen has\nbeen found in fossil-rich Wyoming. All the mammoths discovered so far are\nColumbian mammoths, a closely related species that was considerably larger.\n\n\u201cOverall, elephants are smaller than mammoths,\u201d she said. \u201cModern elephants\nare probably about the size of a woolly mammoth, but a Columbian mammoth is\nsignificantly bigger than an elephant.\n\nWoolly mammoths didn\u2019t live in perpetually snowy environments but were adapted\nto a specific ecosystem that could get quite chilly. Woolly mammoths might\nstruggle in modern-day Yellowstone, and resurrecting the ideal environment\ncould be an even more mammoth task.\n\n  * A replica of \"Dee\" the Columbian mammoth at the Southeast Wyoming Visitor Center in Cheyenne. \"Dee,\" excavated near Glenrock in 2006, is at least 11,000 years old and one of the largest Columbian mammoths ever found.

Wooly mammoths have never been found in Wyoming, while the larger Columbian mammoths lived and roamed everywhere in the Cowboy State, including Yellowstone. (Cowboy State Daily Staff)\n\n## Steppe Back\n\nFred Lacombat is a paleontologist who specializes in cold-adapted fauna. His\nresearch has taken him across Siberia's frozen landscapes to examine the\ncarcasses of frozen ice age megafauna. He even led a team of researchers\nscanning and autopsying baby mammoths.\n\nLacombat said woolly mammoths lived in a specific prehistoric biome called\n\u201cthe mammoth steppe.\u201d This ecosystem was once the planet's largest and most\nexpansive, stretching across the entire Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\u201cThey used to live in a cool and dry climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe environment was\ncrucial for them. They used to migrate seasonally in large herds in the\nmammoth steppe and could find all the different plants that they needed to\nlive in large quantities.\u201d\n\nAt its peak, the steppe would have resembled a vast grassland covered with\ngrasses, herbs and other high-productivity plants. For roughly 100,000 years,\nmammoths shared that environment with extant species like brown bears,\nreindeer, wolves and antelope, along with extinct cave lions and woolly\nrhinos.\n\nGiven this description, there could be plenty of things mammoths would find\nfamiliar in Yellowstone. Even modern-day bison are close relatives of the\nextinct steppe bison that occupied the mammoth steppe 20,000 years ago.\n\nDespite this, Lacombat is skeptical that mammoths could find a happy, healthy\nhome in Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cYellowstone is a wonderful place for animals to live, but you can\u2019t find a\nreal steppe (environment) there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis type of mammoth steppe is not\nfound today.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the significantly hairy issue posed by woolly mammoths.\n\nWoolly mammoths were probably genetically similar to Columbian mammoths, as\nthere\u2019s evidence the two species hybridized before their extinction. But\nColumbian mammoths were considerably less hairy, an adaptation for life in\nwarmer climates.\n\nMeachen still believes mammoths could sustain themselves in Yellowstone, but\nthe long hair of a resurrected woolly mammoth would be a hot-button issue.\n\n\u201cI don't know what their temperature threshold is,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody does.\nThat\u2019s up in the air. It\u2019s unclear whether a woolly would do OK in the\nYellowstone Ecosystem, especially today with climate change. Fifty or 100\nyears ago? Maybe, but I don\u2019t know about today.\u201d\n\n## Steppe Up\n\nLamm said Colossal recognizes that its woolly mammoths won\u2019t survive without a\nthriving mammoth steppe. That\u2019s why they\u2019re working so hard to resurrect the\nmammoth and return it to the wild.\n\n\u201cThe mammoth\u2019s massive size, thunderous gait and vast migration patterns were\nactive benefactors in preserving the health of the Arctic region,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Mammoth Steppe was once the world\u2019s largest ecosystem, home to millions\nof large herbivores. And these animals were key to protecting an ecosystem so\nvast.\u201d\n\nLamm said that the total mass of plants and animals in Siberia\u2019s tundra today\nis 100-fold less than when it was a steppe. He cited the extinction of\nmammoths as the primary reason for that.\n\n\u201cThe loss of these large cold-tolerant mammoths over the past 10,000 years has\nstripped this ecosystem of the grasslands,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are mossy forests\nand wetlands, which aren\u2019t as helpful with combating rising temperatures.\u201d\n\nThat touches on one of Colossal\u2019s primary goals. Resurrecting the mammoth and\nthe steppe could be a permanent, natural solution to reducing climate change.\n\n\u201cIf the Mammoth Steppe ecosystem could be revived it could help reverse the\nrapid warming of the climate and, more pressingly, protect the Arctic\u2019s\npermafrost \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest carbon reservoirs,\u201d Lamm said.\n\nAs for Yellowstone, Lamm wouldn\u2019t say whether the first national park is being\nconsidered as a rewilding location for mammoths.\n\n\u201cWe are currently exploring many environments for potential rewilding but have\nnot yet finalized the exact locations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis rewilding planning\nprocess will take years and has to be done thoughtfully with various partners\nacross conservation, government and ingenious leaders.\u201d\n\nThis illustration generated by PhotoShop's artificial intelligence generator\nshows what it could look like if prehistoric wooly mammoths were introduced\ninto Yellowstone National Park. (Cowboy State Daily Illustration by Greg\nJohnson)\n\n## People Vs. Pachyderms\n\nWhen facing the question of a hypothetical future with mammoths in\nYellowstone, many scientists believe the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem could\nabsorb their return without much trouble.\n\nMeachen speculated the transition could be \u201ccompleted\u201d within a single\nlifetime, citing the reintroduction of wolves as a relevant, modern-day\ncomparison.\n\n\u201cWhen wolves were reintroduced in the 1990s, things went back to the \u2018normal\u2019\necosystem within 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf mammoths were left to their own\ndevices \u2014 unmolested, and this is always the caveat \u2014 I would say habitats\nwould probably be restored within 20 to 40 years.\u201d\n\nMeachen has a strong opinion about mammoths in Yellowstone\u2019s future, and it\u2019s\nnot optimistic.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a catastrophe,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't think the ecosystem\nwill have trouble absorbing mammoth, but it could have serious consequences\nfor the human environment.\u201d\n\nMeachen has studied modern elephants in the wild and knows enough about their\nbehavior to see dozens of mammoth-sized issues. Elephants are more than\nwilling to use their size and strength to get what they want, and there isn\u2019t\nmuch people can do to dissuade them.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find examples of the destruction wrought by a single 5-ton\nmale elephant, let alone a herd of multiple, multi-ton animals on the same\nwavelength.\n\nWoolly mammoths, let alone Wyoming\u2019s endemic Columbian mammoths, would make\nthat potential even bigger and badder. Lacombat estimated that a sustainable\npopulation of breeding mammoths, as was done with wolves in Yellowstone, would\nneed at least 200 animals.\n\nMeachen can already envision the absolute havoc mammoths could cause inside\nand outside Yellowstone. She believes anyone living adjacent to the park would\n\u201chave an absolute, catastrophic heart attack if elephants were going to be\nunleashed in their neighborhoods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see giant herds of mammoths stampeding through West Yellowstone,\nstomping on cars and bowling through buildings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be an\nabsolute catastrophe. You have to remember that an elephant's home territory\nis probably bigger than the park, and they probably wouldn\u2019t give a damn if\nthe boundaries were not sufficient for their roaming needs.\u201d\n\n## Double Jeopardy\n\nWoolly mammoths roamed the Northern Hemisphere until around 12,000 years ago\nwhen the Mammoth Steppe started declining worldwide. Paleontologists and\narchaeologists still debate the reasons for this decline.\n\nLacombat said it\u2019s no coincidence that mammoths and many other ice age\ncreatures went extinct once their environment began to disappear.\n\n\u201cClimate warming reduced the area where steppe mammoths could be found,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThey became isolated in smaller areas, and then it was more difficult\nfor them to have genetic interbreeding. In addition, the pressure of human\nhunting increased in certain places. These two parameters probably reduced the\npopulation, leading in the long term to its extinction.\u201d\n\nToday, the steppe is a shadow of itself. The eastern Altai-Sayan mountains of\ncentral Eurasia are cited as the closest analog to the prehistoric biome, and\nmany species that formerly lived there still exist today.\n\nThe leading theories for what caused the Late Pleistocene extinctions of\nmammoths and many other large North American mammals are climate change and\nhumans. While scientists argue over the extent of humanity\u2019s role in the\nextinction, most believe they had a significant impact.\n\n\u201cI believe very strongly that if humans had never colonized the Americas,\nthere would still be mammoths living here today,\u201d Surovell said. \u201cI believe\nthat mammoth extinction worldwide was largely driven by human hunting. This is\na very contentious topic in archaeology, but to me, it\u2019s rather unambiguous.\u201d\n\nA 2023 study of the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California, found high\nquantities of charcoal in the sediment, likely from fires caused by the\nmigration and settlement of prehistoric people. That discovery led researchers\nto conclude that human habitation, rather than hunting, was the leading cause\nof mammoth extinction.\n\nMeachen was one of the scientists leading the 2023 La Brea study. She said\nhumans were modifying their prehistoric habitat to such a degree that it\nimmensely impacted animals, particularly large mammals like mammoths.\n\n\u201cI think the major cause of the extinction was a combination of large-scale\nclimate change and habitat modification by humans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like\nthat today. Habitat modification is the No. 1 reason animals go extinct today.\nWe eradicate natural habitats today, and that was happening at the end of the\nlast ice age, too.\u201d\n\nThis perspective contributes to Meachen and Surovell\u2019s skepticism that\nmammoths could successfully and sustainably survive in modern-day Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cI can't imagine that this wouldn't present a serious issue,\u201d Meachen said.\n\u201cHumans would want to kill these things immediately, and I don't think the\nmammoths would stand a chance. It's a tragedy waiting to happen for both the\nmammoths and humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cMammoths would just do just fine (in Yellowstone) if we allowed them to,\u201d\nSurovell added. \u201cBut we allow these animals to exist. If we didn't regulate\nthe hunting of pronghorn or elk, I feel very strongly that those things would\nnot exist anymore.\u201d\n\nThis illustration generated by PhotoShop's artificial intelligence generator\nshows what it could look like if prehistoric wooly mammoths were introduced\ninto Yellowstone National Park. (Cowboy State Daily Illustration by Greg\nJohnson)\n\n## Can, But Should?\n\nDespite the informed pessimism expressed by paleontologists, archaeologists,\nbiologists and many other scientific minds in the 21st century, the modern\nworld seems poised to witness the return of the woolly mammoth.\n\nAnd even the pessimists aren\u2019t immune to the childlike enthusiasm of seeing a\nliving mammoth.\n\n\u201cSome nights when I can't fall asleep, I sit in my tent and imagine what it\nwould be like to hear a herd of mammoths walking by,\u201d Surovell said. \u201cWhat\nwould it be like to drive down Interstate 80 and see a herd of mammoths off in\nthe distance? It would be a really cool thing to go beyond imagination.\u201d\n\nMeachen described her first experience with a wild elephant as \u201cabsolutely\nbreathtaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've never had a visceral reaction to an animal like I did to an elephant in\nthe wild,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are incredible. So, I understand the feelings of\nwanting to resurrect mammoths. I understand the excitement.\u201d\n\nHowever, the philosophical boundaries of human civilization often check the\nenthusiasm for science. The ultimate issue in the debate over de-extinction\nwas queried by the character Ian Malcolm in the 1993 film \u201cJurassic Park\u201d:\nscience can, but that doesn\u2019t mean humanity should.\n\nEven in the vast Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, mammoths would still be\nconfined to the invisible boundaries erected by human civilization. In\nYellowstone National Park, their existence would be beholden to people's\npermissiveness.\n\nHumanity contributed to the extinction of the mammoths in the distant past. If\nso tempted, they could contribute to their extinction again in the future.\n\n\u201cDon't get me wrong, I would love to see a living mammoth once in my life,\u201d\nLacombat said. \u201cBut what is the goal? It will cost millions and millions to\nbring back a prehistoric species, and while I\u2019m sure it will be studied, it\nmight only become a tourist attraction. Putting woolly mammoths in an open\ncage is not something I like to think about.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com.\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n### Cowboy State Daily Video News: Monday, April 29, 2024\n\nWendy Corr7 min read\n\n### Historical Artist Recreates Images Of Wild West Wyoming In Exact Detail\n\nRen\u00e9e Jean9 min read\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEnvelope\n\n## Authors\n\nAR\n\n### Andrew Rossi\n\n#### Features Reporter\n\nView Profile\n\n## More in Wyoming Life\n\n### Casper Woman Survives Son\u2019s Suicide By Keeping Others From Theirs\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 28, 2024\n\n### Wyoming Woman Preserves Art Of Printing With 125-Year-Old, 250-Pound Press\n\nRen\u00e9e JeanApril 28, 2024\n\n### Casper Man Pieces Together Decades-Old WWII Wyoming Training Flight\nCrashes\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 28, 2024\n\n### Ghost Hunting at Wyoming's Fort Caspar\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 28, 2024\n\n## Most read\n\n  1. ### American Rare Earths Project Rejects $400 Million Buyout Offer From California Firm\n\nPat MaioApril 29, 2024\n\n  2. ### Debate Erupts Over Tour Bus Plowing Through Bison Jam In Yellowstone\n\nAndrew RossiApril 29, 2024\n\n  3. ### Casper Man Pieces Together Decades-Old WWII Wyoming Training Flight Crashes\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 28, 2024\n\n  4. ### Globetrotting Wyoming Wrangler J.B.
