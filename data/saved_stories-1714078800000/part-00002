Clark\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nCommentary\n\nAfter spending years working and living in Africa, I have learned you cannot\ntake anything for granted. Even though foreign navies and coast guards exist\non paper, that does not mean they have boats that float and work. Even if they\ndo have boats that float and work, that does not mean they have fuel or spare\nparts. Even if the boats are able to regularly operate, that does not mean\nthey put a dent in maritime crime because maritime law enforcement is only one\ncomponent of a government effectively policing its waters.\n\nIn December 2022, U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Aaron Delano-Johnson and U.S. Navy\nCmdr. Chris Bernotavicius published an article in War on the Rocks where they\nargued that the U.S. government should more aggressively confront Chinese\nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices across the globe.\nUnlike current U.S. strategies, the authors consider these practices a\n\u201ccoercive tool of Chinese statecraft\u201d and frame them as a component of\nstrategic competition. Delano-Johnson and Bernotavicius propose that the U.S.\nCoast Guard, due to the service\u2019s unique capabilities and relationships, lead\nefforts against Chinese fishers by helping partner governments to develop more\neffective maritime enforcement capabilities that ideally become self-\nsufficient.\n\nThis proposal, however, takes the functioning of other state institutions for\ngranted and fails to address the larger problems that facilitate harmful\nChinese fishing practices.\n\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in general and Chinese fishing\npractices in particular do pose significant threats to international and U.S.\nnational security. Meaningfully addressing these threats, however, would\nrequire a more robust response than what Delano-Johnson and Bernotavicius\npropose. A more effective U.S. approach should more directly confront the\nsystem of factors that prevent a foreign government from effectively policing\nits waters. In addition to maritime enforcement, two other significant factors\ninclude corruption and economic coercion. All these factors significantly\nimpact many U.S. partner governments\u2019 ability to police their waters, and\nfocusing on maritime enforcement while failing to address corruption and\ncoercion would likely result in a failure to effectively push back against\nharmful fishing practices even if the U.S. Coast Guard is able to train a\nperfect foreign counterpart.\n\nBecome a Member\n\nA Significant National Security Threat\n\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices, particularly as\npracticed by the Chinese fishing fleet, pose multiple threats to international\nand U.S. national security. These practices often lead to overfishing, which\ndepletes local fishing stocks and makes it difficult for the poorest in costal\ncountries to afford the fish they rely on as their primary source of protein.\nOverfishing depresses local fishing industries, eliminating the livelihoods of\nmany of the same people. These practices also challenge global norms and\ninfringe upon the sovereignty of any country in which they occur.\n\nThe Chinese government heavily subsidizes the Chinese distant-water fishing\nfleet, which is the largest in the world and often engages in illegal,\nunreported, and unregulated fishing. The Chinese government further aids this\nfleet by coercing foreign governments to minimize enforcement against Chinese\nvessels, and it uses many of the same fishing vessels as part of its maritime\nmilitia, which operates in waters closer to home.\n\nThe 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy mentions the necessity for U.S.\nsupport to allies and partners that \u201cstand on the frontlines of the [People\u2019s\nRepublic of China] coercion and are rightly determined to seek to ensure their\nown autonomy, security, and prosperity.\u201d Governments that suffer from illegal\nChinese fishing practices are on the frontlines of daily Chinese government\ncoercion and threats to autonomy, security, and prosperity.\n\nChallenges to Enforcement\n\nThere are many challenges that enable illegal, unreported, and unregulated\nfishing practices beyond poor maritime enforcement. Two main challenges\ninclude corruption and susceptibility to economic coercion, and both of these\npermeate through many of the countries the U.S. government wants to help\ncombat such practices.\n\nA government\u2019s ability to police its exclusive economic zone, 200 nautical\nmiles from its coastline, neither starts nor stops on the water. Before\nmaritime enforcement takes place, governments pass laws, participate in\ninternational agreements, and issue permits to regulate how fishing should be\nconducted. Should a navy or coast guard apprehend illegal fishers, a\ngovernment\u2019s criminal justice system levies punishments to disincentivize\nfurther violations.\n\nCorruption is pervasive throughout the global fishing industry and undermines\nregulation through bribes to politicians who oversee the process, officials\nwho issue fishing permits, law enforcement personnel, investigators,\nprosecutors, and judges, among others. Fighting corruption presents a\nsignificant challenge to a majority of the partners the U.S. government wants\nto engage with to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. The\nOctober 2022 U.S. Interagency Working Group on Illegal, Unreported, and\nUnregulated Fishing\u2019s National 5-Year Strategy for Combatting Illegal,\nUnreported, and Unregulated Fishing lists 57 priority countries in Latin\nAmerica, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean where U.S. government assistance\nis most needed. The World Bank assessed 50 of these 57 priority countries in\n2021. Thirty of them scored in the bottom 50th percentile for control of\ncorruption, and 17 of those scored in the bottom 25th percentile.\n\nAs an example, Ghana is one of the U.S. government\u2019s strongest partners in\nWest Africa, one of the strategy\u2019s priority countries, and scored just above\nthe 50th percentile for control of corruption, making it an above-average\ncountry. The Environmental Justice Foundation, a British non-governmental\norganization, found in an October 2022 study about the Chinese-owned fishing\nfleet in Ghana that a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d exists throughout the official\nGhanaian fishing management system. The majority of the Ghanian fishing sector\npersonnel who the foundation interviewed had witnessed corruption from port\nauthorities, members of the navy, and official government fishing observers.\n\nFurthermore, according to a January 2023 BBC story, most of the Ghanian\ngovernment fishing observers take bribes due to \u201cfear, corruption, and\nneglect.\u201d The neglect the article is referring to is that the government is\npaying these observers meager salaries infrequently, if at all, driving them\nto seek alternate sources of income to make a living and support their\nfamilies. In my experience, this form of neglect among government workers is\ncommon throughout much of Africa and often leads to corruption out of economic\nnecessity. Ghana\u2019s relatively high scores in controlling corruption make it\nlikely that corruption would pose an even greater challenge when trying to\nconfront illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in a majority of the\nworking group\u2019s priority countries.\n\nThe Chinese government adds to these difficulties, making its support to\nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing particularly acute. With the\nsecond-largest economy in the world, the Chinese government uses its\nsignificant power and influence to coerce governments into minimizing\nenforcement against Chinese fishing vessels. As Delano-Johnson and\nBernotavicius point out, one way the Chinese government does this is by\nforcing governments to choose between prosecuting Chinese fishing vessels or\naccepting Chinese aid. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no to China when they are building\nyour roads,\u201d as one former head of Senegal\u2019s Oceanic Research Institute puts\nit. Senegal is one of five \u201cflag states\u201d that the working group\u2019s strategy\ndesignates as a focus of U.S. government-to-government engagement to counter\nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\n\nMany of the strategy\u2019s priority countries are also underdeveloped, making them\nvulnerable to coercion with foreign aid. The United Nations assessed 49 of the\nstrategy\u2019s 57 priority countries in 2021. Twenty-one of them, including Ghana,\nare in the medium human development category. Eight, including Senegal, are in\nthe low human development category. These are the two lowest human development\ncategories of four.\n\nChallenges to Self-Sufficiency\n\nPervasive corruption and susceptibility to economic coercion would make it\nextremely difficult for Delano-Johnson and Bernotavicius\u2019 solution to become\nself-sufficient. They propose that the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s maritime security\ncooperation efforts be modeled after the Department of State\u2019s Global Peace\nOperations Initiative, but this initiative is also unlikely lead to lead self-\nsufficiency. Its primary goal is to help partner militaries develop forces\nthat contribute to U.N. peacekeeping operations, and the authors provide\nexamples of notable successes. The successes, however, rely on the United\nNations to pay governments directly for their troop contributions.\n\nFor maritime enforcement capabilities to reach true self-sufficiency,\ncountries need a reliable internal source of income. Some portion of this\nincome could come from governments issuing fishing licenses and imposing fines\non guilty illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishers. The governments,\nhowever, must be capable of effectively doing both to collect enough revenue\nto pay for the operations. Corruption and economic coercion undermine these\nprocesses.\n\nAn ineffective system to effectively punish illegal, unreported, and\nunregulated fishers could also create motivation and morale problems within a\nmaritime force, no matter how well-trained, further hindering its performance.\nTo paraphrase what a senior African counterpart once told me, \u201cWhy should\nmilitary members risk their lives on the high seas to catch illegal fishers if\nthey know the fishers will just be let free when they are pulled into port?\u201d\nIn other words, if the navy or coast guard knows nothing will happen to any\nillegal fishers they catch, then why should they bother patrolling their\ncountry\u2019s waters?\n\nFinally, government leaders must want to maintain a capability before the\ncapability can become self-sufficient. One adage of security cooperation is\n\u201cyou can\u2019t want it more than they do.\u201d For any maritime security cooperation\nto bear long-term dividends and produce capable maritime forces after U.S.\ntrainers leave, host-nation government and military leaders must want to\nmaintain the forces. If government leaders are gaining financially through\ncorruption or politically through economic aid, then they may have little to\nno motivation to start enforcing fishing regulations and see their income and\npolitical support disappear.\n\nA More Holistic Solution\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is the right organization to lead security cooperation\nefforts against Chinese illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing\npractices. Focusing on security cooperation without addressing the other\nissues that prevent partner governments from effectively policing their waters\nmay result in short-term success but would likely result in long-term failure.\nInstead, other agencies, like the Department of State or U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development, should lead a more holistic approach to challenge\nChinese fishing practices at sea as well as challenge corruption within the\nfishing industry and propose viable alternatives to Chinese economic coercion.\n\nA more effective U.S. approach would seek to change the incentives for enough\npartner government officials to want to effectively police a country\u2019s waters\nand maintain a maritime enforcement capability after U.S. trainers leave. Many\nof these officials would likely not be in the military, like fishing observers\nand judges.\n\nThe Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development\nspecialize in conducting holistic approaches to security issues due to their\nunique capabilities and relationships. They work with foreign governments to\ndecrease corruption and improve criminal justice systems. The U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development\u2019s specialty is economic development, which would\nlikely be necessary to provide viable alternatives to Chinese economic\ncoercion. The Biden administration\u2019s \u201cMemorandum on Combatting Illegal,\nUnreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Associated Labor Abuses,\u201d released\nfour months prior to the working group\u2019s strategy, calls on the U.S. Agency\nfor International Development Administrator to lead anti-corruption and\njudicial reform efforts as well. The Department of State works regularly with\nand funds U.S. Coast Guard and military security cooperation efforts, like the\nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative, and it has a bureau that specializes in\ntraining police and strengthening criminal justice institutions. The\nDepartment of State also recently opened the Office of China Coordination to\nmanage U.S. competition with China.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Chinese government uses subsidies and coercion to enable the Chinese\ndistant-water fishing fleet to conduct illegal, unreported, and unregulated\nfishing across the globe. These activities represent a direct threat to the\nrules-based international system, and they occur daily in multiple countries\nthat have a minimal capacity to push back and have structural governance\nissues that disincentivize them from doing so. These illegal fishing\nactivities also represent a daily threat to the lives and livelihoods of the\npoorest citizens within these countries.\n\nFor the U.S. government to more effectively push back against harmful Chinese\nfishing practices and help create indigenous, self-sustaining maritime\nenforcement capabilities, it should not focus its efforts primarily on\nmaritime security cooperation led by the U.S. Coast Guard. Instead, the U.S.\ngovernment should address the system of factors that enable illegal Chinese\nfishing practices, including government corruption and Chinese economic\ncoercion as well as maritime enforcement. A more holistic approach would\nlikely have to be led by a more holistic agency that already addresses similar\nissues, such as the Department of State or U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment.\n\nMore aggressively pushing back against Chinese illegal fishing practices is an\nopportunity for the U.S. government to highlight its global leadership in a\nway that directly defends the rules-based international order, challenges its\nmost capable global competitor, helps rehabilitate the maritime environment,\nand increases the food security and economic opportunity for some of the\nworld\u2019s poorest and most helpless people. But Chinese fishers are not the only\nones that engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and the U.S.\ngovernment should not take its own institutions and those of its partners and\nallies for granted. The U.S. government should also ensure it is effectively\npushing back against the lesser but not insignificant numbers of American,\nallied, and partner fishers who conduct the same activities. To truly defend\nthe rules-based order against all violators, the U.S. government should ensure\nU.S. fishers follow the rules, and it should be willing to defend the rules\nfrom its best friends and most fierce competitors alike.\n\nBecome a Member\n\nMichael E.
