From her bed, Danae\nMossman hears the noise building: loud romantic liaisons, vomiting, squeals,\nthe sound of bodies hitting the pool at full tilt.\n\nThings get particularly loud between midnight and 4am, Mossman says, \u201cwhen\nthey are getting busy\u201d.\n\n  * A koror\u0101, or little penguin, colony live under Danae Mossman\u2019s house \u2013 and show no signs of wanting to leave\n\nMossman\u2019s hard-partying housemates are a flock of koror\u0101, or little penguin,\nthe world\u2019s smallest, which have formed a growing colony beneath her house in\nthe Wellington suburb of Karaka Bays on the Miramar peninsula. They use her\nlily ponds for pool parties, and during nesting season, they create a stink.\n\n\u201cThey go out and get fish, regurgitate it and eat that for three days.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation encouraged the birds to move to\nspecially built nests closer to the sea, but so far they have shown no desire\nto leave. So Mossman has come to embrace her housemates, even installing a\nladder in the ponds so the penguins can clamber out.\n\n\u201cWe figured if they were happy and safe under our home, then we wouldn\u2019t want\nthem any place they were more vulnerable,\u201d Mossman says. \u201cThe most annoying\nthing about them being under the house is how loud they are.\u201d\n\n  * A makeshift ladder in a pond at Danae Mossman\u2019s Karaka Bays home helps the penguins clamber out\n\nIn many cities, forests and ecosystems around the world, the sounds of nature\nare falling silent. But in New Zealand\u2019s capital, people are experiencing a\ncrescendo in birdsong, thanks to decades of conservation efforts. Some\nspecies, such as the koror\u0101, are still at risk, but many native birds have\nbounced back in their thousands, transforming the city\u2019s morning chorus.\n\n## \u2018The dawn chorus is so loud, we have to shut the doors\u2019\n\n  * A p\u012bwakawaka (fantail) at Zealandia wildlife sanctuary in Wellington\n\nWorld faces \u2018deathly silence\u2019 of nature as wildlife disappears, warn experts\n\nRead more\n\nIn the dark, still moments as Wellington wakes and the hum of traffic builds,\nthe city\u2019s birds begin to sing.\n\nFirst comes the t\u016b\u012b\u2019s high, clear trill, slicing through the dawn. The\nmelodious bells of korimako join, followed by the p\u012bwakawaka with its kiss-\nlike squeaks. As the horizon lightens, k\u0101k\u0101 \u2013 large brown parrots \u2013 fleck the\nsky, waking residents as they swoop and screech.\n\nFifty years ago, when Jack and Jill Fenaughty bought their then bare, rugged\nfarmland in M\u0101kara \u2013 25 minutes from the city centre \u2013 they were lucky if they\nencountered an introduced bird species, let alone a native one.\n\n\u201cYou saw hardly any native birds,\u201d Jill says. \u201cNow,\u201d Jack jumps in, \u201cthe dawn\nchorus is so loud, we have to shut the doors if we want a lie-in.\u201d\n\n  * Jack and Jill Fenaughty in the bush near their home in M\u0101kara, near Wellington; Highland cattle and sheep on the Fenaughtys\u2019 farm, close to an area of bush where kiwi have been heard since their reintroduction\n\nWellington may be bucking local and international trends, but nearly 30 years\nago conservationist Jim Lynch described the city as a \u201cbiodiversity basket\ncase\u201d.\n\nLike many cities across the globe, human activity, habitat loss and introduced\npests had decimated Wellington\u2019s birdlife. By the 1990s, many native species\nwere on the brink of local extinction.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Lynch began work to found a new bird sanctuary in a patch of\nnative forest around a decommissioned city reservoir. Dubbed \u201cZealandia\u201d, it\nwould become the world\u2019s first fully fenced urban ecosanctuary. By 2000, all\nmajor predators \u2013 cats, possums, rats and ferrets \u2013 had been eradicated\ninside. As native species thrived within the fence, Zealandia worked as a\ncentre, from which recovered bird populations radiated out into the city\u2019s\nneighbourhoods.\n\n  * A view of the Zealandia reserve in Wellington this month\n\n\u201cThe first thing we noticed coming back were the t\u016b\u012b,\u201d Jack says. As if on\ncue, one calls loudly in the garden. \u201cNow, they are just part of the\nfurniture.\u201d\n\nThe pair notice once-rare native birds year-round in their garden. There are\ntwo pairs of k\u0101rearea, the country\u2019s only falcon, nesting in a patch of bush\nnearby and p\u012bwakawaka have become so numerous that the Fenaughtys keep their\ndoors shut to stop the curious birds inviting themselves in.\n\n  * Clockwise from top left: a t\u016b\u012b; a t\u012beke or saddleback; a pied shag or k\u0101ruhiruhi; and a k\u0101k\u0101 at Zealandia reserve\n\n> Birdlife used to be sparrows, starlings and blackbirds, now we have t\u016b\u012b,\n> fantails, k\u014dtare and kerer\u016b \u2013 it\u2019s truly amazing\n\nRoss Findlay\n\nThe Fenaughtys\u2019 experience tracks with the data \u2013 a 2023 Wellington regional\ncouncil report shows that since 2011, the average number of native bird\nspecies in the city\u2019s parks and reserves had risen by 41%. Between 2011 and\n2022, k\u0101k\u0101 increased by 260%, kerer\u016b by 200%, t\u016b\u012b by 85% and p\u012bwakawaka by\n49%.\n\nThe Zealandia sanctuary, it noted, was having a \u201cmeasurable halo effect\u201d and\n\u201cdriving spectacular recoveries in several previously rare or locally extinct\nnative forest bird species\u201d.\n\nZealandia\u2019s conservation and restoration manager, Jo Ledington, says the five\nmiles (8km) of anti-predator perimeter fence has meant birds can thrive, but\nthe community efforts outside the sanctuary have allowed them to expand their\nhabitats.\n\n  * \u2018Penguins crossing\u2019: a warning sign for drivers on the Miramar peninsula\n\n\u201cWellington is one of the only cities in the world experiencing this bounce-\nback,\u201d Ledington says, adding that a healthy ecosystem \u201cis more important now\nthan ever\u201d, not just for biodiversity but for people\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nPerhaps most extraordinarily, the Fenaughtys now hear kiwi \u2013 the country\u2019s\nbeloved national bird \u2013 calling at night in the hills around them. In 2022,\nthe Capital Kiwi Project, a community initiative, reintroduced kiwi to\nWellington\u2019s wilds after a 100-year absence.\n\nJill pauses when asked what it is like hearing such rare birds in her back\nyard. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe \u2013 it\u2019s just wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we would hear those out here in our lifetime,\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cWhen you hear the kiwi in your back yard, you know it\u2019s worked.\u201d\n\n## Community buy-in key\n\nA sanctuary alone is not enough to bring back a city\u2019s birds. Part of the\nsuccess of Wellington\u2019s biodiversity boom has been widespread community work\nto create a safe environment for birds \u2013 and a deadly one for invasive\npredators. Introduced pests kill an estimated 25 million native birds a year\nin New Zealand.\n\n  * A Capital Kiwi Project member prepares to rerelease a male kiwi on Tawa Hill, Terawhiti Station, Wellington, after changing a transmitter on its leg; and a road sign in M\u0101kara\n\nOn a bright Sunday morning on Miramar peninsula, 10 minutes east of the city\ncentre, six volunteers gather to check a vast network of pest traps and\ncameras crisscrossing the landscape.\n\nTrudging over the headland, Dan Henry, a coordinator at Predator Free Miramar,\nsays volunteers have managed to eliminate rats \u2013 ruthless hunters of native\nbirds \u2013 from the peninsula. The Wellington urban area alone (population\n215,200) boasts at least 50 community pest-trapping and planting groups. They\nwork alongside the government\u2019s department of conservation, Predator Free\nWellington \u2013 a project to make Wellington the world\u2019s first predator-free\ncapital \u2013 and initiatives such as the Capital Kiwi Project.\n\n  * A p\u012bwakawaka, or New Zealand fantail, follows Dan Henry, coordinator of volunteer pest trapping group Predator Free Miramar, around the Miramar peninsula\n\nAs Henry removes a dead mouse from a trap, he explains how the thriving\nbirdlife has created a positive feedback loop: as residents encounter native\nbirds in their daily life, the desire to protect them becomes more pronounced.\n\n\u201cIt was particularly evident around the lockdown. People were out walking, the\nbirds came out to play and people were much closer to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cI\nthink people saw that and [thought]: \u2018Holy shit \u2013 look what\u2019s around us,\u2019 and\ndoubled their efforts. It was quite remarkable.\u201d\n\nRoss Findlay, a retired teacher and grandfather, attends the meet-up every\nSunday morning. In his 40 years in Wellington, he has noticed remarkable\nchanges.\n\n\u201cBirdlife used to be sparrows, starlings and blackbirds, now we have t\u016b\u012b,\nfantails, k\u014dtare and kerer\u016b in our streets \u2013 it is truly amazing.\u201d\n\n  * Predator Free Miramar volunteers Sue Hope and Ross Findlay check a trap\n\nAnother volunteer, Sue Hope, agrees. \u201cEveryone notices it, not just us,\u201d she\nsays.\n\nAs the crew gather to discuss the morning\u2019s work, a rare k\u0101rearea crashes\nthrough the branches above, sending a ripple of excitement through the group.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a big city and there are these amazing birds,\u201d Hope\nsays. \u201cIt makes you appreciate you are not the only thing here.\u201d\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters\nPhoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Soundscapes\n  * Birds\n  * Wildlife\n  * Animals\n  * New Zealand\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * Conservation\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
