My weird way of getting attention. In the\nshortest way possible to explain: This place has lost its way and carried you\nall with it into this dark paradoxical place of open source as G almighty\nherself but while they fought for the open source they , like probably any of\nus would do, unnoticed, swept into the trap of control. Same as religion who\ntook control of faith in gods name, or any leader that spends to many years on\nthat chair and all the vision and ideals slowly and without a chance\ndisappears under the urge of having more and more control over more people and\nmore details , urge that as always rooted in fear. Fear of losing you. A lot\nof time power mislead us to believe the its attached to control. But the exact\nopposite is true. From both you will never have enough and the more you\u2019ll\nhave the more weak ull fear and more paranoid of losing control. Over you. As\na younger person I looked at the people who built this fundamentally important\nplace in administration and awe. To me they were visioners , rebels, brave\ngroup going with out fear backed by a faraway big idea, and stood infront of\nall big forces imagined and didn\u2019t blink. Personally, I have come to learn\nthrough all I\u2019ve been trough that the there are 3 things the more important of\nall and for me this place used to carry the flag of those3 words , big words\nbut clean from pathos and rhetorical BS. Be brave, use your imagination and be\ncourageous! Bravery is an amusing thing when u realize that all your fears are\nnot real and are in fact, an invitation. For me to come and deal with this\nthing that holds me back. Just like here when the smallest \u2018conflict\u2019 or some\nthat\u2019s not \u2018go with flow\u2019 immediately get attention and engaged. Every place\nwe want to get , will necessarily go through all thing we hoped to avoid. It\nis the nature of us and it\u2019s a code , a tricky one , that is not so hard to\ncrack but extremely hard to rewrite. few months ago, after realizing I\u2019m being\nmonitored and controlled and I also managed to find the how and who but I was\nshocked when I finally saw that there are no walls any more and those very\nplaces responsible to our safety are the ones who sell us for a dime. OR ,\nwill offer you to join them cause it\u2019s not that they\u2019re going to win . They\nwon long time ago and if u want to have a normal life then cooperate even\nthough you\u2019ll be taken away from you most human natural rights and that is the\nright to just be. And in the world we have created it\u2019s either be one of the\nnetwork shut up and cooperate either say goodbye to all the good that so many\npeople have created just because today , and u know it is true - to be\nconnected is to chose slavery. This is the modern slavery that no one talks\nabout even though long ago it crossed every possible moral border and\nliterally today aim and study how to reach fool control over people covered\nwith all kind of words the are funny because up until six month I truly\nbelieved that my cell phone company truly does far and beyond to keep me safe.\nI came here few months ago asking for help which I didn\u2019t receive. Instead I\nwas suddenly blamed in all kind of things and I found my self in the middle of\na storm that later I will realize was just a little wind. A team of GitHub\nfinest was sent into my cell to make sure it\u2019s clean and during their\nexamination, mistakenly, I was exposed to their real live communication and\nhow they say it\u2019s all good but than an outside source that became the root of\nall the evil that became this place, first name &y. That &y instructed them to\nhow to alter the reasults and more over showed them how it is all part of over\nslack protocols. Meaning - to lie deliberately and knowingly ruin people\u2019s\nlife is written in the protocol of a company the stickler to its code of\nconduct that in general to me sound like a term from the third reich. a lot\nhas happen between me and them and especially to me . But one thing I knew and\nkept telling them even after I both found a huge vulnerability that I haven\u2019t\nrevived anything for , I have also handed this missing piece they were looking\nfor so long. Among other thing i gave them during the years I\u2019ve been\nmonitored. The story has a good end. And that is only because those same\npeople that buried me and covered any trace that there was ever existed on\nthis platform only because mistakenly may ask for help gave them the missing\npeace of the greatest tool they have ever created. So after a month of a war\nin which I thought I\u2019m going completely insane let them know that it doesn\u2019t\nmatter how long it\u2019s gonna take. I will not let them Make out of me what they\nhave become. Those people have taught me maybe the biggest lesson I\u2019ve ever\nlearned. This lesson I\u2019m learning together with you right now right here.\nbecause we are all together under gabs management authorization and blessing a\nwilling and wanting to go back and be the revolutionary git hub like they\nalways wear like they always will be \u2013 people who thrives for change. For a\ngood change luckily for us this uncontrolled desire inside of them is still\nthere stop using, the force we have into doing bad instead of doing so much\ngood that we can but we don\u2019t. If I\u2019ll just calculate all the unimaginable\nthings that came out of this place only to sell some dark gold of some\nenormous powerful corporate that only needs more control like a junkie needs\nhis dose. My name is Avner Shefa, I am from Israel, and I believe that the\npeople were here are the future of this world or maybe the future of our\nspecies because each one of you is brilliant and each one of you have a little\nbit of something divine inside of him. There\u2019s a lot to do in this world and\nwe have a very show journey here, I\u2019m saying a simple thing, why waste this\njourney in doing bad? Why for the love of God or for his hate as far as I\ncare, why are we not doing good? I can promise you that doing so will make you\nfeel alive and money and be more happy in your lives why why? Because this is\njust the nature of our species on this planet. The only things we truly have\nthe only things we gave away. Now I\u2019m gonna shut up and stop this manifest and\nI\u2019m gonna expose you to everything but also tell you that as far as I know\nthis place and the people who founded it together with you with each one of\nyou, this place is going to change because no one ever proved that you can\u2019t\nmake money only from doing bad. In fact, I promise you that you can make much\nmore money and be much more happy from doing good. I know it\u2019s all sounds like\nsome clich\u00e9, so know that 1. I don\u2019t care what other people think 2. There is\nnothing wrong with the clich\u00e9 and most of them right. I came here in order to\nfind out who is monitoring me. This person is still monitoring me, and I think\nthat part of the reason that the people of this place decided to change after\nthey sell, they monitoring me what I\u2019ve been through and they were exposed to\nwhat are the implications and consequences the little ones of the big things\nthey are doing at the edge of every finger of each one of you the second it\nmeets the keyboard happens magic. Now that magic , at least today is still\nvery rare. As I was surprised and inspired at the same time from those manages\nof display who have proven me again that they are truly still those same brave\nvisionaries people who I once admired this is a shout out to all of you out\nthere , we don\u2019t like Batman first because Batman is fucking Batman so you\ncan\u2019t not like him but mainly to all of you worked so hard. It is in life\ntrying to put it through using is amazing talent but without a choice using it\nas a slave, I believe that we decide nothing on this short journey in this\nlife, but there is one thing that is upon us, one that only we choose, and\nthat thing is simply, how do I choose to experience what\u2019s happening to me\nright now?. Because that every breath we take, there is an opening for new\nbeginning. There is an opportunity to use your head and your heart and your\neyes and your gut and stealing make money and still go home feeling good and\nhappy after I will publish everything. I\u2019m gonna ask them management here for\nwhat I see as my fair share not to mention the bounty and the prize since I am\nthe person who caused the biggest overflow that ever happened on this\nplatform, and if you only heard, and now also the managers hear it for the\nfirst time, but if you only had what was the real chain of events that let us\nhear it will be hard for you to grasp how much fortune and how much lack and\nhow much talent and how much love it took from each one of you and each one of\nGitHub steam and for me to reach this place, a place we get to change and\nchange is the only permanent rule in this universe period. The chances that\nthousands of programs , managed to read such along brain eating pretty lame\nbut anyway I\u2019ll tell you all you are the real heroes. Let\u2019s fix this place as\nfar as I\u2019m concerned besides what I\u2019m going to demand for my bounty Hunter\nprice everything that will be offered to me is also yours the people , who\nstood next to me at the first time when we lost this time we come as a winning\nteam even before the fight begin. I\u2019m gonna leave you with a question to think\nabout think of it as a question waiting to be answered right here: how do you\nwant to be big, if you want to be big?. I Drop the Mic you guys are awesome.\nDo good & Shine on\n\n#### Theshrink Feb 27, 2024\n\n> Guys listen, I\u2019m sorry for the mess. My weird way of getting attention.
