Stockholders did \u2013 by a wide\nmargin.\n\n#### 02\n\nIn just five years, Elon delivered by hitting every single \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d key\nmilestone in the plan to deliver a total shareholder return of nearly 1,100%.\n\n#### 03\n\nSix years later, a Delaware Court stepped in to side with a plaintiff who\nowned just nine Tesla shares when he sued and ordered the plan be cancelled,\ndespite overwhelming approval from holders of millions of shares.\n\n#### 04\n\nUnlike most CEOs, Elon was entitled to receive NO salary, NO cash bonuses, and\nNO equity that would vest simply by the passage of time. Instead, he was asked\nto deliver the type of exponential value creation most thought was impossible\n\u2013 or get nothing.\n\n#### 05\n\nElon was also required to hold any shares awarded through stock options for\nfive years after the option was exercised, meaning that he was not only\nincentivized to achieve remarkable results at the time to earn his\ncompensation, but to also continue to drive growth for five more years.\n\n#### 06\n\nAs stockholders recognized by voting in favor in 2018, the ultra-ambitious\nplan was simple: if stockholders and the Company benefit, so does Elon.\n\n## We believe in stockholder democracy.\n\nThis important decision should be made by the owners of the Company. You.\nWe\u2019re asking you to make your voices heard and reinstate what you already said\nyou wanted.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Bring Tesla Home to Texas\n\n#### Proposal Three\n\n#### 01\n\nWe believe in the rights of our stockholders. We believe their votes matter.\nIn Delaware, your vote was not respected and again may not be in the future.\n\n#### 02\n\nThe Texas legal regime is strong and fair, and more appropriate to our\nmission.\n\n#### 03\n\nOur global headquarters, largest manufacturing facility and future are in\nTexas.\n\n#### 04\n\nWe have thousands of employees in Travis County, Texas.\n\n#### 05\n\nWe respect Texas. Texas respects us. Texas corporate law is developed.\n\n#### 06\n\nWe have received a tidal wave of communications from stockholders asking Tesla\nto move from Delaware.\n\nLearn More\n\nTesla \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
