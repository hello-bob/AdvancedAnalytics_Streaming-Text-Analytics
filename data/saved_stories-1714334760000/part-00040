Speaking at the launch of a new $5 billion Infineon\nsemiconductor fabrication plant, the Chancellor boasted that one in three\nEuropean microchips would now be \u2018Made in Saxony\u2019. A month later, Intel\nconfirmed that it would invest $33 billion in two new factories in Magdeburg:\nthe single largest foreign direct investment in the history of the Federal\nRepublic. This was followed by an announcement that the Taiwanese\nsemiconductor giant TSMC would assume a 70% ownership stake in a new \u20ac11\nbillion fabrication plant in Dresden. The so-called free market didn\u2019t draw\nthese companies into \u2018Silicon Saxony\u2019: an eye-watering \u20ac20 billion in\nsubsidies from the German government did. The Eurozone\u2019s High Priest of\nbudgetary discipline has cast aside its holy writs, responding to the decline\nof its export-led growth model by going on a subsidy binge.\n\nThe immediate cause of the volte-face was the inflationary aftermath of the\nCovid-19 pandemic. In October 2021, as Europe began to unwind lockdown\nrestrictions, the Director General of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019\nAssociation (ACEA), Eric-Mark Huitema, issued a warning. Europe\u2019s automotive\nsector \u2013 the bulk of which is concentrated in Germany and its hinterlands \u2013\nhad suffered \u20ac100 billion of production losses during 2020, and the global\nsupply of semiconductors was collapsing. In light of these shortages, Huitema\ncalled for a pan-European \u2018strategic plan to increase the production of\nsemiconductors in the EU\u2019, with the aim of minimizing Europe\u2019s dependency on\noverseas markets.\n\nAcross the Rue de Loi from ACEA\u2019s headquarters, the European Commission was\nbusy developing its plans to shore-up ailing European industry. Ursula von der\nLeyen stressed the need to bolster the EU\u2019s chipmaking capacities in order to\nrestore its \u2018technological sovereignty\u2019 amid rising geopolitical tensions.\nThis culminated in a \u20ac43 billion package \u2013 the 2023 EU Chips Act \u2013 which\nsought to reduce Europe\u2019s external dependencies while reshoring semiconductor\nproduction to the Single Market. The most important feature of the Act isn\u2019t\nits headline price tag or lofty ambition to \u2018double Europe\u2019s share of the\nglobal semiconductor market by 2030\u2019. Its real significance is at the level of\nthe member states. The Commission has relaxed state aid restrictions, allowing\nnational governments to inject public funds into their domestic semiconductor\nsectors. The Directorate General for Competition \u2013 traditionally the enforcer-\nin-chief of the EU\u2019s strict anti-subsidy regime \u2013 has rubberstamped the new\narrangements. Rather than zealously policing \u2018anti-competitive\u2019 practices,\nBrussels will now be giving active support to a mass subsidy regime.\n\nThis marks a decisive break from the recent past. In the 1990s and 2000s,\nWashington and Brussels viewed the development of the semiconductor industry\nas an example of globalization working as intended. The semiconductor supply\nchain is notoriously complex, incorporating multiple firms across numerous\nnational borders. Producers in the UK specialise in the software that\nunderpins modern chip manufacture; Silicon Valley dominates high value-added\nchip design; Taiwan exercises an effective monopoly over the fabrication of\nhigh-end chips; back-end manufacturing is outsourced to countries such as\nMalaysia and Vietnam. Western elites wagered that the eastwards expansion of\nthe supply chains would consolidate the primacy of US and European companies,\nreducing prohibitive start-up costs, allowing them to focus on R&D, and\nensuring a continuous supply of low-cost components.\n\nBut the business-school boosterism that underpinned this vision of\nglobalization has unravelled. Rather than a sphere of seamless market\nexchange, the semiconductor supply chain has become a zone of economic rivalry\nand geopolitical conflict. China, determined to reduce its dependence on the\nWest for high-end technologies, rapidly built-up its domestic fabrication\ncapacities. In 2000, the year before its accession to the WTO, China launched\nthe Shanghai Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), a state-backed\nfabrication plant which aims to challenge its rival across the Taiwan Strait.\nIn 2014, under the auspices of the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 programme, Beijing set\naside $170 billion to support the development of Chinese \u2018national champions\u2019\n\u2013 with SMIC one of the major recipients. By 2019, China accounted for 20% of\nglobal semiconductor exports, a figure that was projected to continue to rise\nover the following decades.\n\nThe Obama administration was initially relaxed about this rapid ascent, but\nsome within the national security establishment soon began to voice concern.\nSemiconductors are a \u2018dual use\u2019 technology, capable of both civilian and\nmilitary deployment, and China\u2019s drive to secure technological independence\nalso threatened to undermine one of the critical \u2018chokepoints\u2019 that Washington\nheld over Beijing. With the 2018 Export Control Reform Act, the US authorities\nbegan to systematically frustrate China\u2019s technological advance. Trump placed\nHuawei on the US \u2018entity list\u2019, and Biden expanded the restrictions,\ncompelling US allies \u2013 including the Dutch firm ASML \u2013 to limit the export of\ncritical machine tools and intellectual property to high-tech Chinese firms.\nAt the same time, the Biden administration ramped-up support for domestic\nchipmakers, channelling $280 billion via the CHIPS Act to US industry.\n\nThe escalating chip war between the US and China sent shockwaves through\nEurope\u2019s industrial core. Export controls, chip shortages and fierce\ncompetition over subsidies threatened to undermine the technological primacy\nof European industry. The primary casualty was Germany. In the boom years of\nthe 2000s and 2010s, Germany consolidated its position as a globalized\nproduction platform. But the triumphs of yesterday cast a shadow over its\nailing export-led economy today: dependence on Russian energy, persistent\ninflation above the Eurozone average, weak consumer spending power compounded\nby high borrowing costs, and a collapse in demand for German exports. \u2018The\nrisk of deglobalization is particularly acute for Germany\u2019s growth outlook\u2019,\nobserved Joachim Nagel, President of the Bundesbank. \u2018Its economy is far more\nopen to trade than that of many other countries.\u2019\n\nFor this reason, the pieties that dominated Europe\u2019s political economy\nthroughout the neoliberal era \u2013 multilateralism, competition policy, supply-\nside reform \u2013 will no longer do. A world of \u2018weaponized interdependence\u2019, as\nthe political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman put it, places a\npremium on strategic capacity, state power and scale. For European capital,\nwhat\u2019s needed is a new framework for EU integration, capable of underwriting\nthe trading bloc\u2019s position at the core of the world economy. As a 2019 joint\nstatement by the French and German governments put it, the choice is either to\n\u2018unite our forces or allow our industrial base and capacity to gradually\ndisappear\u2019.\n\nThe EU Chips Act, with its ambition to create a pan-European framework capable\nof competing with the US and China, is an expression of this \u2018unify or die\u2019\nlogic. But it aspires to a peculiar kind of unification. The EU, of course, is\nstill highly fragmented. Its budget remains a paltry 1% of the bloc\u2019s overall\nGDP, which means there are insufficient resources at the supranational scale\nto support an expansive continent-wide industrial policy. Pooling resources,\nin effect, means creating the conditions for already existing industrial\nclusters and states with fiscal firepower to further consolidate their\ndominant positions. Convergence around a common EU industrial policy threatens\nto accelerate divergence between member states. Since the EU relaxed its\nrestrictions, Germany has accounted for a staggering 53% of the total \u20ac672\nbillion issued in state aid. Germany has also benefited from new pan-European\nframeworks designed to support strategic sectors, gobbling up half of the\nstate aid attached to the \u2018Important Projects of Common European Interest\u2019 in\nmicroelectronics.\n\nIn the wake of the Eurozone crisis, a cleavage emerged between Europe\u2019s\nexport-led northern core and its debt-led southern periphery. Elites had\npromised that European integration would support upwards convergence in\neconomic performance amongst member states. But under the euro, with its\nstrict debt and deficit rules and lack of fiscal transfer mechanisms, it\nbecame clear that integration was delivering the precise opposite. German\nindustry boomed while the Eurozone\u2019s southern debtor states suffered the\npenury of permanent austerity. Today, the conditions that enabled this bout of\nexport-led dynamism are unravelling, with deleterious implications for German\ncapitalism. But the EU\u2019s response \u2013 a new pan-European industrial policy,\nenabling more muscular state interventionism \u2013 represents an attempt to\nreinforce Europe\u2019s industrial core.\n\nThe myths that drove neoliberal globalization have now been shattered by the\nbattle over semiconductors and other strategic sectors. Rules that were once\nrigidly applied are being bypassed to enable new waves of state\ninterventionism; the \u2018level playing field\u2019 of the Single Market is being\ncircumvented to shore-up dominant fractions of European capital. Meanwhile,\nnew myths are being forged: an ever-more integrated and autonomous union,\nbound together by the challenge posed by China and Russia. As EU policymakers\nmobilize against their external rivals, the bloc\u2019s internal rifts \u2013 between\nindustrial core and underdeveloped periphery \u2013 continue to widen.\n\nRead on: Christopher Bickerton, \u2018Thinking Like a Member State\u2019, NLR 138.\n\n# Share\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\n# Discover\n\n  * Contributors\n  * Newsletter\n  * Current NLR\n\n  * About\n  * Newsletter\n  * Contributors\n  * Support\n\n  * Current NLR\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n\n# Follow us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * RSS\n\nNew Left Review 6 Meard Street, London W1F 0EG United Kingdom +44 (0)20 7734\n8830\n\n\u00a9 New Left Review Ltd 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
