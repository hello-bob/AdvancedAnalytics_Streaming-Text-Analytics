Today, a\nwhopping 20% of global energy demand goes to producing heat used in industry,\nand most of that heat is generated by burning fossil fuels. In an effort to\nclean up industry, a growing number of companies are working to supply that\nheat with a technology called thermal batteries.\n\nIt\u2019s such an exciting idea that MIT Technology Review readers have officially\nselected thermal batteries as the reader\u2019s choice addition to our 2024 list of\n10 Breakthrough Technologies. So here\u2019s a closer look at what all the\nexcitement is about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStoring energy as heat isn\u2019t a new idea\u2014steelmakers have been capturing waste\nheat and using it to reduce fuel demand for nearly 200 years. But a changing\ngrid and advancing technology have ratcheted up interest in the field. \u201cThis\nis a hot area,\u201d says Jeffrey Rissman, senior director of industry at Energy\nInnovation, an energy and climate policy and research firm.\n\nRenewable energy sources like wind and solar have seen prices fall\ndramatically in the past decade. However, these power sources are\ninconsistent, subject to daily and seasonal patterns. So with the rise in\ncheap renewable energy has come a parallel push to find ways to store it for\napplications that require a consistent power source.\n\n## Related Story\n\nThe hottest new climate technology is bricks\n\nHeat batteries could help cut emissions by providing new routes to use solar\nand wind power.\n\nThermal energy storage could connect cheap but intermittent renewable\nelectricity with heat-hungry industrial processes. These systems can transform\nelectricity into heat and then, like typical batteries, store the energy and\ndispatch it as needed.\n\nRondo Energy is one of the companies working to produce and deploy thermal\nbatteries. The company\u2019s heat storage system relies on a resistance heater,\nwhich transforms electricity into heat using the same method as a space heater\nor toaster\u2014but on a larger scale, and reaching a much higher temperature. That\nheat is then used to warm up carefully engineered and arranged stacks of\nbricks, which store the heat for later use. Air blown over the hot bricks can\nthen be used to generate steam, or delivered directly to heat up equipment.\n\nBy using common materials and designing equipment that can work with existing\nfacilities, Rondo is working to show that its technology can integrate into a\nsector where cost is key. \u201cWe\u2019re proving this is economical right now,\u201d says\nJohn O\u2019Donnell, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nRondo has been running its first commercial pilot at an ethanol plant in\nCalifornia since March 2023. The company is also scaling up, manufacturing\nequipment in a factory in Thailand that it\u2019s already announced plans to\nexpand.\n\nA recently announced project with the beverage company Diageo will see Rondo\u2019s\nheat batteries installed in a Kentucky whiskey distillery where Bulleit\nbourbon is made, along with one of Diageo\u2019s other facilities. In March, the\nproject got a boost from the US Department of Energy, which selected it to\nreceive $75 million in funding as part of a larger push to clean up industrial\nemissions.\n\nRondo is far from the only contender in the thermal battery space, which now\nincludes companies using everything from molten salt and metal to crushed-up\nrocks to store heat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related Story\n\n10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024\n\nEvery year, we look for promising technologies poised to have a real impact on\nthe world. Here are the advances that we think matter most right now.\n\nElectrified Thermal Solutions is building thermal batteries that use thermally\nconductive bricks as both a heating element and a storage medium. Running an\nelectrical current through the bricks generates heat, without the need for any\nseparate component. Antora Power similarly uses its carbon-based blocks to\nboth generate and store heat. The company is also aiming to turn that heat\nback into electricity using thermophotovoltaic technology.\n\nWhile many companies want to install their storage solutions in industrial\nfacilities, delivering heat, electricity, or both, some are aiming to offer\ngrid-based energy storage to utilities. Malta, which spun out from X (formerly\nGoogle X) in 2018, is building technology that will take in electricity, store\nthe energy as heat in a molten-salt system, and then re-generate electricity\nfor use on the grid.\n\nBrenmiller Energy is among the most experienced players in thermal energy\nstorage. The company, founded in 2011, makes modular systems that use crushed\nrocks to store heat. Its technology is currently operating at several\nfacilities, including a beverage maker and a hospital.\n\nTo make a dent in industrial emissions, companies building thermal energy\nstorage systems need to scale quickly. They\u2019ll also need to convince customers\nto sign on for a new method of generating heat, a potentially difficult task\nin industries that can be conservative, says Doron Brenmiller, the company\u2019s\nchief business officer.With industrial heat demand expected to continue\ngrowing this decade, there\u2019s an urgent need to find cleaner options. Thermal\nbatteries could be a key strategy for keeping factories running as efforts to\ncut their emissions warm up.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Rondo\nEnergy's factory. It is located in Thailand.\n\n2024\n\n###\n\n10 Breakthrough Technologies\n\nAI for everything\n\nSuper-efficient solar cells\n\nApple Vision Pro\n\nWeight-loss drugs\n\nEnhanced geothermal systems\n\nChiplets\n\nThe first gene-editing treatment\n\nExascale computers\n\nHeat pumps\n\nTwitter killers\n\n### by Casey Crownhart\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
