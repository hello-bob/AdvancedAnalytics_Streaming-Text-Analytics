The name collectively refers to related people who usually\ncall themselves the Sama or Samah (formally A'a Sama, \"Sama people\");^[5] or\nare known by the exonym Bajau (/\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0d\u0292a\u028a, \u02c8b\u00e6-/, also spelled Badjao, Bajaw,\nBadjau, Badjaw, Bajo or Bayao). They usually live a seaborne lifestyle and use\nsmall wooden sailing vessels such as the perahu (layag in Maranao), djenging\n(balutu), lepa, and vinta (pilang).^[6] Some Sama-Bajau groups native to Sabah\nare also known for their traditional horse culture.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau are the dominant ethnic group of the islands of Tawi-Tawi. They\nare also found in other islands of the Sulu Archipelago, coastal areas of\nMindanao and other islands in the northern Philippines; as well as northern\nand eastern Borneo, Sulawesi, and throughout the eastern Indonesian\nislands.^[7] In the Philippines, they are grouped with the religiously similar\nMoro people. Within the last fifty years, many of the Filipino Sama-Bajau have\nmigrated to neighbouring Sabah and the northern islands of the Philippines,\ndue to the conflict in Mindanao.^[8]^[9] As of 2010, they were the second-\nlargest ethnic group in Sabah.^[2]^[10]\n\nSama-Bajau have sometimes been called the \"Sea Gypsies\" or \"Sea Nomads\", terms\nthat have also been used for non-related ethnic groups with similar\ntraditional lifestyles, such as the Moken of the Burmese-Thai Mergui\nArchipelago and the Orang Laut of southeastern Sumatra and the Riau Islands of\nIndonesia. The modern outward spread of the Sama-Bajau from older inhabited\nareas seems to have been associated with the development of sea trade in sea\ncucumber (trepang).\n\n## Ethnonym[edit]\n\nA Sama lepa houseboat from the Philippines (c. 1905)\n\nSama-Bajau is a collective term, referring to several closely related\nindigenous people who consider themselves a single distinct bangsa (\"ethnic\ngroup\" or \"nation\").^[6]^[11] It is generally accepted that these groups of\npeople can be termed Sama or Bajau, though they never call themselves Bajau in\nthe Philippines. Instead, they call themselves with the names of their tribes,\nusually the place they live or place of origin. For example, the sea-going\nSama-Bajau prefer to call themselves the Sama Dilaut or Sama Mandilaut\n(literally 'sea Sama' or 'ocean Sama') in the Philippines; in Malaysia, they\nidentify as Bajau Laut.^[12]^[13]\n\nA Sama-Bajau flotilla in Lahad Datu, Sabah, Malaysia\n\nHistorically in the Philippines, the term Sama referred to the more land-\noriented and settled Sama\u2013Bajau groups, while Bajau referred only to more sea-\noriented, boat-dwelling, nomadic groups.^[14] Even these distinctions are\nfading as the majority of Sama-Bajau have long since abandoned boat living,\nmost for Sama-style piling houses in the coastal shallows.^[13]\n\nSama is believed to have originated from the Austronesian root word sama\nmeaning \"together\", \"same\", or \"kin\".^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18] The exact origin of\nthe exonym Bajau is unclear. Some authors have proposed that it is derived\nfrom a corruption of the Malay word berjauh ('getting further apart' or 'the\nstate of being away') or in Indonesian word it means boat dwelling.^[18]^[19]\nOther possible origins include the Brunei Malay word bajaul, which means \"to\nfish\".^[19] The term Bajau has pejorative connotations in the Philippines,\nindicating poverty in comparison to the term Sama, especially since it is used\nmost commonly to refer to poverty-stricken Sama-Bajau who make a living\nthrough begging.^[13]\n\nBritish administrators in Sabah classified the Sama-Bajau as \"Bajau\" and\nlabelled them as such in their birth certificates. Thus, the Sama-Bajau in\nMalaysia may sometimes self-identify as \"Bajau\" or even \"Malay\" (though the\npreferred term is \"Sama\"), for political reasons. This is due to the\ngovernment recognition of the Sama-Bajau as legally Bumiputera (indigenous\nnative) under the name \"Bajau\".^[13] This ensures easy access to the special\nprivileges granted to ethnic Malays. This is especially true for recent Moro\nFilipino migrants. The indigenous Sama-Bajau in Malaysia have also started\nlabelling themselves as their ancestors called themselves, such as Simunul.\n\nIn the 17th-century, the Spanish priest Francisco Comb\u00e9s calls the Sama-Bajau\nas the Lutao (\"[people who] float on water\") in his Historia de las Islas de\nMindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes (1667), and describes them as building houses\non the sea because they \"hate land\". They were described as being the subjects\nof the Sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao, and they were esteemed for their\nshipbuilding skills and were commonly hired as crews of warships.^[20]^[21]\n\n## History and origin[edit]\n\nRegions inhabited by peoples usually known as \"Sea Nomads\"^[22] Sama-Bajau\nOrang Laut Moken\n\nFor most of their history, the Sama-Bajau have been a nomadic, seafaring\npeople, living off the sea by trading and subsistence fishing.^[23] The boat-\ndwelling Sama-Bajau see themselves as non-aggressive people.^[citation needed]\nThey kept close to the shore by erecting houses on stilts and travelled using\nlepa, handmade boats which many lived in.^[23] A 2021 genetic study shows that\nsome Sama-Bajau have Austroasiatic ancestry.^[24]\n\n### Oral traditions[edit]\n\nMost of the various oral traditions and tarsila (royal genealogies) among the\nSama-Bajau have a common theme which claims that they were originally a land-\ndwelling people who were the subjects of a king who had a daughter. After she\nis lost by either being swept away to the sea (by a storm or a flood) or being\ntaken captive by a neighbouring kingdom, they were then supposedly ordered to\nfind her. After failing to do so they decided to remain nomadic for fear of\nfacing the wrath of the king.^[6]^[22]^[25]^[26]\n\nOne such version widely told among the Sama-Bajau of Borneo claims that they\ndescended from Johorean royal guards who were escorting a princess named\nDayang Ayesha for marriage to a ruler in Sulu. However, the Sultan of Brunei\n(allegedly Muhammad Shah of Brunei) also fell in love with the princess. On\nthe way to Sulu, they were attacked by Bruneians in the high seas. The\nprincess was taken captive and married to the Sultan of Brunei instead. The\nescorts, having lost the princess, elected to settle in Borneo and Sulu rather\nthan return to Johor.^[27]^[28] This legend is popular among Sabah Sama-Bajau\nas it legitimises their claim to \"Malay-ness\" and strengthens their ties to\nIslam, which puts them in a favourable position in the Bumiputera laws of\nMalaysia (similar to the usage of the name \"Bajau\" instead of \"Sama\").^[29]\n\nAmong the Indonesian Sama-Bajau, on the other hand, their oral histories place\nmore importance on the relationship of the Sama-Bajau with the Sultanate of\nGowa rather than Johor. The various versions of their origin myth tell about a\nroyal princess who was washed away by a flood. She was found and eventually\nmarried a king or a prince of Gowa. Their offspring then allegedly became the\nancestors of the Indonesian Sama-Bajau.^[25]^[30]\n\nHowever, there are other versions that are more mythological and do not\nmention a princess. Among the Philippine Sama-Bajau, for example, there is a\nmyth that claims that the Sama-Bajau were accidentally towed into what is now\nZamboanga by a giant stingray.^[6] Incidentally, the native pre-Hispanic name\nof Zamboanga City is \"Samboangan\" (literally \"mooring place\"), which was\nderived from the Sinama word for a mooring pole, sambuang or samboang.^[28]\n\n### Modern research on origins[edit]\n\nSama-Bajau children in Basilan\n\nThe origin myths claiming descent from Johor or Gowa have been largely\nrejected by modern scholars, mostly because these kingdoms were established\ntoo recently to explain the ethnic divergence.^[26]^[28] Whether the Sama-\nBajau are indigenous to their current territories or settled from elsewhere is\nstill contentious.^[13] Linguistically, they are distinct from neighbouring\npopulations, especially from the Taus\u016bg who are more closely related to the\nnorthern Philippine ethnic groups like the Visayans.^[6]\n\nIn 1965, the anthropologist David E. Sopher claimed that the Sama-Bajau, along\nwith the Orang laut, descended from ancient \"Veddoid\" (Australoid)^[note 1]\nhunter-gatherers from the Riau Archipelago who intermarried with\nAustronesians. They retained their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, though they\nbecame more maritime-oriented as Southeast Asia became more populated by later\nAustronesian settlers.^[6]\n\nA Sama woman making a traditional mat in Semporna, Sabah, MalaysiaSama-Bajau\nwoman anchoring a family boat (banglo) in Malaysia\n\nIn 1968, the anthropologist Harry Arlo Nimmo, on the other hand, believed that\nthe Sama-Bajau are indigenous to the Sulu Archipelago, Sulawesi, and/or\nBorneo, and do not share a common origin with the Orang laut. Nimmo proposed\nthat the boat-dwelling lifestyle developed among the ancestors of the Sama-\nBajau independently from the Orang laut.^[6]\n\nA more recent study in 1985 by the anthropologist Alfred Kemp Pallasen\ncompares the oral traditions with historical facts and linguistic evidence. He\nputs the date of the ethnogenesis of Sama-Bajau as 800 AD and also rejects a\nhistorical connection between the Sama-Bajau and the Orang laut. He\nhypothesises that the Sama-Bajau originated from a proto-Sama-Bajau people\ninhabiting the Zamboanga Peninsula who practised both fishing and slash-and-\nburn agriculture. They were the original inhabitants of Zamboanga and the Sulu\narchipelago,^[31] and were well-established in the region long before the\nfirst arrival of the Taus\u016bg people at around the 13th century from their\nhomelands along the northern coast of eastern Mindanao. Along with the Taus\u016bg,\nthey were heavily influenced by the Malay kingdoms both culturally and\nlinguistically, becoming Indianised by the 15th century and Islamised by the\n16th century.^[32] They also engaged in extensive trade with China for\n\"luxury\" sea products like trepang, pearls, and shark fin.^[11]^[32]^[33]\n\nFrom Zamboanga, some members of these people adopted an exclusively seaborne\nculture and spread outwards in the 10th century towards Basilan, Sulu, Borneo,\nand Sulawesi.^[32]^[34] They arrived in Borneo in the 11th century.^[28] This\nhypothesis is currently the most widely accepted among specialists studying\nthe Austronesian peoples. This would also explain why even boat-dwelling Sama-\nBajau still practice agricultural rituals, despite being exclusively\nfishermen.^[34] Linguistic evidence further points to Borneo as the ultimate\norigin of the proto-Sama-Bajau people.^[11]\n\nA genetic study of three groups\u2014the Derawan of Northeast Borneo, the Kotabaru\nof Southeast Borneo, and the Kendari of Southeast Sulawesi\u2014suggested that\ntheir origin was in southern Sulawesi. Their ethnogenesis is estimated to have\ndated back to around the 4th century AD by an admixture event between the\nBugis people and a Papuan group. The authors suggest that the Sama moved to\neastern Borneo at around the 11th century AD, and then towards northern Borneo\nand the southern Philippines at around the 13th to 14th centuries AD. They\nhypothesize that they were driven to migrate during the increase of influence\nand trading activities of the Srivijaya Empire. Genetically, the Sama-Bajau\nare highly diverse, indicating heavy admixture with the locals or even\nlanguage and cultural adoption by coastal groups in the areas they settled.\nHowever, the study is restricted to the Indonesian Bajo subgroup, and the\nauthors recommend additional studies from Sama-Bajau groups in neighbouring\nregions.^[35]\n\nA 2021 genetic study discovered a unique genetic signal among the Sama-Bajau\nof the Philippines and Indonesia. This genetic signal (called the \"Sama\nancestry\" by the authors) identifies them as descendants of an ancient\nmigration of Austroasiatic-affiliated hunter-gatherer groups from mainland\nSoutheast Asia via the now sunken land bridges of Sundaland around 15,000 to\n12,000 years ago. These populations admixed with both the preexisting Negrito\npopulations, and later on, the incoming migrations of the Austronesian peoples\n(also adopting an Austronesian language in the process). They are genetically\nclustered with the Lua and Mlabri peoples of mainland Southeast Asia, as well\nas the Manobo people of mainland Mindanao. The study also identifies minimal\nSouth Asian gene flow among Sama populations starting at around 1000 years\nago. Sama ancestry was highest among the Sama Dilaut, followed by more land-\nbased Sama. But it was also detected among other ethnic groups that do not\nself-identify as Sama in Palawan, Zamboanga, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-\nTawi.^[24]\n\n### Historical records[edit]\n\nSama-Bajau houses in Cawa Cawa, Zamboanga City, Philippines, 1923\n\nThe epic poem Darangen of the Maranao people record that among the ancestors\nof the hero Bantugan is a Maranao prince who married a Sama-Bajau princess.\nEstimated to have happened in 840 AD, it is the oldest account of the Sama-\nBajau. It further corroborates the fact that they predate the arrival of the\nTaus\u016bg settlers and are indigenous to the Sulu archipelago and parts of\nMindanao.^[26]\n\nResidents of a Bajau kampung in Afdeeling Ternate, Groote Oost, Dutch East\nIndies (present-day North Maluku, Indonesia) c. 1925\n\nSama-Bajau were first recorded by European explorers in 1521 by Antonio\nPigafetta of the Magellan-Elcano expedition in what is now the Zamboanga\nPeninsula. Pigafetta writes that the \"people of that island make their\ndwellings in boats and do not live otherwise\". They have also been present in\nthe written records of other Europeans henceforth; including in Sulawesi by\nthe Dutch colonies in 1675, in Sulawesi and eastern Borneo by Thomas Forrest\nin the 1770s,^[6] and in the west coast of Borneo by Spenser St. John in the\n1850s and 1860s.^[27]\n\nA Bajau chieftain in traditional attire from Kampung Menkabong, Tuaran,\nBritish North Borneo, c. 1948\n\nSama-Bajau were often widely mentioned in connection to sea raids (mangahat),\npiracy, and the slave trade in Southeast Asia during the European colonial\nperiod, indicating that at least some Sama-Bajau groups from northern Sulu\n(e.g. the Banguingui) were involved, along with non-Sama-Bajau groups like the\nIranun. The scope of their pirate activities was extensive, commonly sailing\nfrom Sulu to as far as the Moluccas and back again. Aside from early European\ncolonial records, they may have also been the pirates described by Chinese and\nArabian sources in the Straits of Singapore in the 12th and 13th\ncenturies.^[32] Sama-Bajau usually served as low-ranking crewmembers of war\nboats, directly under the command of Iranun squadron leaders, who in turn\nanswered to the Taus\u016bg datu of the Sultanate of Sulu.^[11]\n\nThe Bajoe harbour in Sulawesi was the site of a small settlement of Sama-Bajau\nunder the Bugis Sultanate of Bone. They were significantly involved in the\nFirst and Second Bone Wars (1824\u20131825) when the Royal Netherlands East Indies\nArmy sent a punitive expedition in retaliation for Bugis and Makassar attacks\non local Dutch garrisons. After the fall of Bone, most Sama-Bajau resettled in\nother areas of Sulawesi.^[17]^[25]\n\nDuring the British colonial rule of Sabah, the Sama-Bajau were involved in two\nuprisings against the North Borneo Chartered Company: the Mat Salleh rebellion\nfrom 1894 to 1905, and the Pandasan Affair of 1915.^[27]\n\n## Modern Sama-Bajau[edit]\n\nPercentage population of Bajau by state constituencies in Sabah, Malaysia,\naccording to 2020 census\n\nModern Sama-Bajau are generally regarded as peaceful, hospitable, and cheerful\npeople, despite their humble circumstances. However, a significant number are\nalso illiterate, uneducated, and impoverished, due to their nomadic\nlifestyle.^[19]\n\nThe number of modern Sama-Bajau who are born and live primarily at sea is\ndiminishing. Cultural assimilation and modernisation are regarded as the main\ncauses.^[6] Particularly blamed is the dissolution of the Sultanate of Sulu,\nthe traditional patron of the Sama-Bajau for bartering fish for farm goods.\nThe money-based fish markets which replaced the seasonal trade around mooring\npoints necessitates a more land-based lifestyle for greater market\npenetration.^[34] In Malaysia, some hotly debated government programs have\nalso resettled Bajau to the mainland.^[23]\n\nThe Sama-Bajau in the Sulu Archipelago were historically discriminated against\nby the dominant Taus\u016bg people, who viewed boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau as\n'inferior' and as outsiders (the traditional Taus\u016bg term for them is the\nhighly offensive Luwaan, meaning \"spat out\" or \"outcast\"). They were also\nmarginalised by other Moro peoples because they still practised animist folk\nreligions either exclusively or alongside Islam, and thus were viewed as\n\"uncivilised pagans\".^[36] Boat-dwelling and shoreline Sama-Bajau had a very\nlow status in the caste-based Taus\u016bg Sultanate of Sulu.^[28]^[31]^[37] This\nsurvived into the modern Philippines where the Sama-Bajau are still subjected\nto strong cultural prejudice from the Taus\u016bg. The Sama-Bajau have also been\nfrequent victims of theft, extortion, kidnapping, and violence from the\npredominantly Taus\u016bg Abu Sayyaf insurgents as well as pirates.^[11]^[38]^[39]\n\nA typical Sama-Bajau settlement in the PhilippinesA Sama-Bajau village in\nOmadal Island, Sabah, MalaysiaBokori, a Sama-Bajau village in southwest\nSulawesi, Indonesia\n\nThis discrimination and the continuing violence in Muslim Mindanao have driven\nmany Sama-Bajau to emigrate. They usually resettle in Malaysia and Indonesia,\nwhere they have more employment opportunities.^[40]^[41]^[42] But even in\nMalaysia, their presence is still controversial as most of them are illegal\nimmigrants. Most illegal Sama-Bajau immigrants enter Malaysia through offshore\nislands. From there, they enter mainland Sabah to find work as manual\nlabourers.^[8]^[11]^[43] Others migrate to the northern islands of the\nPhilippines, particularly to the Visayas, Palawan, the northern coast of\nMindanao, and even as far as southern Luzon.^[16]^[18]^[19] Though these are\nrelatively safer regions, they are also more economically disadvantaged and\nsocially excluded, leading to Filipinos sometimes stereotyping the boat-\ndwelling Sama-Bajau as beggars and squatters.^[11]^[13]^[19]^[44] The\nancestral roaming and fishing grounds of the Sama-Bajau straddled the borders\nof the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. And they have sometimes voyaged\nas far as the Timor and Arafura Seas.^[45] In modern times, they have lost\naccess to most of these sites. There have been efforts to grant Sama-Bajau\nsome measures of rights to fish in traditional areas, but most Sama-Bajau\nstill suffer from legal persecution. For example, under a 1974 Memorandum of\nUnderstanding, \"Indonesian traditional fishermen\" are allowed to fish within\nthe Exclusive Economic Zone of Australia, which includes traditional fishing\ngrounds of Sama-Bajau fishermen. However, illegal fishing encroachment of\nCorporate Sea Trawlers in these areas has led to concern about\noverfishing,^[46] and the destruction of Sama-Bajau vessels.^[45] In 2014,\nIndonesian authorities destroyed six Filipino Sama-Bajau boats caught fishing\nin Indonesian waters. This is particularly serious for the Sama-Bajau, whose\nboats are also oftentimes their homes.^[47]\n\nSama-Bajau fishermen are often associated with illegal and destructive\npractices, like blast fishing, cyanide fishing, coral mining, and cutting down\nmangrove trees.^[30]^[48] It is believed that the Sama-Bajau resort to these\nactivities mainly due to sedentarisation brought about by the restrictions\nimposed on their nomadic culture by modern nation-states. With their now\nlimited territories, they have little alternative means of competing with\nbetter-equipped land-based and commercial fishermen and earn enough to feed\ntheir families.^[11]^[48] The Indonesian government and certain non-\ngovernmental organisations have launched several programs for providing\nalternative sustainable livelihood projects for Sama-Bajau to discourage these\npractices (such as the use of fish aggregating devices instead of\nexplosives).^[30] Medical health centres (puskesmas) and schools have also\nbeen built even for stilt-house Sama-Bajau communities.^[11] Similar programs\nhave also been implemented in the Philippines.^[49]\n\nWith the loss of their traditional fishing grounds, some refugee groups of\nSama-Bajau in the Philippines are forced to resort to begging (agpangamu in\nSinama), particularly diving for coins thrown by inter-island ferry passengers\n(angedjo). Other traditional sources of income include selling grated cassava\n(magliis), mat-weaving (ag-tepoh), and jewellery-making (especially from\npearls). Recently, there have been more efforts by local governments in the\nPhilippines to rehabilitate Sama-Bajau refugees and teach them livelihood\nskills.^[19]^[36]^[50] In 2016, the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic\nResources started a project for distributing fishing boats, gear, and other\nlivelihood materials among Sama-Bajau communities in Luzon. This was largely\nthe result of raised awareness and an outpouring of support after a photo of a\nSama-Bajau beggar, Rita Gaviola (dubbed the \"Badjao Girl\"), went viral in the\nPhilippines.^[51]^[52]^[53]\n\nOne Tausug Muslim who was interviewed insulted the Bajau people, who are also\nMuslim but he declared the Bajau as non-Muslim and compared killing a Bajau to\nkilling a monkey, saying it was not worth the effort for a juramentado to\nattack Bajau.^[54]^[55] There are Tausug in Sulu who takfir the Bajau and\ndeclared them as non-Muslims despite them following Islam and discriminate\nagainst them due to their lifestyle.^[56] In Indonesia many discriminate\nagainst them with false stereotypes, accusing them of using love potions on\nwomen and were untrustworthy.^[57]\n\n## Subgroups[edit]\n\nThe Sama-Bajau are fragmented into highly diverse subgroups. They have never\nbeen politically united and are usually subject to the land-based political\ngroups of the areas they settle, such as the Sultanate of Brunei and the\nformer Sultanate of Sulu.^[34]\n\nSama-Bajau woman and children from Omadal Island, Sabah, Malaysia\n\nMost subgroups of Sama-Bajau name themselves after the place they originated\nfrom (usually an island).^[28]^[31]^[34] Each subgroup speaks a distinct\nlanguage or dialect that are usually mutually intelligible with their\nimmediate neighbouring subgroup in a continuous linguistic chain.^[34] In the\nPhilippines, the Sama-Bajau can be divided into three general groups based on\nwhere they settle:^[18]^[32]\n\n  * Sama Bihing or Sama Lipid \u2013 The \"shoreline Sama\" or \"littoral Sama\". These are the Sama-Bajau which traditionally lived in stilt houses in shallows and coastal areas. An example is the Sama Simunul. They are originally from the larger islands of Tawi-Tawi.^[18]^[32] They have a more flexible lifestyle than the Sama-Gimba (Dilaut Origin) and will farm when there is available land. They usually act as middlemen in trade between the Sama Dilaut and other land-based peoples.^[32]\n  * Sama Dea, Sama Deya, or Sama Darat \u2013 The \"land Sama\". These are the Sama-Bajau which traditionally lived in island interiors. Some examples are the Sama Sibutu and the Sama Sanga-Sanga. They are usually farmers who cultivate rice, sweet potato, cassava, and coconuts for copra through traditional slash-and-burn agriculture (in contrast to the plow agriculture technology brought by the Taus\u016bg). They are originally from the larger islands of Tawi-Tawi and Pangutaran.^[18]^[28]^[32] In the Philippines, the Sama Dea will often completely differentiate themselves from the Sama Dilaut.^[58]\n  * Sama Dilaut, Sama Mandilaut, Sama Pala'u, or Bajau Laut \u2013 The \"sea Sama\" or \"ocean Sama\". In the Philippines, the preferred ethnonym is Sama Dilaut;^[12] while in Malaysia, they usually identify as Bajau Laut. This subgroup originally lived exclusively on elaborately crafted houseboats called lepa, but almost all have taken to living on land in the Philippines. Their home islands include Sitangkai and Bongao.^[59] They are the Sama-Bajau subgroup most commonly called \"Bajau\", though Filipino Sama Dilaut considers it offensive.^[58] They sometimes call themselves the \"Sama To'ongan\" (literally \"true Sama\" or \"real Sama\"), to distinguish themselves from the land-dwelling Sama-Bajau subgroups.^[15] A recent study shows that the Sama-Dilaut people of the Philippines have Indian or South Asian ancestry.^[24]\n\nOther minor Sama-Bajau groups named after islands of origin include the Sama\nBannaran, Sama Davao, Sama Zamboanga Sikubung, Sama Tuaran, Sama Semporna,\nSama Sulawesi, Sama Simunul, Sama Tabawan, Sama Tandubas (or Sama Tando' Bas),\nand Sama Ungus Matata.^[28] Mixed-heritage Sama-Bajau and Taus\u016bg communities\nare sometimes known as \"Bajau Suluk\" in Malaysia.^[8]^[60] People of multiple\nethnic parentage may further identify with a three-part self-description, such\nas \"Bajau Suluk Dusun\".^[61] The following are the major subgroups usually\nrecognised as distinct:\n\n  * Bajo (Indonesia) \u2013 Also known as \"Same'\" (or simply \"Sama\") by the Bugis; and \"Turijene\" or \"Taurije'n\" (literally \"people of the water\"), \"Bayo\", or \"Bayao\" by the Makassar.^[15]^[62] They are Sama-Bajau groups who settled in Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Indonesia through the Makassar Strait from as early as the 16th century.^[6]^[63]^[64] They have spread further into nearby islands, including the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku Islands, and Raja Ampat Islands.^[17]\n\nGaray warship of the Banguingui pirates\n\n  * Banguingui (Philippines, Malaysia) \u2013 Also known as \"Sama Balangingi\", \"Sama Balanguingui\", or \"Sama Bangingi\". Native to the Philippines. Some have recently migrated to Sabah. They are sometimes considered distinct from other Sama-Bajau. They have a more martial-oriented society and were once part of regular sea raids and piracy against coastal communities and passing ships.^[34]^[65]\n\nMain article: Banguingui people\n\nThe Regatta Lepa festival in Semporna, Sabah, Malaysia. Lepa refers to the\nhouseboat in the dialect of east coast Bajau. In this festival, Bajau people\ndecorate their boats with colourful flags.\n\n  * East Coast Bajau (Philippines, Malaysia) \u2013 are Sama Dilaut who settled in the eastern coast of Sabah, particularly around Semporna. They still identify themselves as Bajau Laut or Sama Laut. Though they are called East Coast Bajau to distinguish them from the Sama Kota Belud of western Sabah.^[66] They are also known by the exonym \"Pala'u\" (\"boat-dwelling\" in Sinama), but it is sometimes considered derogatory. Some have retained their original boat-dwelling lifestyle, but many others have built homes on land. They are known for the colourful annual Regatta Lepa festival, which occurs from 24 to 26 April.^[67]\n  * Samal (Philippines, Malaysia) \u2013 \"Samal\" (also spelled \"Siamal\" or \"Siyamal\") is a Taus\u016bg and Cebuano term and is sometimes considered offensive. Their preferred endonym is simply \"Sama\", and they are more accurately a general subgroup of Sama Dea (\"land Sama\") native to the Philippines.^[15]^[58] A large number are now residing around the coasts of northern Sabah, though many have also migrated north to the Visayas and southern Luzon. They are predominantly land-dwelling.^[6]^[42]^[58] They are the largest single group of Sama-Bajau.^[68] In Davao del Norte, the Island Garden City of Samal was possibly named after them.^[58]^[69]\n  * Ubian (Philippines, Malaysia) \u2013 Originated from the island of South Ubian in Tawi-Tawi, Philippines, and make up the largest Sama-Bajau subgroup in Sabah. They reside in sizeable minorities living around the towns of Kudat and Semporna in Sabah, Malaysia.\n\nThe traditional house of the west coast Bajau in Kota Belud, Sabah, Malaysia\n\n  * West Coast Bajau (Malaysia) \u2013 Also known as \"Sama Kota Belud\". Native to the western coast of Sabah, particularly around Kota Belud. They prefer to call themselves by the general ethnonym \"Sama\", not \"Bajau\"; and their neighbours, the Dusuns also call them \"Sama\". British administrators originally defined them as \"Bajau\". They are referred to as West Coast Bajau in Malaysia to distinguish them from the Sama Dilaut of eastern Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago.^[66] They are known for having a traditional horse culture.^[58]\n\nThe following are subgroups that do not self-identify as Sama, although they\nare culturally related to the Sama people and speak a Sama-Bajaw language:^[5]\n\n  * Abaknon (Philippines) \u2013 a subgroup from Capul, Northern Samar in the Visayas Islands that speak the Abaknon language. They were colonised and converted to Christianity early by the Spanish and today are culturally Visayan.^[5] Their folk history claims that their ancestors originated from the southern Philippines (identified in some sources as the island of Balabac). In the 1300s, they refused to convert to Islam and submit to the rule of the Moro sultanates. Led by a datu named Abak, their people left the island, eventually reaching and settling the island now known as Capul.^[70]^[71]\n  * Jama Mapun (Philippines) \u2013 sometimes known by the exonyms 'Sama Mapun\", \"Sama Kagayan\", or \"Bajau Kagayan\". They are from the island of Mapun, Tawi-Tawi (formerly known as Cagayan de Sulu). Their culture is heavily influenced by the Sulu Sultanate.^[72] They are relatively isolated and do not usually consider themselves as Sama.^[5]\n  * Yakan (Philippines) \u2013 Found in the mountainous interior of the island of Basilan. Though they may have been the ancestors of the Sama-Bajau, they have become linguistically and culturally distinct and are usually regarded as a separate ethnic group. They are exclusively land-based and are usually farmers.^[34] Yakan are also a horse-riding culture, similar to the West Coast Bajau. They are renowned for their weaving traditions.^[73] They resisted Tausug rule during the early formation of the Sulu Sultanate, eventually gaining recognition as a separate political entity. They are only partially Islamized, with a significant minority retaining indigenous anito beliefs or practising Folk Islam.^[5]\n\nMain article: Yakan people\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\nDerawan Island, one of the major Bajau settlement off the coast of Berau, East\nKalimantan, Indonesia\n\nMain article: Sama-Bajaw languages\n\nThe Sama\u2013Bajau peoples speak some ten languages of the Sama\u2013Bajau subgroup of\nthe Western Malayo-Polynesian language family.^[74] Sinama is the most common\nname for these languages, but they are also called Bajau, especially in\nMalaysia. Most Sama-Bajau can speak multiple languages.^[11]\n\nThe Sama-Bajau languages were once classified under the Central Philippine\nlanguages of the Malayo-Polynesian geographic group of the Austronesian\nlanguage family. But due to marked differences with neighbouring languages,\nthey were moved to a separate branch altogether from all other Philippine\nlanguages.^[75] For example, Sinama pronunciation is quite distinct from other\nnearby Central Philippine languages like Taus\u016bg and Tagalog. Instead of the\nprimary stress being usually on the final syllable; the primary stress occurs\non the second-to-the-last syllable of the word in Sinama.^[32] This placement\nof the primary stress is similar to Manobo and other languages of the\npredominantly animistic ethnic groups of Mindanao, the Lumad peoples.^[76]\n\nIn 2006, the linguist Robert Blust proposed that the Sama-Bajaw languages\nderived from the Barito lexical region, though not from any established group.\nIt is thus a sister group to other Barito languages like Dayak and Malagasy.\nIt is classified under the Bornean geographic group.^[77]\n\nSama-Bajau languages are usually written in the Jawi alphabet.^[16]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\nSee also: Anito and Babaylan\n\nReligions of Sama-Bajau (Malaysian population only)^[78]  \n---  \nReligion| Percent  \nIslam| 95.26%  \nChristianity| 0.52%  \nFolk religion / Other religions| 0.08%  \nNo religion / Unknown| 4.14%  \n  \nReligion can vary among the Sama-Bajau subgroups; from strict adherence to\nSunni Islam, forms of folk Islam (itself influenced by Sufi traditions of\nearly Muslim missionaries), to animistic beliefs in spirits and ancestor\nworship. There is a small minority of Catholics and Protestants, particularly\nfrom Davao del Sur in the Philippines.^[26]^[36]\n\nAmong the modern coastal Sama-Bajau of Malaysia, claims to religious piety and\nlearning are an important source of individual prestige. Some of the Sama-\nBajau lack mosques and must rely on the shore-based communities such as those\nof the more Islamised or Malay peoples. Some of the more nomadic Sama-Bajau,\nlike the Ubian Bajau, are much less adherent to orthodox Islam. They practice\na syncretic form of folk Islam, revering local sea spirits, known in Islamic\nterminology as Jinn.^[34]\n\nAn-Nur Mosque, the main mosque in the Bajau village of Tuaran, Sabah,\nMalaysia^[79]\n\nThe ancient Sama-Bajau were animistic, and this is retained wholly or\npartially in some Sama-Bajau groups. The supreme deities in Sama-Bajau\nmythology are Umboh Tuhan (also known as Umboh Dilaut, the \"Lord of the Sea\")\nand his consort, Dayang Dayang Mangilai (\"Lady of the Forest\").^[80] Umboh\nTuhan is regarded as the creator deity who made humans equal to animals and\nplants. Like other animistic religions, they fundamentally divide the world\ninto the physical and spiritual realms which coexist.^[12]^[81] In modern\nMuslim Sama-Bajau, Umboh Tuhan (or simply Tuhan or Tuan) is usually equated\nwith Allah.^[28]^[81]^[note 2]\n\nSunduk grave markers showing the Sama okil carving traditions. These\noriginated from the pre-Islamic ancestor worship of the Sama-Bajau and\noriginally included human and animal figures, which are largely missing in\nmodern sunduk, due to Islamic influence.^[82]^[83]\n\nOther objects of reverence are spirits known as umboh (\"ancestor\", also\nvariously spelled omboh, m'boh, mbo', etc.).^[28] Traditionally, the umboh\nreferred more specifically to ancestral spirits, different from the saitan\n(nature spirits) and the jinn (familiar spirits); some literature refers to\nall of them as umboh.^[84] These include Umboh Baliyu (the spirits of wind and\nstorms), and Umboh Payi or Umboh Gandum (the spirits of the first rice\nharvest). They include totemic spirits of animals and plants, including Umboh\nSummut (totem of ants) and Umboh Kamun (totem of mantis shrimp).^[81]\n\nThe construction and launch of sailing vessels are ritualised, and the vessels\nare believed to have a spirit known as Sumang\u00e2 (\"guardian\", literally \"one who\ndeflects attacks\").^[45] The umboh are believed to influence fishing\nactivities, rewarding the Sama-Bajau by granting good luck favours known as\npadalleang and occasionally punishing by causing serious incidents called\nbusong.^[48]^[80]\n\nTraditional Sama-Bajau communities may have shamans (dukun) traditionally\nknown as the kalamat. The kalamat are known in Muslim Sama-Bajau as the wali\njinn (literally \"custodian of jinn\") and may adhere to taboos concerning the\ntreatment of the sea and other cultural aspects. The kalamat presides over\nSama-Bajau community events along with mediums known as igal jinn.^[31]^[80]\nThe kalamat and the igal jinn are said to be \"spirit-bearers\" and are believed\nto be hosts of familiar spirits. It is not, however, regarded as a spirit\npossession, since the igal jinn never lose control of their bodies. Instead,\nthe igal jinn are believed to have acquired their familiar spirit (jinn) after\nsurviving a serious or near-fatal illness. For the rest of their lives, the\nigal jinn is believed to share their bodies with the particular jinn who saved\nthem.^[80]\n\nOne important religious event among the Sama-Bajau is the annual feast known\nas pag-umboh or magpaay-bahaw, an offering of thanks to Umboh\nTuhan.^[28]^[31]^[34] In this ceremony, newly harvested rice (paay-bahaw) are\ndehusked (magtaparahu) while Islamic prayers (duaa) are recited. They are\ndried (magpatanak) and are then laid out in small conical piles symbolic of\nmountains (bud) on the living room floor (a process known as the \"sleeping of\nrice\"). After two or three nights, two-thirds are set aside for making sweet\nrice meals (panyalam), while one-third is set aside for making sweet rice\ncakes (durul).^[31]^[34] Additional prayers (zikir), which includes calling\nthe names of ancestors out loud, are offered to the Umboh after the rice meals\nhave been prepared. Pag-umboh is a solemn and formal affair.^[31]\n\nAnother annual religious ceremony among the boat-dwelling Sama Dilaut is the\npagkanduli (literally \"festive gathering\").^[84] It involves ritual dancing to\nUmboh Tuhan, Dayang Dayang Mangilai, and ancestral ghosts called bansa. The\nritual is first celebrated under a sacred dangkan tree (strangler figs, known\nelsewhere in the Philippines as balete) symbolising the male spirit Umboh\nTuhan and afterwards in the centre of a grove of kama'toolang trees (pandan\ntrees) symbolising the female spirit Dayang Dayang Mangilai.^[80]\n\nThe Jama Mapun people's indigenous cosmology is extremely vast. Examples of\nfigures in their cosmology are Niyu-niyu (coconut palm), Lumba-lumba\n(dolphin), and Anak Datu (two sons of a datu spearing another figure, Bunta \u2013\na blowfish).^[85]\n\nThe trance dancing is called mag-igal and involves female and male and igal\njinn, called the jinn denda and jinn lella respectively. The jinn denda\nperform the first dance known as igal limbayan under the dangkan tree, with\nthe eldest leading. They are performed with intricate movements of the hands,\nusually with metal fingernail extensions called sulingkengkeng. If the dance\nand music are pleasing, the bansa are believed to take possession of the\ndancers, whereupon the wali jinn will assist in releasing them at the end of\nthe dance.\n\nThe bansa are not feared as they are regarded as spirits of ancestors.\nTemporarily serving as hosts for the bansa while dancing to music is regarded\nas a \"gift\" by the living Sama Dilaut to their ancestors. After the igal\nlimbayan, the wali jinn will invite the audience to participate, to celebrate,\nand to give their thanks. The last dance is the igal lellang, with four jinn\nlella performing a warrior dance, whereupon the participants will proceed to\nthe kama'toolang grove. There they will perform rituals and dance (this time\nwith male and female dancers together), symbolically \"inviting\" Dayang Dayang\nMangilai to come with them back to the dangkan tree. Further games and\ncelebrations are held under the original dangkan tree before the celebrants\nsay their farewells to the spirits. Unlike pag-umboh, pagkanduli is a joyous\ncelebration, involving singing, dancing, and joking among all participants. It\nis the largest festive event among the Sama Dilaut communities.^[31]\n\nAside from pagkanduli and magpaay-bahaw, public dances called magigal jinn may\noccur. During these celebrations, the igal jinn may be consulted for a public\ns\u00e9ance and nightly trance dancing.^[84] In times of epidemics, the igal jinn\nis called upon to remove illness-causing spirits from the community. They do\nthis by setting a \"spirit boat\" adrift in the open sea beyond the village or\nanchorage.\n\n### Boat dwelling[edit]\n\nSee also: Lepa (ship), Djenging, and Vinta\n\nA Sama-Bajau vinta in Zamboanga City, 1923Sama-Bajau woman from Maiga Island,\nSemporna, Sabah, Malaysia, with traditional sun protection called burak\n\nA few Sama-Bajau still live traditionally. They live in houseboats (lepa,\nbalutu, and vinta being the most common types) which generally accommodate a\nsingle nuclear family (usually five people). The houseboats travel together in\nflotillas with houseboats of immediate relatives (a family alliance) and co-\noperate during fishing expeditions and in ceremonies. A married couple may\nchoose to sail with the relatives of the husband or the wife. They anchor at\ncommon mooring points (called sambuangan) with other flotillas (usually also\nbelonging to extended relatives) at certain times of the\nyear.^[28]^[27]^[34]^[86]\n\nThese mooring points are usually presided over by an elder or headsman. The\nmooring points are close to sources of water or culturally significant\nlocations like island cemeteries. There are periodic gatherings of Sama-Bajau\nclans usually for various ceremonies like weddings or festivals. They\ngenerally do not sail more than 40 km (24.85 mi) from their \"home\"\nmoorage.^[6]^[27] They periodically trade goods with the land-based\ncommunities of other Sama-Bajau and other ethnic groups.^[27] Sama-Bajau\ngroups may routinely cross the borders of the Philippines, Malaysia, and\nIndonesia for fishing, trading, or visiting relatives.^[13]^[19]^[28]^[87]\n\nSama-Bajau women also use a traditional sun-protecting powder called burak or\nborak, made from water weeds, rice, and spices.^[88]\n\n### Music, dance, and arts[edit]\n\nSee also: Okir\n\nA Bajau girl clad in her traditional dressDetail of the elaborate okil\ncarvings on the stern of a vinta from Tawi-Tawi, c. 1920\n\nSama-Bajau traditional songs are handed down orally through generations. The\nsongs are usually sung during marriage celebrations (kanduli pagkawin),\naccompanied by dance (pang-igal) and musical instruments like pulau (flute),\ngabbang (xylophone), tagunggo' (kulintang gongs), biula (violin), and in\nmodern times, electronic keyboards.^[31] There are several types of Sama-Bajau\ntraditional songs, they include: isun-isun, runsai, najat, syair, nasid, bua-\nbua anak, and tinggayun.^[15]^[89]\n\nAmong the more specific examples of Sama-Bajau songs are three love songs\ncollectively referred to as Sangbayan. These are Dalling Dalling, Duldang\nDuldang, and Pakiring Pakiring.^[31] The most well-known of these three is\nPakiring Pakiring (literally \"moving the hips\"), which is more familiar to the\nTaus\u016bg in its commercialised and modernised form Dayang Dayang. The Taus\u016bg\nclaim that the song is native to their culture, and whether the song is\noriginally Taus\u016bg or Sama-Bajau remain controversial.^[31] Most Sama-Bajau\nfolk songs are becoming extinct, largely due to the waning interest of the\nyounger generations.^[15] Sama-Bajau people are also well known for weaving,\nneedlework skills, and their association with tagonggo music.\n\nIn visual arts, Sama-Bajau have an ancient tradition of carving and sculpting\nknown as okil (also okil-okil or ukkil). These were used to decorate\nhouseboats and animistic ritual objects. They were used most prominently for\nSama grave markers which are found in the ancient traditional burial grounds\nof the Sama people in some (usually uninhabited) islands of Sulu and Tawi-\nTawi. These include some of the oldest examples of okil, which are usually\ncarved from coral and limestone. Wooden carved grave markers are common later\non, usually made from or carved from the boat belonging to the deceased. These\nare usually carved into human figures that represent the deceased. These\ngraves are often decorated with buntings and food offerings, reflecting the\nancient ancestor worship (anito) traditions of the Sama. Okil later inspired\nthe very similar okir traditions of the Maranao people.^[82]^[83]\n\n### Horse culture[edit]\n\nThe West Coast Bajau horsemen in their hometown of Kota Belud, with a\nbackground of Mount Kinabalu\n\nThe more settled land-based West Coast Bajau are expert equestrians \u2013 which\nmakes them remarkable in Malaysia, where horse riding has never been\nwidespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen\nconsists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (badu sampit) with gold\nbuttons (betawi) on the front and decorated with silver floral designs\n(intiras), black or white trousers (seluar sampit) with gold lace trimmings,\nand a headpiece (podong). They carry a spear (bujak), a riding crop (pasut),\nand a silver-hilted keris dagger. The horse is also caparisoned with a\ncolourful outfit called kain kuda that also have brass bells (seriau)\nattached. The saddle (sila sila) is made from water buffalo hide and padded\nwith cloth (lapik) underneath.^[citation needed]\n\n### Society[edit]\n\nThe rehabilitation of a traditional Sama-Bajau house in the Heritage Village\nof Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia\n\nThough some Sama-Bajau headsmen have been given honorific titles like \"Datu\",\n\"Maharaja\" or \"Panglima\" by governments (like under the Sultanate of Brunei),\nthey usually only had little authority over the Sama-Bajau community. Sama-\nBajau society is traditionally highly individualistic,^[27] and the largest\npolitical unit is the clan cluster around mooring points, rarely more. Sama-\nBajau society is also more or less egalitarian, and they did not practice a\ncaste system, unlike most neighbouring ethnic groups. The individualism is\nprobably due to the generally fragile nature of their relationships with land-\nbased peoples for access to essentials like wood or water. When the\nrelationship sours or if there is too much pressure from land-based rulers,\nthe Sama-Bajau prefer to simply move on elsewhere.^[32] Greater importance is\nplaced on kinship and reciprocal labour rather than formal authority for\nmaintaining social cohesion.^[19] There are a few exceptions, however, like\nthe Jama Mapun and the Sama Pangutaran of the Philippines, who follow the\ntraditional pre-Hispanic Philippine feudal society with a caste system\nconsisting of nobles, notables, and commoners and serfs. Likely introduced by\nthe Sultanate of Sulu.^[27]\n\n## Biological characteristics[edit]\n\n### Free-diving adaptations[edit]\n\nA Sama-Bajau child in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, Philippines, diving for coins\nthrown by tourists into the water\n\nSama-Bajau are noted for their exceptional abilities in free-diving.^[90]\nDivers work long days with the \"greatest daily apnea diving time reported in\nhumans\" of greater than 5 hours per day submerged.^[91] Some Bajau\nintentionally rupture their eardrums at an early age to facilitate diving and\nhunting at sea. Many older Sama-Bajau are therefore hard of hearing.^[23]^[90]\n\nMore than a thousand years of subsistence freediving associated with their\nlife on the sea appear to have endowed the Bajau with several genetic\nadaptations to facilitate their lifestyle.^[92]^[93] A 2018 study showed that\nBajau spleens are about 50 per cent larger than those of a neighbouring land-\nbased group, the Saluan, letting them store more haemoglobin-rich blood, which\nis expelled into the bloodstream when the spleen contracts at depth, allowing\nbreath-holding dives of longer duration.^[94]^[93] This difference is\napparently related to a variant of the PDE10A gene.^[93] Other genes that\nappear to have been under selection in the Bajau include BDKRB2, which is\nrelated to peripheral vasoconstriction, involved in the diving response;^[95]\nFAM178B, a regulator of carbonic anhydrase, which is related to maintaining\nblood pH when carbon dioxide accumulates; and another one involved in the\nresponse to hypoxia.^[93] These adaptations were found to likely result from\nnatural selection, leading to a uniquely increased frequency of the relevant\nalleles within the sampled Bajau population relative to other referenced\neastern Asian populations.^[93] Members of another group, the Moken, have been\nfound to have better underwater vision than Europeans, although it is not\nknown if this trait has a genetic basis.^[96]\n\n## Depictions in popular culture[edit]\n\nThe 1982 to 1988 Sabah coat of arms depicts a kingfisher, adopted primarily to\nsymbolise the large Sama-Bajau population in Sabah^[97]\n\nIt has been suggested by some researchers that the Sama-Bajau people's visits\nto Arnhem Land gave rise to the accounts of the mysterious Baijini people in\nthe myths of Australia's Yolngu Aboriginals.^[98]\n\nIn 2010, the newly discovered squidworm, Teuthidodrilus samae, was named after\nthe Sama-Bajau people of Tawi-Tawi.^[99]\n\nThe Sama-Bajau have also been the subject of several films.

It originally referred to a different concept of a deity separate from the Abrahamic god, but Malays and other Muslim Austronesian ethnic groups usually equate Tuhan with Allah. Compare with Bathala of the Tagalogs and Kan-Laon of the Visayans.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"2010 Census of Population and Housing, Report No. 2A \u2013 Demographic and Housing Characteristics (Non-Sample Variables), Philippines\" (PDF).
