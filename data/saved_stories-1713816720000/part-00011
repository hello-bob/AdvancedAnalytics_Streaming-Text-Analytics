It's the best and actually simplest\nweb framework I have ever tried. The developer experience is the best I ever\nhad for a MVC-style framework. And I got to learn Haskell without banging my\nhead too much against the wall. Really enjoyed it :)\n\nLars Lillo Ulvestad\n\nFrontend Developer\n\nI loved the idea of Haskell but hadn't been motivated to use it for\nsignificant projects until I tried IHP. Now it's the tool I reach for first\nwhen starting any side projects. I was even able to convince a non-Haskell\nprogrammer to give it a try, and they were productive with it in a matter of\ndays.\n\nJohnston Jiaa\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nI love that it's based on Haskell, yet feels familiar like Rails: you get all\nof the superpowers of the Haskell compiler, which helps you avoid many classes\nof errors, and it's combined with the pragmatism of Rails which allows you to\nship code quickly. I'm not a Haskell expert by any means, but I was able to\nbuild multiple prototypes within a week, all of which were much higher quality\nthan I expected them to be.\n\nJohn Yoder\n\nVP Engineering, AppFolio\n\nIHP is a fantastic framework that has rekindled my love for programming. It is\nbeginner-friendly for those with little or no experience learning Haskell. It\nis easy to learn and use. It has a built-in browser-based IDE that provides\nessential features, such as a schema editor for database management and a code\ngenerator for rapid development. It has a very constructive and friendly\ncommunity. Most importantly, however, it is fun to use.\n\nJoshua Obritsch\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nIHP is the best web framework experience I have had.\n\nHenry Lambert\n\nFounder, Comhlan Ltd.\n\nIHP is ridiculously good. I hope it makes Haskell a bigger part of the web dev\nindustry because wow\n\nJames Foster\n\n@ratherforky\n\nI think in Open Source projects two things are important among other:\ncommunity and documentation. I found them in IHP.\n\nMax Bertinetti\n\nWeb Developer\n\nThis is *very* impressive work. A whole new Haskell web framework based on\nWarp server, with a non-TH ORM and type-safe templating framework. \ud83d\ude80\n\nStephen Diehl\n\nCTO & Founder\n\nDude... it's the coolest web framework I've used.... I think the people who\ntry it, love it. I say that as someone coming from ASP.NET Core and a little\nbit of the F# ones (Giraffe and Saturn). IHP blows everything I've seen out of\nthe water.\n\nEduardo Cavazos\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nThis is a really impressive project, super excited to try it. All this time\nI've been doing Haskell web development I've been wishing for features like an\nadmin UI and all the other things rails/django have had for a long time\n\nAvi Press\n\nCEO, Scarf\n\nGranted I did not build a SPA this afternoon. But using @nixpkg I have a\nfunctioning database-webserver-client USING HASKELL. It is like suddenly all\nthe effort learning Nix, Haskell and Web finally clicked into something that's\nnot a promise, but REAL, NOW.\n\nDaniel Vianna\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nI think IHP might be the killer framework for Haskell. Hashell on Rails.\n\nMartin\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nThe more I look at IHP, the more I think this is Haskell's killer framework.\nReally excellent work.\n\nWill Ricketts\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nAmazed at the quality of documentation of IHP. They are doing a splendid job\n\nGeoffrey Huntley\n\nPrincipal Developer Advocate, Gitpod\n\nIf you've enjoyed the safety and pleasureable development experience on\ndeveloping in #elmlang, and enjoyed the power, speed and of server-side\nrendered front-end with #phoenix_liveview, here comes #ihp (Integrated Haskell\nPlatform) @digitallyinduce\n\nYeong Sheng (\u6c38\u80dc)\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nThis looks really good! The ORM gives me some Ecto/Elixir vibes Grinning face\nwith smiling eyes :)\n\nLuc Thielen\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nI've often wished for a Haskell on Rails, and IHP certainly delivers. Great\ndocumentation, lots of helper scripts and utilities, boilerplate generators,\nlive reload (via Turbolinks?),\n\nand, possibly most importantly,\n\nit's totally divorced from the usual Haskell suspects\n\nMatt Parsons\n\nSoftware Developer, Mercury\n\ntbh what I'm most excited about/impressed by is the schema/controller/model\nboilerplate handling and the admin interface in general\n\nswann\n\n@evertedsphere\n\nIHP is supposed to become the Django/Rails/Phoenix of Haskell.\n\nI\u2019ve been using Django professionally for since 2013, but have started using\nIHP a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s still quite early but with surprisingly few\nrough edges, i.e. the developer ergonomics are much better than I expected. It\nhas great documentation that is improving rapidly (as opposed to many other\nHaskell libraries, which provide little more than API docs or even just the\ntyped function definitions) and offers a refreshing take on database\nmanagement and migrations.\n\nHendrik Richter\n\nCEO, evers-internet\n\nI'm really impressed by the work behind IHP, Haskell is getting a Rails\nframework finally!\n\nDomen Ko\u017ear\n\nFounder, Cachix\n\n@digitallyinduce hey! :) just discovered IHP, kind of like the rails for\nhaskell, awesome! just tweeting you to send some love <3\n\nMiguel Salas\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nReflecting on 2020, #IHP #haskell was by far the technology that made my year.\nThanks to @_marcscholten and the @digitallyinduce team for open sourcing and\ndriving this framework, it\u2019s been inspiring to see all your hard work! Looking\nforward to what 2021 will bring!
