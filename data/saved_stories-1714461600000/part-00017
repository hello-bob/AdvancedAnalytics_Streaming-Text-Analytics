Credit: Tu Wien\n\nPhysicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: For many years,\nscientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state\nof thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological\napplications. It could be used, for example, to build a nuclear clock that\ncould measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today.\nIt could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in\nphysics\u2014for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are\nactually constant or whether they change in space and time.\n\nNow this hope has come true: The long-sought thorium transition has been\nfound, and its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been\npossible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher\nenergy and then precisely track its return to its original state.\n\nThis makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had\nlittle to do with each other: Classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A\ncrucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-\ncontaining crystals.\n\nA research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now\npublished this success together with a team from the National Metrology\nInstitute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n## Switching quantum states\n\nManipulating atoms or molecules with lasers is commonplace today: If the\nwavelength of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be\nswitched from one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or\nmolecules can be measured very precisely. Many precision measurement\ntechniques are based on this, such as today's atomic clocks, but also chemical\nanalysis methods. Lasers are also often used in quantum computers to store\ninformation in atoms or molecules.\n\nFor a long time, however, it seemed impossible to apply these techniques to\natomic nuclei.\n\n\"Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states. However, it\nusually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one state to\nanother\u2014at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom or a\nmolecule,\" says Schumm. \"This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot be\nmanipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough.\"\n\nThis is unfortunate because atomic nuclei are actually the perfect quantum\nobjects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and\nmolecules and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances,\nsuch as electromagnetic fields. In principle, they would therefore allow\nmeasurements with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nPTB-researcher Johannes Tiedau in the laser lab.

This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy\nstates\u2014so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to\nchange the state of the atomic nucleus.\n\nFor a long time, however, there was only indirect evidence of the existence of\nthis transition. \"The problem is that you have to know the energy of the\ntransition extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition\nwith a laser beam,\" says Schumm.\n\n\"Knowing the energy of this transition to within one electron volt is of\nlittle use, if you have to hit the right energy with a precision of one\nmillionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.\" It is like\nlooking for a needle in a haystack\u2014or trying to find a small treasure chest\nburied on a kilometer-long island.\n\n## The thorium crystal trick\n\nSome research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them\nindividually in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Schumm and his team\nchose a completely different technique.\n\n\"We developed crystals in which large numbers of thorium atoms are\nincorporated,\" explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the crystals in Vienna\nand measured them together with the PTB team.\n\n\"Although this is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can\nnot only study individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately\n10 to the power of 17 thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser\u2014about a\nmillion times more than there are stars in our galaxy.\"\n\nThe large number of thorium nuclei amplifies the effect, shortens the required\nmeasurement time and increases the probability of actually finding the energy\ntransition.\n\nThorsten Schumm (Tu Wien, Vienna) holding one of his crystals. Credit: Foto\nWilke\n\nOn November 21, 2023, the team was finally successful: The correct energy of\nthe thorium transition was hit exactly, and the thorium nuclei delivered a\nclear signal for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched the\nstate. After careful examination and evaluation of the data, the result has\nnow been published.\n\n\"For us, this is a dream coming true,\" says Schumm. Since 2009, Schumm has\nfocused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His\ngroup as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly\nachieved important partial successes in recent years.\n\n\"Of course, we are delighted that we are now the ones who can present the\ncrucial breakthrough: The first targeted laser excitation of an atomic\nnucleus,\" says Schumm.\n\n## The dream of the atomic nucleus clock\n\nThis marks the start of a new exciting era of research: Now that the team\nknows how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for\nprecision measurements. \"From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was\nan important long-term goal,\" says Schumm.\n\n\"Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging of the pendulum as a timer,\nthe oscillation of the light that excites the thorium transition could be used\nas a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly more accurate\nthan the best atomic clocks available today.\"\n\nBut it is not just time that could be measured much more precisely in this way\nthan before. For example, the Earth's gravitational field could be analyzed so\nprecisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or\nearthquakes. The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of\nfundamental mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant?\nOr can tiny changes perhaps be measured over time?\n\n\"Our measuring method is just the beginning,\" says Schumm. \"We cannot yet\npredict what results we will achieve with it. It will certainly be very\nexciting.\"\n\nMore information: J. Tiedau et al, Laser Excitation of the Th-229 Nucleus,\nPhysical Review Letters (2024).
