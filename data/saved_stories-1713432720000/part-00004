The technology is\ngenerally considered good for your ears by reducing the overall noise levels\nyou\u2019re exposed to. But even though noise-canceling headphones are good for our\nhearing, it\u2019s a myth that the technology is entirely good for us.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nSony's New Concert Headphones Are All About That Bass\n\nLeaked Photos Give Us a Peek at the Next Generation of Sony's Excellent Noise-\nCancelling Earbuds\n\nSony Does it Again\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nSony Does it Again\n\nOnline forums are full of people complaining about ear pain, nausea, and\nheadaches from noise-canceling headphones. These forums largely share the same\nconspiracy theory: that active noise canceling (ANC) is dangerous because it\nputs harmful pressure on your eardrum. However, that\u2019s not quite right either.\nAccording to David McAlpine, the academic director of Macquarie University\nHearing, there\u2019s a simpler explanation: not hearing your environment is\nunnatural.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nSony's New Concert Headphones Are All About That Bass\n\nLeaked Photos Give Us a Peek at the Next Generation of Sony's Excellent Noise-\nCancelling Earbuds\n\nSony Does it Again\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nSony Does it Again\n\nMcAlpine says noise-canceling headphones lower the volume that reaches your\nears, which is a good thing for your hearing. Using ANC likely means you don\u2019t\nhave to drown out background noise by listening to music at high volumes. The\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention says listening to loud sounds for\nlong periods can lead to hearing impairment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, too much noise reduction could be problematic. McAlpine says your\nbrain overcompensates to ANC by turning up its internal gain. He says this\ncreates a \u201clistening loss,\u201d as operating at an increased sensitivity alters\nyour neural pathways. McAlpine wrote a paper in 2011 coining the term \u201cHidden\nHearing Loss,\u201d referring to our brain\u2019s inability to process sound, rather\nthan our ears\u2019 inability to hear it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have a listening loss, it\u2019s like changing your brain\u2019s encryption,\u201d\nMcAlpine said in an interview. \u201cEven if you can change what you\u2019re hearing,\nyou may not get back to the brain state that you had before. It\u2019s not\nreversible.\u201d\n\nMcAlpine describes what happens when people enter his university\u2019s anechoic\nchamber, a virtually soundless environment. He says people feel disoriented\nand describe a pressure in their head and ears. The sensations are remarkably\nsimilar to when people use ANC. The common thread is that your body is not\nmade to experience total silence, so people react poorly without background\nnoise. There\u2019s a disconnect between what you\u2019re experiencing and what you\u2019re\nhearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIntense sound damages your hearing, so there are situations where noise-\ncanceling headphones benefit you,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cAt the same time,\nbackground noise\u2014features of the soundscape\u2014are critical to orienting yourself\nin an environment.\u201d\n\nA 2012 study from McAlpine\u2019s coauthor on \u201cHidden Hearing Loss\u201d asked 17\nsubjects to wear earplugs for a week. Eleven participants developed tinnitus,\na common medical condition where someone perceives a ringing or buzzing noise\nwith no external source. The study suggests that audio deprivation can affect\nhow your brain processes sound, even if your ears are unharmed. However, the\ncondition disappeared after subjects removed their earplugs, so you shouldn\u2019t\nworry about your noise-canceling headphones giving you long-term tinnitus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while ANC can be good for your ears, it could be altering your brain\u2019s\nlistening ability. The truth is, there\u2019s a tradeoff every time you use ANC.\nYou\u2019re hearing the world at a different sensitivity, what McAlpine calls an\n\u201caltered gain state.\u201d Spending enough time in this state can make it difficult\nfor your brain to \u201clisten\u201d at normal audio levels.\n\n\u201cI do think that we\u2019ve let the big tech companies co-opt our listening habits,\nmonetize it, and sell it back to us,\u201d said McAlpine. \u201cTheir solution to the\nhearing problem is probably creating a listening problem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Origins of the Myth\n\nThere are a couple of myths surrounding noise-canceling headphones. The first\nis courtesy of Big Tech, which claims that noise-canceling headphones are your\nsolution to the noisy world. As McAlpine says, they\u2019re solving one problem\nwith another, an all too familiar strategy in tech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second myth is that ANC is somehow bad for your ears. Wirecutter\u2019s testing\nfound that Apple Airpods and other popular headphones reduced noise by about\n10 dBs, which may not be as effective as they claim but is still better than\nnothing.\n\nANC works by emitting a sound wave that\u2019s exactly opposite to your\nenvironment\u2019s noise. The two waves, from the environment and the headphones,\neffectively neutralize each other, resulting in that artificial silence you\u2019ve\ncome to love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s understandable to believe that because something hurts your\nears, it\u2019s bad for your ears. And the myth is rooted in some truth. If you do\nfind ANC painful in any way, the technology could be messing with your brain\u2019s\nperception of your environment and triggering some kind of instinctual\ndiscomfort.\n\n## Why It\u2019s Pervasive\n\nNoise-canceling headphones have become fairly commonplace in our society\nbecause the modern world is increasingly noisy. Cars, planes, construction,\nand electronics contribute to a far noisier world than our ancestors had.\nLikewise, our hearing problems are getting worse, as our brains and ears\nstruggle to keep up with the changing times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue noise-canceling headphones try to address is a serious one. Noise\npollution has been linked to a higher rate of cardiovascular disease, and it\u2019s\nbeing increasingly recognized as a harmful pollutant, similar to air and\nlight. Plus, other studies have found that noise-canceling headphones can help\nimprove your focus.\n\nSo we\u2019re left with a tradeoff. Noise-canceling headphones may protect your\nears, but non-stop use of them can alter your brain\u2019s listening ability.\nIdeally, you should only use noise-canceling headphones when you\u2019re being\nexposed to excess noise. On trains and planes, or in a noisy city, they\u2019re\nprobably a good idea. However, if you\u2019re in a quiet environment, you may be\nbetter off just listening to the world around you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
