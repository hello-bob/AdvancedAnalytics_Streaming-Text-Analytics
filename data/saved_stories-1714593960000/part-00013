There were no cell phone towers\nanywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents\nhad died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no\nidea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now\nthat he'd paid attention to the sun, and thought he'd figured out which way\nwas north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about\n30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how\ndark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight,\nhe's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on\nsome sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an\numbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade,\npours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that\ndesperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like\nit might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the\nsunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels\nsunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is\nreally getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol\nand coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to\nkeep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the\npoison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day, he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking\nat least three miles an hour, according to his watch for over ten hours. That\nmeans that if his estimate was right, he should be close to the town.\nUnfortunately, he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek\nbed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV.\nHe figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry\ncreek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's\nclose, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of\nthese hills. That'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he\nfinds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up\nand turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and\nhis mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He\u2019s so thirsty that he\ncan't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd\nforgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the\nnight before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without\nwater, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a\nlittle longer, in the best situations. The desert heat and having to walk and\nsweat isn't the best situation to be in without water. Unless he finds water,\nhe figures, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses out his mouth with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits\nfor a while after spitting that little bit out to see if his mouth goes numb,\nor he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his\nmind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find\nwater, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from\nhere? Does he keep walking the same way as yesterday (assuming that he still\nknows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what\nto do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he\nwas heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the\nleft of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of\nhours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and\nthen stops. He starts getting worried at that. He knows that when you stop\nsweating, you\u2019re in trouble. It\u2019s usually right before heat stroke..\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any\nlonger - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock,\ntakes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it,\nmaking it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked\nthroat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another\nmouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures\nthat since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some\ndifference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him. If he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to\nmake you sick: their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for\nthe ethanol content. He can handle throwing up if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever\nmoved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds,\nlizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's\ncareful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the\nwiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself and keep\ngoing.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts\nin it, or at least he thinks he remembers it; he's getting woozy enough and\ntired enough that he's not sure what he remembers anymore or if he's\nhallucinating. He thinks he remembers it, so he heads off into it, trying to\nget to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure anymore.\nHe's not even sure how long he's been walking anymore. Is it still morning?\nHas it moved into afternoon, and the sun is going down again? It must be\nafternoon; it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes from when he was driving over the sand in his SUV. At least\nhe doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nAll the same, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He\nfigures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything\nfrom there that can help him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up, since he'll\njust fall down again. He keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten\nto the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert, crawling through the sand\non his hands and knees. It would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only\nhis clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the\ncartoons always had ragged clothes, but his have lasted without any rips so\nfar. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand\nyears from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand\nout, give them a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat\nwere wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he\nstruggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is\nsand. Sand and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the\nrocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more\nsand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle and starts removing the\ncap when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At\nthe bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a\nflat area, in the sand. He stops opening the bottle and tries to look closer.\nThe area seems to be circular, and it's dark: darker than the sand, and there\nseems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is, so he\nlooks as hard as he can but still can't tell from here. He's going to have to\ngo down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back into his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble; he's not going to be able\nto keep his balance. After a couple more sliding, tottering steps, he falls\nand starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot that he thinks he's\ncaught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as\nit goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his\neyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he\nclears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the\nsand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSeeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand still there, he crawls towards\nit. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to\nget up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he\nfigures as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll\nlikely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. It\u2019s hard to focus, and lifting his head up to look takes so much\neffort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of\ncrawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now\ncrawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a\npattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the\npattern is, so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center where his\nblurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are\nso burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone,\nin the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead,\ndoesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the\nnice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying,\nand just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women\ncarrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then\nhe'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in\nthe middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent: he rolls over and leans back trying to sit up on the stone. After a\nfew seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of\nstone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole\nabout two inches in diameter and sticking about four or five feet out of the\nstone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod is what must be a fifteen foot long desert\ndiamondback rattlesnake, with a hovering tail and rattle seemingly prepared to\nstart rattling, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run\naway. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it: his final\nresting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from\nthis spot.\n\nWell, at least dying from a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and flicks\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment,\nthen goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake has no interest in biting him. It hasn't rattled yet -\nthat\u2019s a good sign. Maybe he isn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He is still very woozy; he feels like\nhe might pass out soon. The sun still beats down on him even though he is now\non cool stone. He still doesn't have anything to drink. Although maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone doesn't look natural. Nor does that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone must have built this. Maybe they\nare still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake is even\ntheir pet, and that's why it isn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but he\u2019s too dry. All that comes\nout is a coughing or wheezing sound. There's no way he's going to be able to\ntalk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the\nwiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls out the bottle, almost losing his\nbalance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't\nhave much time left by his reckoning before he passes out.\n\nHe gets the bottle open, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some\nof the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He\ncoughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head back towards the snake. That's where the sound seemed to\ncome from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker\nhidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try\nasking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty\nanymore. I've been without water for a long time. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls\nforward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up\nand grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers: the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - it feels like his shirt has two holes in it - two puncture holes. They\nmatch up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He has been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy anymore. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty anymore - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty anymore? Did you give me a drink\nbefore you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty\nanymore? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the\nwindshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you\nreal? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't\ngive you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works, it's what I do. I bite. Plus\nI don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting\naround here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake\nthat could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great -\nhe was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer\nthirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in\nthis sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone\nbeneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of\nthirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank\nit, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the\nwiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if\nyou drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get\nthree requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own\njoke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel\nused to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to\njust call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He\nsaid that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You\ncan call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't\noffer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat\nthreatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\"\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\nvenom...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What\ndo you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all\nof them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider.\n\"Second, the venom is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink.\nThat's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty\nany more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent\n- now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body\nwill conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just\nfrom the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been\nchanged.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In\nyour current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming\nyou get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his\nown humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake\nemotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second\nrequest and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot venomous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while.\nMaybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that\nbottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out\nto drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still\ncolor wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing\nthat you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you\nwon't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little\nnervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are\nyou, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to\nyourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before\nyou ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for\nthat matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive,\nand then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent.\nBut what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still\ncould only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my\nopinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune\nto most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring\naccident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents\nwell. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long\ntime? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a\nchange to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a\nchange to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after\nthis one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules\nfor the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request.\nYou know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health\ndoesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need\nto sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the venom, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be\nable to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his\njeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans\nhave a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one\nmy size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it\nalready doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit\nwith this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something\ninstead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to\nhear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\" answered\nNate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip\nup food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it\nfor you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that\nis,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is\nyou find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No\nthanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\nsceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\nand look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark stone\nthey were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\nrepresentation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\nwas coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\nleft the trunk to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\nlooked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded\nin the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\nsetting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\nnight out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\nstood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said Jack.\n\"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to\nhead back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters\nfor long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this\ntime. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way\nhe'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by the way the\ncrow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it\nin about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early\ntomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then\nsat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out\nright now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff.\n\"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\nfigured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could\nnever quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across\nthe ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\ncount years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do\nremember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of\nyears, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind\nthat I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have\nbeen. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a\n'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of\nthe stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\nbigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\nif it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one\nday, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\nsomething for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\nbeen here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\ncoils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the\nstone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the\nstone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and\nlooked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could\nsee in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was\nsuddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\nthat way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\nvoice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\ngrinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\nJack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\nreally do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought the\nvoice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\nwould anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\nOr maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad,\nthere should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the\nrules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't\nthink to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless\nthey agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be\nbound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd\nlet me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do you\nwant to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\nthe world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\nthat! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Jack. \"Any of those bound to\nsecrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\nanother. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think,\nor so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted\nwith humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he\nnever pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\nthe same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of humanity?\nI get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\ndecision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\nbad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\nup to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to\nknow.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible?\nCouldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\" protested\nJack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to try\nyour best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\ngetting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\none bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read\nand brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the\nsand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you first\ntold him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and\nthen asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you\nhave to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you\nreally think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it.\nYou won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious again. \"And\nyou'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with his\nthird request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, \"Wisdom,\nJack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it to\nme.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped him,\nmaybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his shoulder\nat Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward.\nLike he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to\nface away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\n\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,\nJack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like\nit needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got that,\" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body\ntense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.\n\n\"And,\" continued Nate, from his new position, \"do you remember that you'll\nturn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!\" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening\nup and turning around. \"Purple?!\" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight\nJack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without\nthe snake wrapped around it.\n\nJack heard, from behind him, Nate's \"Just Kidding!\" right before he felt the\nnow familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.\n\nJack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet\nextending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to the\nwind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been recently\nbitten.\n\nNate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped\nbulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever, his\ntongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he was\nstill awake.\n\nOccasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he\nthought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.\n\n\"Nate, do accidents count?\"\n\nNate lifted his head a little bit. \"What do you mean, Jack?\"\n\nJack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. \"You know,\naccidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does that\nstill wipe out humanity?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that if\nyou start feeling wobbly,\" said Nate with some amusement.\n\nA little later - \"Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it,\" answered Nate.\n\n\"No,\" Jack shook his head, \"I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull\nthe lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a\nrock?\"\n\n\"Yes, those should work,\" replied Nate. \"Though I'm not sure how complicated\nyou could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote\ncontrol for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by\nthe next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that in\nthe past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they\nwouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or whatever\nhad disappeared.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" said Jack, \"Cool.\" Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him off\nof the stone and looked up into the sky.\n\n\"Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too, right?\"\nasked Jack.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Nate, \"it was. He lived 167 years, Jack.\"\n\n\"Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long. Do\nyou know what he died of, Nate?\"\n\n\"He died of getting tired of living, Jack,\" Nate said, sounding somewhat sad.\n\nJack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.\n\nNate looked back. \"Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in society.\nHe figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start questioning\nit, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He faked his\ndeath once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and he could\nstay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he liked the\nattention. Most of the time, anyway.\n\n\"His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't stay\nin society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend time\ntalking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he told\nme he'd had enough. It was his time.\"\n\n\"And then he just died?\" asked Jack.\n\nNate shook his head a little. \"He made his fourth request, Jack. There's only\none thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.\n\nAfter a bit Nate continued, \"He told me that he was tired, that it was his\ntime. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always\nhad.\n\nAfter another pause, Nate finished, \"Samuel's body disappeared off the stone\nwith the sunrise.\"\n\nJack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his\nmemories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.\n\nJack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with the\nmorning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except that his\nstomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.\n\nSo, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to get\nback, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long walk\nback to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made it back\neasily.\n\nJack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,\nlittle worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert\nand walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with a\ntow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV. They\nfound it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without\nincident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's lever,\nthough their path back didn't come within sight of it.\n\nBefore the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a book\nstore, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to avoid\nany more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see Nate.\n\nJack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new\nbackpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then\nstarted walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he\nknew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,\nand shouldn't really raise suspicions.\n\nJack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.\nSome things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,\nothers that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate, and\nthen headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but that he\nhad things to do first.\n\nOver four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought a\nlaptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,\nspecial filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a\nspecial keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot rattlesnake\nwould be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out its location to\nthe satellite.\n\nAfter that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him\nfairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.\n\nAfter the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he'd\nbeen given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years, working\nin a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile any more.\nJack went back to school.\n\nEventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps\nbecause of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote, and\nhe became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started\ntraveling around the country for book signings and readings.\n\nBut, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.\n\nOn one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been a\nfountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing\nSamuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace Samuel\nin Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this visit\nNate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at Jack,\nand then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's\nsilence, sat down and waited.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Nate spoke. \"Jack, I have someone to introduce you to.\"\n\nJack looked surprised. \"Someone to introduce me to?\" Jack looked around, and\nthen looked carefully back at Nate. \"This something to do with the Big Guy?\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Nate. \"This is more personal. I want you to meet my son.\"\nNate looked over at the nearest sand dune. \"Sammy!\"\n\nJack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the\ndune and up to the stone base of the lever.\n\n\"Yo, Jack,\" said the new, much smaller snake.\n\n\"Yo, Sammy\" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. \"Named after Samuel, I assume?\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around\nfor me?\" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the edge\nof the stone and looked across the sands. \"When Samuel first told me about the\nworld, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I\nwanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the other\ndeserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to have that\nchance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been.\n\n\"He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear\nthat it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have\nthat. Think you can do that for me, Jack?\"\n\nJack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even\njoke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. \"Yeah, I can do\nthat for you, Nate. Is that all you need?\" Jack could sense that was something\nmore.\n\nNate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,\n\"Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet\nya!\" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.\n\nNate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. \"Jack, this is my\nfirst son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to\nknow what it took for me to find a mate.\" Nate grinned to himself. \"But\nanyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I\nneeded a replacement.\"\n\nJack considered this for a minute. \"So, you're ready to come see the world,\nand you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?\"\n\nNate shook his head. \"No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've\nalready figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave\nhere. And I'm ready. It's my time to die.\"\n\nJack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about this -\nprobably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would be like\nto be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another hundred or\ntwo hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself. Jack could\nunderstand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said was, \"What do\nyou want me to do?\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around\nthe world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here and\ntake over. Two - give me the fourth request.\n\n\"I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of\nold age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now. I\nneed to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be able\nto die. And I need you to kill me.\n\n\"I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And\nI've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so\nthat's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.\n\nNate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. \"I'd say\nan axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground or a\nchopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of going out.\nA dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work, even on me.\n\n\"You willing to do that for me, Jack?\" Nate turned back to look at Jack.\n\n\"Yeah, Nate,\" replied Jack solemnly, \"I think I can handle that.\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Good!\" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, \"Sammy!\nJack's about ready to leave!\" Then quietly, \"Thanks, Jack.\"\n\nJack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it\nback to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then headed\ninto the desert with Sammy following.\n\nOver the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through\ne-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting every\ncountry in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a natural\ngift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up acting as a\ntranslator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to keep the\ntalking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were nearing the end\nof their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a few times. While\nthere were several people that had seen enough to startle them greatly, nobody\nhad enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few wild rumors and stories\nfollowed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the newspapers or the public\nin general.\n\nWhen they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some\nundersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally\ndrew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was\nstalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that\nJack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans\ncould be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.\n\nSo, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told\nJack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from\nhis dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to\nJapan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by\ngetting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as much\nas he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was definitely\ncompetent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to head back and\nsee Nate.\n\nWhen they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he and\nSammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up Sammy and\nthe sword, and they headed for the desert.\n\nWhen they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those years\nago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like walking\nall of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to figure the\ntravel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either have to spend\nthe night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.\n\nAs Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his resolve,\nhe decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was only going to\nbe this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks afterward. They\nought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they drove, and then\nthey could get it over tonight.\n\nJack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of sight\nof the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out into the\ndesert.\n\nEverything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been nursing\nthe RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds, revving\nthe engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to the dunes,\nJack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed up the first\none. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd decided to try\ndriving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing traction. Jack was\nhaving to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to keep from losing\ncontrol each time they came over the top and slid down the other side. Sammy\nhad come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and laughing at Jack's\ndriving.\n\nAs they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw\nthat this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,\nwaited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV\nstarted slipping down the other side.\n\nJack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped\nthe brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and\nfaster.\n\nJack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were\nheading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for it.\nIf Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end\nhumanity.\n\nJack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't\nworking. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,\nJack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the\nlever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit\nthe lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer\naway.\n\nJack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a\nlittle bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just\nright.\n\nThe RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the sand.\nJust before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that they\nwere still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something else\nthat he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped around the\nlever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the stone, waiting\nfor them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of the lever that\nJack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV was already\nstarting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the sand and there\nwas no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the lever to the other\nside.\n\nJack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the\nlever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy realized\nthe same thing.\n\nJack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.\nShouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, \"Better Nate than lever!\",\nhe ran over the snake.\n\nTHE END\n\n### Dash tips:\n\nXvap3LRsVTu6hhiuse4PL8PVbzops66Bmc\n\nSend me email\n\n", "frontpage": false}
