What could go wrong?\n\nPhotograph: Jonathan Kitchen/Getty Images\n\nAt some point this weekend, Airchat cofounder Naval Ravikant had to close off\nnew sign-ups to his app. After releasing a new version Friday, Airchat was\nquickly overloaded with people thirsting for a glimpse\u2014or an audio snippet\u2014of\nSilicon Valley\u2019s newest fad. Ravikant had given a small number of users\nunlimited invites to share with friends, and it backfired.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an influx of new users, so we\u2019re turning off the invitation\ncapability for a little while,\u201d Ravikant said on Sunday.\n\nRavikant didn\u2019t say this to WIRED, or on Twitter or Threads. He said it in a\nshort audio post within his own app, accompanied by a transcription. If a\nvoice note drops in a forest and only Silicon Valley\u2019s early adopters are\nthere to hear it, does it make a noise? Ravikant seems confident it will.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nAirchat marries the feed aspect of Twitter with the audio-first format of\nClubhouse, a daunting combo. After launching the app and being prompted to\nfollow some contacts, you\u2019re put into a minimalist feed of text blocks. These\ntext blocks are actually transcriptions of audio bytes. The app automatically\njumps from voice note to voice note, unless you think to tap the Play/Pause\nbutton wedged in the lower right corner of the app.\n\nTo post an audio note yourself, you hold down the Audio/Video button at the\nbottom of the app, talk, and let go. (From what I\u2019ve seen so far, no one\nreally uses the Video option.) If you\u2019d prefer not to post publicly, there\u2019s\nalso a DM option. Either way, there\u2019s no typing allowed.\n\nAirchat has confounding elements. Voice notes are posted to the Airchat feed\nthe moment you release the Audio/Video button, so you\u2019d better get it right\nthe first try. There\u2019s an option to delete after you\u2019ve spoken, if you decide\nyou weren\u2019t happy with your byte, but I didn\u2019t notice the trash can icon until\nsomeone pointed it out to me. Sorting through multiple responses to a voice\nnote is less than intuitive. You can\u2019t respond to every voice note or see\nevery response in a given thread, and it\u2019s not clear why. It\u2019s also unclear\nhow long a single Airchat message can be; one user told me his limit was 45\nseconds, but in a test I was able to record for about a minute before I opted\nto stop.\n\nAnd all voice notes play back at 2X speed by default, giving everyone a\nvaguely hyper, just-woke-up-and-slammed-my-Philz-then-cold-plunged vibe. If\nyou hold down the Play/Pause button in the lower right corner of the app you\ncan adjust the speed, which is, again, less than intuitive.\n\nThis new Airchat is apparently a reincarnated version of the app that was\nreleased without fanfare last spring. Brian Norgard, the longtime chief\nproduct officer of Tinder, had first envisioned it as a peer-to-peer voice\nmessaging app. Ravikant, the founder of AngelList, joined Norgard one year ago\nand became \u201csuper involved\u201d in the app\u2019s development a couple of months ago.\nThen the new Airchat entered the chat.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Science\n\nIt Takes Guts, Not College, to Fix Wind Turbines for a Living\n\nCaitlin Kelly\n\n  * Gear\n\nUse Apple Shortcuts to Build the Ultimate Daily Digital Journal\n\nJustin Pot\n\nRavikant said most of the funding for Airchat has come from his own fund, as\nwell as from Jeff Fagnan, a founding partner at Accomplice Ventures. \u201c[OpenAI\nCEO] Sam Altman threw in a check, kind of blindly,\u201d Ravikant said. He\ncommunicated all of this to me in a public response on Airchat, after politely\ndeclining to respond to my DMs and insisting our conversation should happen in\npublic. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a side-channel, DM-based interview. That\u2019s the old world\nthat we are leaving behind,\u201d he told me. (In the old world, as in the new\nworld, conducting an interview synchronously is almost always ... preferable.)\n\nSo far the Airchat feed appears to be filled with tech enthusiasts, early\nadopters, venture capitalists, and journalists. There\u2019s lots of Bitcoin\nposting. Winefluencer Gary Vaynerchuk is on the app. So is Y Combinator CEO\nGarry Tan. This weekend Tan posted, \u201cBreakfast is the first step to greatness.\nWhat are you eating this morning?\u201d So far it has more than 96 audio responses.\nSocial media is back, baby.\n\nAirchat has AI. What doesn\u2019t? The app\u2019s deployment, though, is quietly\nsensible. The transcripts for each Airchat voice note appear almost\nimmediately, and they\u2019re good. Pronounced \u201cUms\u201d appear within the transcript,\nbut other slight pauses and filler words are edited out. When I used the word\n\u201cAirchat\u201d in a voice note, it first showed as \u201cerror chat,\u201d then quickly self-\ncorrected. The app appears to be able to recognize and transcribe other\nlanguages, too; one user spoke in Russian and the transcript appeared in\nCyrillic, while another spoke in Moroccan Arabic, known as darija, and then\nmarveled in a follow-up voice note at how good the transcription was.\n\nSo what will happen to all of this voice data? Ravikant claimed that the\ncreators of Airchat have no intention of training a large language model on\nuser voices and making \u201cweird synthetic clones of you.\u201d He also said he\nwouldn\u2019t sell Airchat data to another company building AI models, especially\ngiven how relatively small the app is and how uncategorized its data. Airchat\nwill, however, likely use people\u2019s voice data to train a model that improves\nits own audio and transcription functions. If you\u2019re in, you\u2019ve opted in.\n\nI asked Ravikant about whether some AI company might still scrape Airchat data\nwithout a formal agreement. He replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll block them, we\u2019ll sue them, and\nthen, if I have a battery of orbital satellites, we\u2019d nuke them from orbit.\u201d\n\nAirchat\u2019s monetization plans are less clear. Navikant hasn\u2019t said anything\nabout charging for access. The current format seems to lend itself to audio\nads, but there\u2019s always the risk of making the app unlistenable.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of content moderation when people\u2019s unfiltered sound\nbytes are posted to a timeline the moment they release the virtual microphone.\nOne troll seemed to be pushing the boundaries of it on Sunday, cursing the\napp\u2019s founders, calling the app \u201cfucking trash,\u201d and in as many words telling\nthe founders to, uh, perform fellatio. The voice note is still there. So is a\nthread where two users go back and forth telling a story about \u201cgay Jewish\nteens\u201d and \u201cneo-Nazi killers.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Science\n\nIt Takes Guts, Not College, to Fix Wind Turbines for a Living\n\nCaitlin Kelly\n\n  * Gear\n\nUse Apple Shortcuts to Build the Ultimate Daily Digital Journal\n\nJustin Pot\n\nOver the weekend an Airchat channel was created and named simply: War. More\nthan 529 members have joined. Conversation topics ranged from Iran\u2019s drone\nattack on Israel to the war in Gaza to US tensions with China. People shared\nstrong opinions, unconfirmed news reports, claims of having \u201cdone a little\nresearch,\u201d thoughts on \u201ceconomical weapons,\u201d and predictions about the price\nof oil. \u201cRequesting more unwarranted opinions from VCs on geopolitics,\u201d one\nAirchatter said.\n\nThe conversation, while asynchronous, was reminiscent of what you used to find\non Clubhouse, the live-audio conversation app that went viral during the\npandemic before flaming out. It, too, was plagued by the moderation challenges\nthat come with an audio-based platform. Last fall, Clubhouse relaunched as a\n... place for asynchronous voice notes. Never say there aren\u2019t any new ideas.\n\nAirchat\u2019s stated policies emphasize self-moderation: You can mute or block a\nperson, but that\u2019s an isolated solution to the thornier problem of harmful\ncontent or misinformation festering on an app. It also states that it won\u2019t\nremove people platform-wide for polite disagreement, or over politics, but it\nwill remove people for harassment, impersonation, foul behavior, and illegal\ncontent.\n\nI scanned Ravikant\u2019s Airchat feed to see if he had posted anything more\nspecific about moderation. I couldn\u2019t find it but did notice that, late on\nSunday, he had opened the app back up to iOS users. He also appeared to be\nhaving a hard time sleeping. \u201cGod, I have to go to sleep,\u201d he posted. His\nvoice sounded tired. \u201cBut I\u2019m having, like, the best conversation in DMs. I\u2019m\nhaving the best conversation here.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
