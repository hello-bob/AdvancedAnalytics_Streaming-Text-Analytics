It\nstands for \u201cMobile PCI Express Module\u201d, and is basically intended as a GPU\ninterface for laptops with PCIe, but there\u2019s way more to it \u2013 it can work for\nany high-power high-throughput PCIe device, with a fair few DisplayPort links\nif you need them!\n\nYou will see MXM sockets in older generations of laptops, barebones desktop\nPCs, servers, and even automotive computers \u2013 certain generations of Tesla\ncars used to ship with MXM-socketed Nvidia GPUs! Given that GPUs are in vogue\ntoday, it pays to know how you can get one in low-profile form-factor and\navoid putting a giant desktop GPU inside your device.\n\nI only had a passing knowledge of the MXM standard until a bit ago, but my\nfriend, [WifiCable], has been playing with it for a fair bit now. On a long\nDiscord call, she guided me through all the cool things we should know about\nthe MXM standard, its history, compatibility woes, and hackability potential.\nI\u2019ve summed all of it up into this article \u2013 let\u2019s take a look!\n\nThis article has been written based on info that [WifiCable] has given me,\nand, it\u2019s also certainly not the last one where I interview a hacker and\ncondense their knowledge into a writeup. If you are interested, let\u2019s chat!\n\n## Simple Wireup, Generous Payoff\n\nYes, an Intel A380m card in MXM format\n\nAn MXM card has a whole side dedicated to its gold finger PCB edge connector.\nWith 285 pins, there are a whole lot of interfaces you can get out of these,\nand all of them are within hobbyist reach! To make an MXM card work, you don\u2019t\nneed much, either.\n\nFor an MXM card to work, first, you need to be able to provide between 60 W\nand 100 W of power, with the ability to impose a power consumption limit on\nthe card. The standard says that the voltage can be anywhere from 7 V to 20 V.\nThis is obviously intended for laptop use, where the main power rail can\neither be at charger voltage or battery voltage, and it results in high\nefficiency \u2013 you don\u2019t need a separate buck-boost regulator for, say, 12 V.\n\nThen, you need a PCIe link of up to 16x, but because PCIe is cool like that,\neven a 1x link will work as long as you won\u2019t be sad if the GPU is\nbottlenecked by it. You also might need to set up a few control GPIOs, like\nthe card enable pin, and the power limit pin that tells the card whether it\nshould run in lower-power mode or not. Plus, for some cards, you might need to\ngive the card 5 V at an amp or two \u2013 the standard requires that, but it\u2019s not\nclear why. Technically, you can even connect an MXM card to a Raspberry Pi 5\nor CM4, as long as you can procure enough power from some external source \u2013 if\nyou want a low-footprint GPU paired with a Pi, MXM makes that firmly within\nyour reach.\n\nIn return, you get a wide array of interfaces. The coolest part is,\nundoubtedly, DisplayPort. You can get up to six 4-lane DP links out of an MXM\ncard, as long as the GPU chip is okay with it. You might also be able to get\nVGA, LVDS, and even HDMI/DVI. MXM GPUs do support DP++, a DisplayPort mode\nthat outputs HDMI-compatible signals, and you only need a few external\ncomponents.\n\nYou also get a good few low-level interfaces, both for practical and debug\npurposes. Need to control a small fan? There\u2019s a PWM output you might be able\nto use for fan control, and a tach signal input! Backlight control for an LCD\npanel you\u2019ve wired up? There\u2019s PWM for that too. Want to poke at the GPUs\u2019\nJTAG? The MXM socket has pins defined for that. It\u2019s up to the cards to\nsupport or not support a lot of stuff that the MXM standard defines, so you\nmight still benefit from a small MCU, but having those things seriously helps\nin embedded applications.\n\nSpeaking of JTAG and vendor freedom, of course, there are OEM pins \u2013 since\nanyone can produce MXM GPUs and systems, and the MXM standard has lasted for\ndecades now, manufacturers like to put their own spin on them. You can often\nfigure things out from MXM-equipped laptop schematics, and, sometimes it\u2019s\nnecessary to check a few. See, giving freedom to individual implementers is a\ndouble-edged sword, and MXM is an outstanding illustration on how modular\nstandards can go wrong for regular users.\n\n## Compatible, Mostly\n\nLooking at MXM, you might rejoice \u2013 thinking about upgrading and repairing\nyour laptop well beyond the few years that the warranty period covers.\nHowever, manufacturers are not exactly interested in that. For them, the\nincentive structure for using MXM is usually completely different.\n\nFor a start, producing a board with five BGAs can in certain cases be easier\nthan producing a board with fifteen, which is what you often have to do if you\nhave to put a GPU and RAM on your board as opposed to an MXM module. And, for\noffering multiple GPU configurations of the same model in a way that lets the\nmanufacturer cover multiple points on the supply-demand chart, it might just\nbe easier to produce an array of MXM cards and then pair them to an array of\nGPU-less mainboards that have their own configurations. Not always \u2013 which is\npart of why you don\u2019t see it lately.\n\nThis is not a standard-defined shape for an MXM card.\n\nSo, while you might like upgradability and repairability, you might find that\nMXM GPUs are not often offered as replacement parts for sale. And, what\u2019s\nworse, if you\u2019ve found an MXM card available for a different laptop, there\u2019s\nno guarantee it will fit.\n\nFor instance, some cards are of the MXM 3.0 standard, while others are MXM\n3.1, with slight but important differences like support for two DP ports on\nLVDS pins. However, most of the real-world differences are from either lack of\nstandardization or from manufacturers straight up ignoring the standard.\n\nThe first hurdle is the most obvious, and that is the mechanical footprint.\nThe MXM standard defines two possible card shapes, A variant or B variant,\nincluding things like heatsink and retention screw hole layout, and even\ncomponent height for heatsink compatibility purposes. Many laptop\nmanufacturers ignore these rules, producing cards of wacky shapes, or worse,\nshapes that almost match but are slightly incompatible in a subtle but severe\nway.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the VBIOS and driver problems. Many MXM cards have an onboard\nBIOS chip, whereas other cards rely on the laptop to feed them their BIOS\nduring boot. If your card is of the latter type, you might need to add a UEFI\nmodule or hack the code. Alternatively, some cards ship with unpopulated flash\nchip footprints or unflashed chips on them, so you can give a BIOS to your\ncard with a bit of soldering and flashing, as long as you can find an image\nthat works.\n\nAs for drivers, Nvidia stands out there. Many Windows Nvidia drivers for MXM\ncards run hardware checks that tie the MXM cards to hardware IDs of laptops,\nand refuse to install the drivers if the card is installed in a laptop it was\nnot expected to be installed in. You used to be able to work around it, but\nnowadays the driver signing mechanism severely limits the things you can do, a\nmechanism that in Windows has no sane leeway for user-tweaked drivers and, as\nsuch, acts as an effective way of proprietary vendor lock-in. So, if you want\nto upgrade your Nvidia MXM card and you run Windows, you might run into a bit\nof a brick wall.\n\n## Some Outright Hostile\n\nContinuing this line of reasoning, there are slots that look like MXM but\naren\u2019t MXM, and I\u2019m not talking about SMARC, which is a fun SoM standard\nreusing MXM slots, just like Pi Compute Modules reuse DDR sockets. No, I\u2019m\ntalking about manufacturers like Lenovo, who have added MXM socketed GPUs into\nsome of their more recent laptops, but with completely different pinouts. They\ndon\u2019t advertise their slots as MXM, at least, which is a bonus.\n\nWhere are the power pins? Who knows!\n\nStill, these cards are easy to confuse for actual MXM, and they fit into the\nslot all the same. The most firey factor is the power pin layout \u2013 a\nmindboggling change that has been made on some laptop models that can destroy\nyour card and laptop even if the card fits mechanically. On one side of the\nMXM card, there\u2019s an array of power pins \u2013 a matching amount of VIN and GND,\noften visible as a single large gold finger. For some unimaginable reason, a\nfew manufacturers have made cards that remap the entire pinout and\nspecifically put those power pins on the opposite side.\n\nThe pinout swapping is bad enough, but it\u2019s the power pin swapping that really\ngets us, and gets every piece of tech involved to release the magic smoke,\ntoo. And then, there\u2019s the few outright criminal cases where manufacturers\nhave put power pins on both sides of the pinout. You can easily notice this\nwhen you look at your card, but you have to know to look out for it.\n\nThe MXM standard can\u2019t prevent most of these problems, and whatever it tries\nto limit, laptop manufacturers can freely bypass. There\u2019s no certification or\ncompliance checks; fundamentally, in laptops, MXM isn\u2019t used for your\nconvenience \u2013 it\u2019s used for the convenience of the manufacturer. If you look\nat your old MXM-equipped laptop and think that you might be able to upgrade\nits GPU, remember that there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\n\nAll of these things, of course, don\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t hack on MXM\notherwise. Just remember that, whatever you build, might be more specific to a\ncertain breed of MXM slots in certain laptop lineups, than to MXM as a\nstandard.\n\n## Still Hackable Anyway\n\nHow about a few good MXM hacks to show you what you can do? Remember,\nfundamentally, MXM is a high-power connection with a high-bandwidth PCIe link\non it, which lets you pull some wonderful tricks!\n\nFor instance, here\u2019s an MXM adapter for certain kinds of iMacs, that lets you\ninstall an NVMe SSDs into the MXM slot of your trusty iMac while preserving\nthe MXM GPU connections! It involves changing a chipset strap to enable\nbifurcation, so there\u2019s no power-hungry PCIe switch involved, and going from\nx16 to x8 on your MXM GPU won\u2019t involve any notable bandwidth loss either. So,\nyou can replace your SATA HDD or SSD with a speedy modern NVMe drive, that\nprobably is way cheaper too!\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be hard to make a generic MXM to NVMe adapter, in general \u2013 and,\n[WifiCable] has a template KiCad project for you. Just like with mPCIe and M.2\ncards, an MXM card is a PCB, after all, 1.2mm thick. You might be worried\nabout leaving your laptop GPU-less, but many laptops with MXM cards still have\nan iGPU that is enabled whenever the MXM card is removed, though, that\u2019s not a\nguarantee. We might see an MXM to Oculink adapter too, at some point!\n\nThere are also a few adapters to reuse MXM cards on the market, cheap and\nexpensive alike. That kind of adapter is good for checking any MXM cards you\nhave laying around, and on the cheap ones, you might even be able to solder\nthe extra HDMI port on, as long as you get 5 V from somewhere. Sadly, none of\nthem are open-source \u2013 yet.\n\nThis is an MXM tinkering adapter board from [WifiCable], exposing as much of\nMXM as humanly possible, with a wide range of power input options. Every\nsingle option is on either pin headers or SMD resistors, able to satisfy\nwhichever obscure feature an MXM card might need, and tap at interfaces that\nmanufacturers don\u2019t expect you to tap. It\u2019s a decently complex design, still\nyet to be polished, and it\u2019s a 6-layer board big enough to go over a good few\nprice breaks for any PCB fab \u2013 we\u2019ve both learned a ton about high-speed\ndesign as [WifiCable] went about it. However, when it comes to playing with\ndifferent MXM cards, exploring manufacturer differences and tinkering with\ncard compatibility, this is as good of a testbench board as anyone can build!\n\nWant to build your own MXM stuff, whether cards or card-carrying PCBs? Here\u2019s\na socket on LCSC, and with easyeda2kicad, you can easily get a footprint and\n3D model for it. As for designing your own card or getting the [generic]\npinout, you can find the MXM standard by looking up\nMXM_Specification_v31_r10.pdf.\n\n## Gone But Not Forgotten\n\nDGFF card\n\nSadly, with the trend of making laptops thinner, we\u2019ve been losing MXM, and\nthe companies involved in defining the standard have not been all that\ninterested in updating it, or even adhering to it for that matter.\nNevertheless, due to industrial use of MXM, you can still find many modern\ncards in MXM format!\n\nFurthermore, the spirit of MXM lives on. The proprietary DGFF standard is\nsuperseding MXM in Dell laptops \u2013 it\u2019s thinner, and it\u2019s fundamentally the\nsame functionality that MXM provides. The same goes for the Framework 16\nexpansion bay modules \u2013 you could easily make an MXM to expansion bay card,\nand, [WifiCable] has made a KiCad sketch of one too!\n\nFor now, we still have laptops with MXM and almost-MXM cards around, and if\nyou ever look into tinkering with those, you now have a better roadmap towards\nthat. Despite the prevalence of soldered-on GPUs in laptops, the concept of\nGPU modules isn\u2019t about to die out, and companies still put \u201cGPU module\u201d on\nthe whiteboards every now and then during their product design processes.\n\nPosted in Featured, laptops hacksTagged amd, gpu, mxm, NVIDIA\n\n## 17 thoughts on \u201cMXM: Powerful, Misused, Hackable\u201d\n\n  1.

WifiCable says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 8:54 am\n\nThe most important part for bifurcation is that you get a refclk to every\ndevice, SMBus isn\u2019t as critical afaik, you often don\u2019t need to connect that at\nall. The clock signal can\u2019t just be split, so if the slot doesn\u2019t provide an\nadditional one, a clock buffer is needed. Other than that it is indeed as\nsimple as wiring each set of lanes to the correct device in the correct order.\n\nIn my experience, PCIe PCB layout isn\u2019t really that difficult, as long as you\npay attention to a few basic things, like impedance and length matching as you\nmentioned. Additionally it helps to keep in mind that you need an\nuninterrupted ground plane on the layer below and some ground vias around\nwhere your PCIe pairs switch layers. Even if you mess up a lot, PCIe is still\nvery forgiving though, it can simply fall back to lower link widths and speeds\nuntil it does work so you\u2019ll at least have something that works.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n        1. shinsukke says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:33 am\n\nThank you for the detailed answer WifiCable.\n\nPCIe suddenly seems not out of reach, I\u2019ve been playing around with some LLMs\nand image generators, and was thinking of building a custom PCIe bifurcation\nPCB to host multiple GPUs.\n\nIts a tall goal but one of these days I can hope...\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.

It initially had a cheesy \u201cis this an\nx8 slot\u201d way to decide if it was in a mining board. And if it was it would\nslow hashing. So this motherboard has 5 PCIe x16 slots (x8 electrically)\nspaced out for the cards to get airflow. It ships with a cheesy BIOS that only\nenables 2 cores so they can cool the CPU with a low profile aluminum heatsink.\nYou can grab a BIOS that unlocks the extra cores. But an 80w Ivy Bridge (E5\nV2) 6 core is the fastest I could get booting IIRC. It has a single DDR3 slot,\nbut worked great with a 32GB LRDIMM. They also make a 9 port one that uses 2\nCPUs.\n\nReport comment\n\n  3.
