Johnson will pay $6.5 billion to resolve nearly all talc ovarian\ncancer lawsuits in U.S.\n\nSquawk Box\n\nJohnson & Johnson on Wednesday said it plans to pay $6.5 billion over 25 years\nto settle nearly all of the thousands of lawsuits in the U.S. claiming its\ntalc-based products caused ovarian cancer, pending approval of the claimants.\n\nThose cases have for decades caused financial and public relations trouble for\nJ&J, which contends that its now-discontinued talc baby powder and other talc\nproducts are safe for consumers. About 99% of the talc-related lawsuits filed\nagainst J&J and its subsidiaries stem from ovarian cancer.\n\nThe company recorded a charge of about $2.7 billion in the first quarter to\nraise its reserve for talc claims to about $11 billion.\n\nThe deal, pending approval by claimants, would allow J&J to resolve the\nlawsuits through a third bankruptcy filing of a subsidiary company, LTL\nManagement. Courts have rebuffed J&J\u2019s two previous efforts to resolve the\nlawsuits through the bankruptcy of that subsidiary, which was created to\nabsorb the company\u2019s talc liabilities.\n\nJ&J will begin a three-month voting period for claimants, in hopes of reaching\na 75% support threshold needed for a bankruptcy settlement that would end the\nlitigation entirely and prevent future lawsuits. Claimants did not have the\nopportunity to vote in LTL Management\u2019s previous bankruptcy cases, J&J\nexecutives said on a call with investors on Wednesday.\n\nJ&J has the \u201csignificant support of the overwhelming majority of the\nclaimants\u201d based on conversations with their lawyers or representation, the\nexecutives added.\n\n## More CNBC health coverage\n\n  * Viking Therapeutics stock jumps more than 25% on promising weight loss pill data\n  * Amgen wants in on the booming weight loss drug market \u2014 and it\u2019s taking a different approach\n  * Medicare can now cover certain weight loss drugs in a big step for patients\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe this plan is in the best interest of claimants and should\nreceive a favorable and immediate confirmation from the bankruptcy court,\u201d\nsaid Erik Haas, J&J\u2019s worldwide vice president of litigation, during the call.\n\nHe contended the settlement is a far better recovery for claimants than would\nbe likely in a trial.\n\n\u201cAs that track record shows, most of bearing claimants have not recovered, nor\nare they expected to ever recover anything at trial,\u201d Haas said. \u201cAt the rate\nat which use cases have been tried, it would take decades to try the remaining\ncases meaning most claimants will never see their day in court.\u201d\n\nStill, litigation has resulted in some large verdicts for claimants. That\nincludes a roughly $2 billion award in favor of 22 women who blamed their\novarian cancer on asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc products.\n\nShares of J&J rose more than 2% in premarket trading Wednesday.\n\nJ&J said the remaining pending lawsuits relate to a rare cancer called\nmesothelioma and will be addressed outside of the new settlement plan. The\npharmaceutical giant said it has already resolved 95% of mesothelioma lawsuits\nfiled to date.\n\nJ&J noted on Wednesday that it has reached \u201cfinal and comprehensive\u201d\nsettlements to resolve an investigation by a coalition of more than 40 states\ninto claims the company misled patients about the safety of its talc baby\npowder and other talc-based products.\n\nThe company has also reached an agreement in principle to resolve claims\nbrought by suppliers of its talc, which include Imerys Talc America, Cyprus\nMines Corporation and their related parties.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, 3M, Pinterest, AMD, Meta and more\n  * Apple reports earnings Thursday.
