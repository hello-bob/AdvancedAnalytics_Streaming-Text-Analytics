How can you combat it?\n\nIf you always respond immediately to texts, it might be time for a shift in\nmindset. We asked experts for some strategies to combat urgency culture.\n\nByNoma Nazish\n\nApril 09, 2024\n\nIn an increasingly fast-paced and hyperconnected world that rewards immediacy,\nurgency culture blurs the line between what is truly important and what is\nnot.\n\nAt work, this could involve handling frequent last-minute requests,\nunrealistic deadlines or workload, and the expectation to be reachable even\nafter hours.\n\nIn personal life, manifestations of urgency culture include overextending in\nrelationships, frequently checking social media updates out of fear of missing\nout, and responding immediately to calls and texts, even when it\u2019s\ninconvenient.\n\nThe constant rush and the unspoken expectation to always be \u201con\u201d\nprofessionally and personally can create a state of heightened alertness. This\nhypervigilance significantly increases stress and anxiety, says Joel Frank, a\nLos Angeles-based clinical psychologist and owner of Duality Psychological\nServices.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association\u2019s Stress in America 2023\nreport, nearly a quarter of adults report feeling high levels of stress post-\npandemic, marking a 19 percent increase since 2019. Younger adults are hit\nworse, with almost half of Gen Z and more than a third of millennials\nreporting feeling anxious or stressed all or most of the time.\n\n\u201cAnxiety, in turn, feeds into the urgency, creating a cycle where each\nreinforces the other,\u201d Frank says.\n\n## The ripple effects of being \u2018always on\u2019\n\nBeing part of the \u201calways on\u201d culture often necessitates multitasking.\nHowever, research shows the human brain lacks the neurocognitive architecture\nto perform two or more tasks simultaneously. So, every time we multitask, it\nactually slows the brain down and may reduce productivity by up to 40 percent.\n\nBesides, \u201cthe attraction to distraction that drives most multitasking can be\nhard to shut off,\u201d says Friederike Fabritius, neuroscientist and author of The\nBrain-Friendly Workplace. \u201cAs a result, you may find it difficult to focus\neven when you aren\u2019t multitasking.\u201d\n\nFor those caught in the whirlwind of urgency culture, the relentless need to\nrush can trigger hypervigilance, igniting our innate \u201cfight or flight\u201d\ninstincts, amplifying stress and anxiety levels.\n\nPhotograph by Laszlo Balogh, Reuters/Redux\n\nMeanwhile, constant overstimulation\u2014a significant contributor to urgency\nculture\u2014desensitizes your dopamine system. In short, the more overstimulated\nyou are, the less joy you can feel, says Fabritius.\n\nIt also impedes reflective thinking. When the brain is overwhelmed by the\nconstant need to process information and make decisions quickly, it often\nresorts to shallow thinking. This compromises your ability to engage in deep\nwork, which requires long bouts of distraction-free concentration, says Frank.\n\n(\u201cZoom fatigue\u201d may be with us for years. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll cope.)\n\nOver time, urgency culture can also be detrimental to physical health. A false\nsense of urgency tricks the body into reacting as if it\u2019s in a threatening\nsituation, activating the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response. Your breathing becomes\nfaster, your blood pressure and heart rate go up, and you lose the ability to\nregulate emotions, says David Rabin, a neuroscientist and cofounder of the San\nFrancisco-based health tech company Apollo Neuro.\n\nAccording to Rabin, an overactive fight-or-flight response contributes to\nhypertension, sleep deprivation, high cholesterol, and inflammatory disorders.\n\n## You May Also Like\n\nSCIENCE\n\n### Many people wean off antidepressants too quickly.

Here's what experts want you to know.\n\n## Counteracting urgency culture\n\nTo avoid the urgency trap, Frank recommends pausing for a few moments before\nleaping into action every time something comes up. \u201cIt allows you to step back\nand assess whether this demand for your attention aligns with your\npriorities,\u201d he says.\n\nSetting clear expectations in personal and professional relationships can also\nhelp plan, prioritize, and problem-solve without inducing false urgency, says\nPeter Economou, director of the Behavioral Health and Sport Psychology program\nat Rutgers University and author of the Mindfulness Workbook for Beginners.\n\n(Here\u2019s how to disconnect from work while on vacation.)\n\nThe best thing you can do to cope with urgency culture is to regularly engage\nin activities that remind you there is no rush, says Rabin.\n\nHe recommends \u201cthe four practices of control\u201d to calm and recenter whenever\nyou feel rushed, overwhelmed, or overstimulated\u2014intentional breathing,\nlistening, movement, and touch.\n\nEstablishing clear boundaries, including digital ones, is also crucial to\navoid false urgency resulting from unreasonable expectations, overcommitting,\nand multitasking.\n\nPrioritizing single-tasking whenever possible is another effective strategy\nfor achieving clear focus and improved productivity.\n\nIf you find it challenging to work on a single task to completion, Fabritius\nsuggests using time blocks to focus exclusively on one task for a specific\nperiod before moving to the next. \u201cThe satisfaction of completing each time\nblock should give you a dose of dopamine, as will the prospect of facing the\nnext \u2018new\u2019 task,\u201d she says.\n\nIda Taghavi, a clinical psychologist with Williamsburg Therapy Group in New\nYork, recommends practicing mindfulness to increase awareness, emotional\nregulation, and stress tolerance.\n\n(You\u2019ve heard of forest bathing. Now try forest therapy.)\n\nMindfulness is nonjudgmental awareness and acceptance of present experiences.\n\u201cIt offers an opportunity to reflect upon and choose responses that we find\nmore effective and aligned with our intentions and values,\u201d she says.\n\nMindfulness creates a buffer between a stimulus, such as a thought, emotion,\nor physical sensation, and our response to it. \u201cThis space disrupts habitual\nreactions that can be destructive, such as emotional dysregulation or\navoidance, compulsive behaviors, or negative thinking patterns,\u201d says Taghavi.\n\nIn addition, \u201cobserving inner experiences without resistance makes room for\nthem to inevitably pass, which can regulate emotions and increase tolerance\nfor distress,\u201d says Taghavi.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * MENTAL HEALTH\n  * ANXIETY\n  * WORK\n  * WELLNESS\n\n## You May Also Like\n\nSCIENCE\n\n### What your biological age can reveal about your health\n\nSCIENCE\n\n### Do you really need 10,000 steps a day?
