Often\nI\u2019m inspired anew to make these plans for myself too. When it comes to looking\nforward to things, long-term items are wonderful, but ideally, the horizon of\nlooking-forward-to isn\u2019t excruciatingly long. Five business days or fewer\ntends to be the sweet spot; otherwise you\u2019re left panting until the next\nreprieve, whenever that is. We\u2019re all looking forward to rare banner days, but\nwho knows when they\u2019ll strike?\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThe sci-fi soap opera Twin Peaks advises a version of this idea: \u201cEvery day,\nonce a day, give yourself a present. Don\u2019t plan it, don\u2019t wait for it, just\nlet it happen,\u201d special agent Dale Cooper advises Sheriff Harry Truman in an\nepisode. In this suggestion, pleasure hinges on a combination of serendipity\nand instant gratification. On the contrary, having something to look forward\nto causes you to derive joy entirely from planning and waiting. I say: Give\nyourself presents. But plan them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Rebecca Onion\n\n### When I Saw Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Pantry, I Had One Main Concern\n\nRead More\n\nScience shows us the benefits of looking forward. A 2018 study published in\nFrontiers in Psychology used functional magnetic resonance imaging to\ndemonstrate a correlation between anticipation of good things and well-being.\nAccording to the authors, we evolved to anticipate. Making preparations for\nthe future was, for our ancestors, linked with survival. But you can, the\nscientists note, use your made-to-anticipate brain to \u201clook forward to\u201d\nnegative things. And that is just anxiety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother study, published in 2015 in the Journal of Experimental Social\nPsychology, found that looking forward to something as simple as a funny New\nYorker cartoon boosted pleasant feelings before and after a stressful event.\nIn fact, anticipating something good was as effective in aiding stress\nrecovery as recently experiencing something good. In other words, looking\nforward to a treat can be, to some extent, as good as the treat itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, when I need something to look forward to, my favorite thing to\nstick in my schedule is getting a really good sandwich. Usually a deli\nsandwich on quality bread that\u2019s impractical to keep at home and fresh\ningredients that had I combined them myself just wouldn\u2019t taste as good.\n\nBut truly anything can be the sandwich. Grabbing coffee. Having tea and a\ncookie every night before bed. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just go through what I already\nhave planned and think about what good things I have coming up that I can\nfocus on.\n\nThese things are small. Sure, it\u2019s nice to look forward to a luxurious\nvacation, a graduation\u2014something huge. But the most important part is not\nnecessarily the thing itself but the act. The thing matters less than the fact\nthat you\u2019re simply looking forward.\n\nHow would we even describe such a feeling? We know that anticipation of bad\nthings is anxiety, but is there a word for anticipation of good things? Ah,\nyes: excitement.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * One Thing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
