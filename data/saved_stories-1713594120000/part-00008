But when\nit comes to waistband placement, history shows there is no golden rule.\n\nYou no longer have to eye his hairline to determine a man's age. There's a new\nway to figure out just how old he is: take a look at his beltline.\n\nA survey from department store Debenhams (illustrated below) suggests that a\nman's waistband rises and falls throughout his life. Trousers bottom out at\nthe age of 16 with below-the-hip styles and peak at 57, just seven inches\nbelow the armpit.\n\nYoung boys may wear their trousers at their natural waist while being dressed\nby their parents, but they generally don't return to this style until they\nreach their late 20s.\n\nFashion history shows this seesaw isn't such a new thing - waistlines have\nbeen bouncing up and down for hundreds of years.\n\nIn Henry VIII's time, men wore trousers called \"cannons\", whose bulkiness\naround the thigh drew the eye. The first true trousers in Western Europe -\npantaloons - were high-waisted and used light-coloured fabric to elongate a\nman's figure.\n\nThe invention of elastic braces in the 1840s meant that trousers continued to\nbe kept hiked up, although waistcoats prevented waistbands from being seen.\n\nBut even with the waistbands hidden from prying eyes, this ushered in a\nproblem that continues until today: Men don't know where to wear their\ntrousers.\n\nUps and downs\n\n\"Historically, braces are used to keep up trousers and undergarments,\" says\nAndrew Groves, course director of fashion design at the University of\nWestminster. \"They hold the trouser so it doesn't really touch the body.\"\n\nBy the turn of the 20th Century, with the advent of baggier lounge-style\nsuits, the waistline dropped, ushering in a century of yo-yoing waistlines.\n\n\"As fashion has inevitably speeded up, the waistband has shifted up and down\nseasonally,\" says Shaun Cole, the principal lecturer in history and culture at\nthe London College of Fashion.\n\nIn particular, Alexander McQueen's \"bumsters\" (revealingly low-cut trousers)\nand hip-hop music in the 1980s and 1990s influenced people to wear their\ntrousers on their hips... or even lower.\n\nTrends are much slower in menswear... They take longer to filter throughShaun\nCole London College of Fashion  \n---  \n  \n\"Young people of today are used to having boxer shorts hanging out,\" Mr Groves\nsays. \"They think they're wearing [their trousers] normally, but they're\nactually on the hip.\"\n\nThat perception of where trousers should sit is at the root of the mockery of\nSimon Cowell, Britain's face of the so-called natural waist. But according to\nthe Debenhams study, Mr Cowell, at age 50, is a bit old to wear his trousers\nthere.\n\n\"It just looks odd,\" Mr Groves says. \"[But] it wasn't like he was making a\nfashion statement.\"\n\nFashion tradition is also on Mr Cowell's side. It dictates that trousers be\nworn on the \"natural waist\", the narrowest part of the body between the chest\nand hip. Most suits are designed for the natural waist or slightly below, but\njackets hide that fact.\n\nMr Cole says that a man's body shape determines where he views his \"waist\" to\nbe. Men entrenched in the gym and fitness culture may be hyper-aware of the\nnatural waist. With a rise in obesity, overweight men may not know whether to\nwear them above or below their stomach.\n\nThis confusion is also reflected in the Debenhams' survey, with research into\nwhat the clothing industry calls Under and Over Achievers. Although most men\nwould prefer to fasten the waistband over their natural waist, the survey\nshows that 20% of older men will ignore their changing body shape and wear\ntheir trousers below their natural waistline, rather than buying a larger\nsize.\n\nWomen led the way in low-cut styles like Alexander McQueen's bumsters  \n---  \n  \nMany men may simply follow what their friends and acquaintances are doing,\nsays Mr Groves, or follow a shop assistant's instructions. They also can be\ninfluenced by the fashions of their personal coming-of-age period and then\ncarry them throughout life.\n\nMr Groves has a hard time believing the waistband trends will continue\nindefinitely.\n\n\"The idea of old people walking around with their pants hanging out is not\npleasant,\" he says. \"Are people suddenly going to pull their trousers up? I\ndon't think so.\"\n\nAlthough there is no single rule for where a man's waistband should sit, Mr\nGroves offers a simple test: Don't expose your socks or your belly.\n\n\"Pay attention to where [your trousers] join the rest of the body,\" he says.\n\nAnd to those who bemoan living in a country of lowering waist lines, he offers\nsome encouragement: what goes around comes around. Fashion tends to be\ncyclical, so high waists may not be gone for long. Just give it another 10\nyears.\n\nBelow is a selection of your comments.\n\nI am a 49 year old with a 30\" waist and struggle to buy trousers off the peg\nthat size. I am often directed to the boys section of shops, what are males\nwaistlines coming to? Dave, Solihull\n\nStange comment about showing socks though. Anyone who sees something from the\n1960s will see that there was always a 1\" gap between trouser and shoe to\nmatch the 1\" gap between cuff and shirt. Bond does it all the time. That is\nsomething that has vanished completely, but I think looks pretty smart. Peter,\nLondon\n\nThe height of one's waistband is not dependent on your age, as much as on the\nfashion of the day. In my grandfather's day, trousers such as the Oxford Bag\nwere cut with a high waistband - he persisted in wearing what he found smart\nand comfortable. Fashion tradition dictates nothing: it merely reflects the\naverage waistband. High-waisted trousers can be extremely flattering -\nalthough they are barely seen these days except amongst vintage enthusiasts or\nin military formal wear. Today I happen to be wearing high-waisted 1930s cut\njeans - and they're great. PJ Ayres, London\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with age at all - it all depends on the\nbelly issue. There comes a time in a man's life when he has to make the\ndecision that he will stick to until the day he dies - am I an up-and-over or\nan up-and-under? Whereas my Dad & my brother both chose the up-and-over camp,\nmy hubby has gone to the up-and-under. I guess it all depends on where you\nwant the belly bulge to be seen - in your shirt or in your trousers. Lily\n\nThis reaffirms my suspicion that I'm a middle-aged man in a 20-something's\nbody. For a while, I've lamented the trouser styles widely available for my\nage that are to sit on (or slightly below) the natural waist. I find that by\nconstantly sitting and getting up my shirt rides out and needs to be tucked in\ntime and time again. If so many people would prefer a higher waistline, why\nare they so hard to find in shops. Perhaps a return to kidney-warmers and\nbraces is too much to hope for? Rhys, Carmarthenshire\n\nSadly your graph is wrong: no line for the below the bum cheeks waistline.\nAndrewM, London\n\nTrousers are made with a certain distance from where the legs join to the\nwaistband and a certain length of leg.. You can't pull them up any further\nthan this distance unless you want to be a soprano, or you can wear them\nlower. If the leg to waist is large and you wear them at your waist then the\npoint of legs will be halfway down your thighs. It's nothing to do with your\nage, it's to do with the fashion of the trousers when you bought them and how\nlong they last. You can't buy trousers that button round your nipples like you\nsaw old men wearing 30 years ago, and they bought them years before that. It's\nlike flat front and pleats, and straight and angled pockets. Fashion designers\ndecree that something is not happening not the people who buy them. Robert,\nGlos UK\n\nWhat makes me laugh is that everyone I've asked who wears their trousers down\nlow say they do this to be different. But they all look the same. Mik Hatcher,\nRochester\n\nNonsense. You get no choice in what's offered these days - and if that leaves\na gut above the belt, that's life. Rahere, Smithfield\n\nBig belly? Wear 'em high with a waistcoat or sweater or tank top or something\nto cover the waistband. A belly hanging over a waistband never looks good and\ncan never be \"fashionable\". The cardinal crime IMO is not the relative height\nof the waistband, it's whether the inside leg has been correctly judged.\nPeople, men especially, tall men worst of all, who wear their trousers\nfloating a few inches above their shoes and socks should be ritually de-bagged\nin the street and forced to wear their trousers on their head for such a\ngrievous style crime. Unless your trousers are rolled up, if you can see your\nsocks in the mirror when you are wearing trousers and standing up... don't. Go\nand buy a pair that fit properly!
