The annual fees will rise to $79.99 and\n$139.99 accordingly.\n\nThe price changes will go into effect July 18 for new customers, and beginning\nAug. 17 for existing subscribers. The Paris Olympics opening ceremony is\nscheduled for July 26.\n\nThe price increase will be the second one in as many years for Peacock, which\nhiked the price of its Premium tier by $1 a year ago, and Premium Plus by $2.\nPremium Plus removes ads from on-demand entertainment programming, and\nincludes NBC\u2019s live local channels, among other features.\n\nHowever, the company is betting that it has a stronger value proposition this\ntime, coming off its exclusive NFL wild card playoff game, the success of\nOppenheimer and the upcoming Olympics. The company has revamped its Olympics\nexperience for this year\u2019s games, adding multiview and a Gold Zone whip-around\nprogram to its roster, as well as a watch party hosted by Alex Cooper.\n\nAnd Peacock will get another exclusive NFL game next season, when the Eagles\nand Packers face off in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on Sept. 6.\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Paramount \u201cOffice of the CEO\u201d Trio\u2019s Memo to Staff: A \u201cNew Long-Term Plan\u201d\nIs Being Finalized\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Paramount\u2019s New \u201cOffice of the CEO\u201d Has a Big First Task: Not Letting CBS\nGo Dark With Charter\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Paramount+ Hits 71M Subscribers as Streaming Loss Narrows to $286M\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Bob Bakish Officially Ousted as Paramount CEO; Trio of Executives to Take\nOver\n\n  * Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\n### Sony Pictures Promotes Tahra Grant to Chief Communications Officer\n\n  * labor\n\n### IATSE Lays Out Top Bargaining Priorities as General West Coast\nNegotiations Resume\n\n### Shopping With THR\n\n### The Best Cold Plunge Tubs for Every Type of Athlete and Wellness Lover\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### The Best Dyson Hair Tool Deals on the Airwrap, Supersonic, Corrale and\nAirstrait\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### Alo\u2019s Biggest Sale of the Year Is Here \u2014 These Are the Best Items to Shop\nfrom the Star-Loved Brand\n\nBy Erin Lassner\n\n### Panasonic\u2019s Stormtrooper-Inspired Electric Shaver Is On Sale for the \u2018May\nthe 4th\u2019 Star Wars Holiday\n\nBy Rudie Obias\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
