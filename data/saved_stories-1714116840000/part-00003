Core was efficiently trained from scratch on thousands of\nGPUs over a period of a few months.\n\n### Performance highlights\n\nCore is competitive with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google across key\nindustry-accepted evaluation metrics. Given its footprint and performance, on\na total cost of ownership basis, Core delivers outsized value. The combination\nof Core\u2019s capabilities and its deployment flexibility unlocks vast new use\ncases.\n\nCore is comparable to GPT-4V on MMMU, outperforms Claude-3 Opus on our\nmultimodal human evaluation conducted by an independent third party, and\nsurpasses Gemini Ultra on video tasks. On language tasks, Core is competitive\nwith other frontier models on well-established benchmarks.\n\nThe table below summarizes a comparison of Core with leading models in the\nmarket today.\n\nSource: Reka internal information, company websites, publicly disclosed\ninformation, and technical reports. \u201c-\u201d denotes data that is not disclosed or\nnot relevant / applicable due to model capabilities.\n\n#### Rankings on Human Evaluation for Multimodal.\n\nA higher ELO score represents better performance. Rankings measured in ELO\ncomputed from third-party blind human preferences on a diverse test set of\nmultimodal prompts.\n\n### Capabilities\n\n  1. Multimodal (image and video) understanding. Core is not just a frontier large language model. It has powerful contextualized understanding of images, videos, and audio and is one of only two commercially available comprehensive multimodal solutions.\n\n  2. 128K context window. Core is capable of ingesting and precisely and accurately recalling much more information.\n\n  3. Reasoning. Core has superb reasoning abilities (including language and math), making it suitable for complex tasks that require sophisticated analysis.\n\n  4. Coding and agentic workflow. Core is a top-tier code generator. Its coding ability, when combined with other capabilities, can empower agentic workflows.\n\n  5. Multilingual. Core was pretrained on textual data from 32 languages. It is fluent in English as well as several Asian and European languages.\n\n  6. Deployment Flexibility. Core, like our other models, is available via API, on-premises, or on-device to satisfy the deployment constraints of our customers and partners.\n\nWhile we release a first version today, we expect Core\u2014along with our other\nmodels\u2014to continue to break performance barriers as it undergoes further\ntraining. Check out our technical report here and example outputs here for\nmore information.\n\n### Our partners\n\nIn less than a year, Reka has become one of only two developers providing\nmodels that allow for comprehensive multimodal input. Its three models allow\nimage, video, and audio input in addition to text. This enables broader and\ndifferentiated customer use cases for industries including e-commerce, social\nmedia, digital content and video games, healthcare, and robotics, to name a\nfew.\n\nA crucial part of delivering on our mission to make frontier multimodal models\nthat benefit humanity is our various partners. We are proud to count amongst\nour partners leading global technology platforms and government organizations\nsuch as Snowflake, Oracle, and AI Singapore. They enable our customers,\norganizations, and individuals around the world to benefit from and build with\nReka models by democratizing access to multimodal technology.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Reka to bring Reka Core\u2019s impressive industry\nleading performance to customers through Snowflake Cortex,\u201d said Baris\nGultekin, Head of AI, Snowflake. \u201cSnowflake and Reka are at the forefront of\nAI innovation, and we\u2019re excited to offer the state-of-the-art AI\ncapabilities, all from within Snowflake\u2019s built-in security and governance.\u201d\n\n\"Reka\u2019s dynamic multimodal and multilingual models allow enterprises to unlock\nmore value from their data, streamline complex tasks, and realize cost\nefficiencies,\u201d said Greg Pavlik, senior vice president, AI and Data Management\nServices, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cWe look forward to collaborating with\nReka to bring video, audio and image capabilities to organizations globally.\u201d\n\n\"One of the goals of AI Singapore is to develop highly capable open-source\nmodels for Southeast Asia. We are excited about Reka's new models and look\nforward to working closely with their series of highly performant general-\npurpose models to build the next generation of SEA-LION models for the\nregion,\" said Leslie Teo, Senior Director of AI Products, AI Singapore, a\nnational programme launched by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, to\nanchor deep national capabilities in AI.\n\n### Concluding remarks\n\nWe live in a multimodal world and Reka is dedicated to the development of\nfrontier multimodal models. The launch of Core today marks an important\nmilestone in delivering against our mission. With our full suite of models\ncomprising Edge, Flash, and now Core, we are ready to take on a greater range\nof challenges. We are excited by what the future holds and look forward to\nwelcoming new partners who want to join us on that journey\n\n### Helpful Links\n\nReka Core Announcement Press Release\n\nExperience firsthand Reka Core, Flash and Edge\n\nSee demonstrations of What Reka Can Do\n\nLearn more about Reka Model Pricing\n\nChe Zheng\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## Snowflake Brings Gen AI to Images, Video and More With Multimodal Language\nModels from Reka\n\nTech\n\nDeploy\n\nTry Our Models\n\nModel Showcase\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nContact\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nDiscord\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Notice\n\nTerms of Service\n\n", "frontpage": false}
