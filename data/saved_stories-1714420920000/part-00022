Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nRumours suggest Samsung plans to expand Galaxy AI with video-focused features\nand potentially collaborate with Google.\n\nFollowing a recently rolled-out software update that expanded Galaxy AI\nfeatures to more Samsung phones, including the upcoming May update for the\nGalaxy S22, Samsung reportedly plans to continue developing additional AI\ntools.\n\nA fresh leak indicates the Korean brand will significantly enhance artificial\nintelligence capabilities in its forthcoming One UI update. Reliable leaker\nIce Universe claims Samsung's upcoming One UI 6.1.1 update will prioritise\nvideo and artificial intelligence (AI) features.\n\n> The key functional innovation of One UI 6.1.1 will be video AI.\n>\n> \u2014 ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) April 25, 2024\n\nDespite the lack of an official confirmation, the tipster suggests \"video AI\"\nwill be the core functionality of the update. The term \"video AI\" undoubtedly\nsparks curiosity.\n\n## Video AI: What To Expect?\n\nSamsung's update is expected to introduce AI-powered enhancements for video\nrecording. Alternatively, it may delve into AI-assisted video creation.\nImagine users crafting videos by simply providing text instructions and\nSamsung's AI tools bringing those ideas to life.\n\nThis will not be Samsung's first foray into AI-powered videography. One UI\nalready boasts the impressive Instant Slow-Mo feature, transforming regular\nvideos into slow-motion masterpieces. This existing functionality hints at the\nexciting possibilities Samsung might explore with video AI in One UI 6.1.1.\n\nSamsung's dedication to AI development remains unwavering regardless of what\nvideo AI entails. This focus extends beyond the impressive Galaxy S24 features\nlaunched earlier this year.\n\nNotably, their collaboration with Google on the Circle to Search tool, now\navailable on Pixel phones as well, exemplifies their commitment to joint AI\ninnovation. Adding to the excitement, a new report suggests Circle to Search\nwill soon gain the ability to capture and share screenshots.\n\n## How Google And Samsung are Revolutionising AI on Your Smartphone\n\nRick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of devices and services,\nrecently took to X to share a photo of himself alongside Samsung Mobile\ndivision chief TM Roh. The top executives were discussing AI.\n\n\"Had a terrific conversation with TM and leadership,\" Osterloh posted. \"Our\npartnership has never been stronger. I'm thrilled about our collaboration on\nAI and the many opportunities ahead for both companies.\"\n\n> Had a terrific conversation with TM and @SamsungMobile leadership.

Google phone users may\nget the One UI software updates. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 could\nbe unveiled later this summer, but the folks at Tom's Guide suggest the\nfoldable phone could launch earlier than expected.\n\nWith Google Pixel Fold 2 on the horizon, Samsung will likely equip the new\nfoldables with cutting-edge Galaxy AI features to stay competitive. A recent\nstudy reinforces this, indicating that a significant portion (25%) of Galaxy\nS24 users value AI functionalities.\n\nAt the January Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, Google and Samsung unveiled\na powerful partnership. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will leverage Google's\nnext-generation Gemini AI models to enhance AI capabilities across its apps\nand services.\n\nNotably, Gemini Pro empowers features like smarter Notes, Voice Recorder, and\nKeyboard summaries. Additionally, the Galaxy S24 integrates Google's Imagen 2\ntext-to-image technology, enabling \"Generative Edit\" features for advanced\nphoto editing within the Gallery app. Google Messages and Android Auto also\nreceived Gemini Nano-powered improvements.\n\nRead more\n\nOne-Fourth of Galaxy S24 Users Buy for AI Features, Study Shows\n\niPhone 16 Leaks: Everything We Know So Far\n\nSamsung Galaxy AI Gets Smarter: Circle to Search Gets a Screenshot Superpower\n\nSamsung Google\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2024.
