While they are often created by processes like\nradioactive decay, few astronomical events produce them in sufficient\nquantities that they can be detected when the radiation originates in another\ngalaxy.\n\nThat said, the list is larger than one, which means detecting gamma rays\ndoesn't mean we know what event produced them. At lower energies, they can be\nproduced in the areas around black holes and by neutron stars. Supernovae can\nalso produce a sudden burst of gamma rays, as can the merger of compact\nobjects like neutron stars.\n\nAnd then there are magnetars. These are neutron stars that, at least\ntemporarily, have extreme magnetic fields\u2014over 10^12 times stronger than the\nSun's magnetic field. Magnetars can experience flares and even giant flares\nwhere they send out copious amounts of energy, including gamma rays. These can\nbe difficult to distinguish from gamma-ray bursts generated by the merger of\ncompact objects, so the only confirmed magnetar giant bursts have happened in\nour own galaxy or its satellites. Until now, apparently.\n\n## What was that?\n\nThe burst in question was spotted by the ESA's Integral gamma-ray observatory,\namong others, in November 2023. GRB 231115A was short, lasting only about 50\nmilliseconds at some wavelengths. While longer gamma-ray bursts can be\nproduced by the formation of black holes during supernovae, this short burst\nis similar to those expected to be seen when neutron stars merge.\n\nThe directional data from Integral placed GRB 231115A right on top of a nearby\ngalaxy, M82, which is also known as the Cigar Galaxy. M82 is what is called a\nstarburst galaxy, which means that it's forming stars at a rapid clip, with\nthe burst likely to have been triggered by interactions with its neighbors.\nOverall, the galaxy is forming stars at a rate more than 10 times that of the\nMilky Way. That means lots of supernovae, but it also means a large population\nof young neutron stars, some of which will form magnetars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn't rule out the possibility that M82 happened to be sitting in front\nof a gamma-ray burst from a distant event. However, the researchers use two\ndifferent methods to show that this is pretty improbable, which leaves\nsomething happening inside the galaxy as being the most likely source of the\ngamma rays.\n\nIt could still be a gamma-ray burst happening within M82, except the estimated\ntotal energy of the burst is much lower than we'd expect from those events. A\nsupernova should also be detected at other wavelengths, but there was no sign\nof one (and they typically produce longer bursts anyway). An alternative\nsource, the fusion of two compact objects such as neutron stars, would have\nbeen detectable using our gravitational wave observatories, but no signal was\napparent at this time. These events also frequently leave behind X-ray\nsources, but no new sources are visible in M82.\n\nSo, it looks like a magnetar giant flare, and the potential explanations for a\nbrief burst of gamma radiation don't really work for GRB 231115A.\n\n## Looking for more\n\nThe exact mechanism by which magnetars produce gamma rays isn't entirely\nworked out. It is thought to involve the rearrangement of the crust of the\nneutron star, forced by the intense forces generated by the staggeringly\nintense magnetic field. Giant flares are thought to require magnetic field\nstrengths of at least 10^15 gauss; Earth's magnetic field is less than one\ngauss.\n\nAssuming that the event sent radiation off in all directions rather than\ndirecting it toward Earth, the researchers estimate that the total energy\nreleased was 10^45 ergs, which translates to roughly 10^22 megatons of TNT.\nSo, while it's less energetic than neutron star mergers, it's still an\nimpressively energetic event.\n\nTo understand them better, however, we probably need more than the three\ninstances in our immediate neighborhood that are obviously associated with\nmagnetars. So, being able to consistently identify when these events happen in\nmore distant galaxies would be a big win for astronomers. The results could\nhelp us develop a template for distinguishing when we're looking at a giant\nflare instead of alternative sources of gamma rays.\n\nThe researchers also note that this is the second candidate giant flare\nassociated with M82, and, as mentioned above, starburst galaxies would be\nexpected to be relatively rich in magnetars. Focusing searches on it and\nsimilar galaxies might be what we need to boost the frequency of our\nobservations.\n\nNature, 2024.
