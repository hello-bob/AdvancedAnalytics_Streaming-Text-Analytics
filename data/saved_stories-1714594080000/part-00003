It used to be one, but it grew\ntoo large. There are navigation arrows at the bottom of each of the pages of\nthis story. Make sure and check \u2019em all out.\n\nThose who know me (and have read my blog over the years) know that I spent\nquite some time working for Scott Miller & George Broussard of Apogee Software\n(later 3D Realms). Was probably the single most fun job I\u2019ve ever had in my\nlife, and to this day, I still wish the old team was together. I\u2019m not getting\ninto the why of that, just pointing out what happened in the past. I worked\nthere from Dec of 1992 through May of 2009. I\u2019ve talked about that part of my\nlife in more detail elsewhere on this blog. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m writing today.\nI\u2019m writing about the history of the company.\n\nApogee was founded back in 1987, and still exists today, although the path to\nget from then till now has a lot of twisty, confusing bits. I always meant to\nlay this out, but the current incarnation of the company did a really cool\n\u201cRealms Deep\u201d thing last month, so I thought I\u2019d get around to doing this\nhistorical piece. Back in the day I was the company archivist, and moreso than\nanyone else there I seemed to care more about the legacy and history of the\ncompany. So that\u2019s what I\u2019 m doing today. Diving into the history of the\ncompany that I was a customer for, worked at for almost 17 years, and still\nmaintain a relationship with today.\n\nA side note: I started writing this as Realms Deep was still going on (5 Sep),\nand I didn\u2019t release this until early November, so it took far longer to put\ntogether than I thought it would \u2013 ha!\n\nOne final comment before I get into it. This is my personal thoughts and\nobservations. This isn\u2019t meant to be an official document for Apogee Software\nLtd / 3D Realms. This is me looking back on everything. With that out of the\nway....\n\n(The spinning logos are leftover images from our 1990\u2019s website designs. Also,\nall the contents of this article are \u00a9 2024 Joe Siegler except for game\nscreenshots and trailers.)\n\nADMIN NOTE: In Jan 2023, this blog post became a problem for my site. It was\n33,000+ words in a single entry. When I wrote it in 2020, I did have some\nproblems with the size, but it worked on the front end (even if I did have\nproblems on the back end). Now as my site has grown, it can\u2019t process the\nthing in one giant piece on the front end, so I had to break it down into\nseveral smaller parts. This first one is in the same spot as full size\noriginal. No content has been changed, just broken up into smaller pieces to\nhelp with the blog being able to render the pages! There will be navigation\nlinks on the subsequent pages.\n\n# Some Personal Stuff\n\nIf you ordered a game from us in 1992 \u2013 it shipped from this desk.\n\nI originally started work for Apogee on 14 Dec 1992. I\u2019ve told this story\nelsewhere before, but my first association with Apogee was as a BBS operator\nback in Philadelphia. I used to have a BBS named \u201cThe Arsenal of Freedom\u201d\n(first on Apple //, then on PC \u2013 both named after an old episode of Star Trek:\nThe Next Generation). The PC version would distribute Apogee shareware, as it\nwas very popular at the time. I was a customer, and bought many Apogee games\nfrom this era myself (Secret Agent, Commander Keen, the original Duke Nukem,\netc...) Once Wolfenstein 3D came out (which I also bought), there was a\nversion that came out that claimed to be a \u201cnew porn update for Wolf3D\u201d. I\nalerted Scott Miller to that, and it was removed, and not long after that,\nScott asked me if I wanted to be a beta tester for Apogee. I of course\nimmediately said yes. During this time, the first ever employee hired by\nApogee (other than Scott\u2019s family) decided to leave Apogee. This was Shawn\nGreen, who left Apogee to go to id Software. Scott asked in the beta group if\nanyone wanted to come work for Apogee, and I jumped on it. After a few chats,\nI decided to move from Philadelphia to Dallas to work for Apogee. I was\nworking for AT&T at the time, so jumping halfway across the country to work\nfor a company with about 20 employees from a place with about 70,000 was a\nmajor culture shock. After a time, I realized I was there to replace \u201cEmployee\n1\u201d, so I go WAY back. In those earliest days, I did phone support, which could\nbe a challenge at times (RIP Debbie Flowers). I was on phones to have me learn\nthe products, and then I moved into online support.\n\nSomething interesting, in looking for a document for another part of this\narticle, I happened upon the original message that Scott Miller posted in the\nApogee beta group asking if anyone wanted to come down to Garland and work for\nApogee. I kept it, although it\u2019s not in the greatest shape almost 30 years\nlater. The message wasn\u2019t dated, but it would have been early fall, as I was\nformally hired in October, had another trip to Texas in November, and moved\npermanently in early December. If you want to see the letter that got me to\nmove 1,400 miles away to work for Apogee, I\u2019ve taken a pic of it. You can\nclick it for a larger version, which is easier to read.\n\nAnyway, once I got there, I noticed a few of the things in place then were in\na disorganized state. That\u2019s not to say the company was a mess, but certain\nareas that I had direct responsibility over were. I was always one for\norganization and record keeping \u2013 even back then. One of the first things I\ndid was organize the online distribution files. I don\u2019t know how many of you\nreading this were around back then, but in early 1993, the distribution method\nfor video game shareware (something pioneered by Scott Miller) was a bit of an\nodd distribution. There were many hub BBS\u2019s around \u2013 the home one for Apogee\nwas then Software Creations. They weren\u2019t the only ones by far (others like\nExec-PC come to mind), but all the shareware from before my time there from\nApogee was a hodgepodge of various compression formats (both arj, pkzip, and\narc), versions, and the like. I organized all of it, collected the entire\ndistribution line, repackaged them into a uniform format, and made sure things\nwere kept up to date with the latest compressions to make the files as small\nas possible. Having the official product line all line up and look the same in\nterms of compression, naming, and whatnot was something I thought it should\nbe. Thought it looked better that way.\n\nAn example of a file_id.diz error \u2013 our earliest form of DRM.\n\nBack in those days, I did something which is commonplace now, but in 1993, it\nwas unheard of. Scott & George decided they wanted someone to be what is now\nknown as a \u201cCommunity Manager\u201d, but back then nobody did this. They pioneered\nonline support, too. The person doing that online support was me. Things were\ndifferent then, because there was no social media. We had things like\nCompuServe, GENie, Prodigy, Delphi, etc... If you were super techy (like John\nCarmack), you had .plan files \u2013 the precursor to twitter, in some ways. But it\nwas my job to \u201cbe Apogee\u201d online. It was a dream job.\n\nI also introduced the old concept of \u201cfile_id.diz\u201d to the Apogee distribution\nfiles. I didn\u2019t create the format, but I did introduce it to our company in a\nunified format. We did have it in one or two games before I started, but it\nwasn\u2019t consistent. The version I introduced had a similar format across all\nour games. It was also my idea to use file_id.diz as an early form of DRM on\nour registered games (to the consternation of some). My idea was this \u2013 if we\nhad problems with people uploading the full/commercial versions of our games\nto BBS\u2019s, I thought we could stick a file_id.diz in the full game directory,\nso if someone zipped it up and uploaded it, the BBS would then add the\ndescription that it was an illegal upload to the BBS listing and presumably be\nseen and removed. You couldn\u2019t remove the file_id.diz file from commercial\ngames, because the game would no longer run without that. Don\u2019t know how many\nof you remember this about the Apogee games from back then, but this was\ntotally my idea.\n\nWhat one of the commercial file_id.diz files would show if you uploaded it to\na BBS.\n\nOne of my other ideas then was to index the company\u2019s output. Now back in\n1993, we didn\u2019t have a website yet (that started in the summer of 1995).\nHowever, everything that the company released from the moment I started\nworking there I kept track of (with one or two exceptions that slipped through\nthe cracks). Major releases, point releases, all updates, freeware, etc... I\nmaintained that file until the day 3DR and I separated in 2009. I also kept\ntrack of it PAST my end of employment, and continued to updated it. It\u2019s still\nmaintained to this day (by me). That\u2019s something I\u2019m quite proud of. It has\nturned into a true historical document that I\u2019ve been told people have used\nwhen researching our game history. The original is still available online, but\nwhat I\u2019m doing with this blog post is expanding on the original basic list of\ngames and dates. There will be additional info, like personal remembrances,\nscreenshots, current availability, etc....\n\nMe with the SW \u201997 Gold Master CD package\n\nI was also the guy who uploaded all new shareware releases and patches. As is\nwell known, our distribution network was housed at Software Creations, the\nmajor BBS run out of Massachusetts. However, they weren\u2019t the only place. When\nwe released something, I would spend a lot of time uploading our files to\nvarious major BBS\u2019s around the country, so the packaging and distribution of\nour shareware was a big thing to me. FTP was also a thing around then, so I\nhandled that too. I was the person who mastered floppy discs (and later CD\u2019s)\nfor mass duplication. Most of our CD\u2019s had a /goodies directory on them \u2013 the\nmajority of the time, I would gather random things and just throw them on the\nCD to have some other fun stuff to discover. That was all me. There\u2019s a pic to\nthe right of me holding the Fedex box in my office with the gold master CD for\nShadow Warrior in 1997. There was a very famous picture of George Broussard in\nmy office pointing at my computer on the first actual upload of Duke Nukem 3D\nto Software Creations on 29 Jan 1996. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it. I took that\npicture, too. ;)\n\nMy official company bio photo from 1993. I was trying to imitate James\nHetfield at the time \u2013 my hair wasn\u2019t long enough though.\n\nTwo other fun things I did with the 3D Realms site back in the day which were\nmostly unheard of at the time were the Virtual Tour, and the webcam. While the\nvirtual tour is available on old copies of the 3D Realms website at\narchive.org, it doesn\u2019t include the pictures, so it\u2019s not something that\u2019s\nworth seeking out. It\u2019s not like a Virtual Reality tour in 2020. This was just\na bunch of still pictures that you went to the next one by clicking something\nand it would load another page. Primitive tech by today\u2019s standards, but\nnobody else was doing this in 1998 on the web. I had a fun easter egg in the\ntour, too. If you remember the old Infocom game \u201cZork\u201d, there was a phase \u201cIt\nis dark, you are likely to be eaten by a grue\u201d. Well, if you went into that\narea in the game, you were stuck in a maze. In my virtual tour, I mapped out\nthat grue maze and replicated it. If you went down the wrong side of the\noffices, you\u2019d get stuck in my grue maze in the tour. Always got a laugh out\nof that. Somewhere I have the actual hand drawn map I used to lay it out, but\nI couldn\u2019t find it in prep for this article.\n\nUPDATE 9 May 2022: Today I found the virtual tour scratch work including the\nZork maze. I threw a few images on Twitter. You can see that tweet here, or\nview the images here, here, and here.\n\nThe webcam was a live camera \u2013 again not like 2020 standards, but it did have\nregularly updated photos. What I did was take a 1990\u2019s era camcorder, and set\nup software on a specific machine which would take a still shot from the\nwebcam once every 30 seconds. It would then FTP the image to our web server,\noverriding the existing photo, so the website would see the new one instead of\nthe old one. Again, old tech, but nobody was really doing that in 1996. That\ncamera got moved around a bunch, and we put it where things were going on. It\nlived in the lunch room for awhile, in tech support, in some of the\ndeveloper\u2019s offices, and we would sometimes use it to send messages to\ndevelopers we were hiring (go look at the webcam, Martin!) \u2013 haha. However,\nthe one most people remember was we put it in the room we shipped Duke Nukem\n3D orders out of, so people could watch us packing orders. Sometimes it would\ncrash too, and you\u2019d end up with weirdness. I\u2019ve included a couple of examples\nfrom both the tour and the cam in the gallery below.\n\n1998 Tour \u2013 Prey Office1998 Tour \u2013 Hallway1998 Tour \u2013 Conf RoomWebcam \u2013 Tech\nRoomWebcam \u2013 Shipping DukeWebcam \u2013 Late night Lounge\n\nOne last one was something I did on the 3DR website for over a decade. That\u2019s\nthe \u201cCamera Captioning Contest\u201d. I\u2019d post random goofy pictures taken around\nthe offices, have people send in their ideas for a caption, and the winner\nwould get a free game sent to them. Was a lot of fun \u2013 all the old entries and\nwinners are still online, too. The contest ran from Dec 20, 1996 through Jan\n12, 2006. It was revived for a time on social media with the new 3D Realms,\nbut it didn\u2019t last terribly long. Fun memory from the past, too.\n\nMe as Sebastian Krist for Rise of the Triad 1994.\n\nI\u2019ve written about my time at Apogee many times on this blog, and there\u2019s some\ngood stories to read if you want a deeper dive. Some of them are game\nspecific, and I\u2019ll link to them in the relevant game sections below. Some of\nthe less game specific ones here are..\n\n  * Pearle Scarboro \u2013 My meeting with the mother of the late 3DR programmer William Scarboro.\n  * Happy Trails Duke Nukem \u2013 This was something I wrote on the last day that 3D Realms had the rights to Duke Nukem on 31 Dec 2015, it was about Duke Nukem in general.\n  * Duke Nukem Swag \u2013 A detail of all the various bits of Duke Nukem swag I had collected over the years. It\u2019s not about any one game, so I\u2019m listing it here. I also threw in my much smaller collection of Shadow Warrior stuff too.\n  * Nuking a Lobby Floor \u2013 A story about the creation and later destruction of the really badass looking lobby floor we had in the NW Highway 3D Realms Offices.\n  * Goodbye Duke Nukem \u2013 This is a very personal journey that I wrote on the last day I was working for Gearbox. At the time I thought it was the end of my connection to Apogee, 3D Realms, & Duke Nukem.\n\n# The Name\n\nBefore I get to the timeline of releases, I wanted to speak for a minute about\nthe names \u201cApogee Software\u201d & 3D Realms. There\u2019s been a bunch of confusion\nover that over the years. I\u2019ve explained it from time to time, but never put\nit down in blog form, so here goes.\n\nThe Apogee Logo at Quakecon 2012.\n\nBack in 1987, Scott Miller founded Apogee Software. Kroz is generally regarded\nas the first \u201cApogee\u201d game, and it was released in November 1987. There were a\nfew rogue games that Scott used the name Apogee before then, but 1987 is more\nor less when the \u201ccompany\u201d was founded, because that was the first game that\nused \u201cThe Apogee Model\u201d. Those earlier games (which I\u2019ll detail below) were\nreleased differently. Anyway, back in those days, things were small. It was\njust Scott and his family in his parents\u2019 house in Garland. A couple of years\nago I wrote a story about that original location for the 3D Realms site. You\ncan read it here.\n\nA couple of years after that, George Broussard was brought on, things\nexpanded, the company got larger, and while it was still before my time there,\nthey created \u201cApogee Software Ltd.\u201d That was (and still is to this day) the\nlegal name of the company I worked for for almost seventeen years in the 90\u2019s\nand 2000\u2019s. \u201cApogee Software Ltd\u201d was what was on my paychecks.\n\nSome time after that, they also created another company called \u201cAction\nEntertainment Inc\u201d. Action Entertainment legally owned Apogee Software Ltd.\nThe idea being if someone sued the company, they\u2019d be suing AEI, and not\nApogee (and therefore its employees) directly.\n\nIn 1994-ish, Scott Miller had the idea that we needed branded names. His\nstated idea at the time was that with the name \u201cApogee\u201d had become diluted,\nand you didn\u2019t know what type of game you would get when you got an Apogee\ngame. I personally thought it was fine the way it was, but we ended up\ncreating the 3D Realms name here out of this. Officially, 3D Realms is a \u201cdba\u201d\nname (doing business as), but after the release of Terminal Velocity, and then\nDuke Nukem 3D, the 3D Realms name took a front seat.\n\nIn 1996, we released the final game under the Apogee name \u2013 Stargunner. We\nused the 3D Realms name exclusively after that to identify ourselves, but\nlegally we were still \u201cApogee Software, Ltd\u201d (a name that still exists in\n2020). We also had a second dba name around this time, that being \u201cPinball\nWizards\u201d, but only one game (Balls of Steel) was ever released using this\nname.\n\nThe original 3D Realms logo as created by Steve Hornback.\n\nAs was written about elsewhere, in 2009, the original Apogee (dba 3D Realms)\nceased to exist as development studio, and laid off all their staff (including\nme). However, despite popular belief, Apogee/3D Realms never ceased to exist \u2013\never. They remained in their offices through the beginning of 2011, then had\noffices in the Gearbox Software building in Plano TX for a time. Apogee/3D\nRealms continued to exist to maintain various intellectual properties they\nowned, but no active development was going on during this time.\n\nFast forward to 2014, when the original Apogee was sold to Interceptor\nEntertainment (now known as Slipgate) and moved the headquarters from Texas to\nDenmark. That is how it was presented to the public, but legally, \u201cApogee\nSoftware Ltd (dba 3D Realms)\u201d was sold to \u201cSDN Invest ApS\u201d \u2013 a holding company\nthat itself was owned by another holding company (MDN Holding ApS) who also\nowns Interceptor/Slipgate. The holding company is owned by the same people\nthat run both 3D Realms and Slipgate, so this is similar to what Scott &\nGeorge did years ago with \u201cAction Entertainment Inc\u201d (which is still legally\nin play, btw). Somewhere between the original purchase and now, The \u201cSDN\nInvest ApS\u201d holding company was shifted to a newer holding company, named \u201c3D\nRealms Entertainment ApS\u201d \u2013 who is also owned by \u201cMDN Holding ApS\u201d.\n\nI realize all the holding company stuff is confusing, so.... the bottom line\nis as of 2020, the original Apogee Software still technically exists. Here\ngoes...\n\n### The \u201cname summary\u201d...\n\nApogee Software Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Action Entertainment Inc.\nApogee Software Ltd has two dba\u2019s \u2013 \u201c3D Realms\u201d & \u201cPinball Wizards\u201d. Action\nEntertainment Inc, and all its assets are owned and controlled by \u201c3D Realms\nEntertainment ApS\u201d. 3D Realms Entertainment ApS is owned partly by MDN Holding\nApS and partly by Slipgate Holding ApS.\n\nA goofy image Tom Hall drew one day. ;)\n\nStill confused?\n\nTo simplify that even further..... \u201cThe guys that own Slipgate/Interceptor\nalso own 3D Realms\u201d. That\u2019s the bottom line. ;)\n\nI miss the days back when I started working at Apogee when it was just \u201cApogee\nSoftware\u201d and nothing else. It was less confusing for sure. :)\n\nAlso... There was in Apr 2021 a \u201cNew Apogee\u201d that I don\u2019t have anything to do\nwith come into existence. It\u2019s headed by Scott Miller, who founded the\noriginal (the original legally is 3D Realms in Denmark now). I have a short\nsection about this variant further down towards the end of this article.\n\nThis is an image we used to have at the top of our news section of the Apogee\nwebsite in the late 90\u2019s.\n\n# The Game History\n\nNow I get to the history of the individual games. As I posted above, there is\na straight linear list of the release history for Apogee/3D Realms on the\nLegacy 3D Realms site. I always wanted to expand on that and make it a bit\nmore intersting than a straight list. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here. This will\nhave some screenshots, links, info to current stuff and remakes (when\nrelevant), and my own memories of that title (assuming I have some). The\noriginal list had them in chronological order, and for the most part that will\nhappen here, but the initial release and all the point releases will be\nmentioned in the same place there vs a straight list in the original. I was\naround for the majority of this stuff personally, and for the stuff I wasn\u2019t,\nI know just about everyone involved. So here goes...\n\nWhile the generally established history has the first proper Apogee game in\nthe fall of 1987, there was some activity before then. A handful of titles\nwere released earlier, not using the same \u201cApogee model\u201d that the company\nbecame known for. The true release dates of these 1986 releases is lost to\ntime. Unfortunately, none of us really remember what the proper dates are now.\nIf for some reason you happen to have verifiable info proving the date of any\nof them, please let me know.\n\n# The Puzzle Fun Pack\n\nRelease Date: Unknown 1986\n\nThis was a \u201cpack\u201d of four small puzzle games all written by Scott Miller. The\nindividual titles were Asteroid Rescue, Block, Five, Maze Machine & Phrase\nMaster. Was discontinued ages ago, but is available as freeware from our FTP\nsite.\n\nBy the time I found out this existed, I was already working for Apogee, and\ncomputers were already too fast for this game. A lot of these early games\ndidn\u2019t adapt themselves to faster computers than they were designed on, and as\nsuch are instantly unplayable. The same goes for the next entry on the list\nhere.\n\nCurrent Status: Freeware Puzzle Fun Pack Links: [ Freeware \u2013 3DR FTP | Internet Archive ]\n\n# The Adventure Fun Pack\n\nRelease Date: Unknown 1986\n\nAnother \u201cpack\u201d of four small games all written by Scott Miller. The individual\ntitles were Night Bomber, Raiders of the Forbidden Mine, Rogue Runner, and The\nThing. The one I have a screen shot from here is \u201cRaiders of the Forbidden\nMine\u201d. It really reminds me of Dig Dug. Other than researching for this\narticle, I\u2019ve never played any of these games, although I was aware of their\nexistence.\n\nThis has the same speed problem with modern computers that the entry before\nthis does. Was discontinued ages ago, but is available as freeware from our\nFTP site.\n\nCurrent Status: Freeware Adventure Fun Pack Links: [ Freeware \u2013 3DR FTP | Internet Archive ]\n\n# Beyond the Titanic\n\nBeyond the Titanic Start Screen\n\nRelease Date: Unknown 1986\n\nBeyond the Titanic was a text adventure game in the vein of the original Zork\ngames written by Scott Miller. If you liked the old Infocom games, you\nprobably would like this. It still holds up in 2020, as it\u2019s a text adventure\ngame, so there\u2019s no speed problems or graphics issues with modern computers.\n\nHere\u2019s the actual text for Beyond the Titanic from one of our super ancient\ncatalog files we would distribute with games.. \u201cIt\u2019s a text adventure game\nthat mixes elements of science fiction, action, fantasy and rollicking\nadventure. The story begins with you standing aboard the Titanic just seconds\nbefore the ship sinks! In this story of riveting survival you\u2019ll discover a\nlong forgotten undersea mystery, travel to the Earth\u2019s future, fly a shuttle\nto a floating city and be chased by a slobbering, three-armed creature\u2013and\nthat\u2019s just the believable part!\u201d\n\nWas discontinued a long time ago. Re-released as freeware on 10 Mar 1998. Re-\nreleased a second time as freeware, only with the source code on 20 Mar 2009.\nStill available on the 3D Realms FTP site.\n\nCurrent Status: Freeware Beyond the Titanic Links: [ Freeware \u2013 3DR FTP | Internet Archive ]\n\n# Supernova\n\nRelease Date: Unknown 1987\n\nWe released another text adventure game similar to the prior year\u2019s Beyond the\nTitanic. this one was called \u201cSupernova\u201d. Supernova was written by Scott and\nhis friend Terry Nagy. Between Supernova & BTT, Scott learned that releasing\nthe entire game in shareware was not the way to go, and a new concept was\nneeded, and what the company became known for (\u201cThe Apogee Model\u201d) was born\nwith the next release. However, like Beyond the Titanic before it, Supernova\nwill appeal to fans of the old Infocom text adventure games.\n\nHere\u2019s the actual text for Supernova from one of our super ancient catalog\nfiles we would distribute with games.. \u201cOur best adventure game requires an\nentire 360K disk! Has as many features as even the best commercial adventure\ngames, and then some. Like a 16-color screen, ASCII graphics (that even work\non nongraphic systems), 1000+ word dictionary, over 160 game locations, scores\nof sound effects, a \u201chint\u201d command, and more.\u201d\n\nThe game was discontinued ages ago. Was released as freeware on 26 Mar 1998.\nLater re-released again as freeware with source code on 20 Mar 2009. It is\nstill available on the 3D Realms FTP site.\n\nCurrent Status: Freeware w/Source Code Supernova Links: [ Freeware \u2013 3DR FTP | Internet Archive ]\n\n# Kroz\n\nRelease Date: 26 Nov 1987\n\nThis is where Apogee starts formally. That\u2019s because it was the first game to\nuse \u201cThe Apogee model\u201d where the first episode was given away for free, and\nthe rest had to be paid for \u2013 aka \u201cshareware\u201d. Scott did a a total of 7 Kroz\nepisodes, and this is the bulk of the early product for Apogee from this point\nfor the next year or so. Here\u2019s some detail on the 7 episodes:\n\n  1. Kingdom of Kroz (1987)\n\n  2. Caverns of Kroz (1988)\n  3. Dungeons of Kroz (1989)\n  4. Return to Kroz (1990)\n  5. Temple of Kroz (1990)\n  6. Final Crusade of Kroz (1990)\n  7. The Lost Adventures of Kroz (1990)\n\nThe first three were packaged as \u201cThe Kroz Trilogy\u201d, and the second three as\nthe \u201cSuper Kroz Trilogy\u201d. There was to be 8th episode of Kroz released in 1991\n(The Underground Empire of Kroz), but it was never released. I asked Scott in\nthe creation of this article how much he\u2019d actually done towards the 8th Kroz,\nand he said \u201cI think I did a few little things but no actual levels.\u201d So\nthere\u2019s no lost game waiting to be found.\n\nThere\u2019s some additional detail on the Kroz games over here on Wikipedia. Some\nof the Kroz games had alternate names, too (such as Dungeons of Kroz being\ncalled \u201cKroz II\u201d) \u2013 all of that is on the Wikipedia page. In researching this\narticle I found something we used to distribute, a document called \u201cKroz: The\nEntire Domain\u201d, detailing the episodes, their original prices, and some other\ninfo. It is shown below.\n\nAt the time it was new, the source code was available for an additional\npurchase. All of the various Kroz games were discontinued ages ago, but were\nre-released as freeware (with source code) on 20 Mar, 2009.\n\nCurrent Status: Freeware w/Source Code Kroz Links: [ Freeware \u2013 3DR FTP ]\n\n###### Join the Conversation\n\n  1.

Michael says:\n\nNovember 21, 2020 at 7:01 am\n\nA trip down memory lane, I had forgotten how much time I devoted to obtaining\nfrom shareware distributors and BBSs each new title as they came out, starting\nfrom the Kroz era. Then, as this post was written, I was busy replaying Kroz\nfor my own gaming blog \u2014 perfect timing, or you were spying on me? I\u2019m not\nsure. Thanks for the research and record-keeping.\n\n  3. Bret Bernhoft says:\n\nNovember 27, 2020 at 2:04 am\n\nDuke Nukem 3D was one of the first PC games I played as a child. I still\nremember how intense it was for me back then; loved every minute of it.\n\nThank you for your work building these games, and for the blog post. It brings\nback some fond memories.\n\n  4. Dan says:\n\nMarch 17, 2021 at 1:58 pm\n\nDuke Nukem: Gameboy Color is not a port of Duke Nukem II. While it shares a\nsimilar plot both games have very little in common besides both of them being\nside-scrollers. Same with Duke Nukem Advance while the graphics are similar to\n3D the game itself is original.\n\n  5. Jens says:\n\nJune 7, 2021 at 10:53 am\n\nSuper great post, thanks Joe ? I was one of the old 3drealms forum people many\nlightyears ago, when we waited on DNF. Great to get some more insights and\nread all about it. Would also love some more details behind everything\n(especially Duke and original Prey).\n\n  6. JosephWJ says:\n\nJune 12, 2021 at 8:53 am\n\nHello Joe,\n\nI created the Extreme Rise of the Triad guide a few years ago, which I linked\nyou to back then. Recently, I livestreamed the game and it\u2019s up on my Youtube.\nWith civvie\u2019s recent video, it finally got me to do something like this. I\nplayed on the hardest difficulty, without cheats, and without frequent saves,\nto show how to beat Extreme ROTT. It\u2019s the first time I picked this game back\nup since about 3 years; so it\u2019s a semi-blind run (ie, without practice,\nrefreshers or even consulting my own guide for anything I forgot). If you\u2019re\ncurious, you can search Extreme Rise of the Triad casual playthrough, you\nshould find the playlist for it, by JosephWJ.\n\n##### Leave a Reply\n\n###### Donate\n\nWhy is this here?\n\n###### Me\n\n###### Archives by Date\n\n###### Featured Posts\n\n  * ###### Extreme ROTT\u2019s Pillar Problem\n\n    * June 26, 2023\n\n  * ###### Shadow Warrior Turns 20\n\n    * May 13, 2017\n\n  * ###### History of PC Sidescrollers\n\n    * September 27, 2016\n\n###### Me\n\n###### Donate\n\nWhy am I asking?
