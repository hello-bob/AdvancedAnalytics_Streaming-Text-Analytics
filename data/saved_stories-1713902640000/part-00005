Words that reflect racial or other discriminatory bias are\ncontrary to the values of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in UW\nInformation Technology (UW-IT) and at the University of Washington. They\nundermine the inclusive environment we aim to create in UW-IT and in serving a\ndiverse University community.\n\nUW-IT has joined IT organizations at universities around the country that are\ninvolved in activities to replace racist, sexist, ageist, ableist, homophobic\nor otherwise non-inclusive language scattered throughout materials and\nresources in the software and information technology fields.\n\nThe resources provided in this document are mostly focused on language\nsurrounding technology tools, resources and services, or language that is more\nlikely to be used on web properties or documentation platforms.\n\n### How we arrived at this guide\n\nThis guide was created with the input of dozens of people, from leadership to\nservice owners and service managers in UW-IT, and was guided by an advisory\ncommittee made up of people representing units across the UW and from UW\nMedicine and UW-IT\u2019s DEI Community of Practice. As an educational institution,\nit\u2019s imperative that we remain committed to diversity, equity and inclusion,\nand one place to start is how we communicate to those who visit our websites.\nThis guide shows our commitment to ensuring our organization, and our\nwebsites, continually show respect for everyone.\n\n### How this guide can be used\n\nWe have divided our language guide into two tables. The first table is focused\non words that are IT-specific. The second table is a more general list of\nproblematic words.\n\nThese reflect the principles of inclusive language: use gender-neutral terms;\navoid ableist language; focus on people not disabilities or circumstances;\navoid generalizations about people, regions, cultures and countries; and avoid\nslang, idioms, metaphors and other words with layers of meaning and a negative\nhistory. This second list isn\u2019t exhaustive, and isn\u2019t intended to be\nexhaustive, but to illustrate the kinds of words to be mindful of.\n\nWe expect this guide to be used as a reference to audit the language used on\nwebsites, web pages, wikis, online documentation, software and system\napplications, and documentation about these applications.\n\nTogether, the two tables are intended to complement other high-quality\nreferences for inclusive language, such as UW Marketing & Communications\u2019\nCommunicating with an Equity Lens resource.\n\n### Roles and responsibilities\n\n#### Web content creators and editors\n\nAs creators and editors of website content, we have a responsibility to\ncarefully consider the language we use in our documentation and its impact on\nthe diverse community we serve at the University and beyond.\n\nTherefore, we are accountable for ensuring racist, sexist, ageist, ableist,\nhomophobic, or otherwise non-inclusive language are not within the materials\nand resources online.\n\nThis resource is especially for those who manage and update content related to\nsoftware and information technology at the University of Washington.\n\n#### UW-IT Service Offering Owner\n\nAs part of our service management practice, UW Information Technology clearly\ndefines roles and responsibilities related to each of our service offerings.\n\nToward integrating diversity, equity and inclusion best practices with this\nservice management practice, the role of the service offering owner is best\nsuited to implementing and training service team staff. Consider using the UW-\nIT inclusive language guide in materials for end users and front-line support\nteams, including request submission forms and workflow, support knowledge\narticles, documentation and self-help aids.\n\n#### Vendor liaison\n\nIf the name for something or if a word in documentation is in the tables below\nand comes from a vendor, and where changing the word may create more\nconfusion, it is recommended that you contact the vendor and urge them to\nchange the word(s). Below are two sample emails that other university IT shops\nhave used for reference:\n\nSample Email 1\n\nWe are reaching out to you because the University of Washington has been\nworking toward fostering an inclusive and welcoming culture in our campus\ncommunity and wish to work with suppliers who share this desire. As such, we\nhave been working to eliminate some of the IT terminology used for years that\nhas racist, ableist and/or sexist origins and their continued use perpetuates\nprivilege. Attached is a list of words [insert link to this guide] we have\nidentified as non-inclusive within our own IT organizations. Some of our other\nvendors including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, and GitHub are addressing this issue\nand I am curious if [fill in name of vendor] has plans to do so as well; I\nnoticed you still use terms such as [provide example]. Does [fill in name of\nvendor] have plans to address this? We would love to know what efforts you are\nundertaking to move away from this language to create a more inclusive\nproduct/service. I am asking from an inclusive partner and curiosity\nperspective, and would offer any help I can to have you make such changes in\nyour language. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nSample Email 2\n\nDear [insert vendor name],\n\nThe University of Washington works to foster an inclusive and welcoming\nculture for everyone in our campus community, and we wish to work with\nsuppliers who share this desire. Unfortunately, in working with your\nproduct/service we have identified language that can be considered offensive\ndue to its racist, ableist and/or sexist origins. Specifically, the use of\n[fill in]. Can you let us know what efforts you are undertaking to move away\nfrom this language so as to create a more inclusive product/service?\n\n### Updating this guide\n\nThis IT language guide is by no means exhaustive, and not all problematic\nwords or phrases have been captured here. If you have comments, suggestions,\nor think a word related to information technology is missing from this guide,\nplease email help@uw.edu with \u201cInclusive language guide\u201d in the subject line\nto start a conversation with the UW-IT Communications team.\n\n## Plain, non-colloquial language\n\nUsing clear, concise and direct language (known as plain language) is a good\nway to avoid problematic words. Plain language is communication your audience\ncan understand the first time they read or hear it. Plain language avoids\njargon and colloquial language.\n\nColloquial language in particular can be a source of many problematic words\nand phrases, and many of the terms we included in the list below are\ncolloquial.\n\nColloquialisms are used in casual conversation where some slang terms are used\nand where no attempt is made at being formal. This can include idioms, or\nphrases that have a cultural meaning, but that meaning is derived from a\ncultural familiarity and not the meaning of the words themselves.\n\nExamples include \u201craining cats and dogs\u201d or \u201csanity check\u201d or \u201clowering the\nbar.\u201d While most people reading this guide know exactly what these phrases\nmean, the meaning is derived from a cultural context and not the words\nthemselves. Two of those phrases are problematic, and included in the list of\nproblematic words below.\n\nYou can learn more about plain language from plainlanguage.gov.\n\n## Problematic words and phrases\n\nThe problematic words and phrases are grouped into two tables: one for words\nthat are IT-specific, and a second section with a more general list of\nproblematic words.\n\nThese reflect the principles of inclusive language: use gender-neutral terms;\navoid ableist language; focus on people not disabilities or circumstances;\navoid generalizations about people, regions, cultures and countries; and avoid\nslang, idioms, metaphors and other words with layers of meaning and a negative\nhistory. The general list is organized into the following categories:\n\n  * Race, Ethnicity, Nationality, Religion, Native/Indigenous Identity\n  * Disability and Ableism\n  * Ageism\n  * Gender and sexual orientation\n\nThe tables are organized into three columns. The first column lists the\nproblem word or words and phrases, the second column gives suggested\nalternatives and the third column provides an explanation of why the words are\nproblematic.\n\n### IT-specific words and phrases\n\nProblem words| Suggested Alternative(s)| Context  \n---|---|---  \nblackout days/datesblack/gray days| blocked daysrestricted daysmake no changes\nperiod| Definition:\u201cBlackout dates\u201d in the technological world are dates where\nsomething is inaccessible or denied, such as when operations are shut down for\nmaintenance, when employees or executives are not allowed to trade in the\ncompany\u2019s share or when travel rewards and other special discounts or\npromotions are not available.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of the words \u201cblack\u201d for\nsomething undesirable, wrong or bad, and light or \u201cwhite\u201d for desirable, right\nor good perpetuates concepts that have been used to oppress people of color.  \nblack list (blacklist, black-list)| deny/denied list| Definition:In computing,\na \u201cblacklist\u201d or \u201cwhitelist\u201d is a basic access control mechanism; a\n\u201cwhitelist\u201d allows everyone access, and a \u201cblacklist\u201d denies its members\naccess.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of the words \u201cblack\u201d for something\nundesirable, wrong or bad, and light or \u201cwhite\u201d for desirable, right or good\nperpetuates concepts that have been used to oppress people of color.Using\nplain language (i.e.,\u201ddeny list\u201d or \u201callow list\u201d) makes the meaning more\nclear.  \nwhite list (whitelist, white-list)| allow list  \nblackbox| blackbox:closed boxclosed systemopaque glassboxfrosted glass\nboxmystery boxunknown originobfuscated| Definition:A \u201cblackbox\u201d is a reference\nto a physical machine (machine learning algorithms) or testing.In testing,\n\u201cwhite box\u201d indicates the presence of knowns and a clear view, and \u201cblack box\u201d\nindicates unknowns or lack of visibility.Why it\u2019s problematic:Because these\nwords are derivatives of racist tropes \u2014 \u201cblack\u201d for something undesirable,\nwrong or bad, and light or \u201cwhite\u201d for desirable, right or good \u2014 they\nperpetuate concepts that have been used to oppress people of color.  \nwhitebox| whitebox:knownopen boxopen systemglass boxclear boxclear box testing  \nblackbox/whitebox|\nblackbox/whitebox:clear/opaqueviewed/hiddenvisible/invisibleclarify  \nBlackhatBlack Hat Hacker/ blackhat hacker|\nunethicalmaliciousmalevolentmalignantbadcriminalunethical hacker| Definition:A\n\u201cblackhat,\u201d \u201cBlack Hat\u201d or \u201cblackhat\u201d hacker are criminal hackers that\nconcentrate on malicious breaking of cyber defenses for money or fame.A\n\u201cwhitehat,\u201d \u201cWhite Hat\u201d or \u201cwhitehat\u201d hacker are ethical hackers who focus on\ntesting cyber defenses as part of an organized corporate development process,\ncybersecurity plan or strategy.A \u201cGray Hat Hacker\u201d is a hacker who exploits a\nweakness in cyber defense and brings the weakness to the attention of the\nowner, with the goal of improving security. They don\u2019t have permission to hack\ninto a system; they bring attention to the system owner, so they are\nstraddling between right and wrong. They think they\u2019re doing good, but they\u2019re\nstill doing something illegal.Why it\u2019s problematic:Because these words are\nderivatives of racist tropes \u2014 \u201cblack\u201d for something undesirable, wrong or\nbad, and light or \u201cwhite\u201d for desirable, right or good \u2014 they perpetuate\nconcepts that have been used to oppress people of color.  \nWhitehatWhite Hat Hacker/ whitehat hacker| security\nresearcherethicalbenevolentbenigngoodethical hacker  \nGray Hat Hacker| Hacktivist  \ngrandfather clause/ grandfather policy/ grandfather rightgrandfathered (in)\ngrandfathering| Legacylegacy statusexempt| Definition:A \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause,\n\u201cgrandfather\u201d policy or \u201cgrandfathering\u201d in IT s a provision in which an old\nrule continues to apply to some existing situations while a new rule will\napply to all future cases. Those exempt from the new rule are said to have\ngrandfather rights, acquired rights, or to have been grandfathered in.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:\u201cGrandfathering\u201d or \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d was used as a way to\nexempt some people from a change because of conditions that existed before the\nchange (e.g., we\u2019ve grandfathered some users on an unlimited data plan.\u201d)\n\u201cGrandfather clause\u201d originated in the American South in the 1890s as a way to\ndefy the 15th Amendment and prevent black Americans from voting.  \nmaster| sourcemainactiveprimaryparent (note: the parent/child binary may be\nhelpful in certain contexts, and so consider the association and connotation\nwhen used, as it may not be helpful)headin chargeprincipalactiveleaderlocal|\nDefinition:The master-slave relationship in technology usually refers to a\nsystem where one \u2014 the master \u2014 controls or is at the top or head of other\ncopies, processes or systems.Why it\u2019s problematic:The master/slave metaphor in\ntechnology dates back to at least 1904, describing a sidereal clock system at\nan observatory in Cape Town, according to a 2007 essay by Ron Eglash, a\nprofessor at the University of Michigan. He argued that the words may have\nbeen chosen to emphasize the concept of a \u201cfree master that did no work and a\nslave that followed the master\u2019s orders made for a vivid, if ethically\nsuspect, technosocial metaphor.\u201dNote: Consider the context in which \u201cmaster\u201d\nis used, and whether that use is derived from the racist binary\n\u201cmaster/slave:\u201d where the \u201cmaster\u201d controls an inferior process or system.For\nexample, a Master\u2019s degree or the common use of master in degrees, such as\nMaster of Science, Master of Arts, etc., suggests a mastery of a subject, and\nthus is not deemed derogatory.\n\n  * Example of proper usage: \u201cShe is a master at the game of chess.\u201d\n\nHowever, if \u201cmaster\u201d is in reference to a person who is in charge of a group\nand evokes the offensive \u201cmaster-slave\u201d dynamic, then \u201cmaster\u201d should be\nreplaced.For example, a Kanban flow master facilitates Kanban meetings,\ncontinuous improvement initiatives and process reviews. Kanban project\nmanagement has been evolving in recent years to de-emphasize the master role,\nand the focus is now on Service Delivery Manager and Service Request Manager.  \nslave| replicasecondarychildworkerfollowerpassivebranchstandbyremoteprimary\nrecord, file or recording of data/ secondary record, file or recording of\ndata.  \nmaster/slave (relationship)| hierarchicalparent-childprimary-replicaprimary-\nsecondaryactive-passiveactive-standbyleader-followerconductor-musicianorigin-\nclonelead-supportlocal-remote  \n(Kanban) flow master| (Kanban) flow manager  \nScrum master| Agile LeadAgile Program ManagerAgile CoachAgile Team\nFacilitatorScrum CoachScrum TeacherScrum LeaderScrum FacilitatorServant\nLeaderScrum CustodianScrum GuardianScrum GuideProcess ExpertProcess Lead  \nmaster branch| trunkmain branch  \nwebmaster/ Web master| Web product ownerWeb managerWebsite managerProduct\nManager  \nfirst-class citizenfirst-class function first-class controlfirst-class data\ntype| typeobjectentityvalue| Definition:In programming language design, a\n\u201cfirst-class citizen\u201d in a given programming language is an entity which\nsupports all the operations generally available to other entities. These\noperations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a\nfunction, modified and assigned to a variableWhy it\u2019s problematic:\u201cFirst-class\ncitizen\u201d implies that this particular value is the best quality or in the\nhighest grade, and thus others under this group are second-class or lower\nclass. Using cultural hierarchies in people-people relationships to denote\nrelationships between things is a form of classism, which is prejudice against\nor in favor of people belonging to a particular social class.  \nmob programming| whole teamswarmingherd programmingtroopcollaborative\nprogramming| Definition:Mob programming (informally mobbing) is a software\ndevelopment approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same\ntime, in the same space, and on the same computer.Why it\u2019s problematic:The\nintention was for a general, non-hierarchical group of people to self-organize\nand by accomplishing tasks \u201cbe dangerous.\u201d However, historically, the use of\n\u201cmob\u201d has a racial component and has been used derogatorily and in a negative\nway.  \nRed TeamWhite TeamYellow TeamRed Atomic Team| Cyber OffenseCyber Exercise\nCellDevSecOps Team| Definition:In cybersecurity, colorization of teams is used\nto differentiate between different roles or personas in a cybersecurity\ncontext. For example, the red team is \u201coffensive security,\u201d white team is\n\u201ccoordinators or referees,\u201d the yellow team is the builders of software,\netc.Why it\u2019s problematic:Using colors based as racist tropes \u2014 labelling\n\u201cwhite\u201d as good, \u201cblack\u201d as bad, \u201cred\u201d as attackers, or \u201cyellow\u201d as excluded\nthird parties \u2014 is offensive.Also, \u201cred atomic\u201d surfaces associations to the\nCold War and negative relations with Russia, which was often denoted as \u201cred\u201d\nand therefore bad because the country was communist.  \ndumb terminal| terminalcomputer terminalthin client| Definition:An original,\nand still technically intact, Old English meaning of the word dumb, which\nmeans to be mute/unable to speak. The function of a terminal is confined to\nthe display and input of data (no local programmable data processing\ncapability) and depends on the host computer for its processing power.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:It\u2019s a negative word often associated negatively with those who\ncannot speak and should not be used in an association with technology.  \ndummy value| placeholder valuesample valuetest data/test valuepseudo value|\nDefinition:A known test or sample values for an identifier or scheme that has\nno meaningful value.Why it\u2019s problematic:The origin of the word, \u201cdummy,\u201d is a\nperson who cannot speak. Because the use of this word is often negatively\nassociated with a disability, implying a person is worthless, ineffective or\nincapable, an alternative word should be used.  \nsanity check| quick checkconfidence check coherence checkgut check|\nDefinition:A test run to confirm or validate something that should follow very\nclear and simple logic. For example, after receiving the software build,\nsanity testing is performed to ensure that the code changes introduced are\nworking as expected. If the sanity test fails, the build is rejected by the\ntesting team to save time and money.Why it\u2019s problematic:The phrase sanity\ncheck is ableist, and unnecessarily references mental health in code bases. It\ndenotes that people with mental illnesses are inferior, wrong, or incorrect.\nUsing an appropriate replacement will also clarify what is intended.  \nMom/girlfriend test| user testtest with novice users| Definition: Putting a\nproduct in front of people who are unfamiliar with it to learn more how they\nwould use the product.Why it\u2019s problematic:The assumption \u2014 if a mom or\ngirlfriend can use a program, anyone can \u2014 is both sexist and ageist.  \nmale or female connectors and fasteners| connector and receptacleplug and\nsocketpin and receptacle| Definition:A \u201cmale\u201d connector is commonly referred\nto as a plug and has a solid pin for a center conductor. A \u201cfemale\u201d connector\nis commonly referred to as a jack and has a center conductor with a hole in it\nto accept the \u201cmale\u201d pin.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of male or female anatomy to\ndescribe electrical and IT connectors and fasteners and sexualize how they fit\ntogether is inherently problematic. Applicability of the issue includes for\nUSB and A/V jacks.  \nman-in-the-middle| person-in-the-middlemachine-in-the-middlemonster-in-the-\nmiddle| Definition:In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle\nattack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters\nthe communications between two parties who believe that they are directly\ncommunicating with each other.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of \u201cman\u201d is not\ninclusive, and thus sexist.  \n  \n### Other Problematic Words\n\nThe problematic words and phrases are grouped into four categories and in\ntable format. The categories are:\n\n  * Race, Ethnicity, Nationality, Religion, Native/Indigenous Identity\n  * Disability and Ableism\n  * Ageism\n  * Gender and sexual orientation\n\nThe following table is organized into three columns. The first column lists\nthe problem word or words and phrases, the second column gives suggested\nalternatives, and the third column provides an explanation of why the words\nare problematic.\n\n#### Race, Ethnicity, Nationality, Religion, Native/Indigenous Identity\n\nProblem words| Suggested Alternative(s)| Context  \n---|---|---  \ntribal knowledge| institutional knowledgeorganizational knowledge| Definition:\nThe word \u201ctribe\u201d is sometimes used to mean a well-connected or organized group\nof people. \u201cTribal knowledge\u201d refers to the collective information of people\nwho work together for an organization such as employees in a unit. But using\nforms of tribe in this way are offensive to many American Indian and Alaska\nNative and world indigenous peoples.Why it\u2019s problematic: In a Western\ncontext, the word \u201ctribal\u201d often implies savage and further perpetuates\nstereotypes of primitiveness, lack of culture and uneducated. Calling people\n\u201ctribal\u201d is equivalent to a racial stereotype.Institutional knowledge is more\naccurate when referring to a long-time employee\u2019s understanding of processes\nand operations. Reserve the use of \u201cTribal\u201d at the UW to apply specifically to\nthe UW\u2019s acknowledgement of the \u201cCoast Salish peoples of this land, the land\nwhich touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish,\nTulalip and Muckleshoot nations.\u201d\n\n  * Potentially offensive/non-inclusive example: \u201cMuch of what we know about these processes comes from tribal knowledge.\u201d\n  * Correction: \u201cMuch of what we know about these processes comes from institutional knowledge.\u201d\n\n  \nbrown bags| lunch and learntech talks| Definition:A brown bag lunch, sometimes\nreferred to as a brown bag meeting, is an informal training session usually\nheld during lunch, and implies that employees should bring their own lunches\nfrom home to participate.Why it\u2019s problematic:Brown bags trace back to the\n\u201cbrown paper bag test,\u201d which was traditionally used to judge skin color by\ncertain African-American sororities and fraternities. References to a \u201cbrown\nbag\u201d when we are really referencing a get-together over lunch surfaces an ugly\nperiod of American history that can alienate and offend people.It would be\nmore clear to say: bring your own lunch.  \ncakewalk (and the shortened \u201ctakes the cake\u201d)| easy| Definition:A \u201ccakewalk\u201d\nis an easy victory or task. \u201cTakes the cake\u201d means to win the prize or to rank\nfirst.Why it\u2019s problematic:The cakewalk was a pre-Civil War dance performed by\nenslaved people, and the winner of which would be given a cake. This is the\noriginal source for the phrases \u201ctakes the cake\u201d and \u201ccakewalk.\u201d Because of\nthis history, this word and phrase should be avoided.  \ngyp / gip| stealscamdefraudcheat| Definition:The word \u201cgypsy\u201d originated as a\nterm used to refer to the Romani (or Roma), a nomadic ethnic group who were\ncharacterized as thieves and swindlers. Hence, the term \u201cgyp / gip\u201d is used to\nrefer to the act of stealing.Why it\u2019s problematic:All versions of this term\nshould be avoided as they are derogatory to the Romani people.  \nlower the bar| simplifyinclusivemake more accessible| Definition:This phrase\nis based on the erroneous idea that a company has to relax hiring standards in\norder to add people from different racial, ethnic, gender backgrounds.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:In fact, in many cases it\u2019s the opposite; companies that have\npoorly designed hiring practices fail to adequately evaluate highly qualified,\nand often diverse, candidates.  \nmantra| North Starelevator pitchmission statement motto| Definition:While\n\u201cmantra\u201d is a word or sound repeated to aid in concentration or meditation,\nthe word is often used to imply someone\u2019s basic belief or belief that they\nlive and work by.Why it\u2019s problematic:Many people in the Buddhist and Hindu\ncommunity hold this term \u201cmantra\u201d as highly spiritual and religious\nexperience, and is not to be used with nonchalance.  \nMinority(if used to comment on a specific group of people and how the group\nwould like to be referred to isn\u2019t considered)| Native AmericanAfrican\nAmericanpeople of colortraditionally underserved communityhistorically\nexcluded| Definition:\u201cMinority\u201d literally means the smaller number or part, or\na number that is less than half the whole number. Often \u201cminority\u201d refers to\ngroups of people that are racially or ethnically different from the racial or\nethnic \u201cmajority.\u201dWhy it\u2019s problematic:When \u201cminority\u201d is used to refer to\nother races or abilities, used as a generalized term for \u201cthe other\u201d and\nimplies a \u201cless than\u201d attitude toward the community or communities being\ndiscussed. For example, the minority neighborhood (when talking about redlined\nareas of a town); the minority agenda, when people insinuate that the agenda\nis negative. The nuance and context of how the word is used is important to\nconsider.Avoid referring to an individual as a \u201cminority\u201d unless in a\nquotation.Use either community-specific terms (e.g., \u201cNative American,\u201d\n\u201cAfrican American,\u201d etc.) or the general term \u201cpeople of color\u201d when referring\nto racial or ethnic communities.When referring to other marginalized\ncommunities, clarify which specific community or communities are being\ndiscussed.Potentially offensive/non-inclusive examples:\n\n  * \u201cEl Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles State Historic Park, in the oldest section of Los Angeles, is the location of some of the most significant cultural landmarks of L.A.\u2019s minority.\u201d\n  * \u201cThat city has several minority neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nCorrections:\n\n  * \u201cEl Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles State Historic Park, in the oldest section of Los Angeles, is the location of some of the most significant cultural landmarks of L.A.\u2019s diverse Latino population.\u201d\n  * \u201cThat city has several neighborhoods historically affected by red-lining practices.\u201d\n\n  \nnative speakernon-native speaker(If used to imply a speaker of English who\nlives in the U.S. or a person who learned English and lives in the U.S., then\nthese words are problematic)| English as a primary languageEnglish as first\nlanguageEnglish language learnersEnglish as a secondary language (ESL)|\nDefinition:A person who has or hasn\u2019t spoken the language in question from\nearly childhood.Why it\u2019s problematic:Over time, as officials have recognized\nthat some of these labels can perpetuate negative or inaccurate narratives,\nthe terminology regarding those whose first language isn\u2019t English has changed\nand evolved.English is not the native language of the land occupied by the\nUnited States of America.Other terms better describe people learning English\nas a secondary language from their primary language. The U.S. Department of\nEducation talks about English language learners (ELL) or just English learners\n(EL). The Center for Promise, the research institute at America\u2019s Promise,\nuses students whose first language is not English (FLNE).  \nninjaguru| expertAgile expertcharismatic persontalented personspecialist|\nDefinition:A person who excels in a particular skill or activity.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:These words are culturally appropriative and thus are\nproblematic.In tech job descriptions, these words can be perceived as more\nmasculine and therefore discourage some groups from applying. These words also\ndon\u2019t identify exactly what qualities and qualifications are being sought.  \nno can do| I can\u2019t do itNot possible or not feasible (within a time frame, or\nwithin the parameters)| Definition:\u201cNo can do\u201d is a colloquial or slang phrase\nthat means \u201cI cannot do it.\u201dWhy it\u2019s problematic:What might seem like a\nfolksy, abbreviated version of \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u201d is actually an imitation of\nChinese Pidgin English. The phrase dates from the mid-nineteenth to early-\ntwentieth centuries, an era when Western attitudes towards the Chinese were\nmarkedly racist.  \noff the reservation| out of bounds out of the norm| Definition:To deviate from\nwhat\u2019s expected or customary; to behave unexpectedly or independently.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:Native American peoples were restricted to reservations created by\nthe U.S. government, and their freedom was severely limited by the terms of\nthe treaties they were often forced to sign. The term can feel like a slight\nbecause it doesn\u2019t acknowledge the origins of the phrase that was used\nhistorically in contempt of Native Americans.  \nopen the kimono| full disclosureprovide insight into| Definition:\u201cOpen the\nkimono\u201d means to reveal what is being planned or to share important\ninformation freely.Why it\u2019s problematic:A kimono is associated with formal\nattire in Japanese culture. Over time, this 1970s-era slang has been\nmisinterpreted from myths that certain Japanese warriors would open their\nrobes to show someone that they were not hiding their weapons. Kimonos were\nalso worn by geishas \u2014 highly trained hostesses who throughout history have\nbeen inaccurately depicted as concubines in various films and books. Both\namplify a stereotypical view of Japanese culture.  \npeanut gallery| upper balcony/galleryother tierthe cheap seatsobservers|\nDefinition:The upper levels of a balcony, gallery, theater and often the least\nexpensive.Why it\u2019s problematic:Peanut gallery originally referred to the\nbalconies of segregated theaters, where African Americans had to sit. Peanuts\nwere introduced to America during the slave trade, and thus became associated\nwith Black people.  \npow wow| huddlestandupdiscussionmeetingmeetup| Definition:A North American\nIndian ceremony involving feasting, singing and dancing.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:Using the word \u201cpow wow\u201d is cultural misappropriation, and\nultimately racist.  \nredline| scrapshelvemothballcanceldropeditmarked up (legal comments in a doc)|\nDefinition:Collaborative text editing or to designate what\u2019s included and\nwhat\u2019s not included.Why it\u2019s problematic:Because the word is so strongly\nassociated with discriminatory practices and policies, it is best to use an\nalternative word if collaborative editing is being referenced.  \nsherpa| guidecoachleadertutor| Definition:A Sherpa is a person with Tibetan\nheritage who lives in the Nepalese Himalayas. The ethnic group is well-known\nbecause there are so many Sherpas that have served as porters on mountain-\nclimbing expeditions.Why it\u2019s problematic:Referring to someone as a \u201csherpa\u201d\nis cultural appropriation.  \nspirit animal| kindred spiritBFFpersonal iconrole model| Definition:Spirit\nanimals are an important part of the belief system of some cultures and refer\nto a spirit that \u201chelps guide or protect a person on a journey and whose\ncharacteristics that person shares or embodies.\u201dWhy it\u2019s problematic:Referring\nto something as your spirit animal is cultural appropriation.  \ntotem pole (e.g., low person on the totem pole)| hierarchy| Definition:A totem\npole or monumental pole is a tall structure created by Northwest Coast\nIndigenous peoples that showcases a nation\u2019s, family\u2019s or individual\u2019s history\nand displays their rights to certain territories, songs, dances and other\naspects of their culture.Why it\u2019s problematic:Using \u201ctotem pole\u201d is culturally\nappropriative.  \n  \n#### Disability and Ableism\n\nProblem words| Suggested Alternative(s)| Context  \n---|---|---  \nblind to the truthblind eye toblind spot|\nimperceptiveignorantuneducatedinsensitivedenseunawarechoosing to ignorebiased\nagainst| Definition:Several colloquialisms use the word \u201cblind\u201d to describe a\nlack of awareness.Why it\u2019s problematic:This phrase is ableist, connoting that\n\u201cblind\u201d is equivalent to ignorant.  \ncrazyinsane| bafflingconfusingdisorienteddisorientingamazingincrediblysuper\ndifficultvery\ncomplicatedwildirrationalridiculoussillyabsurdstrangeunnaturaloutrageousout of\nthis worldexcitinginfatuatedpassionateenthusiasticimpracticalsenseless|\nDefinition:Colloquially, labelling something \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cinsane\u201d is describing\nsomething that is chaotic, unorganized, or nonsensical.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:Historically, \u201ccrazy\u201d was commonly used to describe someone\nsuffering from mental illness and not mentally sound.Using a word associated\nwith mental health and attributing it to someone or something is problematic\nbecause it perpetuates the stigma associated with mental health issues.\u201cCrazy\u201d\nis a word with many uses and connotations, but it\u2019s recommended to avoid this\nword as much as possible.  \ncripple(s)| slow(s) downinhibitshindersprevents| Definition:A lame or partly\ndisabled state of being that is deprived of the capability for service or of\nstrength, efficiency or wholeness.Why it\u2019s problematic:This is an ableist word\nthat tends to be used with a negative connotation describing the disability.  \ndumbdumb-down| cluelessuninformedignorantmute or nonvocalsimplify (to replace\ndumb-down)| Definition:The origin of the word, \u201cdumb,\u201d is a person who cannot\nspeak.Why it\u2019s problematic:It\u2019s a negative word often associated negatively\nwith those who cannot speak.  \n\u201cdeaf\u201d to something; fell on deaf ears| unwilling to hear or\nlistenignorantunwilling to\nlearn/understandmisunderstandinguneducateddensedidn\u2019t\nlistenignoreddisregarded| Definition:This phrase connotes that being deaf is\nthe same as being unwilling to listen.Why it\u2019s problematic:There is a long\nhistory of associating people who are deaf with being unintelligent. It stems\nfrom the idea that if someone cannot use their voice and speak then they do\nnot have anything of value to share.  \nlame| weak| Definition:Originally, the word was used in reference to people\nwith reduced mobility, and now it\u2019s often a synonym for \u201cuncool.\u201dWhy it\u2019s\nproblematic:This word is offensive, even when it\u2019s used in slang for uncool\nbecause it\u2019s using a disability in a negative way to imply that the opposite,\nwhich would be not lame, to be superior. This use is considered ableist.  \nnormal, healthy (to denote people without disabilities)| nondisabled\npersonsighted personhearing personperson without disabilitiesneurotypical\npersondesired state| Definition:These words are often (and problematically)\nused to describe a person who does not have disabilities.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:People with disabilities are equally healthy, and calling someone\nwithout a disability \u201cnormal\u201d is denigrating those with disabilities as\n\u201cabnormal\u201d and therefore, \u201cnormal\u201d is an ableist word.\n\n  * Potentially offensive/ non-inclusive example: \u201cA normal person can use both mouse and keyboard with their computers.\u201d\n  * Correction: \u201cPeople without physical disabilities have the option of using a mouse, keyboard or both with their computers.\u201d\n\n  \nsee (this web page)| read or visit this web pagehyperlink to the\nreferenceviewread| Definition:The definition of \u201csee\u201d can mean to look with\none\u2019s eyes at something, and so is associated with vision. It can also be used\non a website or in a story posted online to mean \u201crefer to,\u201d \u201cvisit,\u201d \u201cknow\u201d\nor \u201cunderstand.\u201dWhy it\u2019s problematic:Though these uses of the word \u201csee\u201d\naren\u2019t inherently incorrect or necessarily offensive, content providers should\navoid using the word \u201csee\u201d in situations in which a more accurate, non-ableist\nword would be better.\n\n  * Potentially offensive/ non-inclusive example: \u201cSee the notes at the end of the article.\u201d\n  * Correction: \u201cRefer to the notes at the end of the article.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n#### Ageism\n\nProblem words| Suggested Alternative(s)| Context  \n---|---|---  \nGray Beard| Use the person\u2019s nameexperienced personknowledgeable personsource\nperson| Definition:An older, more experienced IT or cybersecurity person, who\nmay be sought after for their experience and wisdom born from study and\nexperience over a lifetime.Why it\u2019s problematic:Using this phrase can be\nperceived as derogatory toward someone\u2019s age.  \n  \n#### Gender and sexual orientation\n\nProblem words| Suggested Alternative(s)| Context  \n---|---|---  \nhe/she as an inclusive combined subject pronoun, also:s/hehe or shehe and\nshehis and herhis or her| they/them/ theirs as singular (neutral)|\nDefinition:In the past, when referring to others, the binary pronoun (he/she)\nand possessive pronoun (his/her) was often used.Why it\u2019s problematic:Using the\nbinary pronoun and possessive pronoun is no longer considered accurate due to\ngreater understanding and acceptance that gender and sexual orientation are\nnot binary or limited to male and female or he/she and his/her.\n\n  * Potentially offensive/ non-inclusive example: Applicants for the position should submit his/her resume and cover letter.\u201d\n  * Correction: \u201cApplicants for the position should submit their resume and cover letter.\u201d\n\n  \nfreshman, freshmen| first-year student| Definition:Term applies to people in\nthe first year of a traditional four-year undergraduate degree program.Why\nit\u2019s problematic:Use of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cmen\u201d in \u201cfreshman/freshmen\u201d is not\ninclusive, and thus sexist.  \nhousekeeping| maintenancecleanupoverview| Definition:Housekeeping refers to\nthe management of business duties and tasks.Why it\u2019s problematic:In reference\nto office work, this language can feel gendered. It carries a fraught history\nand connotation of women\u2019s traditional domestic role as housekeepers.  \nman (verb: e.g., \u201cI\u2019ll be manning the front desk\u201d)| staffingworking|\nDefinition:To staff or furnish with a person or people, such as in customer\nservice.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of \u201cman\u201d is not inclusive, and thus sexist.  \nman hours| person hours engineer hours, hours of effort, work hours, labor\nhours| Definition:Hours of a worker\u2019s time.Why it\u2019s problematic:Use of \u201cman\u201d\nis not inclusive, and thus sexist. Gender is unnecessary when describing time\nworked.  \nmanpower| workforcehuman effort| Definition:People capable of doing the work\nnecessary to complete a task.Why it\u2019s problematic:The word \u201cmanpower\u201d is\ngendered in a way that implies that men are required for a task, when gender\nis irrelevant to a task\u2019s completion.  \npreferred pronouns| pronouns personal pronouns| Definition:Pronouns that\nindividuals use to substitute for themselves in the third-person and how they\nprefer to be referred to. Examples include: he/his/him, she/her/hers,\nthey/their/theirs, ze/hir/hirs and ze/zir/zirs.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:\u201cPreferred\u201d implies that a person\u2019s pronoun is optional, and it\nsuggests that gender identity and expression is a preference and that\nrespectful pronoun use is therefore optional. Gender identity and expression\nis more complex than that, and respectful use is neither preferred nor\noptional; it is expected and warranted.  \nupperclassman, upperclassmen| junior or senior student(s)returning student(s)|\nDefinition:A student who is a junior or senior in secondary school or\ncollege.Why it\u2019s problematic:Using \u201cmen\u201d or \u201cman\u201d is not inclusive and\nconsidered sexist.  \nguys| folkspeopleyou ally\u2019allfriends| Definition:Used to refer to people in a\ngroup or audience, regardless of their sex.Why it\u2019s problematic:Avoid gendered\npronouns that favor one gender over the other and aim for those that are\ninclusive.  \nladies/gals| womenfolkspeopleyou ally\u2019allfriends| Definition:Used to refer to\nwomen in a group or audience.Why it\u2019s problematic:Terms like \u201cladies,\u201d \u201cgals\u201d\nor others can feel patronizing to some.  \nmankind| humankind| Definition:The human race; humankind.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:Using \u201cman\u201dkind to represent all of humankind is sexist.  \nsexual preferencelifestyle| sexual orientation| Definition:Romantic or sexual\nattraction (or a combination) to persons of the opposite sex or gender, the\nsame sex or gender, to both sexes or more than one gender.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:The terms \u201csexual preference\u201d and \u201clifestyle\u201d are considered\noffensive because they imply that a person\u2019s sexuality is a choice.  \nGay, as a generic term| LGBTQIA+LGBTQQIAAP| Definition:Gay is a term used to\nrefer to homosexuality, a homosexual person, or a homosexual male.Why it\u2019s\nproblematic:The term \u201cgay\u201d has fallen out of favor, and the preferred term is\nnow LGBTQIA+ which stands for:L \u2013 Lesbian. Lesbian is a term used to refer to\nhomosexual females.G \u2013 Gay. Gay is a term used to refer to homosexuality, a\nhomosexual person, or a homosexual male.B \u2013 Bisexual.
