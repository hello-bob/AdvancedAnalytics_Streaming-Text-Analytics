The chipmaker's 3nm technology is one of the most advanced\nsemiconductor processes available, offering significant improvements in\nperformance and energy efficiency over the previous 5nm and 7nm nodes.\n\nApple's purported move toward developing a specialist AI server processor is\nreflective of the company's ongoing strategy to vertically integrate its\nsupply chain. By designing its own server chips, Apple can tailor hardware\nspecifically to its software needs, potentially leading to more powerful and\nefficient technologies.\n\nApple could use its own AI processors to enhance the performance of its data\ncenters and future AI tools that rely on the cloud. While Apple is rumored to\nbe prioritizing on-device processing for many of its upcoming AI tools, it is\ninevitable that some operations will have to occur in the cloud. By the time\nthe custom processor could be integrated into operational servers in late\n2025, Apple's new AI strategy should be well underway.\n\nThe Weibo user has a number of accurate previous claims, including that the\niPhone 7 would be water-resistant and that the standard iPhone 14 models would\ncontinue using the A15 Bionic chip, with the more advanced A16 chip being\nexclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models. These predictions were later\ncorroborated by multiple credible sources and proved correct upon the\nproducts' release.\n\nTags: Artificial Intelligence, Phone Chip Expert, TSMC\n\n[ 12 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nPeterKeller\n\n1 hour ago at 07:00 am\n\nThis makes SO MUCH sense. The biggest long term cost of server farms is power\nand cooling. And with Apple's chip technology, they have an advantage here.\nMargins on these things must be excellent and a new line of Apple Servers with\ncustom chips could be a big growth area - something that Tim Cook needs for\nthe stock to continue to grow. Also, NVidia is the only game in town at the\nmoment, so it's not like it's a crowded field.\n\nThis is a much better idea than a Car or even VR Goggles, IMHO. (Although they\nshould be throwing a bunch of stuff at the wall to see what sticks)\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nguzhogi\n\n47 minutes ago at 07:14 am\n\n> Xserve AI\n\nJust about to say how much I miss the Xserve. I know it didn't sell well, and\nI'm sure servers don't have that high a margin. It would be cool to have a Mac\nserver again, though. With the size of the motherboard, I wonder if Apple\ncould do blade servers or something?\n\nScore: 4 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nHellHound911\n\n1 hour ago at 07:01 am\n\nIf Apple only allowed the NUVIA founders to pursue their AI & server\naspirations...
