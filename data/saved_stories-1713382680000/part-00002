The first\none that got me was that you need to hold down the mouse button to keep a menu\nopen; clicking isn\u2019t enough. Or the way the Apple Menu has applications in it,\nrather than system commands. Or the way that folders\u2019 icons get greyed out\nwhen they\u2019re open, or the old spatial Finder, or the Zoom button on the right,\nor how you can only resize windows from the bottom-right corner instead of\nfrom any side.\n\nBut there was one more feature that I decided I sorely miss, despite not\nhaving thought about it for a couple decades: Balloon Help.\n\nYou can boot up System 7.0.1 in your browser, courtesy of the Internet\nArchive.\n\nThere is also another more lightweight version, thanks to James Friend.\n\nSystem 7 was released on this day, 28 years ago!\n\nIn this post, I use pixelated screenshots which look authentic on some screens\nbut horrible on others. If they look horrible for you, set the images to\n\u201csmooth\u201d below. (You may not see a difference at all)\n\n## What is Balloon Help? #\n\nIf you go to the Help menu at the right-hand side of the Menu Bar, you\u2019ll see\nan option: Show Balloons. Do this, and wherever you hover the mouse cursor\nover anything, you\u2019ll see a brief explanation appear:\n\nMenu Bar items tell you what they do when clicked on.\n\nApplication icons provide a short description of what the application does,\nwho made it, and how to use it.\n\nUser interface elements come with a short piece of text explaining their\nfunction.\n\nEven the System Folder has its own tagline.\n\nEven if these UI elements are now commonplace after we\u2019ve been using them for\nyears and years \u2014 title bars, scroll bars, and close buttons \u2014 they would have\nbeen new to everybody at some point. And what better way to learn, than if you\ncould get help with anything, just by pointing at it?\n\nWhich is why, if you\u2019re seeing this feature while playing around in the\nemulator, I bet you\u2019d have the same reaction as I did 25 years ago: playing\naround with it for a few minutes and then switching it off. As though it was a\ntool for newbies, and once you\u2019ve learnt how it all works, you don\u2019t need it\nanymore.\n\nAnd, well, this is true. While the balloons weren\u2019t huge, they did take up\nroom on the screen and get very annoying very quickly \u2014 and those machines had\ntiny screens relative to the ones we have now.\n\nUnder the surface, however, Balloon Help is far more important a feature than\nit initially lets on, because it allows you to ask the question: Why isn\u2019t the\ncomputer letting me do what I want to do?\n\nThe greatest aspect of Balloon Help is that explained the why, not just the\nwhat. If part of the system was different from normal, such as an icon being\ndifferent, or a button or menu being greyed out, the system would offer an\nexplanation. Here are some more examples:\n\nWhen an icon looks different from normal, you can find out why.\n\nWhen a menu bar item is disabled, you get an explanation.\n\nWhen a button is disabled, again, it tells you why.\n\nIf an application is limited, it has to provide you with an explanation.\n\nIf a button is disabled, the computer told you why it is so; it didn\u2019t just\ndisable the button hoping you figure it out yourself. It\u2019s the same with menu\nitems: if you couldn\u2019t select something from a menu, it would explain why.\n\nHaving full Balloon Help support meant admitting to the user that the computer\nis not perfect. That this machine, which you\u2019ve probably had to spend a lot of\nmoney on, isn\u2019t actually capable of bending to your every whim. And when you\ndo hit the limits, you can trust the computer to tell you that.\n\nMy favourite example is the one where the TeachText application outright\nadmits one of its limitations:\n\n> TeachText can only open one document at a time.\n\nThe Macintosh Plus only had 1 MB of RAM, but that\u2019s still not the user\u2019s\nfault, is it? They were trying to do something completely reasonable \u2014 open\ntwo documents at once \u2014 and the computer has to let them down.\n\nIt feels refreshing to just see a computer admit something like that, without\nthrowing obscure error messages in your face. Even though the machine couldn\u2019t\ndo what you told it to do, it was still on your side \u2014 because the alternative\nis just to sit there and do nothing, which looks exactly like the computer has\nbroken.\n\nCan we really say that this is still the case?\n\n## The Era of Helpful Computers #\n\nIf you keep on using Balloon Help, you\u2019ll quickly discover that very few\napplications actively supported it, even in 1991. Sure, the Finder and many of\nthe built-in system utilities had full support, but even the other\napplications included in the Internet Archive\u2019s OS image do nothing when you\nhover over their controls. It\u2019s always less work to do nothing than to do\nsomething, and with few applications supporting it, people didn\u2019t expect it to\nbe there, so support for it languished further. It was finally removed\nentirely in Mac OS X.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s a real shame.\n\nOne alternative is to provide tooltips for inactive menu items instead of\ndisabling them.\n\nAs the article says, this is probably the only time users want to see\ntooltips! I\u2019m not sure if this still works or not.\n\nRelatively often, I see menu bar items that are disabled, or buttons that I\u2019m\nnot allowed to click. The other day, I discovered that Outlook won\u2019t let me\ndisplay the weather for some reason:\n\nThe engineer behind this feature probably knows exactly why this isn\u2019t\nhappening: your company policy has disabled the thingy! But it\u2019s not obvious\nto me, the user. It both looks, and feels, broken. It\u2019s also not obvious why I\ncouldn\u2019t delete or rename this task list in Reminders:\n\nOr why I couldn\u2019t quit Safari the other day:\n\nAgain, there\u2019s probably some technical reason behind this. Maybe the list\ncalled \u201cTasks\u201d is special somehow, or Safari was busy doing something. I don\u2019t\nknow. I do know that Chess is considered part of the operating system, and\ncan\u2019t be deleted, but the OS itself doesn\u2019t want to tell me that:\n\nSoftware companies have taken advantage of this lack of expectation, and now\ncomputers have taken on authorities of their own. And now it\u2019s gone, we can\u2019t\nget it back. The computer no longer wants to tell you what it is doing.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that a million people have tried dragging music files from\ntheir iPods or their iPhones to their computers. iTunes (now Music) doesn\u2019t\nlet you do that. If you try, it won\u2019t let you. There\u2019s no explanation or piece\nof text that explains why you can\u2019t do that; it just doesn\u2019t let you.\n\nAre you being stopped to help prevent piracy? Or is it trying to push you\ntowards the iTunes Music store? Or could they just not get the feature\nworking, so they left it like that?\n\nPart of me thinks, if the developers behind these features had to literally\nexplain them using simple English, they\u2019d see how unfriendly the work they\u2019re\ndoing is. \u201cYour company policy has disabled showing the weather\u201d would go a\nlong way, but \u201cWe\u2019re intentionally disallowing dragging music to your computer\nso you use the iTunes store instead\u201d would go further.\n\nThere\u2019s precedent for this in programming. If you\u2019ve got some code that\ndoesn\u2019t work under a set of circumstances, it\u2019s tempting to just leave it in\nthere as a bug \u2014 unless you have to document that bug:\n\n> Ritchie adds: \u201cOur habit of trying to document bugs and limitations visibly\n> was enormously useful to the system. As we put out each edition, the\n> presence of these sections shamed us into fixing innumerable things rather\n> than exhibiting them in public. I remember clearly adding or editing many of\n> these sections, then saying to myself \u201cI can\u2019t write this\u201d, and fixing the\n> code instead.\u201d\n>\n> \u2014 UNIX Evolution: 1975-1984, Part I (Section 2)\n\nThis is why I miss Balloon Help \u2014 I miss the era of computing it came from.\u220e\n\nAll posts\n\n", "frontpage": false}
