A big and important national security bill just passed the House,\ncontaining aid for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel, as well as a demand that\nTikTok separate from its Chinese parent company. This is big news, but the\nbill still has to go to the Senate on Tuesday. I\u2019ll write about it if and when\nit passes the Senate. In the meantime, today\u2019s list of interesting things\nfocuses more on domestic matters.\n\nFirst, though, we have podcasts. There are two episodes of Econ 102 this week.\nThe podcast is morphing to a Q&A format, which listeners seem to be enjoying a\nlot. If you want to submit questions to the show, you can email the producers\nat Econ102@turpentine.co.\n\nNow, on to this week\u2019s list of interesting things:\n\n####\n\n1\\. \u201cWoke capital\u201d thrives when competition is weak\n\nOver the last decade, many large U.S. corporations moved away from a pure\nfocus on the bottom line, and became more socially and politically activist \u2014\nusually in a progressive direction. This phenomenon eventually became known as\n\u201cwoke capital\u201d. Fan (2019) sums up the trend:\n\n> Iconic companies such as Apple, BlackRock, Delta, Google (now Alphabet),\n> Lyft, Salesforce, and Starbucks, have recently taken very public stances on\n> various social issues. In the past, corporations were largely silent in the\n> face of them. Now the opposite is true\u2014corporations play an increasingly\n> visible role in social movements and there are times when corporations have\n> led the discussion, particularly in areas where they have a self-interest or\n> public opinion supports it. The enormous influence corporations wield on\n> both the economic and social fabric of our society due to the legal\n> framework and norms under which they operate make them uniquely positioned\n> to affect the outcome of social movements\u2014for better or worse.\n\nOthers scoffed at the idea, arguing that \u201cwoke capital\u201d would fail to change\nsociety in a meaningful way.\n\nBut over the last two years or so, woke capital seems to be in retreat. ESG\nand DEI, two of the main corporate policies associated with the trend, have\nbeen losing popularity to some degree:\n\nSource: Musa al-Gharbi\n\nA recent incident at Google may eventually be remembered as a watershed in\nthis process. A number of workers staged a sit-in protest over Google\u2019s\nprovision of cloud computing services to the Israeli government. Nine were\narrested. In response, Google fired 28 employees whom it determined to be\ninvolved with the protest in some way. CEO Sundar Pichai sent out a lengthy\nmemo to the company declaring that the company \u201cis a business, and not a place\nto act in a way that disrupts co-workers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt\nto use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues\nor debate politics.\u201d\n\nThe fired workers took to social media to decry the company\u2019s actions, with\nzero apparent result:\n\nGoogle\u2019s leaders were not, in fact, terrified of worker power, and had no\nproblem declaring exactly who they are.\n\nWhat explains the abrupt decline of woke capital? A general turn away from the\nattitudes and activism of the 2010s is probably part of it. But I think\neconomic forces are clearly at work here too. The rise in interest rates that\nbegan in 2022 was obviously part of it, putting pressure on corporate America\nto increase profitability. But another factor was probably competitive\npressure.\n\nGary Becker, the famous Chicago economist, had a theory that lack of\ncompetition allows companies the leeway to discriminate in ways that would\notherwise hurt them economically. In the 70s, that mainly meant discriminating\nagainst women and minorities. In fact, there\u2019s a decent amount of evidence in\nfavor of that theory, as I wrote in a post two years ago:\n\n#### Antitrust vs. ESG\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nJune 1, 2022\n\nRead full story\n\nIn the 2010s, companies often chose to discriminate in favor of the activist\nclass \u2014 hiring people whose main goal at work was to change society, rather\nthan to make money for the company. We tend to think of the rise of monopoly\npower and the rise of \u201cwoke capital\u201d as separate phenomena, but Becker\u2019s\ntheory suggests they were actually intimately related.\n\nIn recent years, competitive pressure has increased for companies like Google.\nThe reinvigorated antitrust movement at the Federal Trade Commission and\nJustice Department is probably exerting a chilling effect on both mergers and\non anticompetitive business practices. Google\u2019s search ad monopoly has come\nunder intense scrutiny, and is the subject of an ongoing antitrust lawsuit. In\naddition, the rise of generative AI is disrupting Google\u2019s core business\nmodel, offering an alternative way to find information on the internet.\n\nThus, Google can no longer afford to mess around like it used to. Cutting down\non employee perks is part of that. Eliminating the jobs of workers who show up\nto bash Google\u2019s policies instead of making the company money is another part\nof it.\n\nSo although progressives tend to strongly support antitrust, especially\nagainst big tech companies, it may play a key role in sunsetting the era of\n\u201cwoke capital\u201d. That would be quite an ironic turn of events.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Universities and the reallocation problem\n\nUniversities are a key part of the U.S. economy. They\u2019re responsible for much\nof our research output and much of our human capital production. Because\nuniversities are so crucial to America\u2019s economic machine, we support them\nwith any number of government policies \u2014 tax exempt status, massive R&D\nfunding, exemption from the H-1b visa cap, cheap subsidized loans for\nundergrads (which mostly flow directly into universities\u2019 pockets), and so on.\n\nSo if universities\u2019 economic productivity is suffering from structural\nproblems, it\u2019s a big deal. And I think that one problem we tend to overlook is\nthat universities have difficulty reallocating resources.\n\nFor example, the University of California San Diego just announced new limits\non how many people can major in computer science:\n\nThis seems a bit crazy, no? In recent years, a lot more students want to go to\ncollege to learn computer science:\n\nSource: Ben Schmidt\n\nSo who is the university to tell them no? Universities should respond to the\nincreasing demand for CS majors by hiring more CS profs and lecturers, and\ndecreasing the number of teachers in the subjects that students no longer want\nto study.\n\nOf course, doing that is actually pretty difficult. Not only does every\ndepartment head and dean in every university lobby the administrators for more\nresources, but many profs and lecturers in the increasingly unpopular\nhumanities have tenure and can\u2019t be laid off. Faced with that constraint,\nuniversities naturally have trouble finding the money to hire new faculty to\nteach the STEM subjects that students increasingly want to learn.\n\nUltimately this will impact the nation\u2019s supply of human capital. We need a\nbunch of STEM graduates to maintain a presence in industries like\nsemiconductors, electric vehicles, machine tools and robotics, aerospace,\nsoftware, and so on, we\u2019re going to need a lot more students with STEM\ndegrees. And American students increasingly want those STEM degrees. If\nuniversities can\u2019t meet that demand because of their legacy commitments to\neconomically less important sectors, that\u2019s not just a problem for college\nkids \u2014 it\u2019s a problem for the United States as a whole.\n\nChina, for its part, has no such legacy issues. Although it only has four\ntimes the population of the U.S., it graduates seven times as many engineers\neach year. If you feel uncomfortable reading that China graduates seven times\nas many engineers as the U.S. while top U.S. universities are forbidding\nAmerican kids from majoring in computer science...well, you\u2019re not alone.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Social media silences moderates and amplifies extremists\n\nI often jokingly call myself a \u201ctechnological determinist\u201d, because I tend to\ninstinctively look for technological explanations for social phenomena. So\nwhen I try to explain the explosion of social unrest that the U.S. experienced\nin the 2010s, I naturally tend to point the finger at social media. Back in\n2017 I wrote a post about how Twitter amplifies people who just want to shout\nand argue (myself included, obviously):\n\n#### The Shouting Class\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nJuly 31, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nI followed this up with a post in 2021 discussing some evidence that Twitter\nand other social media platforms amplify divisive voices and people with\ntoxic, aggressive personalities:\n\n#### The Shouting Class 2: Last Refuge of Scoundrels\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nWell, here\u2019s a bunch more research to add to the growing pile. In a new study\nentitled \u201cInside the Funhouse Mirror Factory: How Social Media Distorts\nPerceptions of Norms\u201d, Claire Robertson, Kareena del Rosario, and Jay J. Van\nBavel survey the literature and find that social media discussions increase\nboth the polarization of opinion and the perceived polarization of opinion.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n> In online political discussions, the people who post frequently on social\n> media are often the most ideologically extreme, (Bail, 2022; Barber\u00e1 &\n> Rivero, 2015). Indeed, a recent analysis found that 97% of political posts\n> from Twitter/X came from just 10% of the most active users on social media,\n> meaning that about 90% of the population's political opinions are being\n> represented by less than 3% of tweets online (Hughes, 2019). This is a\n> marked difference from offline polling data showing that most people are\n> ideologically moderate, uninterested in politics, and avoid political\n> discussions when they are able (American National Election Studies, 2021;\n> Converse, 1964; Krupnikov, 2022). This renders moderate opinions effectively\n> invisible on social media, leaving the most extreme perspectives most\n> visible for users...\n>\n> Receiving biased inputs from the online environment can lead to extremely\n> biased outputs...People base their perception of norms on an\n> unrepresentative sample of opinions and images leading to a distorted view\n> of social norms.\n\nAnd here is a graph that shows how the effect works:\n\nSource: Robertson et al. (2024)\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s really just the exact thing I described in my \u201cShouting Class\u201d\nposts. Normal people log on to Twitter and they see a small number of highly\nengaged extremists engaging in constant shouting battles. This makes people\nthink the country is more polarized than it really is, which scares them and\nmakes them more likely to fear and distrust the opposing political party.\n\nThis seems like a major technological problem that liberal societies haven\u2019t\nyet figured out how to solve. I hope we find something better than China\u2019s\n\u201csolution\u201d of totalitarian information control.\n\n####\n\n4\\. No, U.S. pedestrian deaths aren\u2019t due to bigger vehicles\n\nPedestrian deaths have soared in the U.S. in recent years. A lot of urbanists\nbelieve that this is due to the fact that Americans have been driving bigger,\nheavier cars. That turns out not to be the reason.\n\nA year ago, a whole bunch of people on Twitter confidently, even aggressively\ntold me that of course heavier cars are more dangerous, that this is just\nphysics. After all, force = mass x acceleration, right? I patiently tried to\nexplain to these people that even a very light, small car is so much heavier\nthan a human that a collision between any car and a pedestrian is basically\nlike a human falling onto the ground. No one listened. So Andy Masley actually\nwent through the numbers and showed that increasing vehicle weight makes a\nnegligible difference.\n\nBut what about vehicle size and shape? After realizing that the weight factor\nwasn\u2019t important, urbanists defended their thesis by pointing to research\nshowing that vehicles with flat, high hoods \u2014 SUVs and trucks \u2014 are deadlier\nto pedestrians, because they\u2019re more likely to hit them in the torso than in\nthe legs, and because they cause pedestrians to bounce off the hood instead of\nrolling over it.\n\nBut a bunch of evidence shows that this factor, while real, is relatively\nminor. For one thing, as John Burn-Murdoch points out, people in Canada,\nAustralia, and New Zealand have been going even more crazy for SUVs, and yet\ntheir pedestrian deaths have continued to go down:\n\nSource: John Burn-Murdoch\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible that these other countries were just working very hard to\nlower pedestrian deaths at the same time, compensating for the increase in\nSUVs. But there\u2019s plenty of other evidence here as well.\n\nTyndall (2021) estimates that the effect of SUVs is modest; replacing all SUVs\nwith cars would reduce U.S. pedestrian deaths by only 9.5% \u2014 not nothing, to\nbe sure, but not anywhere big enough of an effect to cause the increase in\ndeaths since 2009. Tyndall also points out that even as SUVs have grown in\npopularity, minivans have become less common, which partially canceled out the\neffect of SUVs:\n\nSource: Tyndall (2021)\n\nMeanwhile, a New York times analysis found that the increase in U.S.\npedestrian deaths has been exclusively a nighttime phenomenon:\n\nSource: NYT\n\nSince SUVs are the same shape whether the sun is shining or not, the\nlopsidedness of this increase strongly suggests that deadlier vehicle shapes\nare not the big culprit here.\n\nSo no, SUVs aren\u2019t a big reason for the rise in pedestrian deaths in the U.S.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean SUVs are good \u2014 they guzzle more gas, take up more space,\netc. But urbanists need to look realize that not every road-related problem is\ncaused by their favorite villain.\n\n(As for what did cause the increase in pedestrian deaths, we don\u2019t really know\nthat yet.)\n\n####\n\n5\\. Crime is bad for urbanism\n\nMany American progressives are urbanists, who want greater urban density, more\nwalkability, more public transit, etc. And many American progressives are in\nfavor of a less punitive attitude toward crime, with less incarceration, less\npolicing, and fewer penalties for drugs. But those two objectives are probably\nfundamentally in conflict.\n\nIn my posts about why Japanese cities are so excellent, one factor I\u2019ve\nemphasized is public safety; Japanese cities are great environments because\nviolent crime is incredibly low. Well, there\u2019s evidence in favor of that\nargument.\n\nDonovan et al. (2024) find that local crime consistently lowers rents in New\nZealand. To isolate causality \u2014 i.e., to make sure that crime and lower rents\nin a neighborhood aren\u2019t both just caused by a third factor, such as poverty \u2014\nthey look at the allocation of additional police to various neighborhoods\nunder a 2018 New Zealand policing expansion. There\u2019s very good evidence that\nincreased policing decreases crime, and Donovan et al. find the same. This\nallows them to show that crime causally decreases rents. (They also use\nanother alternative technique to show causality, but I won\u2019t go into that\nhere.)\n\nAnyway, lower rents are due to lower demand. So the fact that crime makes rent\nfall means that people don\u2019t want to live in high-crime neighborhoods. Donovan\net al. theorize that this leads to noticeable reductions in cities\u2019\nagglomeration economies \u2014 i.e., the economic benefit of density.\n\nSo progressive urbanists who dream of dense, walkable, transit-rich cities\nneed to understand that there\u2019s a tradeoff here. A more permissive attitude\ntoward crime is going to make people move out to the suburbs \u2014 not just \u201cwhite\nflight\u201d, but Americans of all races. Policing and incarceration aren\u2019t the\nwhole solution, of course, and American police forces still do have plenty of\nproblems. But a refusal to police streets and lock up criminals is going to\nmake it difficult to create the kinds of cities that European and Asian\ncountries enjoy.\n\nNot impossible, of course \u2014 NYC does exist. But it\u2019s no coincidence that our\none truly dense, walkable metropolis is also among the safest major cities,\nand one of the most heavily policed. Sometimes, reality forces unfortunate\ntradeoffs upon us, and we have to prioritize.\n\nShare\n\n126\n\nShare this post\n\n#### At least five interesting things to start your week (#34)\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n80\n\nShare\n\n80 Comments\n\nThe Lone Ranger10 hrs ago\u00b7edited 10 hrs agoIt's not just in teaching that\nuniversities suffer extreme allocation inefficiencies. It also shows up in the\ndifficulties they have in organizing even very basic cross-field or cross-\ninstitutional research collaboration. A couple of examples from recent years\nthat stick in my mind:1\\. Public health researchers recommend extremely\ndestructive policies, then turn around and say \"you can't expect us to think\nabout the economic impacts of our suggestions/demands, we aren't economists\".\nAlternatively, profs like Ferguson write code full of bugs so it doesn't model\nwhat they think it's modeling, and then say \"you can't expect us to write\nworking code, we aren't computer scientists\". Imperial College London even\nsaid to the British press \"epidemiology is not a subfield of computer science\"\nin defense of Ferguson's crap work.If you say, but you work down the hall from\neconomists/computer scientists, so why didn't you talk to them ... well\nacademics just look at you blankly. The thought that they might go build a\nteam with the right mix of specialisms to answer a specific question just\ndoesn't seem to occur to them, even though they easily could. This is a big\ndriver of the replication crisis too, because universities are full of\n\"scientists\" who struggle so badly with statistics and coding that they\nproduce incorrect papers all the time, and it becomes normalized. They can't\nrecruit professionals to help them because they don't pay enough and they\ndon't pay enough because they allocate their resources to maximizing quantity\n(measurable) over quality (not measurable).2\\. In computer science it's not\nall roses either. Billions of dollars flow into universities via grants, yet\nwhen it comes to fields like AI they constantly plead poverty and that it's\ntoo hard to compete with corporate labs. Why don't they pool resources, like\nthe physics guys do in order to build particle accelerators? Again, cultural\nissues. There's a limited number of names that go on a paper, a limited amount\nof reputation to go around, and pooling resources means most researchers will\ntoil on unglamorous work. So they prefer to split up their resources over\ngazillions of tiny teams that mostly produce useless or highly derivative \"me\ntoo\" output.The result is that universities *appear* to be highly productive\nand important, if you measure by their preferred metrics like paper\nproduction. If you measure them by actual real world impact of implemented\nresearch outcomes, they are well behind and falling further.China is no better\nby the way. They produce more papers than America does now but nobody reads\nthem, not even in China. Way too much outright fakery.Expand full commentLike\n(16)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n14 replies\n\nKathleen WeberAs Time Goes By10 hrs ago\u00b7edited 10 hrs agoWhy more pedestrian\ndeaths at night in the United States?My first hunch was inattention,\ndistraction by cell phones, but that should be the same, day or night.My\nsecond hunch is intoxication\u2014 alcohol, cannabis, and or other drugs, which is\nalmost certainly more salient at night.
