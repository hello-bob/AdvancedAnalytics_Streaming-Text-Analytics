Now, hydrology\nresearchers from the University of Arizona have investigated how humans impact\nEarth's deep subsurface, a zone that lies hundreds of meters to several\nkilometers beneath the planet's surface.\n\n\"We looked at how the rates of fluid production with oil and gas compare to\nnatural background circulation of water and showed how humans have made a big\nimpact on the circulation of fluids in the subsurface,\" said Jennifer\nMcIntosh, a professor in the UArizona Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric\nSciences and senior author of a paper in the journal Earth's Future detailing\nthe findings.\n\n\"The deep subsurface is out of sight and out of mind for most people, and we\nthought it was important to provide some context to these proposed activities,\nespecially when it comes to our environmental impacts,\" said lead study author\nGrant Ferguson, an adjunct professor in the UArizona Department of Hydrology\nand Atmospheric Sciences and a professor in the University of Saskatchewan's\nSchool of Environment and Sustainability.\n\nIn the future, these human-induced fluid fluxes are projected to increase with\nstrategies that are proposed as solutions for climate change, according the\nstudy. Such strategies include: geologic carbon sequestration, which is\ncapturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide in underground porous rocks;\ngeothermal energy production, which involves circulating water through hot\nrocks for generating electricity; and lithium extraction from underground\nmineral-rich brine for powering electric vehicles. The study was done in\ncollaboration with researchers from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada,\nHarvard University, Northwestern University, the Korea Institute of\nGeosciences and Mineral Resources, and Linnaeus University in Sweden.\n\n\"Responsible management of the subsurface is central to any hope for a green\ntransition, sustainable future and keeping warming below a few degrees,\" said\nPeter Reiners, a professor in the UArizona Department of Geosciences and a co-\nauthor of the study.\n\nWith oil and natural gas production, there is always some amount of water,\ntypically saline, that comes from the deep subsurface, McIntosh said. The\nunderground water is often millions of years old and acquires its salinity\neither from evaporation of ancient seawater or from reaction with rocks and\nminerals. For more efficient oil recovery, more water from near-surface\nsources is added to the salt water to make up for the amount of oil removed\nand to maintain reservoir pressures. The blended saline water then gets\nreinjected into the subsurface. This becomes a cycle of producing fluid and\nreinjecting it to the deep subsurface.\n\nThe same process happens in lithium extraction, geothermal energy production\nand geologic carbon sequestration, the operations of which involve leftover\nsaline water from the underground that is reinjected.\n\n\"We show that the fluid injection rates or recharge rates from those oil and\ngas activities is greater than what naturally occurs,\" McIntosh said.\n\nUsing existing data from various sources, including measurements of fluid\nmovements related to oil and gas extraction and water injections for\ngeothermal energy, the team found that the current fluid movement rates\ninduced by human activities are higher compared to how fluids moved before\nhuman intervention.\n\nAs human activities like carbon capture and sequestration and lithium\nextraction ramp up, the researchers also predicted how these activities might\nbe recorded in the geological record, which is the history of Earth as\nrecorded in the rocks that make up its crust.\n\nHuman activities have the potential to alter not just the deep subsurface\nfluids but also the microbes that live down there, McIntosh said. As fluids\nmove around, microbial environments may be altered by changes in water\nchemistry or by bringing new microbial communities from Earth's surface to the\nunderground.\n\nFor example, with hydraulic fracturing, a technique that is used to break\nunderground rocks with pressurized liquids for extracting oil and gas, a deep\nrock formation that previously didn't have any detectable number of microbes\nmight have a sudden bloom of microbial activity.\n\nThere remain a lot of unknowns about Earth's deep subsurface and how it is\nimpacted by human activities, and it's important to continue working on those\nquestions, McIntosh said.\n\n\"We need to use the deep subsurface as part of the solution for the climate\ncrisis,\" McIntosh said. \"Yet, we know more about the surface of Mars than we\ndo about water, rocks and life deep beneath our feet.\"\n\nMore information: Grant Ferguson et al, Acceleration of Deep Subsurface Fluid\nFluxes in the Anthropocene, Earth's Future (2024).
