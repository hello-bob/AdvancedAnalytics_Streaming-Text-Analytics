Now, researchers and regulators say, we need to pay more\nattention to toxic emissions from tires as vehicles roll down the road.\n\nAt the top of the list of worries is a chemical called 6PPD, which is added to\nrubber tires to help them last longer. When tires wear on pavement, 6PPD is\nreleased. It reacts with ozone to become a different chemical, 6PPD-q, which\ncan be extremely toxic\u2014so much so that it has been linked to repeated fish\nkills in Washington state.\n\nThe trouble with tires doesn't stop there. Tires are made primarily of natural\nrubber and synthetic rubber, but they contain hundreds of other ingredients,\noften including steel and heavy metals such as copper, lead, cadmium, and\nzinc.\n\nAs car tires wear, the rubber disappears in particles, both bits that can be\nseen with the naked eye and microparticles. Testing by a British company,\nEmissions Analytics, found that a car's tires emit 1 trillion ultrafine\nparticles per kilometer driven\u2014from 5 to 9 pounds of rubber per internal\ncombustion car per year.\n\nAnd what's in those particles is a mystery, because tire ingredients are\nproprietary.\n\n\"You've got a chemical cocktail in these tires that no one really understands\nand is kept highly confidential by the tire manufacturers,\" said Nick Molden,\nCEO of Emissions Analytics. \"We struggle to think of another consumer product\nthat is so prevalent in the world and used by virtually everyone, where there\nis so little known of what is in them.\"\n\nRegulators have only begun to address the toxic tire problem, though there has\nbeen some action on 6PPD.\n\nThe chemical was identified by a team of researchers, led by scientists at\nWashington State University and the University of Washington, who were trying\nto determine why coho salmon returning to Seattle-area creeks to spawn were\ndying in large numbers.\n\nWorking for the Washington Stormwater Center, the scientists tested some 2,000\nsubstances to determine which one was causing the die-offs, and in 2020 they\nannounced they'd found the culprit: 6PPD.\n\nThe Yurok Tribe in Northern California, along with two other West Coast Native\nAmerican tribes, have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to\nprohibit the chemical. The EPA said it is considering new rules governing the\nchemical. \"We could not sit idle while 6PPD kills the fish that sustain us,\"\nsaid Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe, in a statement. \"This\nlethal toxin has no place in any salmon-bearing watershed.\"\n\nCalifornia has begun taking steps to regulate the chemical, last year\nclassifying tires containing it as a \"priority product,\" which requires\nmanufacturers to search for and test substitutes.\n\n\"6PPD plays a crucial role in the safety of tires on California's roads and,\ncurrently, there are no widely available safer alternatives,\" said Karl\nPalmer, a deputy director at the state's Department of Toxic Substances\nControl.\n\n\"For this reason, our framework is ideally suited for identifying alternatives\nto 6PPD that ensure the continued safety of tires on California's roads while\nprotecting California's fish populations and the communities that rely on\nthem.\"\n\nThe U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association says it has mobilized a consortium of\n16 tire manufacturers to carry out an analysis of alternatives. Anne\nForristall Luke, USTMA president and CEO, said it \"will yield the most\neffective and exhaustive review possible of whether a safer alternative to\n6PPD in tires currently exists.\"\n\nMolden, however, said there is a catch. \"If they don't investigate, they\naren't allowed to sell in the state of California,\" he said. \"If they\ninvestigate and don't find an alternative, they can go on selling. They don't\nhave to find a substitute. And today there is no alternative to 6PPD.\"\n\nCalifornia is also studying a request by the California Stormwater Quality\nAssociation to classify tires containing zinc, a heavy metal, as a priority\nproduct, requiring manufacturers to search for an alternative. Zinc is used in\nthe vulcanization process to increase the strength of the rubber.\n\nWhen it comes to tire particles, though, there hasn't been any action, even as\nthe problem worsens with the proliferation of electric cars. Because of their\nquicker acceleration and greater torque, electric vehicles wear out tires\nfaster and emit an estimated 20% more tire particles than the average gas-\npowered car.\n\nA recent study in Southern California found tire and brake emissions in\nAnaheim accounted for 30% of PM_2.5, a small-particulate air pollutant, while\nexhaust emissions accounted for 19%. Tests by Emissions Analytics have found\nthat tires produce up to 2,000 times as much particle pollution by mass as\ntailpipes.\n\nThese particles end up in water and air and are often ingested. Ultrafine\nparticles, even smaller than PM_2.5, are also emitted by tires and can be\ninhaled and travel directly to the brain. New research suggests tire\nmicroparticles should be classified as a pollutant of \"high concern.\"\n\nIn a report issued last year, researchers at Imperial College London said the\nparticles could affect the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs and cause\ncancer.\n\nPeople who live or work along roadways, often low-income, are exposed to more\nof the toxic substances.\n\nTires are also a major source of microplastics. More than three-quarters of\nmicroplastics entering the ocean come from the synthetic rubber in tires,\naccording to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the British company\nSystemiq.\n\nAnd there are still a great many unknowns in tire emissions, which can be\nespecially complex to analyze because heat and pressure can transform tire\ningredients into other compounds.\n\nOne outstanding research question is whether 6PPD-q affects people, and what\nhealth problems, if any, it could cause. A study published in Environmental\nScience & Technology Letters found high levels of the chemical in urine\nsamples from a region of South China, with levels highest in pregnant women.\n\nThe discovery of 6PPD-q, Molden said, has sparked fresh interest in the health\nand environmental impacts of tires, and he expects an abundance of new\nresearch in the coming years. \"The jigsaw pieces are coming together,\" he\nsaid. \"But it's a thousand-piece jigsaw, not a 200-piece jigsaw.\"\n\nJournal information: Environmental Science & Technology Letters\n\n2024 KFF Health News.
