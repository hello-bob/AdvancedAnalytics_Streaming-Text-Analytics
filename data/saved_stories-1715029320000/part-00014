Kennedy Jr. wrong about a ban on NIH research about mass\nshootings?\n\nby Louis Jacobson\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\n\"Congress prohibits the NIH from researching the cause of mass shootings.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. in an April 21 post on X\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is the federal government's main agency for\nsupporting medical research. Is it barred from researching mass shootings?\nThat's what presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said recently.\n\nKennedy, whose statements about conspiracy theories earned him PolitiFact's\n2023 \"Lie of the Year,\" is running as an independent third-party candidate\nagainst President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, and the\npresumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\nOn April 21 on X, Kennedy flagged his recent interview with conservative\ncommentator Glenn Beck, which touched on gun policy. Kennedy summarized his\ngun policy views in the post, writing, \"The National Institutes of Health\nrefuses to investigate the mystery; in fact, Congress prohibits the NIH from\nresearching the cause of mass shootings. Under my administration, that rule\nends\u2014and our kids' safety becomes a top priority.\"\n\nBut this information is outdated.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the \" Dickey Amendment,\" an appropriations bill\nprovision that federal officials widely interpreted as barring federally\nfunded research related to gun violence (though some observers say this was a\nmisinterpretation). Congress in 2018 clarified that the provision didn't bar\nfederally funded gun-related research, and funding for such efforts has been\nflowing since 2020.\n\nKennedy's campaign did not provide evidence to support his statement.\n\n## What was the Dickey Amendment?\n\nAfter criticizing some federally funded research papers on firearms in the\nmid-1990s, pro-gun advocates, including the National Rifle Association,\nlobbied to halt federal government funding for gun violence research.\n\nIn 1996, Congress approved appropriations bill language saying that \"none of\nthe funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun\ncontrol.\" The language was named for one of its backers, Rep. Jay Dickey\n(R-Ark).\n\nBut the Dickey Amendment, as written, did not ban all gun-related research\noutright.\n\n\"Any honest research that was not rigged to produce results that helped\npromote gun control could be funded by CDC,\" said Gary Kleck, a Florida State\nUniversity criminologist. But CDC officials, experts said, interpreted the\nDickey Amendment as banning all gun-related research funding.\n\nThis perception meant the amendment \"had a chilling effect on funding for gun\nresearch,\" said Allen Rostron, a University of Missouri-Kansas City law\nprofessor who has written about the amendment. Federal agencies \"did not want\nto take a chance on funding research that might be seen as violating the\nrestriction\" and so \"essentially were not funding research on gun violence.\"\n\nAlso, the Dickey Amendment targeted only the CDC, not all other federal\nagencies. Congress expanded the restriction to cover NIH-funded research in\n2011.\n\nAlthough the Dickey Amendment didn't bar gun-related research, federal\ndecision-makers acted as though it did by not pursuing such research.\n\n## Moving past the Dickey Amendment\n\nOver time, critics of the gun industry made an issue of the Dickey Amendment\nand gathered congressional support to clarify the amendment.\n\nIn 2018, lawmakers approved language that said the amendment wasn't a blanket\nban on federally funded gun violence research. By 2020, federal research\ngrants on firearms began to be issued again, starting with $25 million to be\nsplit between the CDC and NIH.\n\nBy now, the CDC and NIH are funding a \" large portfolio\" of firearm violence-\nrelated research, said Daniel Webster, a professor at the Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nAlso, the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice has funded the\nlargest study of mass shootings to date, Webster said, and is seeking\napplications for studies of mass shootings.\n\nKennedy said, \"Congress prohibits the NIH from researching the cause of mass\nshootings.\"\n\nAlthough the Dickey Amendment, a provision of appropriations law supported by\nthe gun industry, didn't prohibit all federally supported, gun-related\nresearch from 1996 to 2018, decision-makers acted as though it did.\n\nHowever, in 2018, Congress clarified the provision's language. And since 2020,\nCDC, NIH, and other federal agencies have funded millions of dollars in gun-\nrelated research, including studies on mass shootings.\n\nWe rate Kennedy's statement False.\n\n2024 KFF Health News.
