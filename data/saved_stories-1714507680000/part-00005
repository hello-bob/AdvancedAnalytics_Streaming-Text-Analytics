That\u2019s because incarcerated people are generally older than\n> those likely to be sent to prison.\n>\n> By the end of 2020, Bureau of Justice Statistics data shows the number of\n> people in state prisons under 55 fell by 17%, while the 55 and older\n> population was down by 6%.\n>\n> Prison deaths spiked almost everywhere across the country, varying in\n> magnitude from state to state.\n\nCheck out the full paper.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Coronavirus cases rising in prisons\n  * 1 in 5 prisoners had Covid-19, a grid map\n  * Case rates adjusted for the unvaccinated\n\n### Chart Type Used\n\nBecome a member.
