But over the last year the only thing I found use for it was to\npropose places to go as a family on our Hokaido Japan journey. There were\ngreat proposals for places to go.\n\nBut perhaps you guys have some great use cases for AI in your life?\n\nalert-triangle\n\nYou must log in or register to comment.\n\n  * @Crozekiel@lemmy.zip\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n1\u20225 hours ago\n\nTtrpg character art via midjourney.

But I\u2019ve come\nacross a couple of therapy style chat bots that are essentially just reading\noff a list of \u201chere\u2019s what to do for XYZ\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tested them a bit, and I\u2019ve found I\u2019m 1) concerned who gets access to the\ninformation shared. 2) If/when these kinds of bots will be used to manipulate\npeople in a negative way. 3)The possibility of a bot replying in a bad way\nthat could make an issue worse for someone\n\nOverall, I like the idea of them. I find it\u2019s hard to process information if\nit\u2019s coming directly from myself, or accept compassion from myself. So funny\nenough, these chat bots actually work really well in that respect.\n\nIn some cases, I\u2019ve had better discussions than I have had with actual\ntherapists, which is funny but also sad.\n\nSo while there\u2019s some troubling possibilities, I think there\u2019s a lot of\npositives that I\u2019ve seen from my time with it.\n\n  * @anlumo@feddit.de\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n1\u20226 hours ago\n\n    * Improved autocomplete when programming\n    * Recommendations for third party packages or protocols for programming or letting it list details for them, or comparing two competing implementations\n    * Hints for my TTRPG stories (not so great for that, because it always uses very similar ideas)\n    * Helping recalling a word I forgot by simply describing what I mean, same with phrases or proverbs\n\n  * @Interstellar_1@pawb.social\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n3\u202213 hours ago\n\nI use it to see the answers to problems on my physics homework when I can\u2019t\nfigure it or myself.

Usually, you can check the answer in the back of\nthe book anyway, so it\u2019s very easy to catch fact hallucinations.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about source hallucinations with this either. I don\u2019t think\nit would even come up?\n\n  * Roza\u016dtuno\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n20\u202219 hours ago\n\nNot much. I totally agree with Linus Torvalds in that AIs are just overhyped\nautocorrects on steroids, and I despise that the artwork generators are all\nbased on theft.\n\nPretty much all I use them for is to make my life easier at work, like turning\na quick draft into a formal email.\n\n    * @meteokr@community.adiquaints.moe\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n1\u20225 hours ago\n\n> I despise that the artwork generators are all based on theft.\n\nOwnership of anything is difficult to define. The internet has accelerated\nthis loosening of definition. If I pay a subscription to use my coffee pot, do\nI really own it? If I take a picture of the coffee pot, do I own the picture?\nIf I pay a photographer to take a picture of the pot do I own the picture, do\nI own their time?\n\nI don\u2019t intend on trying changing your opinion on theft, but its interesting\nto think about how ownership feels very different as time goes by.\n\n    * @Zworf@beehaw.org\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n8\u2022\n\nedit-2\n\n14 hours ago\n\nThe LLMs for text are also based on \u201ctheft\u201d. They\u2019re just much better at\nhiding it because they have a multitude more source material. Still, it does\nsometimes happen that they quote a source article verbatim.\n\nBut yeah basically they\u2019re just really good copy/paste engines that work with\nstatistical analysis to determine the most likely answer based on what\u2019s\nwritten in basically the whole internet :P It\u2019s a bit hard to explain\nsometimes to people who think that the AI really \u201cthinks\u201d. I always say: If\nthat were the case, why is the response to a really complicated question just\nas fast as a simple one? The wait is just based on the length of the output.\n\nIn terms of the \u201ctheft\u201d I think it\u2019s similar ethically to google cache though.\n\n      * Roza\u016dtuno\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n3\u2022\n\nedit-2\n\n14 hours ago\n\n> It\u2019s a bit hard to explain sometimes to people who think that the AI really\n> \u201cthinks\u201d\n\nIf I had the patience, I\u2019d try to explain the Chinese Room though experiment\nto the people that misunderstand AIs.

ChatGPT is extremely good in absorbing\na whole mix of comments in different languages and summarising them in English\n(or whatever other language).\n\nFor programming I don\u2019t use it so much anymore because it hallucinates too\nmuch, calling APIs that don\u2019t even exist. And when I lower the temperature the\noutput is too sparse.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to build an assistant that can also communicate proactively (I\nintend to auto-prompt it when things happen and then evaluate if it should\ncause a message to me). But I need to get a local LLM going for that because\nrunning that through the ChatGPT API will be too costly.\n\nAlso, a replacement for some of my web searches. Sometimes I just want to know\nsomething and it\u2019s refreshing that it can give me an answer (even though it\ndoes need to be validated, it\u2019s much easier to do that when you know what\nyou\u2019re looking for!)\n\n  * @PerogiBoi@lemmy.ca\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n3\u202214 hours ago\n\nI use it quite a bit. I don\u2019t trust big companies who commercialize AI so I\nrun my AIs locally on my old retired gaming desktop that I\u2019ve turned into a\nhomelab/media server.\n\nI use Kobold.AI to self host an LLM like ChatGPT (Dolphin-Mistral7b if you are\ncurious). I mainly use it for low effort knowledge searches for stuff that is\neasier typed out long and descriptive (since google struggles with this).\nSince it\u2019s AI I have to be careful about what I search since I\u2019ve seen it make\nstuff up but for the majority of what I use it for (Programming syntax, Linux\ntroubleshooting, general questions) it\u2019s pretty good.\n\nI also have Stable Diffusion running as well using the ICBINP model (which is\npretty decent for photorealistic images). I use this AI to generate social\nmedia display pictures and porn :) it\u2019s fun because it\u2019s a surprise at what\nyou\u2019re going to get but sometimes it generates absolute horrors. Anatomical\nhorrors. Those are genuinely horrific. Other times it\u2019s really good.\n\n    * @jkrtn@lemmy.ml\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n1\u20225 hours ago\n\nHow do you set up stable diffusion to run locally? I have been trying out\nllama.cpp for text and was looking for a similarly easy tool to try image\ngeneration.\n\n      * @Mesa@programming.dev\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n2\u20225 hours ago\n\nhttps://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui\n\n  * exscape\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n7\u202217 hours ago\n\nMostly for finding information that for whatever reason can be difficult to\nfind using search engines. For example, I\u2019ve used ChatGPT to ask spoiler-free\nquestions about plot points in books I\u2019m reading, which has worked rather\nwell. It hasn\u2019t spoiled me yet, but rather tells me that giving more\ninformation would be a spoiler.\n\nLast time I tried to look something up on Google, carefully, I got a massive\nspoiler for the end of the entire book series.\n\nI also use it for code-related questions at times, but very rarely, and mostly\nwhen using a language I\u2019m not used to. Such as when I wrote an expect script\nfor the first (and perhaps only) time recently.\n\n    * @Kwakigra@beehaw.org\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n2\u202213 hours ago\n\nSo many times I wanted to know the name of an actor who played a character\nafter the first episode and the top result was something like \u201c[Character\nName] (deceased)\u201d or \" Villain: [Character Name].\"\n\n  * @GissaMittJobb@lemmy.ml\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n2\u202213 hours ago\n\n    * General purpose LLMs are starting to replace everyday queries I used to posit to Google. Perplexity can be quite good for this.\n    * Copilot as enhanced autocomplete when writing code. A particularly good use-case is writing tests: with a few test cases already written, a sufficiently good test name will most often generate a well-written test case.\n    * LLMs for lazy generation of SQL queries can sometimes be quite nice.\n    * Writing assistance for things I find myself struggling to get written by myself. A writing unblocking tool, if you will.\n\nIt\u2019s reducing the effort and time I have to put into some things, and I\nappreciate that. It\u2019s far from perfect, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to\nbe useful.\n\n  * Brad\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n3\u202214 hours ago\n\nI\u2019ve found it helpful at work for things like preparing agendas for meetings,\nor creating an outline of a presentation or document I need to write.\n\nI\u2019ve also found it helpful when I\u2019m trying to Google something where I need to\nbe pretty specific and then I can\u2019t find exactly what I mean by searching.\n\n  * apotheotic(she/they)\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n8\u202219 hours ago\n\nI find them neat, but there\u2019s just too many issues I can\u2019t overlook.\n\nThe environmental impact of these technologies is immense, and growing\nexponentially.\n\nA vast amount of the training data used for the big llms and image generators\nis not in the public domain, which is at best ethically grey but at worst just\nblatantly exploiting artists and other professionals.\n\nIf there existed some alternatives to the big names that avoided both of these\nissues, I\u2019d love to use them for code autocomplete and image generation for\nttrpgs, but as it stands the moral cost is too high.\n\n  * @zaphod@lemmy.ca\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n31\u20221 day ago\n\nI don\u2019t.

I tried ChatGPT a few times to get it to generate some code,\nbut mostly it produced code that didn\u2019t even compile and when I asked it to\nfix it, it created code that didn\u2019t compile in a different way. I enjoy\nwriting code on my own a lot more than having to review some pre-generated\ncode.\n\nThough I use it as a glorified Google sometimes and that is not even so bad.\n\n  * @drkt@lemmy.dbzer0.com\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n9\u202220 hours ago\n\nI\u2019m not a programmer but I work with IT and I regularly need complex shell\nscripts.
