Here , and the minimum value\nof zero is at .\n\nIn mathematical optimization, the Rosenbrock function is a non-convex\nfunction, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960, which is used as a\nperformance test problem for optimization algorithms.^[1] It is also known as\nRosenbrock's valley or Rosenbrock's banana function.\n\nThe global minimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To\nfind the valley is trivial. To converge to the global minimum, however, is\ndifficult.\n\nThe function is defined by\n\nIt has a global minimum at , where . Usually, these parameters are set such\nthat and . Only in the trivial case where the function is symmetric and the\nminimum is at the origin.\n\n## Multidimensional generalizations[edit]\n\nTwo variants are commonly encountered.\n\nAnimation of Rosenbrock's function of three variables. ^[2]\n\nOne is the sum of uncoupled 2D Rosenbrock problems, and is defined only for\neven s:\n\n    ^[3]\n\nThis variant has predictably simple solutions.\n\nA second, more involved variant is\n\n    ^[4]\n\nhas exactly one minimum for (at ) and exactly two minima for \u2014the global\nminimum at and a local minimum near . This result is obtained by setting the\ngradient of the function equal to zero, noticing that the resulting equation\nis a rational function of . For small the polynomials can be determined\nexactly and Sturm's theorem can be used to determine the number of real roots,\nwhile the roots can be bounded in the region of .^[5] For larger this method\nbreaks down due to the size of the coefficients involved.\n\n## Stationary points[edit]\n\nMany of the stationary points of the function exhibit a regular pattern when\nplotted.^[5] This structure can be exploited to locate them.\n\nRosenbrock roots exhibiting hump structures\n\n## Optimization examples[edit]\n\nNelder-Mead method applied to the Rosenbrock function\n\nThe Rosenbrock function can be efficiently optimized by adapting appropriate\ncoordinate system without using any gradient information and without building\nlocal approximation models (in contrast to many derivate-free optimizers). The\nfollowing figure illustrates an example of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function\noptimization by adaptive coordinate descent from starting point . The solution\nwith the function value can be found after 325 function evaluations.\n\nUsing the Nelder\u2013Mead method from starting point with a regular initial\nsimplex a minimum is found with function value after 185 function evaluations.\nThe figure below visualizes the evolution of the algorithm.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Test functions for optimization\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Rosenbrock, H.H.
