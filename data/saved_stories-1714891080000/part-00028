I don't,\nand end up feeling a bit guilty about being so haphazard. So, maybe this will\nbe interesting to some people: below is a fairly complete catalog of the\nphysical books I own. I always enjoy reading others' lists and browsing their\nbookshelves, so this intended to be a digital version of that. I've only read\nabout half of the books here. (I guess I fall somewhere in the middle in the\nUmberto Eco theory of the library.)\n\nI flagged a few books that I thought were particularly great in green and\nthose that I thought were substantially above average in light blue. These\ndesignations are non-exhaustive, though\u2014it's kinda hard to recommend books in\nthe abstract. And I've no doubt missed some.\n\nSince the stacks and shelves lack any particular order, so too does this list.\n\nIf you like books, you may enjoy Stripe Press.\n\n  * How Judges Think\n  * Aftermath\n  * The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War\n  * The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (The Princeton Economic History of the Western World)\n  * Pacific: Silicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World's Superpowers\n  * Popper Selections\n  * Feynman Lectures On Gravitation\n  * The Ascent of Man\n  * American Colossus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865-1900\n  * Quantum Electrodynamics\n  * Men, Machines, and Modern Times\n  * The Power of Productivity: Wealth, Poverty, and the Threat to Global Stability\n  * The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality\n  * The Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence & Japan's Computer Challenge to the World\n  * A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World\n  * GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History\n  * This Town: Two Parties and a Funeral-Plus, Plenty of Valet Parking!-in America's Gilded Capital\n  * Pop Internationalism\n  * Trading Places: How We Are Giving Our Future to Japan and How to Reclaim It\n  * Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe, and America\n  * Recent economic changes, and their effect on the production and distribution of wealth and the well-being of society\n  * Orality and Literacy: 30th Anniversary Edition (New Accents)\n  * Enemies: A Love Story\n  * Labyrinths\n  * Mind-Body Problem\n  * The Road\n  * The Company of Strangers: A Natural History of Economic Life\n  * The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World (Bradford Books)\n  * Three Famous Short Novels: Spotted Horses, Old Man, The Bear (Vintage International)\n  * Fear No Evil\n  * The Arrival\n  * Last and First Men: A Story of the near and far future\n  * Invisible Cities\n  * Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge\n  * William Blake and the Age of Revolution\n  * The Good Old Days--They Were Terrible!\n  * War and Peace\n  * The Printing Press as an Agent of Change\n  * Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman\n  * Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business\n  * Managing Oneself\n  * The End of Error: Unum Computing\n  * The Age of Em: Work, Love and Life when Robots Rule the Earth\n  * Streetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution\n  * Photoviz: Visualizing Information through Photography\n  * Designing Walkable Urban Thoroughfares A Context Sensitive Approach\n  * Urban Street Design Guide\n  * Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus\n  * Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America\n  * Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built\n  * The 40s: The Story of a Decade\n  * Perfidia: A novel\n  * The 60s: The Story of a Decade\n  * Alexander Hamilton\n  * Ask Me Anything (A collection of Reddit's best from r/IAmA Volume 1)\n  * American Tabloid\n  * The Revolt of the Masses\n  * Pioneering Portfolio Management: An Unconventional Approach to Institutional Investment\n  * Mapping the Airways\n  * The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future\n  * Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model\n  * An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays\n  * Suck: Worst-Case Scenarios in Media, Culture, Advertising, and the Internet\n  * Underworld\n  * Lincoln: Speeches and Writings 1859-1865\n  * All Art Is Propaganda: Critical Essays\n  * The Cowshed: Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution\n  * How Not to Network a Nation: The Uneasy History of the Soviet Internet (Information Policy)\n  * The Journalist And The Murderer\n  * The Hunters\n  * The Lost Daughter\n  * Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.
