Investment in\nadditional headcount, new systems, or process is probably quite a way down\nyour list of priorities - behind a lot of optimisation, and just trading\nthrough the rough patch. However, for growth-minded organisations with some\nfinancial flexibility, there is an opportunity to acquire experienced talent\nto drive the next wave of growth and innovation for the business.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced a rapid acceleration in digital transformation,\nprompting businesses to launch many initiatives. Yet, facing economic\npressures as consumers become more discretionary in their purchasing, many\nhave since scaled back - delaying or descoping these projects.\n\nRetail spaces have struggled to recover. Photo by the blowup on Unsplash\n\nWhile Big Tech and Finance have been the main beneficiaries of what growth has\nhappened in the last five years (eg the Magnificent Seven), they, and others,\nare now generating layoffs - about 50,000 people in the first two months of\n2024 so far. As we emerge from the bottom of the business cycle, there is an\nopportunity for savvy Retail and Consumer organisations to benefit.\n\nIf your business is profitable, but faces cyclical challenges, such as Retail\n- right now you are able to pick up some extraordinary talent from big-tech\nand finance. Point them at your hardest business problems to get the\ngroundwork done, and you can capitalise as consumer sentiment improves and\nspending increases again.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I\u2019m mostly considering Retail, Consumer\nProducts and Services businesses as these are domains I know very well. Over\nthe last six to nine months I have had many conversations with leaders in\nthese sectors that have influenced my thinking on this topic.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll outline some of the challenges businesses have had to\nnavigate over the last couple of years, why tech firms are laying off staff,\nand what the opportunity is for organisations who can capitalise on it.\n\n## Consumer businesses - between a rock and a hard place\n\nEven though COVID-19 dramatically impacted recent business performance, the\nchallenges began earlier. 2018 and 2019 already posed significant difficulties\nfor many organisations due to a decade of rising living costs and stagnant\nwages after the Great Recession, compounded by global events like France's\nMouvement des gilets jaunes, Hong Kong's Water Revolution, and Australia's\nBlack Summer.\n\nOver 1M people protested in Hong Kong in 2019. Photo by Joseph Chan on\nUnsplash\n\nI highlight this pre-pandemic period because trying to hire into retail\nbusinesses was already challenging. Businesses didn\u2019t have a lot of spare cash\nto invest in more headcount and candidates were already scarce. This was\nbecause Finance and Big Tech were already into their run up as they started to\ncapitalise on technology advances to do with new architectural patterns (eg\nmicro-services and composable architecture) and the first shoots of AI and ML\ntechnologies showing benefits (eg voice, NLP, classifiers etc).\n\nThe implication of this was that in consumer businesses, that were not digital\npure-plays, projects were already falling behind and teams had persistent\nvacancies that were challenging to fill. Some outsourcing occurred to keep\nprojects moving, but this is not sustainable long term due to the cost.\n\nBy March 2020, every consumer business in the world was facing the choice of\nwillingly or begrudgingly expediting their entire digital transformation, or\nhave almost certain collapse as a result of physical retail closing overnight.\nAt the same time, Big-Tech saw a rapid increase in sales due to vast numbers\nof the population spending more time on screen and in their houses.\n\nThe net effect was that Big-Tech and, to a lesser extent Finance, found\nthemselves in a position where they had money coming in at unprecedented rates\nand were able to attract significant amounts of talent with high wages, who\ncould work from anywhere remotely and continue to drive their digital business\ngrowth. On the flip-side, consumer businesses were faced with the impossible\ntask of completing two to five years of work in six months with increasing\nuncertainty around their jobs.\n\nConsumer organisations that managed to stay afloat faced stiff competition for\ntalent, often being outbid by tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, where\neven junior roles commanded salary premiums of 40-90%, not to mention superior\nbenefits. Vacancies continued to grow.\n\nAfter COVID there has been a significant decrease in consumer sentiment and\nspending and consumer businesses have found themselves in a precarious\nposition - grappling with significant revenue challenges lacking the\nwillingness to invest in headcount or expensive projects. Throughout 2023 and\ninto 2024, many organisations have faced into extreme prioritisation, scaling\nback initiatives and managing costs ever-more aggressively - a necessary, but\nshort-sighted strategy, given the long-term potential of these projects.\n\nIn 2024, from my conversations and interactions with numerous organisations,\nthis has become the dominant behaviour for many Direct to consumer businesses.\nDeliver core business well, drive profitability and, focus on a smaller number\nof high-value opportunities.\n\nThis all poses a question though: After an astonishing boom and the sustained\ndominance of Big Tech and Finance over the last half-decade, why are we now\nseeing continued layoffs in these sectors? This shift is not just a market\ncorrection for some COVID-19 over-hiring, but a signal of deeper changes\nafoot.\n\nIn the next section, I delve into the reasons behind these layoffs and how\nthese underlying shifts may open a golden opportunity for consumer businesses\nin the next business cycle.\n\n## Inside out - tech\u2019s first target is itself\n\nIt's well-known that new technologies can displace workers, typically those in\nlower-skilled roles, however the technology industry often focusses on itself\nfirst, automating its operations and optimising internally before seeking to\nimpact other sectors.\n\nThis internal focus stems primarily from an ongoing war for talent coupled\nwith a relentless drive for profitability.\n\nTechnology sectors have historically grappled with a persistent shortage of\nskilled workers. The demands on even entry-level technology professionals have\nescalated significantly over the past two decades, intensifying the challenge.\nEach year, the industry's demand for talent consistently exceeds the supply of\nnew graduates, a trend that shows no signs of abating and looks to be getting\nworse.\n\nGiven this persistent context, for technology-led businesses a long-term\nbeneficial strategy has been to invest heavily in automation to free up talent\nto work on more difficult problems. This allows you to scale by removing\nbottlenecks (instead of Jane being the only person who can do a task, now\neveryone in the team can leverage Jane\u2019s automations and she can move on to\nthe next hard problem) and it can drive profitability (I can have my team\nworking on more innovation or higher value work that I can charge more for\nrather than routine work which quickly becomes devalued).\n\nPhoto by Scott Graham on Unsplash\n\nNo part of technology has been spared from this effect.\n\nThe virtualisation of computers spurred rapid advancements in automation,\nstreamlining the management of virtual machines and networking. This evolution\ncatalysed the growth of cloud-based infrastructure, which in turn facilitated\nmore sophisticated applications and data management strategies. These\ntechnologies laid the groundwork for the development of complex machine\nlearning pipelines and on-demand AI models, further reducing the need for\nextensive human intervention.\n\nDespite an exponential increase in applications driven by these technologies\nand rising consumer demand, the workforce has not expanded at the same rate.\nAutomation enables existing professionals to manage larger technology\necosystems more efficiently, thereby enhancing business value.\n\nIn recent years, AI's viability has surged. Before ChatGPT made headlines in\nlate 2022, tech organisations were already leveraging early tools to automate\ncode generation, content validation, natural language tasks, and data\nanalysis, significantly easing the burden on overstretched teams.\n\nAs more sophisticated AI tools landed, this has been like pouring petrol on\nthe fire of automation.\n\nWith cultures of innovation, optimisation and automation entrenched in most\ntech organisations, these tools have enabled even more rapid development and\nmore value creation.\n\nGiven all of this, why would tech companies be laying people off? Surely they\nare better retained in the organisation?\n\nIn late 2022, the main factor was cost rationalisation. The boom that many\ntech companies had experienced was COVID related and those gains began to\nreverse. Many organisations decided to downsize for what looked like a\nrecession and get ahead of that. In 2023, for many markets, this recession\ndidn\u2019t occur however business conditions were more challenging and those\nbusinesses that shrank their workforces were considerably more profitable (eg\nMeta, Microsoft and Amazon).\n\nRecently, additional layoffs have occurred that are smaller in total size,\nhowever much more broadly based. Here too, businesses are rationalising their\ncost base to show higher margins and profitability to the market (the days of\n\u201cburn baby burn\u201d when it comes to cash with few profits are definitely behind\nus) however they aren\u2019t doing away with whole teams. Rather, as various AI and\nautomation tools are becoming effective they are taking a small chunk out of\nmany jobs so instead of a team of 10 to do the work, this may be rationalised\nto a team of 9 instead. Hiring has much reduced from the heady days of\n2020-2021 as well, with fewer roles advertised - particularly for entry\npositions.\n\nAI tooling for teams has multiplied rapidly. Photo by Solen Feyissa on\nUnsplash\n\nWhen you look at the output however, you see the full picture - these slightly\nsmaller teams are delivering the same output (or more in the case of Meta in\nparticular). This is improving their margins and profit - so the rationale for\ndownsizing the workforce is well founded.\n\nA lot of this isn\u2019t purely AI related, it\u2019s the combination of opportunities\nbrought about by cloud technologies, automation and AI that have taken time to\npull together, however it is supercharging the productivity of teams.\n\nThese factors occurring concurrently provide opportunities for those\nbusinesses - particularly Retail - who are prepared to Zig while everyone else\ncontinues to Zag.\n\nIn the final section, I explore how to take advantage of these opportunities\nnow and race ahead while your competitors are still putting on their running\nshoes.\n\n## Tech layoffs may be retail payoffs\n\nThe persistent challenges in the consumer non-tech sector have squeezed\ncapabilities and hindered the delivery of transformational changes within\norganisations. Meanwhile, technology-led organisations have created\ndisproportionate value by leveraging automation, AI, and data, relative to the\nsize of their teams.\n\nWhat should retail and consumer businesses do as digital sophistication\nrapidly increases but funding for innovation remains scarce?\n\nQuite simply, you need to invest smartly but you need to go now - and I mean\nright now - 2025 will be too late.\n\nConsumer and Retail businesses should seize the opportunity to strategically\nhire experts in Architecture, Data, AI, and Automation. Complementing these\nstrategic hires with eager juniors currently struggling to find roles can\nmaximise impact.\n\nStart by hiring experienced team members who have direct, first hand\nexperience in:\n\n  * Architecting large, distributed applications and enterprise technology with composability at its core and micro-services throughout.\n  * Data engineering to extract valuable data from the organisation and make it available to products and services.\n  * Pragmatic AI capabilities whether in using off the shelf models for enhancing existing products or refining processes or leveraging AI-based tooling that can improve productivity (eg engineers with AI-copilot or AI-DevOps experience)\n  * Automation engineers who can help remove tasks from existing digital and business teams and create opportunities for those staff to work on higher value activities.\n\nTo scale and innovate effectively, integrate enthusiastic early-career\nprofessionals into your team, supporting them with AI copilot tools and DevOps\npractices. This approach allows juniors to rapidly assume significant roles,\ndriving forward your transformation objectives.\n\nThis addresses the hiring side, with a view of seeding these skills into the\nteam. Alongside that needs to be a clear strategy that leveraging automation,\nutilising AI-based tooling and copilots and use of low or no-code solutions or\nframeworks to achieve outcomes is critical to the ability of the organisation\nto execute.\n\nThis focus on methods, and the change management required to support that in\nexisting teams, should help to start to create momentum inside the\norganisation to deliver at a higher cadence.\n\nSimultaneously, businesses must adapt by adopting AI copilots and adjacent\ntechnologies to automate processes, enhance classification, support services,\nand improve customer experiences.\n\nDone right, this will help free up valuable time from over stretched staff who\ncan work on projects that further transformation, work on supporting higher\nvalue customers or helping expansion into new channels or markets.\n\nAdditionally, the business should invest in low or no-code application\nplatforms and extensively train business users in their use. Many of the\nmarket leading tools already leverage automation and AI capabilities for rapid\ndelivery. Layered onto a composable architecture and a well understood\nintegration ecosystem, business users can rapidly automate business processes,\ncreate micro-applications to service their needs, and deliver rapid change\nthemselves. This will free up key technology resources to invest in innovation\nor high-value platform creation.\n\nCreate opportunities for organisational changes.

Before\nembarking on this journey, here are some items to consider:\n\n  * Prioritise architecture and full-stack engineering if your organisation lacks architectural maturity, such as insufficient micro-services or integration layers. This foundational work is critical in supporting the approaches discussed in this post.\n  * Implement clear guidelines for AI copilot usage, focusing on data safeguards and team responsibilities to prevent inadvertent data leaks. Proper training and governance are essential in ensuring safe and effective use.\n  * Support junior team members with robust mentoring and onboarding programmes to integrate into their teams. Strong cultural processes are essential for their success and future growth in the organisation.\n  * Ensure the accurate assessment of capabilities in prospective candidates by possibly engaging an external 'Advisory CTO' or similar expert for advanced domains. This expertise is vital for recruiting senior roles, who can then assist in onboarding junior team members.\n\nRetail and consumer organisations, whilst they start behind, have a golden\nopportunity to bring to bear a number of significant trends coupled with a\nspecific set of people who can drive innovation and opportunity for the\nbusiness.\n\n## In case of emergency, break glass\n\nThe convergence of available talent, cutting-edge technologies, and urgent\ninnovation needs presents a unique opportunity for retail and consumer\nbusinesses. Capitalise on this moment by strategically hiring experts in\narchitecture, data, AI, and automation, and support them with eager, early-\ncareer professionals. This combination will build a resilient, forward-\nthinking team ready for rapid innovation and deployment.\n\nAct now. The talent is available, but won't remain so indefinitely, and\ncompetitors may also be eyeing this advantage. New technologies provide an\nopportunity for generational leap-frogging that will help you quickly create\nnew opportunities for profit or elevate your customer experience. Don\u2019t\nhesitate; those who act decisively have an incredible opportunity at their\nfeet.\n\nImagine a future where your business not only survives but thrives, leading\nthe rapidly evolving retail landscape. By acting now, you're not just\nadapting; you'll be setting the pace for innovation and success.\n\n#### Similar posts you might like\n\n  * AI in 2023 - it works well enough now\n\n  * If software is a race to $Zero, how do you create revenue?\n\n#### About this post\n\nTitle\n\n    \"Now or never: harnessing growth opportunities in retail\"\nPublished on\n\n    Tuesday, April 16th 2024\nTags\n\n    ai strategy business retail growth\nAuthor\n\n    ajfisher\nTitle image\n\n    ajfisher - Retail Innovation Opportunities - Dall-E 3\nLicense\n\n    CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License\nPermanent source\n\n    https://www.ajfisher.me/2024/04/16/now-or-never-growth-opportunities-in-retail/\n\n## Now or never: harnessing growth opportunities in retail\n\nPublished on Tuesday, April 16th 2024 by ajfisher\n\nTags: ai strategy business retail growth\n\n## Featured Post\n\nAI in 2023 - it works well enough now\n\nAfter attending the Web Directions AI conference, it's clear 2023 brings\nsignificant advancements in AI.
