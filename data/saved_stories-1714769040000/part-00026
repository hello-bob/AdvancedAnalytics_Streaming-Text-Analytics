It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTerraform or Bust?\n\nHas your organization used or evaluated a Terraform alternative since new\nrestrictions were placed on its licensing?\n\nWe have used Terraform, but are now piloting or using an open source\nalternative like OpenTofu.\n\nWe never used Terraform, but have recently piloted or used alternatives.\n\nWe don't use Terraform and don't plan to use or evaluate alternatives.\n\nWe use Terraform and are satisfied with the results\n\nWe are waiting to see what IBM will do with Terraform.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nRyan Dahl keeps finding new approaches to familiar tech. More than once, he\u2019s\nplayed a central role in the evolution of an existing ecosystem. Now he\u2019s part\nof an effort to modernize the many modules of code that developers import into\ntheir projects every day. And it\u2019s not just upgrading repositories and supply\nchains, but ultimately the way that secure development gets performed.\n\nOn a recent episode of Stack Overflow\u2019s podcast that featured Dahl,\nStackOverflow editor Ryan Donovan began by acknowledging that Dahl \u201cstarted\nthe whole JavaScript-on-the-backend movement\u201d \u2014 before following it up in 2018\nwith the Deno runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly. On the\npodcast, Dahl succinctly summarized much of the commercial effort at the Deno\nproject today: \u201cto build, let\u2019s call it, a cloud runtime, a multitenant\nJavaScript runtime that spans data center regions \u2014 spans clouds, even \u2014 and\nis set up to handle many, many users at once.\u201d\n\nBut Dahl also recorded the interview just two weeks after Deno had announced\nthe launch of the new JavaScript Registry, which Dahl said will ensure that\nits published packages \u201care modern and doing best practices.\u201d\n\nDahl used the podcast to explain the multiple ambitions behind the project,\noffering a vision for what a secure repository will look like in the future.\n\nAnd along the way, he even offered a prediction about what lies ahead for\nJavaScript...\n\n## Why JSR?\n\nAmong other things, JSR packages include type declaration files. But Dahl said\nthe new repository is attempting to address the fact that JavaScript has two\ndifferent module systems that \u201cdo not play well with each other\u201d \u2014 CommonJS\nand ECMAScript modules (or ESM). As Dahl sees it, ESM is \u201cnow kind of embedded\ninto all of the web browsers, the real way of doing modules.\u201d (\u201cECMAScript\nmodules have arrived as a standard,\u201d explains the FAQ for the repository.) So\nthe JSR supports ES modules only.\n\nBut in addition, \u201cThere are more JavaScript runtimes than just Node.js and\nbrowsers. With the emergence of Deno, Bun, workerd, and other new JavaScript\nenvironments, a Node.js-centric package registry no longer makes sense for the\nentire JS ecosystem.\u201d And with TypeScript emerging as a de facto standard, \u201cA\nmodern registry should be designed with TypeScript in mind.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

How to Build a Server-Side React App Using Vite and Express\n  5. Cancel Asynchronous React App Requests with AbortController\n\nYet beyond that, Dahl sees it all in a larger context. \u201cDeno in general is\nattempting to level up JavaScript...\u201d he said on the podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent\non us as developers to really move this ecosystem into the future. And Deno is\ntrying to do this at the runtime layer, but what we perceive is, really, a\nproblem at the registry layer where you share code.\u201d\n\nThe JSR isn\u2019t meant as a replacement of the current npm package registry, but\nas an extension, Dahl explained. \u201cIn some sense, you can think of it as a\nsuperset of npm, kind of in the same way that TypeScript itself is a superset\nof JavaScript.\u201d\n\n> Did you know that JSR packages can be used from Node.js with no\n> configuration?\n>\n> \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/4AtwLtmX4q\n>\n> \u2014 JSR (@jsr_io) March 6, 2024\n\nBut Dahl has given a lot of thought to npm. \u201cFor a very long time, they did\nnot even keep checksums of npm packages. And there have been instances where\nhackers have gotten into the registry and potentially changed tarballs that\nwere published, and there is no way to know because there is no checksum of\nthose tarballs.\u201d There\u2019s also supply chain issues \u2014 the problem of not just\nmalicious pull requests, but malicious code coming from upstream...\n\nJSR attempts to provide more visibility with a simple way to give packages\ncryptographic signatures. Packages built on GitHub (using GitHub Actions) can\nprovide an OpenID Connect token to JSR that will ultimately publish the\ncorresponding cryptographic signature on the Sigstore blockchain. \u201cWe can do\nthese \u2018cryptographic attestations\u2019, as they\u2019re called, of where packages got\nbuilt \u2014 and publish them in the package pages and expose these details to\nusers.\u201d In short, it provides a record of where the code is coming from. \u201cAnd\nthat is important for trust, right?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s building up a web of trust.\u201d\n\nLater Dahl calls it in some ways \u201can extension of signed commits...\u201d\n\n> \u201cThings that I invented in 2010 for Node.js are just not where browsers are\n> going now. And I think there\u2019s a real need to close the gap between\n> browsers.\u201d\n>\n> \u2014Ryan Dahl\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a vision for a more secure future. \u201cAt the end of the day,\nyou\u2019re going to take a number of dependencies and build your microservice and\nthen run that as a Docker container in some Kubernetes infrastructure. And it\nwould be very nice... to be able to say all software running inside this\nDocker container has attestations that trace it all the way back to a verified\nuser somewhere and that there is no code that is running here that we don\u2019t\nknow where it came from.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of building up the infrastructure for this. And what likely will\nhappen is, in the future, every microservice will have clear attribution for\nall of your dependencies. And that\u2019s very nice \u2014 then you have really\nmitigated the supply chain risk.\u201d\n\nDahl also stresses that the new repository (unlike npm) \u201cis completely open\nsource. The back end, the front end \u2014 the whole thing is open sourced and MIT\nlicensed.\u201d\n\nJSR is not part of the commercial operations of the Deno company. \u201cJSR is for\nthe JavaScript community. It is an attempt to level up JavaScript, and it\u2019s\ndesigned to be able to run very cheaply on commodity cloud software... We\nwould eventually like to have this thing be in a foundation and kind of\noperating independently. We\u2019re trying to build an institution here for the\nfuture of JavaScript.\u201d\n\nNow in its \u201cpublic beta\u201d stage at jsr.io, the JSR is officially billed as a\npackage registry \u201cfor modern JavaScript and TypeScript.\u201d\n\nDahl emphasized on the podcast that it\u2019s not a package manager. \u201cYou can use\nyour existing package manager but connect it to this new registry...\u201d\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAt one point Dahl acknowledged that TypeScript was \u201cvery, very useful. It has\nclear utility.\u201d So much so that he predicts its JavaScript-superset-with-types\nconcept \u201cis likely to be codified in standards. Maybe not this year or next\nyear or the year after, but I think over time TypeScript will find its way\ninto the standards and really become part of what JavaScript is.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for predictions about the future of JavaScript, Dahl started by\nsaying the language is \u201cdeeply embedded\u201d in today\u2019s web ecosystem, and \u201cIt\u2019s\ndefinitely not going away anytime soon... Unlike many other technologies in\nthe world, I feel confident saying that JavaScript will be here five years\nfrom now, if not 10, if not 20 years from now.\u201d\n\nHe even put it in the most pragmatic possible terms. \u201cLike, your bank depends\non JavaScript. It is not going away anytime soon.\u201d\n\nBut looking specifically toward what\u2019s to come, Dahl said \u201cThe future of\nJavaScript is browsers. Browsers will always dictate the future of\nJavaScript.\u201d\n\nSo while there\u2019s obviously a large community writing server-side JavaScript,\n\u201cany server-side code must narrow the gap to browser JavaScript.\u201d It\u2019s part of\nwhy they\u2019re pushing ECMAScript modules over CommonJS modules.\n\n\u201cThings that I invented in 2010 for Node.js are just not where browsers are\ngoing now. And I think there\u2019s a real need to close the gap between browsers.\u201d\n\nDavid Cassel is a proud resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where he's\nbeen covering technology news for more than two decades.
