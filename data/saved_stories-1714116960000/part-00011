But those preservationists continue to face pushback from\nindustry trade groups, which worry that an exemption would open a legal\nloophole for \"online arcades\" that could give members of the public free,\nlegal, and widespread access to copyrighted classic games.\n\nThis long-running argument was joined once again earlier this month during\nlivestreamed testimony in front of the Copyright Office, which is considering\nnew DMCA rules as part of its regular triennial process. During that\ntestimony, representatives of the Software Preservation Network and the\nLibrary Copyright Alliance defended their proposal for a system of\n\"individualized human review\" to help ensure that temporary remote game access\nwould be granted \"primarily for the purposes of private study, scholarship,\nteaching, or research.\"\n\nEnlarge / Lawyer Steve Englund, who represented the ESA at the Copyright\nOffice hearing.\n\nJenner & Block\n\nSpeaking for the Entertainment Software Association trade group, though,\nlawyer Steve Englund said the new proposal was \"not very much movement\" on the\npart of the proponents and was \"at best incomplete.\" And when pressed on what\nwould represent \"complete\" enough protections to satisfy the ESA, Englund\nbalked.\n\n\"I don't think there is at the moment any combination of limitations that ESA\nmembers would support to provide remote access,\" Englund said. \"The\npreservation organizations want a great deal of discretion to handle very\nvaluable intellectual property. They have yet to... show a willingness on\ntheir part in a way that might be comforting to the owners of that IP.\"\n\n## Getting in the way of research\n\nResearch institutions can currently offer remote access to digital copies of\nworks like books, movies, and music due to specific DMCA exemptions issued by\nthe Copyright Office. However, there is no similar exemption that allows for\nsending temporary digital copies of video games to interested researchers.\nThat means museums like the Strong Museum of Play can only provide access to\ntheir extensive game archives if a researcher physically makes the trip to\ntheir premises in Rochester, New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / Currently, the only way for researchers to access these games in the\nStrong Museum's collection is to visit Rochester, New York, in person.\n\nStrong Museum of Play\n\nDuring the recent Copyright Office hearing, industry lawyer Robert Rothstein\ntried to argue that this amounts to more of a \"travel problem\" than a legal\nproblem that requires new rule-making. But NYU professor Laine Nooney argued\nback that the need for travel represents \"a significant financial and\nlogistical impediment to doing research.\"\n\nFor Nooney, getting from New York City to the Strong Museum in Rochester would\nrequire a five- to six-hour drive \"on a good day,\" they said, as well as\novernight accommodations for any research that's going to take more than a\nsmall part of one day. Because of this, Nooney has only been able to access\nthe Strong collection twice in her career. For researchers who live farther\nafield\u2014or for grad students and researchers who might not have as much\nfunding\u2014even a single research visit to the Strong might be out of reach.\n\n\"You don't go there just to play a game for a couple of hours,\" Nooney said.\n\"Frankly my colleagues in literary studies or film history have pretty routine\nand regular access to digitized versions of the things they study... These\nimpediments are real and significant and they do impede research in ways that\nare not equitable compared to our colleagues in other disciplines.\"\n\n## Limited access\n\nEnlarge / Lawyer Kendra Albert.\n\nKendra Albert\n\nDuring the hearing, lawyer Kendra Albert said the preservationists had\nproposed the idea of human review of requests for remote access to \"strike a\ncompromise\" between \"concerns of the ESA and the need for flexibility that\nwe've emphasized on behalf of preservation institutions.\" They compared the\nproposed system to the one already used to grant access for libraries'\n\"special collections,\" which are not made widely available to all members of\nthe public.\n\nBut while preservation institutions may want to provide limited scholarly\naccess, Englund argued that \"out in the real world, people want to preserve\naccess in order to play games for fun.\" He pointed to public comments made to\nthe Copyright Office from \"individual commenters [who] are very interested in\nplaying games recreationally\" as evidence that some will want to exploit this\nkind of system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if an \"Ivy League\" library would be responsible with a proposed DMCA\nexemption, Englund worried that less scrupulous organizations might simply\nprovide an online \"checkbox\" for members of the public who could easily lie\nabout their interest in \"scholarly play.\" If a human reviewed that checkbox\naffirmation, it could provide a legal loophole to widespread access to an\nunlimited online arcade, Englund argued.\n\n## Will any restrictions be enough?\n\nEnlarge / VGHF Library Director Phil Salvador.\n\nVGHF\n\nPhil Salvador of the Video Game History Foundation said that Englund's concern\nabout this score was overblown. \"Building a video game collection is a\nspecialized skill that most libraries do not have the human labor to do, or\nthe expertise, or the resources, or even the interest,\" he said.\n\nSalvador estimated that the number of institutions capable of building a\nphysical collection of historical games is in the \"single digits.\" And that's\nbefore you account for the significant resources needed to provide remote\naccess to those collections; Rhizome Preservation Director Dragan Espenschied\nsaid it costs their organization \"thousands of dollars a month\" to run the\nsophisticated cloud-based emulation infrastructure needed for a few hundred\nusers to access their Emulation as a Service art archives and gaming\nretrospectives.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n87% of classic games are out of print. That\u2019s a problem for gaming history.\n\nSalvador also made reference to last year's VGHF study that found a whopping\n87 percent of games ever released are out of print, making it difficult for\nresearchers to get access to huge swathes of video game history without\ninstitutional help. And the games of most interest to researchers are less\nlikely to have had modern re-releases since they tend to be the \"more\nprimitive\" early games with \"less popular appeal,\" Salvador said.\n\nThe Copyright Office is expected to rule on the preservation community's\nproposed exemption later this year. But for the moment, there is some\nfrustration that the industry has not been at all receptive to the significant\ncompromises the preservation community feels it has made on these potential\nconcerns.\n\n\"None of that is ever going to be sufficient to reassure these rights holders\nthat it will not cause harm,\" Albert said at the hearing. \"If we're talking\nabout practical realities, I really want to emphasize the fact that proponents\nhave continually proposed compromises that allow preservation institutions to\nprovide the kind of access that is necessary for researchers. It's not clear\nto me that it will ever be enough.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nKyle Orland Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica\nsince 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind\nvideo games.
