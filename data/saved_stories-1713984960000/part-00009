(\u00a9 Bartek - stock.adobe.com)\n\nScience & Technology News\n\n# Quantum computers take major step forward thanks to simplified laser beam\ntrick\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nby Chris Melore\n\nVIENNA, Austria \u2014 Quantum computing just took a big step forward thanks to a\nscientific breakthrough involving just one laser. Researchers in Austria are\nnow able to perform complex quantum calculations with a single beam of light \u2014\nsetting up the next leap forward for these ultra-fast computers.\n\nQuantum computers promise to vastly outperform classical computers for certain\ncutting-edge applications like modeling quantum physics, cryptography, and\nmachine learning. However, building large-scale universal quantum computers\nhas proven to be an immense challenge for engineers.\n\nThe key to quantum computing is taking advantage of some mind-bending quantum\nphenomena like superposition and entanglement. In quantum superposition, tiny\nparticles can exist in a mixture of multiple states at once, unlike our\neveryday classical intuition, where an object exists in just one state. For an\neveryday computer, that choice is binary \u2014 1 or 0. Moreover, quantum particles\ncan exhibit strange correlations called entanglement, where their states\nremain interconnected even across vast distances.\n\nMost current experimental quantum computers use individual photons (particles\nof light) as the quantum information carriers. The photons are typically\nencoded into different degrees of freedom like their polarization direction or\ntheir spatial mode or path. Interfering with these specially prepared quantum\nstates of photons allows sampling from probability distributions that are hard\nfor classical computers to calculate.\n\nAs the number of photons increases for more complex calculations, however, the\nrequired experimental resources like optical circuits, detectors, and sources\nquickly become overwhelming using standard computing architecture. That\u2019s why\nthe new work from researchers at the University of Vienna is such an important\nbreakthrough.\n\nTheir innovative approach, published in the journal Science Advances, uses a\ncutting-edge quantum dot \u2013 a tiny semiconductor crystal just nanometers wide \u2013\nto act as a high-quality single photon source. The quantum dot acts like a\nsingle atom, emitting identical photons one by one when triggered by pulses\nfrom a laser. Rather than encoding quantum information into different photon\ndegrees of freedom, the researchers instead used the photons\u2019 arrival times as\nthe information carrier.\n\nResource-efficient multi-photon processor based on an optical fiber loop. C:\nMarco Di Vita\n\nBy carefully timing the laser pulses, they could prepare sequences or \u201ctrains\u201d\nof up to eight single photons separated by precisely timed intervals along the\nsame spatial mode \u2013 just a single laser beam path. They then passed this\nphoton train through a programmable interferometer circuit that could\nmanipulate and interfere with each time window or bin independently while\nstill being part of the same spatial mode.\n\nThe key component making this possible is a high-speed electro-optic modulator\nthat can rapidly change the reflectivity of the interferometer every 100\nnanoseconds (100 billionths of a second). With such lightning speed, each\nsingle photon experiences a different controlled operation, interfering with\nall the separate time bins at the output.\n\nThis allowed the researchers to record interference patterns for up to eight\nphotons in 16 time bin modes using just a single detector at the output,\nrather than needing 16 separate detectors as would be required with standard\ntechniques. Through some advanced validation protocols, they confirmed the\nintricate multi-photon interference was due to genuine quantum effects rather\nthan any classical explanation.\n\nWith only a lone laser beam, a fast modulator, a single photon source, and one\ndetector, the researchers could perform sampling computations exponentially\nharder than on a classical computer but using far fewer physical resources\nthan previous multi-photon experiments.\n\n\u201cIn our experiment, we observed quantum interference among up to eight\nphotons, surpassing the scale of most of existing experiments. Thanks to the\nversatility of our approach, the interference pattern can be reconfigured and\nthe size of the experiment can be scaled, without changing the optical setup,\u201d\nnotes first author Lorenzo Carosini in a media release.\n\nThe researchers plan to enhance their system by adding a second programmable\nloop to achieve universal linear optics capabilities, a key requirement for\nphotonic quantum computing and simulations. While still at the research level,\ntime-bin encoding offers a resource-efficient route to continue scaling up\nmulti-photon quantum processors toward more complex realms.\n\nSo, while large-scale universal quantum computers are still years or even\ndecades away from practical use, this new time-bin encoding technique helps\nmake the vision a bit more feasible and brings quantum supremacy over\nclassical computers even closer to reality.\n\nTags: light, photons, quantum computers, quantum computing\n\nAdd a Comment\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### Chris Melore\n\nChris Melore has been a writer, researcher, editor, and producer in the New\nYork-area since 2006.
