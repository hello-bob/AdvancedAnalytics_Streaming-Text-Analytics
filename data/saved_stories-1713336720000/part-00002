He and his colleagues\nidentified the circuits by locating DBS electrodes in brain scans from nearly\n200 people with Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),\nParkinson\u2019s disease or dystonia and plotting those locations onto a normative\nconnectome of the human brain, created using diffusion tractography scans of\nhundreds of control brains.\n\nThe resulting \u201cdysfunctome,\u201d as Horn and his team dubbed it, shows the set of\ncircuits likely to be disrupted in those disorders, Horn says, given that\ntheir activation via DBS is associated with symptom improvement.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cnot an unreasonable inference,\u201d says Helen Mayberg, professor of\nneurology and neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who\nwas not involved in the study. \u201cThe subthalamic nucleus is a small area that\u2019s\na convergent zone for a lot of different pathways in the brain.\u201d\n\nH\n\norn\u2019s work figures in an ongoing debate about how best to identify\ndysfunctional circuitry using diffusion tractography. The method, used to\nvisualize fiber bundles in white matter, provides only an indirect assessment\nof axonal connections, \u201cbut it\u2019s the best we have for noninvasive\n[measurements of] human brains,\u201d says Sarah Heilbronner, associate professor\nof neurosurgery at Baylor College of Medicine, who was not involved in the\nstudy.\n\nA normative connectome built from tractography scans of control brains\nprovides a low-noise comparison for scans from people with brain disorders,\nHeilbronner says, but other scientists, Mayberg included, say individualized\ntractography is needed to capture disease-related differences in anatomical\nconnectivity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [something] that we are fighting about relentlessly\u2014there are different\ncamps,\u201d she adds.\n\nHorn\u2019s team purposely used a normative connectome in order to compare across\ndiseases, says study investigator Ningfei Li, a research associate in the\nneurology department at Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin. They aggregated\ntractography data from 985 people without any brain disorders from the Human\nConnectome Project to form a connectome of 6 million fiber tracts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit controversial, I think, in the field,\u201d Li says, but data\nfrom people with brain disorders are hard to come by and often of worse\nquality than the images included in the Human Connectome Project.\n\nA software program developed by the team, called Lead-DBS, localized\nelectrodes within the subthalamic nucleus on scans from 70 people with\ndystonia, 94 with Parkinson\u2019s disease, 14 with Tourette syndrome and 19 with\nOCD treated at seven international DBS centers.\n\nSweet streamlines: Dystonia (DYT), Tourette syndrome (TS), Parkinson\u2019s disease\n(PD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are each associated with\ndifferent circuits between the subthalamic nucleus and the cortex.\n\nMapping those spots onto the normative connectome revealed \u201csweet\nstreamlines,\u201d as the team called them. These fibers passed near the electrode\nsites and, when stimulated, correlated with clinical improvement. Streamlines\nfor Parkinson\u2019s connect to premotor and supplementary motor areas via the\nsubthalamic nucleus, the results suggest, whereas streamlines for Tourette\nsyndrome connect to the primary motor and supplementary motor areas; for\ndystonia to the somatosensory and primary motor cortices; and for OCD to four\nareas: the ventromedial prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsolateral\nprefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. The findings were published in February\nin Nature Neuroscience.\n\nT\n\no better activate the circuits indicated by the streamlines, the team changed\nthe stimulation settings for already implanted electrodes in two people, one\nwith Parkinson\u2019s and one with OCD. Both showed improvement in clinical scores.\nSymptoms also improved in a third person whose DBS electrode was placed and\nprogrammed based on the OCD streamlines.\n\nThat said, these streamlines may not be ready for broader clinical deployment,\nsays Cameron McIntyre, professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University.\nIt is challenging to predict which fibers activate in response to electrical\nstimulation, because of uncertainty about a DBS electrode\u2019s exact location,\naccording to a computational study by McIntyre. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the right\ntools to be able to dissect which of these pathways are actually related to\ntherapeutic effect,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are possible sources of error that would, in theory, preclude his team\u2019s\nfindings, Horn says, \u201cbut no matter how we do it, we always show that it\u2019s a\nmore frontal circuit for OCD and a more posterior circuit in dystonia, for\nexample. And in our view, that is a helpful distinction and maybe a\ncontribution.\u201d\n\nHorn says he plans work to refine the new streamlines using more anatomically\ndetailed connectomes, in collaboration with Anastasia Yendiki, associate\nprofessor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. Yendiki received about $4.5\nmillion from the BRAIN Initiative in 2023 to image neural circuits from the\nsubthalamic nucleus to the cortex using the latest techniques, including forms\nof tomography and light-sheet microscopy. These techniques, Yendiki says, can\nresolve anatomy at the level of individual axons.\n\nThe first control human brain is slated to enter the project\u2019s pipeline this\nyear, Yendiki says. If the project is successful, the team plans to move on to\nbrains from those with brain disorders \u201cand figure out if there\u2019s some\ndifference in how the brains are wired,\u201d she says.\n\nCorrection:\n\nDetails of Yendiki's grant have been updated in the story.\n\ntags:\n\nConnectivity, Circuits, deep brain stimulation, subthalamic nucleus\n\n## Explore more from The Transmitter\n\nSpotted\n\n0\n\ncomments\n\n### TRIO gene; left-handedness; gender diversity\n\nBy Jill Adams\n\n16 April 2024 | 2 min read\n\nFuture of fMRI\n\n0\n\ncomments\n\n### To improve big data, we need small-scale human imaging studies\n\nBy Emily S.
