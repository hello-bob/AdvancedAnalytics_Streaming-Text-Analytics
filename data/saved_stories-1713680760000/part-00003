What Are Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs?\n\n# Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs\n\n## How They Work & Why They Matter\n\nThis introduction to the topic \u201cWhat Are Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs\u201d\nwill explain how the process of entity resolution can be applied to graph data\nto create a synergistic result called entity resolved knowledge graphs. This\nnew approach amplifies the power and utility of traditional graph technology.\n\nBy applying entity resolution to knowledge graphs, organizations are able to\nmake better decisions from their enterprise data, become more competitive,\nreduce fraud, and service their customers better.\n\nThe process of constructing a knowledge graph usually involves combining data\nfrom multiple sources. The value of having data organized in a graph is that\nit emphasizes relationships i.e., links the data. However, when the nodes in\nthe graph represent duplicate entities or miss links (shared edges) \u2014 it\u2019s not\n\u201cknowledge\u201d, it\u2019s just disconnected facts.\n\nThese duplicate nodes and missed relationships are difficult to remedy as data\nis messy for example, business names or addresses are often spelled\ndifferently, abbreviated, or just \u201cone letter\u201d off. Harder yet, some data has\nbeen intentionally obfuscated for example the tradecraft of a clever\nfraudster.\n\nEntity resolution fixes the duplicates for \u201creal-world entities\u201d and provides\nlinked data to build more effective graphs. Without entity resolution, all of\nthe analytics and machine learning derived from a graph is inaccurate and\nmisleading.\n\nCombining entity resolution with knowledge graph practices produces entity\nresolved knowledge graphs, and these allow connections which would otherwise\nbe hidden to become available for graph analytics, visualizations, and\napplications in AI.\n\n### Table Of Contents\n\n  * ###### What Is A Knowledge Graph (KG)?\n\n  * ###### What Is Entity Resolution (ER)?\n\n  * ###### Problems With A Non-Resolved Graph\n\n  * ###### Introducing Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs\n\n  * ###### Approaches & Best Practices to ER a KG\n\n  * ###### ERKG Use Cases\n\n  * ###### References\n\n## What Is A Knowledge Graph? (KG)\n\nA knowledge graph (KG) provides a flexible, structured representation of\nconnected data, enabling advanced search, analytics, visualization, reasoning,\nand other capabilities that are difficult to obtain otherwise. In other words,\nknowledge graphs help us understand relationships that contextualize and make\nsense of the data coming from a connected world. Recent uses of retrieval\naugmented generation (RAG) to make AI applications more robust have turned\nknowledge graphs into a hot topic.\n\n## What Is Entity Resolution? (ER)\n\nEntity resolution (ER) provides advanced data matching and relationship\ndiscovery to identify and link data records that refer to the same real-world\nentities.\n\nFor example, your business may have duplicate entities (e.g. customers,\nsuppliers) in a dataset that have been overlooked, (e.g., due to variations in\nname or address). These redundancies can create data quality problems \u2014 for\nexample, they can cause you to not know exactly how many customers you have.\n\nBut the problem gets worse when you\u2019re trying to link entities across\ndisparate data sources. This is required if you\u2019re trying to get an\nenterprise-wide\n\n360-degree view of your customers.\n\nWhether you\u2019re trying to get accurate customer counts, or linking records\nacross datasets, if you\u2019d like to leverage your data in downstream analytics,\ndecisioning systems, model training, or other AI applications, making sense of\nmillions of different entities becomes very important. And that is exactly\nwhat entity resolution helps accomplish.\n\n## Problems With Non-Resolved Graphs\n\nOne of the truisms about data science is that 80% of the work gets spent on\ncleaning up data. When you\u2019re working graph data science, this problem becomes\neven more poignant because unless you can link your data correctly, it\u2019s not\nreally a graph.\n\nWithin any single source of data, there tend to be duplicate records. For\nexample, one person\u2019s name could be spelled \u201cElizabeth Reston\u201d and \u201cLiz\nReston\u201d across different records. Simple approaches for handling data would\nmiss that these are the same person. Loading the data into a graph would split\nthe information for this person across multiple nodes, making any downstream\nuses incorrect.\n\nThis issue becomes even harder to handle as you add more data sources. For\nexample, if there\u2019s no trusted \u201ckey\u201d shared between two data sources \u2013 such as\nan account number, email address, or other unique identifier \u2013 then\nconnections will get missed. Again, the messy data makes for less \u201cknowledge\u201d\nin a graph, and makes any downstream uses incorrect.\n\n## Introducing Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs (ERKG)\n\nDeveloping knowledge requires a process of accumulating context. For example,\nknowledge graphs used in production in industry tend to combine diverse\ndatasets into one consistent graph. It\u2019s like connecting puzzle pieces in a\njigsaw puzzle: the randomly scattered puzzle pieces that spill out of a box\nwon\u2019t show the full picture for the solved puzzle. Similarly, as we integrate\nmultiple datasets into a knowledge graph, the connections create the\n\u201cknowledge\u201d within the graph.\n\nBy using an Entity Resolved Knowledge Graph, we fix problems in graph data\nwhich would otherwise lead to false results. Example of popularly used graph\nanalytics include:\n\n\u2022 Pathing: one of the most common uses of a knowledge graph is to determine\nhow to get from one node to another node. For example, is this suspect\nconnected in any way to the missing person? Or how does our international\ndistributor connect with this known counterfeiting operation? If an unresolved\ngraph such pathing questions cannot be detected.\n\n\u2022 Nearest neighbors: another popular use of knowledge graphs is to find\nsimilar elements. Suppose you have a graph which includes enterprise sales\ndata, and you\u2019ve identified the nodes representing your top accounts. Running\na nearest neighbor algorithm can help find other potential customers with\nsimilar characteristics, which could become valuable sales leads \u2013 in other\nwords, finding the proverbial \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d within your data. Nearest\nneighbor searches are also used to power AI applications, for example where\nknowledge graphs augment an AI chat session, providing results that link to\nyour data and help mitigate \u201challucinations\u201d in the AI results. Without entity\nresolution, the duplicates within your KG scramble the nearest neighbor\nresults.\n\n\u2022 Centrality scores: to find the \u201cmost connected\u201d nodes in a graph, we use a\nfamily of graph algorithms for measuring centrality, i.e., the degree of\nconnectedness for nodes. These scores are used to rank the nodes within a\ngraph based on network flows: for example who are the major \u201cconnectors\u201d in a\nsocial graph, or where was Patient Zero in a graph about the spread of an\nepidemic. Probably the most famous example of using centrality scores is the\nPageRank algorithm used by Google Search. Unresolved graphs falsify centrality\nscores.\n\n\u2022 Node/Link prediction: graph machine learning techniques are often used to\nhelp improve the knowledge in a graph, by suggesting where some nodes or links\nmight be missing in the source data. For example, node prediction used in an\necommerce graph can help recommend products to a customer, based on their\nprior history. In law enforcement, link prediction helps inform investigators\nwhere some vital missing link could help solve a case. However, without entity\nresolution, a graph built with duplicate records will cause these kinds of AI\nmodels to be trained poorly.\n\n## Approaches & Best Practices to ER a KG\n\nOne of the best practices for working with knowledge graphs is to think in\nterms of \u201cmultiple levels of detail\u201d when handling the data. KG experts talk\nabout a data graph at the lowest level. These provide lots of detail about the\nprovenance for each data element: where did it come from, what version was\nused, has it been verified, and so on. You will want resolved entities to\nmaintain full attribution \u2013 whereby every record know which source system and\nrecord key it represents. Full attribution is essential to support audits as\nwell as feedback loops correction.\n\nThe entity resolution process can be either done in the data layer on the way\nto the graph, or applied to data that was first staged in a graph. Hybrid\narchitectures would work as well.\n\nEither entity resolution architecture eliminates problems of disconnected\nelements in the graph. Of course, many organizations try to build custom\nanalytics into their graph applications, to approximate entity resolution.\nBeware that handling duplicates in the later stages of a graph construction\nworkflow becomes much more expensive computationally, it\u2019s difficult to\nperform correctly, and is not fit for purpose.\n\nAnother best practice is to ensure one can explain why duplicate input records\nhave been resolved, including which features contributed to this decisions.\n\n## Use Cases for Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs\n\n  * Fraud detection\n  * Risk scoring\n  * Supply chain visibility\n  * Investigation support\n  * Customer service, upsell, cross-sell\n  * Marketing\n\n## References & Additional Resources\n\n  * What Is Entity Resolution?
