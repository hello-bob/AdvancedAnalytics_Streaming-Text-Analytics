More marginal\nland is brought into cultivation, but in practice it is marginal for a reason.\nThat means that the addition of this new land does not fully replace the\nimported grain and stop food prices increasing. As a result the best land,\nwhich is always cultivated, goes up in price in a pure windfall gain to its\nowner.\n\nThe Corn Laws, which did just this, banning, and then taxing, the import of\nforeign grain into Britain, are mostly remembered for their effect on food\nprices and the standards of living of the average worker, as well as for their\nlessons on the economics of free trade. But at the time the question of land\nrents was even more important. Land, which appeared to have no substitute at\nall, turned out to be substitutable with foreign imports. Repealing the Corn\nLaws began driving down the price of all farmland.\n\nThanks for reading The Origins of the Housing Crisis!

Many argue that this is a land problem: it is \u2018unique and\nfixed in space\u2019 and we\u2019re not making any more of it, so it is impossible to\nmake prices lower in high wage cities with good amenities. In fact, David\nRicardo\u2019s criticism of the Corn Laws applies identically to the UK\u2019s housing\nmarket since the planning system. There are a huge number of potential\nsubstitutes that could be provided to existing housing, we just fail to permit\nthem. The planning system is today\u2019s equivalent of the Corn Laws.\n\nThe economic rents earned by factors of production that are only partly\nsubstitutable\n\nModern thinkers who worry about land, whether explicit followers of Henry\nGeorge or not, have their roots in the ideas of David Ricardo, the nineteenth-\ncentury economist who, among other things, invented the idea of comparative\nadvantage.\n\nDavid Ricardo, 1821, Source, Wikipedia\n\nRent for us is usually the amount you pay someone in a given time period to\nborrow something from them, like their flat, their field, or their car. Rent\nfor Ricardo, as advanced in his 1817 work On the Principles of Political\nEconomy and Taxation, which is close to the concept now known as \u2018economic\nrent\u2019: the difference between the rent on land currently in cultivation, and\nland on the margin of being cultivated.\n\nProducing food requires land. Some land is better than other land. If there is\nan increase in demand for food then more land will be cultivated, and all land\nwill be cultivated more intensively, but because the best land is already\ncultivated, and because there are diminishing returns to investing more\ncapital in any given piece of land, or getting ever more workers to work it,\nthere will be unearned windfall benefits for existing landowners.\n\nThis windfall is the rents, or economic rents, in question. Landowners would\nwork this land even with lower rents, but they receive a large surplus because\ntheir land is scarce. This happens for all rare factors of production: Jude\nBellingham would probably play football for a vastly lower salary than he is\ncurrently paid, but every time football becomes more popular he earns extra\neconomic rents. Ricardo worked this through with a detailed numerical example\nwhich is in the endnote.\n\nHow to solve the land problem\n\nRicardo feared that the trends to higher agricultural prices he observed\nrisked enriching landowners at the expense of everyone else. Between 1730 to\n1817 the English population had more than doubled, from 5.4 million to 10.9\nmillion. As demand for food rose so did its price, helped by wars with France\nand the resulting continental blockade cutting off imports.\n\nIn 1790 the price of wheat was 49 shillings per quarter. By 1817, the year\nRicardo published his work, the price of wheat had risen to over 83 shillings\nper quarter. This meant its price had nearly doubled from 1790 to 1817.\nRicardo correctly believed that this was driving a huge windfall for\nlandowners, who benefited even if they did not invest.\n\nRicardo was not enthused by a tax on unearned rents or a land value tax,\nbelieving it would not solve the problem of high prices, though it might\nredistribute some of the gain around.\n\nThe determinant of a price is the cost of adding production at the margin.\nWhen this is high for a land intensive product the windfalls that accrue to\nlandowners from this are just a symptom. In the words of Ricardo, \u2018corn is not\nhigh because rent is paid, but rent is paid because corn is high\u2019. Therefore\n\u2018no reduction would take place in the price of corn, although landlords should\nforego the whole of their rent\u2019.\n\nRicardo\u2019s solution was linked to the trade theory that he became famous for:\nscrapping restrictions on trade. This would reduce the price of foodstuffs in\nthe short term by allowing cheaper imports, but also in the long run by\nforcing British farmers to become more productive. Higher levels of\nproductivity would mean that more corn could be produced more cheaply,\nreducing its price and therefore the rent.\n\nCheap grain imports to Britain were banned 1815 due to the corn laws, which\ninitially banned the importation of grains altogether if domestic prices were\nunder 80 shillings per quarter but was altered in 1828 to a sliding scale of\ntariffs that charged higher taxes on grain imports the cheaper the price was.\nThis maintained grain prices at the high level that they had reached during\nthe Napoleonic wars, despite the fact Britain was no longer under French\nblockade.\n\nRicardo was elected to parliament in 1819. In both his writings and his\nspeeches to the chamber he argued for repealing these restrictions on trade.\nRicardo died in 1823 but his ideas triumphed after his death.\n\nIn 1832 parliamentary reforms increased the representation of urban areas,\ngiving growing cities such as Manchester and Liverpool seats for the first\ntime and standardised the franchise to enable some of the middle classes\n(those renting property of \u00a310 or more per year), to vote in every\nconstituency. In addition rural \u2018rotten boroughs\u2019 \u2013 parliamentary seats that\nwere so small that local landowners could easily bribe the electorate to vote\nfor them such as Old Sarum with a population of 11 voters, all absentee\nlandowners \u2013 were abolished. Rodney Mace estimates that this reform increased\nthe percentage of the population with an meaningful vote from one percent to\nseven percent.\n\nTaking advantage of a more representative, and sympathetic political base\nLiberal politicians, especially John Bright and Richard Cobden launched a\ncampaign in favor of free trade and against the \u2018bread-taxing oligarchy\u2019 of\nthe English landed gentry. The potato blight and the resulting agricultural\ncrisis finally convinced the Conservative government of Robert Peel to repeal\nthe corn laws in 1846, at the cost of splitting his party. The pro\u2013free trade\nPeelite Conservatives merged with the Whigs to become the Liberal party and\nthe remnants remained as Conservatives.\n\nThe advent of free trade was coupled with productivity improvements that\nreduced the price of grains. In this case it was the invention of trains which\nled to the ghost acres of fertile but previously inaccessible agricultural\nland in America coming into production. From 1846 to the mid 1860s English\nwheat prices converged to cheaper European level and from 1866 to 1894 wheat\nprices fell from an average of 56 shillings per quarter to 17s 6d in 1894.\n\nIn both cases technology and legal reform increased the substitutability of\nland, proving that although it was fixed in place, it was not unique, and\nthereby reduced the economic rents to landowners, clawing back some of the\nunearned windfalls they had been enjoying. Land was substitutable \u2013 only\nregulation was preventing it being substituted.\n\nIncreasing the substitutability of land today\n\nThis argument also does not just apply to agricultural land, but also to\nmodern cities. Land that could be substitutable for that under expensive homes\ntoday is prevented from doing so by regulations on development.\n\nOver time the benefits of different cities and locations rise and fall. In\nparticular high performing \u201csuperstar\u201d cities have access to high paying jobs\ndue to the inherent advantages of their location and urban agglomeration\nbenefits. Over the past few decades the appeal of high productivity urban\nareas has increased. For example the median wage in San Francisco is around\n$100,000, In rural America, the average per capita income is half that.\n\nAs shown most effectively by Card, Rothstein, and Yi this economic boom in\nurban areas has led to windfalls for local landowners (of which homeowners are\nthe majority) and rising urban rents. An acre of land in San Francisco, which\ncould be used for office space or apartments in which thousands of people\ncould work and live, is of an order of magnitude more valuable than\nagricultural land. An acre of farmland in California will set you back around\n$10,000, while an acre of land in central San Francisco can run into the tens\nof millions.\n\nIn part, as Ricardo knew, this is inevitable. The supply of central urban land\nis limited and only partially substitutable. Of course this does not mean that\nnothing can be done. A developer will not spend millions on buying urban land\nonly to erect a single tent for themselves. Like nineteenth century farmers,\nmodern day builders can substitute capital for land and intensify the use of\nexisting land. If living in a given city becomes more valuable we can demolish\nexisting buildings and build taller ones.\n\nBut even if we do build up, the cost of building up increases as the buildings\nget taller. It costs more to add a story onto a skyscraper than to build a\nsimilar sized single family home. As a result it becomes more expensive to\nbuild up than there are extra benefits to living in that place \u2013 or we aren\u2019t\nable to build enough lifts to get people up and down in reasonable time.\n\nLike Ricardo\u2019s farmer we can also add land at the margin by building out, and\nbuilding infrastructure to make the new suburb accessible to the city\u2019s labour\nmarket. But this is also subjected to increasing costs the more infrastructure\nis used more expensive. Prices for housing rises and urban landowners\ntherefore get an unearned windfall whenever more people move to their city.\n\nA modern Ricardo however would point out that although there are hard limits\non what we can do, we have certainly not reached them in cities such as\nLondon, San Francisco or New York (outside of some areas of Manhattan). In\nLondon and San Francisco rents and land values are not high because the\ndifficulty and density of development has driven construction costs all the\nway up to the point it\u2019s unprofitable to build more. Instead, the price of any\nhouse is several times the cost of building it and the majority of the value\nof a home comes from the permission that was granted in the past to build it\n\nThese cities are not like 1916-61 Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, where the\nlight plane based zoning system allowed more or less all profitable\ndevelopment to happen. They are not like Tokyo, where liberal rules mean that\ndensity ripples steadily out from the center, and away from high value\nlocations like train stations, or Hong Kong, where every piece of land that\npermits building is intensified maximally. Instead, most of the land in these\ncities is used for roads, gardens, and the land that is built on is largely\ntwo or three storeys. In London\u2019s case, nearly all the suburbs in its broad\neconomic region are those that existed in 1939, when builders downed tools.\n\nThese are in effect today\u2019s Corn Laws. The economic windfall that is driving\nmost of today\u2019s inequality is not from the inherent scarcity of land, but of\ndeliberate restrictions on how much it is allowed to produce. In many cases\nthe cost of substituting land or capital for housing is effectively infinite\ndue to planning laws that limit the growth of cities and the density of\nconstruction. As supply is approximately fixed any increase in housing demand\nsimply increases house prices with no additional production even on marginal\nland. Improvements in productivity which reduce the cost of building up or out\ncan\u2019t be used to reduce housing costs, and therefore land values.\n\nLandowner windfalls are thus a consequence of high housing costs, rather than\na cause of it. And just like in the mid-nineteenth century, the only solution\nis fixing the laws that cause it. Fixing the planning system is today\u2019s\nequivalent of abolishing the Corn Laws.\n\nEndnote:\n\nBy expending a fixed amount of inputs (capital and labor) on the highest\nquality land a landowner could obtain 100 quarters of corn (in 1800s Britain,\ncorn was a general term that referred to all grains; a quarter was eight\nbushels). In 1803 the price of corn was \u00a3250 per quarter in modern prices so\nthe income from this land would be \u00a325,000.\n\nThe landowner has a choice, they can invest money in cultivating the land or\nin an alternative investment such as shares or government bonds. The risk\nadjusted market interest rate is five percent. This means that the landowner\nwill cultivate the land when the cost of doing so is \u00a323,750 (or less),\nallowing them to make a profit of five percent (or more).\n\nLet's assume that to get this high quality land to produce those 100 quarters\nthe landowner also had to spend \u00a323,750 on capital and labor.\n\nIn response to a price increase landowners gear up production to the price at\nwhich the marginal cost of the production inputs is equal to price sold. This\nis straightforward with capital and labour. But when it comes to land there is\na problem. Once all the best land has been used up it land is only partially\nsubstitutable. Landowners can either cultivate the the best land that isn\u2019t\ncurrently being used (the \u2018extensive margin\u2019), or they can use more capital\nand/or labour: invest more in improving their existing land or hire more\npeople to work it (the \u2018intensive margin\u2019).\n\nFor example if the next best land could yield 90 quarters for the same\ninvestment of \u00a323,750 it would be economical to bring it into production at a\nprice of \u00a3280 per quarter. If this was the case then the income for the owner\nof the best land from the same inputs would be \u00a328,000. This of course meant\nthe landowner of the first land now earns \u00a34,250. Therefore they have obtained\na windfall of \u00a33,000 of pure profit from no extra work or investment.\n\nThe same principle applies when increasing the inputs of the other factors.\nAny landowner could hire more labor or buy more equipment to increase\nproduction. But both of these inputs are subject to diminishing returns.\nDoubling the input of capital and labor into a farm will almost never double\nthe output of grain. As a result of the supply curve sloping upwards like\nthis, a rise in demand will always lead to a higher price, even if it is\naccommodated through more intensively working the existing land, rather than\nbringing extra land into cultivation.\n\nThanks for reading The Origins of the Housing Crisis!
