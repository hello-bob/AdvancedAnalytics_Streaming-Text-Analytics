This practice is so common that\nGoogle even acknowledged the phenomenon in a post announcing that it will be\nscraping Reddit posts to train its AI. And so, naturally, there are now\nservices that will poison Reddit threads with AI-generated posts designed to\npromote products.\n\nA service called ReplyGuy advertises itself as \u201cthe AI that plugs your product\non Reddit\u201d and which automatically \u201cmentions your product in conversations\nnaturally.\u201d Examples on the site show two different Redditors being controlled\nby AI posting plugs for a text-to-voice product called \u201cAnySpeech\u201d and a bot\nwriting a long comment about a debt consolidation program called Debt Freedom\nNow.\n\nScreenshot of ReplyGuy's website\n\nA video demo shows a dashboard where a user adds the name of their company and\nURL they want to direct users to. It then auto-suggests keywords that \u201chelp\nthe bot know what types of subreddits and tweets to look for and when to\nrespond.\u201d Moments later, the dashboard shows how Reply Guy is \u201calready in the\nresponses\u201d of the comments section of different Reddit posts. \u201cMany of our\nresponses will get lots of upvotes and will be well-liked.\u201d\n\nThe creator of the company, Alexander Belogubov, has also posted screenshots\nof other bot-controlled accounts responding all over Reddit. Begolubov has\nanother startup called \u201cStealth Marketing\u201d that also seeks to manipulate the\nplatform by promising to \u201cturn Reddit into a steady stream of customers for\nyour startup.\u201d Belogubov did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA screenshot of Stealth Marketing's website\n\nRedditors as a group have always been highly suspicious of astroturfing (the\npractice of artificially boosting products in an online community), bots that\ndon\u2019t label themselves as bots, vote manipulation, and \u201ckarma farming.\u201d\nReddit\u2019s reliance on community upvotes and volunteer moderators who generally\nknow their communities means that the site has felt less vulnerable to the\nsorts of AI spam that have taken over other social media platforms.\n\nMost of the Reddit accounts that Belogubov has shown as examples on his social\nmedia and on ReplyGuy\u2019s website have been banned by Reddit. An FAQ on the site\nsays \u201cwe send the replies from our pool of high quality Twitter and Reddit\naccounts. You may optionally connect your own account if you\u2019d like the\nreplies to come from a brand page ... think of [ReplyGuy] as more of an\ninvestment\u2014a Reddit post will be around for a long time for future internet\nusers to stumble upon.\u201d\n\nA screenshot from ReplyGuy's website.\n\nThe existence of ReplyGuy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Reddit is going to\nsuddenly become a hellscape full of AI-generated content. But it does\nhighlight the fact that companies are trying to game the platform with the\nexpress purpose of ranking high on Google and are using AI and account buying\nto do it. There are entire communities on Reddit dedicated to identifying and\nshaming spammy accounts (r/thisfuckingaccount, for example), there has been\npushback against people using ChatGPT to generate fake stories for personal\nadvice communities like r/aitah (Am I the Asshole), and Redditors themselves\nhave found that posts on Reddit are able to rank highly on Google within\nminutes of being published. I have noticed low-effort posts promoting products\nwhen I end up on Reddit from a Google search. This has led to a market for\n\u201cparasite SEO,\u201d where people try to attach their website or product to a page\nthat already ranks high on Google. \u201cBuy aged Reddit accounts with HIGH karma\nfor Parasite SEO,\u201d according to a video made by YouTuber SEO Jesus.\n\n\u201cGoogle is clearly telling us it\u2019s smashed [downranked] loads of high-quality\nniche sites and meanwhile, what\u2019s performing is Reddit, LinkedIn, and other\nparasites,\u201d SEO Jesus said in a January YouTube video about how to buy\naccounts to \u201cmanipulate Reddit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we actually manipulate Reddit? How do we use it to make money and\ngenerate leads? Well the answer is we basically find pages that are already\nranking, and then we want to comment underneath,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rankings are\ndriven by individual upvotes. Upvotes are quite easy to manipulate.\u201d He then\nexplains that to make a comment with affiliate links that are \u201cobviously\ncommercial\u201d without it being taken down is to buy \u201can aged Reddit account with\na lot of trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cReddit can even outrank top-performing websites,\u201d he adds.\n\nA spokesperson for Reddit told me that they would treat manipulation like the\ntype ReplyGuy is doing as spam or content manipulation, and that it breaks\nReddit\u2019s rules. A transparency report released by Reddit last week found that\ntwo-thirds of all takedowns on Reddit are for spam, and 2.7 percent are for\ncontent manipulation. Reddit\u2019s data shows that about half of the takedowns are\ndone by Reddit\u2019s moderators, and about half is done by Reddit staff. About\nthree fourths of these removals are done automatically.\n\nAbout the author\n\nJason is a cofounder of 404 Media. He was previously the editor-in-chief of\nMotherboard.
