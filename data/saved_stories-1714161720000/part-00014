He was\ndetained late at night trying to board a flight at BWI Thurgood Marshall\nAirport. Security personnel stopped him because the declared firearm he had\nwith him was improperly packed and an ensuing background check revealed an\nopen warrant for his arrest.\n\n\"On January 17, 2024, the Baltimore County Police Department became aware of a\nvoice recording being circulated on social media,\" said Robert McCullough,\nChief of Baltimore County Police, at a streamed press conference today. \"It\nwas alleged the voice captured on the audio file belong to Mr Eric Eiswert,\nthe Principal at the Pikesville High School. We now have conclusive evidence\nthat the recording was not authentic.\n\n\"The Baltimore County Police Department reached that determination after\nconducting an extensive investigation, which included bringing in a forensic\nanalyst contracted with the FBI to review the recording. The results of the\nanalysis indicated the recording contained traces of AI-generated content.\"\n\nMcCullough said a second opinion from a forensic analyst at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, also determined the recording was not authentic.\n\n\"Based off of those findings and further investigation, it's been determined\nthe recording was generated through the use of artificial intelligence\ntechnology,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the warrant issued for Darien's arrest, the audio file was shared\nthrough social media on January 17 after being sent via email to school\nteachers. The recording sounded as if Principal Eric Eiswert had made remarks\ninflammatory enough to prompt a police visit to advise on protective security\nmeasures for staff.\n\n\"It should be noted that comments in the recording spoke to [Eiswert's]\nalleged frustrations with test scores of African-American students and\nassertions that they (the African American students) were unable to 'test\ntheir way out of a paper bag,'\" the warrant says.\n\n\"The recording went on to make disparaging comments about Jewish individuals\nand two teachers who 'should have never been hired' at the school. The\nrecording depicted a conversation between [Eiswert] and one of PHS' Assistant\nPrincipals.\"\n\n### And then everyone piled in\n\nThe clip, according to the warrant, led to the temporary removal of Eiswert\nfrom his position and \"a wave of hate-filled messages on social media and\nnumerous calls to the school,\" and significantly disrupted school operations.\nPolice say it led to threats against Eiswert and concerns about his safety.\n\nEiswert told investigators that he believes the audio clip was fake as \"he\nnever had the conversations in the recording.\" And he said he believed Darien\nwas responsible due to his technical familiarity with AI and had a possible\nmotive: Eiswert said there \"had been conversations with Darien about his\ncontract not being renewed next semester due to frequent work performance\nchallenges.\"\n\n  * Meta's value plummets as Zuckerberg admits AI needs more time and money\n  * Microsoft and Amazon's AI ambitions spark regulatory rumble\n  * Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n  * Ex-Amazon exec claims she was asked to ignore copyright law in race to AI\n\nThose challenges are described in more specific terms in the warrant. One\nincident involved Eiswert reprimanding Darien for firing a long-time coach\nwithout approval.\n\nAnother is that Eiswert was investigating Darien's handling of school funds.\n\"In December of 2023, Darien was the subject of a potential theft\ninvestigation [Eiswert] initiated,\" the warrant says. Hence, the witness\nretaliation charge.\n\nThe other party heard on the recording told investigators that the\nconversation had not happened and said the remarks did not sound like anything\nEiswert would have said.\n\nInterviews with Darien and associates at the school suggest the file was sent\nto Baltimore County Public School addresses from a Gmail account, TJFOUST9.\nOne of the people interviewed noted that Darien had \"urged her to check her\nBCPS email account for a 'weird' message.\"\n\nThereafter, another staff member \u2013 who \"had a difficult time working under\n[Eiswert's] leadership for various reasons\" \u2013 disclosed that she forwarded the\nemail to a PHS student's cellphone, who she knew would rapidly spread the\nmessage around various social media outlets and throughout the school.\" A\nsubpoena for her former university email account indicated the file had been\nforwarded to news organizations and the NAACP.\n\nDuring his initial interview with investigators, Darien denied knowing anyone\nnamed \"TJ Foust\" and denied any involvement in the creation and distribution\nof the recording.\n\n### Blame it on the granny\n\nSubsequently, investigators sent subpoenas to Google and AT&T to obtain\naccount ownership information and IP address information. They determined that\nthe Gmail address was created on August 15, 2022 at an IP address associated\nwith the Los Angeles residence of Darien's grandmother. They further found\nthat the recovery phone number for the TJFOUST9 account was associated with a\nT-Mobile US account registered to Darien.\n\nThe specific AI tools allegedly used by Darien have not been disclosed. The\nwarrant however indicates that the BCPS Office of Information Technology\nreviewed Darien's network access and found several instances where he searched\nfor OpenAI tools via Bing Chat.\n\n> We are entering a new deeply concerning frontier\n\nOpenAI Voice Engine, a tool for creating synthetic voices, was not publicly\navailable at the time of the alleged crimes. It was announced on March 29,\n2024. However, other companies like ElevenLabs have been offering voice\ncloning technology for longer.\n\nDuring the press conference, John Olszewski, Baltimore County Executive,\ncalled for more caution with regard to public media.\n\n\"It is clear that we are also entering a new deeply concerning frontier as we\ncontinue to embrace emerging technology and its potential for innovation and\nsocial good,\" he said.\n\n\"We must also remain vigilant against those who would have used it for\nmalicious intent. That will require us to be more aware and more discerning\nabout the audio we hear and the images we see. We will need to be careful in\nour judgment.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Education\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Education\n  * Government\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Computer Science\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * Harvard University\n  * IDE\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Jenkins\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * MIT\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * NCSC\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Stanford University\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * University of California\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Security\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n8 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Education\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Education\n  * Government\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Computer Science\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * Harvard University\n  * IDE\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Jenkins\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * MIT\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * NCSC\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Stanford University\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * University of California\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Security\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
