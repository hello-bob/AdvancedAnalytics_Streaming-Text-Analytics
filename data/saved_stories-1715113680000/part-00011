The community has grown significantly since\n2019, benefiting immensely from being part of Arrow and following The Apache\nWay.\n\n## Why now?\n\nThe community discussed graduating to a top level project publicly for almost\na year, as the project seemed ready to stand on its own and would benefit from\nmore focused governance. For example, earlier in DataFusion\u2019s life many\ncontributed to both arrow-rs and DataFusion, but as DataFusion has matured\nmany contributors, committers and PMC members focused more and more\nexclusively on DataFusion.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe future looks bright. There are now 10s of known projects built with\nDataFusion, and that number continues to grow. We recently held our first in\nperson meetup passed 5000 stars on GitHub, wrote a paper that was accepted at\nSIGMOD 2024, and began work on Comet, an Apache Spark accelerator initially\ndonated by Apple.\n\nThank you to everyone in the Arrow community who helped DataFusion grow and\nmature over the years, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration as\nprojects. All future blogs and announcements will be posted on the Apache\nDataFusion website.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nIf you are interested in joining the community, we would love to have you join\nus. Get in touch using Communication Doc and learn how to get involved in the\nContributor Guide. We welcome everyone to try DataFusion on their own data and\nprojects and let us know how it goes, contribute suggestions, documentation,\nbug reports, or a PR with documentation, tests or code.\n\nApache Arrow, Arrow, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache Arrow\nproject logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of The Apache\nSoftware Foundation in the United States and other countries.\n\n\u00a9 2016-2024 The Apache Software Foundation\n\n", "frontpage": false}
