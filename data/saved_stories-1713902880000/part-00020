(Of 1995)\n\n### By Charlie Stross\n\nThe AI hype in the media obscures the fact that we're clearly in another\ngoddamn venture capital bubble right now.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal said earlier this month (article is paywalled),\n\"... In a presentation earlier this month, the venture-capital firm Sequoia\nestimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on the Nvidia chips used to\ntrain advanced AI models last year, but brought in only $3 billion in\nrevenue.\"\n\nOn top of that, the industry is running at a loss on power consumption alone,\nnever mind labour costs (which are quite high: those generative LLMs require\nextensive human curation of the input data they require for training).\n\nSo, we've been here before. Most recently with cryptocurrency/blockchain\n(which is still going on, albeit much less prominently as governments and\npolice go after the most obvious thieves and con men like Sam Bankman Fried).\n\nBut there've been other internet-related bubbles before.\n\nI was in on the ground floor of the dot-com boom from 1995-2000, and the hype\nback then was absolutely bonkers: that may be part of why I'm so thoroughly\nsoured on the current wave of bilge and bullshit. (That, and it's clearly\nbeing pumped up by fascist-adjacent straight white males with an unadmitted\npolitical agenda, namely to shore up the structures of privilege and\nentitlement that keep them wealthy.)\n\nThe common feature of these bubbles is a shitload of hype and promises from\nhucksters who fail to deliver a viable product but suck up as much investment\ncapital as they can. A handful of them survive: from dot-com 1.0, the stand-\nouts are Amazon and Google (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, et al came along much\nlater\u2014social media was a later, smaller bubble). Other survivors include\nPaypal, eBay, and Doubleclick (the latter being merged with Google to form a\nmonstrous global advertising monopoly). The survivors tend to leave behind\ninfrastructure: the failures leave behind t-shirts, second hand Aeron chairs,\nand motivational posters.\n\nIf I had more energy I'd be writing a snarky, satirical, 21st century Jetson's\nstyle short story right now to highlight the way this plays out. It'd be set\nin a future where all the dot-com 1.0 hype and promises actually delivered and\nlaid the bedrock of our lives in 2025.\n\nBut of course, that's not the story. Instead, the story would explore the\nunanticipated drawbacks. Starting with \"oops, the Amazon drone delivering your\nneighbour's new dishwasher just fell through your roof; but trades.com only\nshows you roofers who live in Boston, England, not Boston, MA\".\n\nIn this shiny dotcom 1.0 future, shoppers always carry their laptop to the\nsupermarket so they can use their CueCat scanner to scan product discount\ncoupon codes off the packaging: they collect the money off vouchers using\ninternet delivered over the supermarket wifi (which blasts them with ads\nthey're forced to click through in return for bandwidth).\n\nThe Teledesic satellite network got funded and built out, so you now have 9600\nbaud global roaming data on your Microsoft Windows CE phone. Which has a fold-\nout QWERTY keyboard because nobody likes writing on a touch-sensitive screen\nwith a stylus and multitouch was still-born. But your phone calls are secure,\nthanks to the mandatory built-in Clipper chip.\n\nBut Pets dot com just mailed you the third dead and decomposing Rottweiler of\nthe month, instead of the cat food subscription you ordered: the SKUs for\nRottie pups and Whiskas are cross-linked in their database, and freight\nshipping from China takes weeks.\n\nIn this gleaming, chromed, Jetsons style future, the Intel Itanium didn't\nfail, Macs still run on Power architecture, and Microsoft OS/2 4.0 runs\neverywhere on MIPS, Alpha, and SPARC workstations. Linux is nearly extinct\nthanks to restrictive embrace-and-extinguish commercial bootloader licensing\nterms ...\n\nBut don't ask about Apple. Oh dear. Oh no. You asked about Apple, didn't you?\nAnd why are all those workstations running OS/2?\n\nSolaris never really took over the workstation market; NeXT ate Sun's lunch in\nthe 90s. Today, UNIX research workstations are all featureless black cubes or\nmonoliths and come bundled with Mathematica and FrameMaker. Cheaper RISC-based\nworkstations are all the domain of Microsoft, as are PCs. Apple lives on in a\nstrange twilight: Steve Jobs was unavailable in 1998 (he was tied up buying\nOracle), and Apple was not-exactly-saved by buying Be and hiring on Jean-Louis\nGass\u00e9e as their CEO. He staunched the bleeding through strategic alliances,\nbut in the end Gass\u00e9e had no alternative but to sell Apple to IBM as Big Blue\ntried to push their Power Architecture down into the realm of business\npersonal computing.\n\nMacintosh\u00ae PowerbookTM is all that's left of the glory that was Apple: a range\nof black plastic PowerPC business laptops sold by Lenovo. Main value\nproposition: they run COBOL business applications real good. Meanwhile, the\nUK's Acorn Computers bought what was left of the NewtonOS intellectual\nproperty and continues to market the Newton Messagepad series as ruggedized\nretail and industrial data capture terminals in Europe, using the unique\nGraffiti text entry system from Palm Computing).\n\nThe world of MP3 music players is dominated by Archos. Video is ... well,\nvideo as such isn't allowed on the public internet because the MPAA hooked up\nwith the cable TV corporations to force legislation mandating blockers inside\nall ISPs. Napster does not exist. Bittorrent does not exist. YouTube does not\nexist. But what passes for video on the internet today is 100% Macromedia\nFlash, so things could be worse.\n\nSo. What survivors from the glorious-future-that-wasn't would you like to\nmemorialize in this shared fictional nightmare?\n\nPosted by Charlie Stross at 12:24 on April 23, 2024 | Comments (14)\n\n## 14 Comments\n\n| Leave a comment\n\nEric Christian Berg | April 23, 2024 12:42 | Reply\n\n1:\n\nSo, what actors are attached to your reboot of Demolition Man? :)\n\nMikko | April 23, 2024 12:46 | Reply\n\n2:\n\nWAP!\n\nSo the Windows CE phone can only do simple text-based pages (though the\ndisplay is an alphanumeric one, so no real loss). The pages are all controlled\nby operators, so everything is properly curated and most importantly billed on\nyour phone bill.\n\nIt's nothing like the free-for-all of HTTP and HTML pages, where anarchy\nreigns and operators are reduced to just bit pipes.\n\nVasil Kolev | April 23, 2024 12:48 | Reply\n\n3:\n\nYou know all that stuff you write, about eldritch horrors, eating your eyes\nand tongue? Way less scary than this post.\n\nCharlie Stross replied to this comment from Mikko | April 23, 2024 12:49 | Reply\n\n4:\n\nSo the mobile web resembles Minitel?\n\nWe could do worse ...\n\nBellinghman | April 23, 2024 13:03 | Reply\n\n5:\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's Acorn Computers bought what was left of the NewtonOS\nintellectual property and continues to market the Newton Messagepad series as\nruggedized retail and industrial data capture terminals in Europe, using the\nunique Graffiti text entry system from Palm Computing).\n\nBut Sophie and Steve's baby \u2014 the Acorn RISC Machine \u2014 still powered the\nNewton?\n\nTill W* | April 23, 2024 13:12 | Reply\n\n6:\n\nNo PDF, but NeXT cubes are really good at DTP in pure PostScript. Plasma\ndisplays, of course, and really high-res b/w flat CRTs.\n\nLycos, Altavista or Yahoo - who publishes the ultimate phone book for the\n\"web\"?\n\nAtari vs Amiga in the console and CGI market, aka multi-media works.\n\nOh, and don't get me started about e-democracy. All the promises became true -\nnot only information at your fingertips, but also portable and personal\ndigital voting. And even structured discussion fora to debate the public.\n\nMichel | April 23, 2024 13:22 | Reply\n\n7:\n\n> But what passes for video on the internet today is 100% Macromedia Flash, so\n> things could be worse.\n\nRealplabuffering\n\nCharlie Stross replied to this comment from Till W* | April 23, 2024 13:22 | Reply\n\n8:\n\nDidn't Atari build a Transputer workstation at one point? Oh yes, they did!\n\nMikko replied to this comment from Till W* | April 23, 2024 13:27 | Reply\n\n9:\n\nAtari vs Amiga in the console and CGI market, aka multi-media works.\n\nSo, does Motorola continue the 68000 line or do the Atari STs and Amigas run\nAcorn processors in the future?\n\nOf course both have a multitude of co-processors so the CPU is more like an\norchestrator.\n\nCorran | April 23, 2024 13:27 | Reply\n\n10:\n\nOf course there is a social media network: Usenet is booming after it became\nan essential tool for celebrities to interact with their fans and for\nbusinesses and governments to communicate. Of course the MPAA got the binaries\ngroups banned, which drastically reduced the burden for the server admins, but\nnow with a significant portion of the population on Usenet there are constant\ncomplaints from the ISPs about the storage and bandwidth requirements\n\nIts use by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq to influence the 2016 elections,\nsaid by many to be pivotal in the election of Boris Johnson as US president,\nis notorious.\n\nAnd with proper kill-files it's even almost usable.\n\nTill W* | April 23, 2024 13:34 | Reply\n\n11:\n\nThe post-grunge, post-techno scene swaps tracks on MD - that are micro disc.\nAnd if you want the full concert experience including vvvideo, a iOmega Zip\ndisc is the medium of choice for your portable Atari WalkAndPlay station.\n\nMattF | April 23, 2024 13:40 | Reply\n\n12:\n\nAnd the title is \u2018The Invisible Hand\u2019.\n\nScott Sanford replied to this comment from Corran | April 23, 2024 14:07 | Reply\n\n13:\n\nOf course there is a social media network: Usenet is booming...\n\nAs someone who was on Usenet in 1995, yeah, I could live with that.\n\nAlso, PostScript instead of PDF? Meh, six of one, half dozen of the other.\n\nThe NeXT was supposed to be pretty good in its day, it would be nice to see\nwhat might come out of that. But then, a few years before 1995 people were\nsaying the same thing about the Amiga; if Commodore had had any clue how to\nmarket what they had the personal computer scene might have been very\ndifferent.\n\nMikko | April 23, 2024 14:09 | Reply\n\n14:\n\nThe IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was replaced by the MSN Messenger. IRC was used\nfor a bit in universities, but the Real Operators took one look at it and\nprevented it being used as it was too decentralized and could be used for\ndistributing subversive material.\n\nMicroSoft did step up with MSN and now you can talk to all your friends on the\nMSN Messenger! Servers provided by Microsoft, of course.\n\n## Leave a comment\n\nSign in to comment.\n\nHere's the moderation policy.
