Its emphasis is on actions that citizens\ncan take, individually and together, to help reduce major global threats. With\nthe Clock the closest it has ever been to striking midnight, the Bulletin has\nremoved the paywall on this issue of its premium magazine.\n\nRead now\n\n## FAQ\n\nThe Bulletin has reset the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock 25 times since\nits debut in 1947, most recently in 2023 when we moved it from 100 seconds to\nmidnight to 90 seconds to midnight. Every time it is reset, we\u2019re flooded with\nquestions about the internationally recognized symbol. Here are answers to\nsome of the most frequent queries.\n\nWhat is the Doomsday Clock? Collapse\n\nThe Doomsday Clock is a design that warns the public about how close we are to\ndestroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a\nmetaphor, a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the\nplanet.\n\nWhen the Doomsday Clock was created in 1947, the greatest danger to humanity\ncame from nuclear weapons, in particular from the prospect that the United\nStates and the Soviet Union were headed for a nuclear arms race. The Bulletin\nconsidered possible catastrophic disruptions from climate change in its hand-\nsetting deliberations for the first time in 2007.\n\nWho created the Doomsday Clock? Expand\n\nCo-editor Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf to come up with a\ndesign for the cover of the June 1947 edition of the Bulletin, the first issue\npublished as a magazine rather than a newsletter. Martyl\u2014as she was known\nprofessionally\u2014was married to a physicist, Alexander Langsdorf, who worked on\nthe Manhattan Project while at the University of Chicago.\n\nAt first the artist considered using the symbol for uranium. But as she\nlistened to the scientists who had worked on the Bomb, as they passionately\ndebated the consequences of the new technology and their responsibility to\ninform the public, she felt their sense of urgency. So she sketched a clock to\nsuggest that we didn\u2019t have much time left to get atomic weapons under\ncontrol.\n\nGraphic designer Michael Bierut reimagined the iconic image in 2007.\n\nWho decides what time it is? Expand\n\nIn the early days, Bulletin Editor Eugene Rabinowitch decided whether the hand\nshould be moved. A scientist himself, fluent in Russian, and a leader in the\ninternational disarmament movement, he was in constant conversation with\nscientists and experts within and outside governments in many parts of the\nworld. Based on these discussions, he decided where the clock hand should be\nset and explained his thinking in the Bulletin\u2019s pages.\n\nWhen Rabinowitch died in 1973, the Bulletin\u2019s Science and Security Board took\nover the responsibility and has since met twice a year to discuss world events\nand reset the clock as necessary. The board is made up of scientists and other\nexperts with deep knowledge of nuclear technology and climate science, who\noften provide expert advice to governments and international agencies. They\nconsult widely with their colleagues across a range of disciplines and also\nseek the views of the Bulletin\u2019s Board of Sponsors, which includes nine Nobel\nlaureates.\n\nWhen were the hands set farthest from midnight? Expand\n\nIn 1991, with the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union\nsigned the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first treaty to provide for\ndeep cuts to the two countries\u2019 strategic nuclear weapons arsenals, prompting\nthe Bulletin to set the clock hand to 17 minutes to midnight.\n\nRead the full FAQ\n\n## Recent Clock changes\n\n### 2023\n\nIT IS 90 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT\n\n### 2020\n\nIT IS 100 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT\n\n### 2018\n\nIT IS 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT\n\n### 2017\n\nIT IS TWO AND A HALF MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT\n\n### 2015\n\nIT IS 3 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT\n\n### 2012\n\nIT IS 5 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT\n\nSee all past Clock times\n\n## FAQ\n\nThe Bulletin has reset the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock 25 times since\nits debut in 1947, most recently in 2023 when we moved it from 100 seconds to\nmidnight to 90 seconds to midnight.
