Adding\nbatteries is critical to achieving the state\u2019s ambitious goal of 100% clean\nelectricity by 2045.\n\nWINTERS \u2013 California has notched a major victory on its path to 100% clean\nelectricity: surpassing 10,000 megawatts (MW) of battery storage capacity.\n\nAt 10,379 MW, the state has increased battery capacity by 1,250% since the\nbeginning of the Newsom Administration \u2013 up from 770 MW in 2019. Ramping up\nbattery storage is a key part of Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s energy roadmap, the\nstate\u2019s plan to achieve its ambitious goal of 100% clean electricity by 2045.\n\nMore battery storage helps the state maintain a clean and reliable power grid\n\u2013 storing energy from renewable sources like solar during the day to use when\nsolar drops off in the evening hours. Just last week, for the first time ever,\nbattery storage discharge exceeded 6,000 MW and batteries were the largest\nsource of supply to power the grid at one point during the day. That milestone\ndemonstrates how batteries will be essential to powering the state\u2019s clean\nenergy future.\n\nGovernor Newsom joined state officials at a battery storage and solar facility\nin Winters to celebrate the milestone on Thursday during Earth Week.\n\n###\n\n\u201cIn just five years, California has increased its battery storage capacity\nmore than tenfold. Our energy storage revolution is here, and it couldn\u2019t come\nat a more pivotal moment as we move from a grid powered by dirty fossil fuels\nto one powered by clean energy.\n\nWe\u2019re in the midst of one of the biggest transformations of our time \u2013 and\nCalifornia is once again leading the way.\u201d\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom\n\nCalifornia\u2019s clean energy leadership:\n\n  * California\u2019s power grid recently set a series of clean energy records:\n\n    * During 40 of the last 48 days, clean energy exceeded grid demand consumed at a point during the day; compared to only seven days all of last year.\n    * The amount of demand served by solar hit a new record this week, powering 97.5% of electricity demand.\n    * Solar projects served a new high of 17,170 MW, an increase of over a thousand MW from last year\u2019s peak \u2013 enough to power millions of homes.\n  * Governor Newsom has taken unprecedented action to streamline clean energy infrastructure and invest billions of dollars to build more faster.
