Near its center is the Institute of Automation, a sleek\nsilvery-blue building surrounded by camera-studded poles. The institute is a\nbasic research facility. Its computer scientists inquire into artificial\nintelligence\u2019s fundamental mysteries. Their more practical innovations\u2014iris\nrecognition, cloud-based speech synthesis\u2014are spun off to Chinese tech giants,\nAI start-ups, and, in some cases, the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nTo hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app.\n\nI visited the institute on a rainy morning in the summer of 2019. China\u2019s best\nand brightest were still shuffling in post-commute, dressed casually in\nbasketball shorts or yoga pants, AirPods nestled in their ears. In my pocket,\nI had a burner phone; in my backpack, a computer wiped free of data\u2014standard\nprecautions for Western journalists in China. To visit China on sensitive\nbusiness is to risk being barraged with cyberattacks and malware. In 2019,\nBelgian officials on a trade mission noticed that their mobile data were being\nintercepted by pop-up antennae outside their Beijing hotel.\n\nAfter clearing the institute\u2019s security, I was told to wait in a lobby\nmonitored by cameras. On its walls were posters of China\u2019s most consequential\npostwar leaders. Mao Zedong loomed large in his characteristic four-pocket\nsuit. He looked serene, as though satisfied with having freed China from the\nWestern yoke. Next to him was a fuzzy black-and-white shot of Deng Xiaoping\nvisiting the institute in his later years, after his economic reforms had set\nChina on a course to reclaim its traditional global role as a great power.\n\nThe lobby\u2019s most prominent poster depicted Xi Jinping in a crisp black suit.\nChina\u2019s current president and the general secretary of its Communist Party has\ntaken a keen interest in the institute. Its work is part of a grand AI\nstrategy that Xi has laid out in a series of speeches akin to those John F.\nKennedy used to train America\u2019s techno-scientific sights on the moon. Xi has\nsaid that he wants China, by year\u2019s end, to be competitive with the world\u2019s AI\nleaders, a benchmark the country has arguably already reached. And he wants\nChina to achieve AI supremacy by 2030.\n\nXi\u2019s pronouncements on AI have a sinister edge. Artificial intelligence has\napplications in nearly every human domain, from the instant translation of\nspoken language to early viral-outbreak detection. But Xi also wants to use\nAI\u2019s awesome analytical powers to push China to the cutting edge of\nsurveillance. He wants to build an all-seeing digital system of social\ncontrol, patrolled by precog algorithms that identify potential dissenters in\nreal time.\n\n[ From the October 2018 issue: Why technology favors tyranny ]\n\nChina\u2019s government has a history of using major historical events to introduce\nand embed surveillance measures. In the run-up to the 2008 Olympics in\nBeijing, Chinese security services achieved a new level of control over the\ncountry\u2019s internet. During China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, Xi\u2019s government\nleaned hard on private companies in possession of sensitive personal data. Any\nemergency data-sharing arrangements made behind closed doors during the\npandemic could become permanent.\n\nChina already has hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras in place. Xi\u2019s\ngovernment hopes to soon achieve full video coverage of key public areas. Much\nof the footage collected by China\u2019s cameras is parsed by algorithms for\nsecurity threats of one kind or another. In the near future, every person who\nenters a public space could be identified, instantly, by AI matching them to\nan ocean of personal data, including their every text communication, and their\nbody\u2019s one-of-a-kind protein-construction schema. In time, algorithms will be\nable to string together data points from a broad range of sources\u2014travel\nrecords, friends and associates, reading habits, purchases\u2014to predict\npolitical resistance before it happens. China\u2019s government could soon achieve\nan unprecedented political stranglehold on more than 1 billion people.\n\nXi wants to use artificial intelligence to build a digital system of social\ncontrol, patrolled by precog algorithms that identify dissenters in real time.\n\nEarly in the coronavirus outbreak, China\u2019s citizens were subjected to a form\nof risk scoring. An algorithm assigned people a color code\u2014green, yellow, or\nred\u2014that determined their ability to take transit or enter buildings in\nChina\u2019s megacities. In a sophisticated digital system of social control, codes\nlike these could be used to score a person\u2019s perceived political pliancy as\nwell.\n\nA crude version of such a system is already in operation in China\u2019s\nnorthwestern territory of Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Muslim Uighurs\nhave been imprisoned, the largest internment of an ethnic-religious minority\nsince the fall of the Third Reich. Once Xi perfects this system in Xinjiang,\nno technological limitations will prevent him from extending AI surveillance\nacross China. He could also export it beyond the country\u2019s borders,\nentrenching the power of a whole generation of autocrats.\n\nChina has recently embarked on a number of ambitious infrastructure projects\nabroad\u2014megacity construction, high-speed rail networks, not to mention the\ncountry\u2019s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative. But these won\u2019t reshape\nhistory like China\u2019s digital infrastructure, which could shift the balance of\npower between the individual and the state worldwide.\n\nAmerican policy makers from across the political spectrum are concerned about\nthis scenario. Michael Kratsios, the former Peter Thiel acolyte whom Donald\nTrump picked to be the U.S. government\u2019s chief technology officer, told me\nthat technological leadership from democratic nations has \u201cnever been more\nimperative\u201d and that \u201cif we want to make sure that Western values are baked\ninto the technologies of the future, we need to make sure we\u2019re leading in\nthose technologies.\u201d\n\nDespite China\u2019s considerable strides, industry analysts expect America to\nretain its current AI lead for another decade at least. But this is cold\ncomfort: China is already developing powerful new surveillance tools, and\nexporting them to dozens of the world\u2019s actual and would-be autocracies. Over\nthe next few years, those technologies will be refined and integrated into\nall-encompassing surveillance systems that dictators can plug and play.\n\nThe emergence of an AI-powered authoritarian bloc led by China could warp the\ngeopolitics of this century. It could prevent billions of people, across large\nswaths of the globe, from ever securing any measure of political freedom. And\nwhatever the pretensions of American policy makers, only China\u2019s citizens can\nstop it. I\u2019d come to Beijing to look for some sign that they might.\n\nThis techno-political moment has been long in the making. China has spent all\nbut a few centuries of its 5,000-year history at the vanguard of information\ntechnology. Along with Sumer and Mesoamerica, it was one of three places where\nwriting was independently invented, allowing information to be stored outside\nthe human brain. In the second century a.d., the Chinese invented paper. This\ncheap, bindable information-storage technology allowed data\u2014Silk Road trade\nrecords, military communiqu\u00e9s, correspondence among elites\u2014to crisscross the\nempire on horses bred for speed by steppe nomads beyond the Great Wall. Data\nbegan to circulate even faster a few centuries later, when Tang-dynasty\nartisans perfected woodblock printing, a mass-information technology that\nhelped administer a huge and growing state.\n\nAs rulers of some of the world\u2019s largest complex social organizations, ancient\nChinese emperors well understood the relationship between information flows\nand power, and the value of surveillance. During the 11th century, a Song-\ndynasty emperor realized that China\u2019s elegant walled cities had become too\nnumerous to be monitored from Beijing, so he deputized locals to police them.\nA few decades before the digital era\u2019s dawn, Chiang Kai-shek made use of this\nself-policing tradition, asking citizens to watch for dissidents in their\nmidst, so that communist rebellions could be stamped out in their infancy.\nWhen Mao took over, he arranged cities into grids, making each square its own\nwork unit, where local spies kept \u201csharp eyes\u201d out for counterrevolutionary\nbehavior, no matter how trivial. During the initial coronavirus outbreak,\nChinese social-media apps promoted hotlines where people could report those\nsuspected of hiding symptoms.\n\nXi has appropriated the phrase sharp eyes, with all its historical resonances,\nas his chosen name for the AI-powered surveillance cameras that will soon span\nChina. With AI, Xi can build history\u2019s most oppressive authoritarian\napparatus, without the manpower Mao needed to keep information about dissent\nflowing to a single, centralized node. In China\u2019s most prominent AI start-\nups\u2014SenseTime, CloudWalk, Megvii, Hikvision, iFlytek, Meiya Pico\u2014Xi has found\nwilling commercial partners. And in Xinjiang\u2019s Muslim minority, he has found\nhis test population.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has long been suspicious of religion, and not just\nas a result of Marxist influence. Only a century and a half ago\u2014yesterday, in\nthe memory of a 5,000-year-old civilization\u2014Hong Xiuquan, a quasi-Christian\nmystic converted by Western missionaries, launched the Taiping Rebellion, an\napocalyptic 14-year campaign that may have killed more people than the First\nWorld War. Today, in China\u2019s single-party political system, religion is an\nalternative source of ultimate authority, which means it must be co-opted or\ndestroyed.\n\nBy 2009, China\u2019s Uighurs had become weary after decades of discrimination and\nland confiscation. They launched mass protests and a smattering of suicide\nattacks against Chinese police. In 2014, Xi cracked down, directing Xinjiang\u2019s\nprovincial government to destroy mosques and reduce Uighur neighborhoods to\nrubble. More than 1 million Uighurs were disappeared into concentration camps.\nMany were tortured and made to perform slave labor.\n\nUighurs who were spared the camps now make up the most intensely surveilled\npopulation on Earth. Not all of the surveillance is digital. The Chinese\ngovernment has moved thousands of Han Chinese \u201cbig brothers and sisters\u201d into\nhomes in Xinjiang\u2019s ancient Silk Road cities, to monitor Uighurs\u2019 forced\nassimilation to mainstream Chinese culture. They eat meals with the family,\nand some \u201cbig brothers\u201d sleep in the same bed as the wives of detained Uighur\nmen.\n\nMeanwhile, AI-powered sensors lurk everywhere, including in Uighurs\u2019 purses\nand pants pockets. According to the anthropologist Darren Byler, some Uighurs\nburied their mobile phones containing Islamic materials, or even froze their\ndata cards into dumplings for safekeeping, when Xi\u2019s campaign of cultural\nerasure reached full tilt. But police have since forced them to install nanny\napps on their new phones. The apps use algorithms to hunt for \u201cideological\nviruses\u201d day and night. They can scan chat logs for Quran verses, and look for\nArabic script in memes and other image files.\n\n[ Read: China is going to outrageous lengths to surveil its own citizens ]\n\nUighurs can\u2019t use the usual work-arounds. Installing a VPN would likely invite\nan investigation, so they can\u2019t download WhatsApp or any other prohibited\nencrypted-chat software. Purchasing prayer rugs online, storing digital copies\nof Muslim books, and downloading sermons from a favorite imam are all risky\nactivities. If a Uighur were to use WeChat\u2019s payment system to make a donation\nto a mosque, authorities might take note.\n\nThe nanny apps work in tandem with the police, who spot-check phones at\ncheckpoints, scrolling through recent calls and texts. Even an innocent\ndigital association\u2014being in a group text with a recent mosque attendee, for\ninstance\u2014could result in detention. Staying off social media altogether is no\nsolution, because digital inactivity itself can raise suspicions. The police\nare required to note when Uighurs deviate from any of their normal behavior\npatterns. Their database wants to know if Uighurs start leaving their home\nthrough the back door instead of the front. It wants to know if they spend\nless time talking to neighbors than they used to. Electricity use is monitored\nby an algorithm for unusual use, which could indicate an unregistered\nresident.\n\nJonathan Djob Nkondo\n\nUighurs can travel only a few blocks before encountering a checkpoint\noutfitted with one of Xinjiang\u2019s hundreds of thousands of surveillance\ncameras. Footage from the cameras is processed by algorithms that match faces\nwith snapshots taken by police at \u201chealth checks.\u201d At these checks, police\nextract all the data they can from Uighurs\u2019 bodies. They measure height and\ntake a blood sample. They record voices and swab DNA. Some Uighurs have even\nbeen forced to participate in experiments that mine genetic data, to see how\nDNA produces distinctly Uighurlike chins and ears. Police will likely use the\npandemic as a pretext to take still more data from Uighur bodies.\n\nUighur women are also made to endure pregnancy checks. Some are forced to have\nabortions, or get an IUD inserted. Others are sterilized by the state. Police\nare known to rip unauthorized children away from their parents, who are then\ndetained. Such measures have reduced the birthrate in some regions of Xinjiang\nmore than 60 percent in three years.\n\nWhen Uighurs reach the edge of their neighborhood, an automated system takes\nnote. The same system tracks them as they move through smaller checkpoints, at\nbanks, parks, and schools. When they pump gas, the system can determine\nwhether they are the car\u2019s owner. At the city\u2019s perimeter, they\u2019re forced to\nexit their cars, so their face and ID card can be scanned again.\n\nRead: Uighurs can\u2019t escape Chinese repression, even in Europe\n\nThe lucky Uighurs who are able to travel abroad\u2014many have had their passports\nconfiscated\u2014are advised to return quickly. If they do not, police\ninterrogators are dispatched to the doorsteps of their relatives and friends.\nNot that going abroad is any kind of escape: In a chilling glimpse at how a\nfuture authoritarian bloc might function, Xi\u2019s strongman allies\u2014even those in\nMuslim-majority countries such as Egypt\u2014have been more than happy to arrest\nand deport Uighurs back to the open-air prison that is Xinjiang.\n\nXi seems to have used Xinjiang as a laboratory to fine-tune the sensory and\nanalytical powers of his new digital panopticon before expanding its reach\nacross the mainland. CETC, the state-owned company that built much of\nXinjiang\u2019s surveillance system, now boasts of pilot projects in Zhejiang,\nGuangdong, and Shenzhen. These are meant to lay \u201ca robust foundation for a\nnationwide rollout,\u201d according to the company, and they represent only one\npiece of China\u2019s coalescing mega-network of human-monitoring technology.\n\nChina is an ideal setting for an experiment in total surveillance. Its\npopulation is extremely online. The country is home to more than 1 billion\nmobile phones, all chock-full of sophisticated sensors. Each one logs search-\nengine queries, websites visited, and mobile payments, which are ubiquitous.\nWhen I used a chip-based credit card to buy coffee in Beijing\u2019s hip Sanlitun\nneighborhood, people glared as if I\u2019d written a check.\n\nAll of these data points can be time-stamped and geo-tagged. And because a new\nregulation requires telecom firms to scan the face of anyone who signs up for\ncellphone services, phones\u2019 data can now be attached to a specific person\u2019s\nface. SenseTime, which helped build Xinjiang\u2019s surveillance state, recently\nbragged that its software can identify people wearing masks. Another company,\nHanwang, claims that its facial-recognition technology can recognize mask\nwearers 95 percent of the time. China\u2019s personal-data harvest even reaps from\ncitizens who lack phones. Out in the countryside, villagers line up to have\ntheir faces scanned, from multiple angles, by private firms in exchange for\ncookware.\n\nAn authoritarian state with enough processing power could feed every blip of a\ncitizen\u2019s neural activity into a government database.\n\nUntil recently, it was difficult to imagine how China could integrate all of\nthese data into a single surveillance system, but no longer. In 2018, a\ncybersecurity activist hacked into a facial-recognition system that appeared\nto be connected to the government and was synthesizing a surprising\ncombination of data streams. The system was capable of detecting Uighurs by\ntheir ethnic features, and it could tell whether people\u2019s eyes or mouth were\nopen, whether they were smiling, whether they had a beard, and whether they\nwere wearing sunglasses. It logged the date, time, and serial numbers\u2014all\ntraceable to individual users\u2014of Wi-Fi-enabled phones that passed within its\nreach. It was hosted by Alibaba and made reference to City Brain, an AI-\npowered software platform that China\u2019s government has tasked the company with\nbuilding.\n\nRead: China\u2019s artificial-intelligence boom\n\nCity Brain is, as the name suggests, a kind of automated nerve center, capable\nof synthesizing data streams from a multitude of sensors distributed\nthroughout an urban environment. Many of its proposed uses are benign\ntechnocratic functions. Its algorithms could, for instance, count people and\ncars, to help with red-light timing and subway-line planning. Data from\nsensor-laden trash cans could make waste pickup more timely and efficient.\n\nBut City Brain and its successor technologies will also enable new forms of\nintegrated surveillance. Some of these will enjoy broad public support: City\nBrain could be trained to spot lost children, or luggage abandoned by tourists\nor terrorists. It could flag loiterers, or homeless people, or rioters. Anyone\nin any kind of danger could summon help by waving a hand in a distinctive way\nthat would be instantly recognized by ever-vigilant computer vision. Earpiece-\nwearing police officers could be directed to the scene by an AI voice\nassistant.\n\nCity Brain would be especially useful in a pandemic. (One of Alibaba\u2019s sister\ncompanies created the app that color-coded citizens\u2019 disease risk, while\nsilently sending their health and travel data to police.) As Beijing\u2019s\noutbreak spread, some malls and restaurants in the city began scanning\npotential customers\u2019 phones, pulling data from mobile carriers to see whether\nthey\u2019d recently traveled. Mobile carriers also sent municipal governments\nlists of people who had come to their city from Wuhan, where the coronavirus\nwas first detected. And Chinese AI companies began making networked facial-\nrecognition helmets for police, with built-in infrared fever detectors,\ncapable of sending data to the government. City Brain could automate these\nprocesses, or integrate its data streams.\n\nEven China\u2019s most complex AI systems are still brittle. City Brain hasn\u2019t yet\nfully integrated its range of surveillance capabilities, and its ancestor\nsystems have suffered some embarrassing performance issues: In 2018, one of\nthe government\u2019s AI-powered cameras mistook a face on the side of a city bus\nfor a jaywalker. But the software is getting better, and there\u2019s no technical\nreason it can\u2019t be implemented on a mass scale.\n\nThe data streams that could be fed into a City Brain\u2013like system are\nessentially unlimited. In addition to footage from the 1.9 million facial-\nrecognition cameras that the Chinese telecom firm China Tower is installing in\ncooperation with SenseTime, City Brain could absorb feeds from cameras\nfastened to lampposts and hanging above street corners. It could make use of\nthe cameras that Chinese police hide in traffic cones, and those strapped to\nofficers, both uniformed and plainclothes. The state could force retailers to\nprovide data from in-store cameras, which can now detect the direction of your\ngaze across a shelf, and which could soon see around corners by reading\nshadows. Precious little public space would be unwatched.\n\nAmerica\u2019s police departments have begun to avail themselves of footage from\nAmazon\u2019s home-security cameras. In their more innocent applications, these\ncameras adorn doorbells, but many are also aimed at neighbors\u2019 houses. China\u2019s\ngovernment could harvest footage from equivalent Chinese products. They could\ntap the cameras attached to ride-share cars, or the self-driving vehicles that\nmay soon replace them: Automated vehicles will be covered in a whole host of\nsensors, including some that will take in information much richer than 2-D\nvideo. Data from a massive fleet of them could be stitched together, and\nsupplemented by other City Brain streams, to produce a 3-D model of the city\nthat\u2019s updated second by second. Each refresh could log every human\u2019s location\nwithin the model. Such a system would make unidentified faces a priority,\nperhaps by sending drone swarms to secure a positive ID.\n\nThe model\u2019s data could be time-synced to audio from any networked device with\na microphone, including smart speakers, smartwatches, and less obvious\nInternet of Things devices like smart mattresses, smart diapers, and smart sex\ntoys. All of these sources could coalesce into a multitrack, location-specific\naudio mix that could be parsed by polyglot algorithms capable of interpreting\nwords spoken in thousands of tongues. This mix would be useful to security\nservices, especially in places without cameras: China\u2019s iFlytek is perfecting\na technology that can recognize individuals by their \u201cvoiceprint.\u201d\n\nIn the decades to come, City Brain or its successor systems may even be able\nto read unspoken thoughts. Drones can already be controlled by helmets that\nsense and transmit neural signals, and researchers are now designing brain-\ncomputer interfaces that go well beyond autofill, to allow you to type just by\nthinking. An authoritarian state with enough processing power could force the\nmakers of such software to feed every blip of a citizen\u2019s neural activity into\na government database. China has recently been pushing citizens to download\nand use a propaganda app. The government could use emotion-tracking software\nto monitor reactions to a political stimulus within an app. A silent,\nsuppressed response to a meme or a clip from a Xi speech would be a meaningful\ndata point to a precog algorithm.\n\nAll of these time-synced feeds of on-the-ground data could be supplemented by\nfootage from drones, whose gigapixel cameras can record whole cityscapes in\nthe kind of crystalline detail that allows for license-plate reading and gait\nrecognition. \u201cSpy bird\u201d drones already swoop and circle above Chinese cities,\ndisguised as doves. City Brain\u2019s feeds could be synthesized with data from\nsystems in other urban areas, to form a multidimensional, real-time account of\nnearly all human activity within China. Server farms across China will soon be\nable to hold multiple angles of high-definition footage of every moment of\nevery Chinese person\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI tell my students that I hope none of them will be involved in killer\nrobots. They have only a short time on Earth. There are many other things they\ncould be doing with their future.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to stress that systems of this scope are still in development.\nMost of China\u2019s personal data are not yet integrated together, even within\nindividual companies. Nor does China\u2019s government have a one-stop data\nrepository, in part because of turf wars between agencies. But there are no\nhard political barriers to the integration of all these data, especially for\nthe security state\u2019s use. To the contrary, private firms are required, by\nformal statute, to assist China\u2019s intelligence services.\n\nThe government might soon have a rich, auto-populating data profile for all of\nits 1 billion\u2013plus citizens. Each profile would comprise millions of data\npoints, including the person\u2019s every appearance in surveilled space, as well\nas all of her communications and purchases. Her threat risk to the party\u2019s\npower could constantly be updated in real time, with a more granular score\nthan those used in China\u2019s pilot \u201csocial credit\u201d schemes, which already aim to\ngive every citizen a public social-reputation score based on things like\nsocial-media connections and buying habits. Algorithms could monitor her\ndigital data score, along with everyone else\u2019s, continuously, without ever\nfeeling the fatigue that hit Stasi officers working the late shift. False\npositives\u2014deeming someone a threat for innocuous behavior\u2014would be encouraged,\nin order to boost the system\u2019s built-in chilling effects, so that she\u2019d turn\nher sharp eyes on her own behavior, to avoid the slightest appearance of\ndissent.\n\nIf her risk factor fluctuated upward\u2014whether due to some suspicious pattern in\nher movements, her social associations, her insufficient attention to a\npropaganda-consumption app, or some correlation known only to the AI\u2014a purely\nautomated system could limit her movement. It could prevent her from\npurchasing plane or train tickets. It could disallow passage through\ncheckpoints. It could remotely commandeer \u201csmart locks\u201d in public or private\nspaces, to confine her until security forces arrived.\n\nIn recent years, a few members of the Chinese intelligentsia have sounded the\nwarning about misused AI, most notably the computer scientist Yi Zeng and the\nphilosopher Zhao Tingyang. In the spring of 2019, Yi published \u201cThe Beijing AI\nPrinciples,\u201d a manifesto on AI\u2019s potential to interfere with autonomy,\ndignity, privacy, and a host of other human values.\n\nIt was Yi whom I\u2019d come to visit at Beijing\u2019s Institute of Automation, where,\nin addition to his work on AI ethics, he serves as the deputy director of the\nResearch Center for Brain-Inspired Intelligence. He retrieved me from the\nlobby. Yi looked young for his age, 37, with kind eyes and a solid frame\nslimmed down by black sweatpants and a hoodie.\n\nOn the way to Yi\u2019s office, we passed one of his labs, where a research\nassistant hovered over a microscope, watching electrochemical signals flash\nneuron-to-neuron through mouse-brain tissue. We sat down at a long table in a\nconference room adjoining his office, taking in the gray, fogged-in cityscape\nwhile his assistant fetched tea.\n\nI asked Yi how \u201cThe Beijing AI Principles\u201d had been received. \u201cPeople say,\n\u2018This is just an official show from the Beijing government,\u2019 \u201d he told me.\n\u201cBut this is my life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nYi talked freely about AI\u2019s potential misuses. He mentioned a project deployed\nto a select group of Chinese schools, where facial recognition was used to\ntrack not just student attendance but also whether individual students were\npaying attention.\n\n\u201cI hate that software,\u201d Yi said. \u201cI have to use that word: hate.\u201d\n\nHe went on like this for a while, enumerating various unethical applications\nof AI. \u201cI teach a course on the philosophy of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell my\nstudents that I hope none of them will be involved in killer robots. They have\nonly a short time on Earth. There are many other things they could be doing\nwith their future.\u201d\n\nYi clearly knew the academic literature on tech ethics cold. But when I asked\nhim about the political efficacy of his work, his answers were less\ncompelling.\n\nYi Zeng, photographed in his office at the Institute of Automation, in\nBeijing, July 2020. Yi, the author of \u201cThe Beijing AI Principles,\u201d has been a\nlonely voice in China warning that government misuse of AI could pose a threat\nto humanity. (Zhou Na)\n\n\u201cMany of us technicians have been invited to speak to the government, and even\nto Xi Jinping, about AI\u2019s potential risks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government is\nstill in a learning phase, just like other governments worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have anything stronger than that consultative process?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSuppose there are times when the government has interests that are in\nconflict with your principles. What mechanism are you counting on to win out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, personally, am still in a learning phase on that problem,\u201d Yi said.\n\nChinese AI start-ups aren\u2019t nearly as bothered. Several are helping Xi develop\nAI for the express purpose of surveillance. The combination of China\u2019s single-\nparty rule and the ideological residue of central planning makes party elites\npowerful in every domain, especially the economy. But in the past, the\nconnection between the government and the tech industry was discreet.\nRecently, the Chinese government started assigning representatives to tech\nfirms, to augment the Communist Party cells that exist within large private\ncompanies.\n\nSelling to the state security services is one of the fastest ways for China\u2019s\nAI start-ups to turn a profit. A national telecom firm is the largest\nshareholder of iFlytek, China\u2019s voice-recognition giant. Synergies abound:\nWhen police use iFlytek\u2019s software to monitor calls, state-owned newspapers\nprovide favorable coverage. Earlier this year, the personalized-news app\nToutiao went so far as to rewrite its mission to articulate a new animating\ngoal: aligning public opinion with the government\u2019s wishes. Xu Li, the CEO of\nSenseTime, recently described the government as his company\u2019s \u201clargest data\nsource.\u201d\n\nWhether any private data can be ensured protection in China isn\u2019t clear, given\nthe country\u2019s political structure. The digital revolution has made data\nmonopolies difficult to avoid. Even in America, which has a sophisticated\ntradition of antitrust enforcement, the citizenry has not yet summoned the\nwill to force information about the many out of the hands of the powerful few.\nBut private data monopolies are at least subject to the sovereign power of the\ncountries where they operate. A nation-state\u2019s data monopoly can be prevented\nonly by its people, and only if they possess sufficient political power.\n\nChina\u2019s people can\u2019t use an election to rid themselves of Xi. And with no\nindependent judiciary, the government can make an argument, however strained,\nthat it ought to possess any information stream, so long as threats to\n\u201cstability\u201d could be detected among the data points. Or it can demand data\nfrom companies behind closed doors, as happened during the initial coronavirus\noutbreak. No independent press exists to leak news of these demands to.\n\n[ Read: China\u2019s surveillance state should scare everyone ]\n\nEach time a person\u2019s face is recognized, or her voice recorded, or her text\nmessages intercepted, this information could be attached, instantly, to her\ngovernment-ID number, police records, tax returns, property filings, and\nemployment history. It could be cross-referenced with her medical records and\nDNA, of which the Chinese police boast they have the world\u2019s largest\ncollection.\n\nYi and I talked through a global scenario that has begun to worry AI ethicists\nand China-watchers alike. In this scenario, most AI researchers around the\nworld come to recognize the technology\u2019s risks to humanity, and develop strong\nnorms around its use. All except for one country, which makes the right noises\nabout AI ethics, but only as a cover. Meanwhile, this country builds turnkey\nnational surveillance systems, and sells them to places where democracy is\nfragile or nonexistent. The world\u2019s autocrats are usually felled by coups or\nmass protests, both of which require a baseline of political organization. But\nlarge-scale political organization could prove impossible in societies watched\nby pervasive automated surveillance.\n\nYi expressed worry about this scenario, but he did not name China\nspecifically. He didn\u2019t have to: The country is now the world\u2019s leading seller\nof AI-powered surveillance equipment. In Malaysia, the government is working\nwith Yitu, a Chinese AI start-up, to bring facial-recognition technology to\nKuala Lumpur\u2019s police as a complement to Alibaba\u2019s City Brain platform.\nChinese companies also bid to outfit every one of Singapore\u2019s 110,000\nlampposts with facial-recognition cameras.\n\nIn South Asia, the Chinese government has supplied surveillance equipment to\nSri Lanka. On the old Silk Road, the Chinese company Dahua is lining the\nstreets of Mongolia\u2019s capital with AI-assisted surveillance cameras. Farther\nwest, in Serbia, Huawei is helping set up a \u201csafe-city system,\u201d complete with\nfacial-recognition cameras and joint patrols conducted by Serbian and Chinese\npolice aimed at helping Chinese tourists to feel safe.\n\nJonathan Djob Nkondo\n\nIn the early aughts, the Chinese telecom titan ZTE sold Ethiopia a wireless\nnetwork with built-in backdoor access for the government. In a later\ncrackdown, dissidents were rounded up for brutal interrogations, during which\nthey were played audio from recent phone calls they\u2019d made. Today, Kenya,\nUganda, and Mauritius are outfitting major cities with Chinese-made\nsurveillance networks.\n\nIn Egypt, Chinese developers are looking to finance the construction of a new\ncapital. It\u2019s slated to run on a \u201csmart city\u201d platform similar to City Brain,\nalthough a vendor has not yet been named. In southern Africa, Zambia has\nagreed to buy more than $1 billion in telecom equipment from China, including\ninternet-monitoring technology. China\u2019s Hikvision, the world\u2019s largest\nmanufacturer of AI-enabled surveillance cameras, has an office in\nJohannesburg.\n\nChina uses \u201cpredatory lending to sell telecommunications equipment at a\nsignificant discount to developing countries, which then puts China in a\nposition to control those networks and their data,\u201d Michael Kratsios,\nAmerica\u2019s CTO, told me. When countries need to refinance the terms of their\nloans, China can make network access part of the deal, in the same way that\nits military secures base rights at foreign ports it finances. \u201cIf you give\n[China] unfettered access to data networks around the world, that could be a\nserious problem,\u201d Kratsios said.\n\nIn 2018, CloudWalk Technology, a Guangzhou-based start-up spun out of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences, inked a deal with the Zimbabwean government to\nset up a surveillance network. Its terms require Harare to send images of its\ninhabitants\u2014a rich data set, given that Zimbabwe has absorbed migration flows\nfrom all across sub-Saharan Africa\u2014back to CloudWalk\u2019s Chinese offices,\nallowing the company to fine-tune its software\u2019s ability to recognize dark-\nskinned faces, which have previously proved tricky for its algorithms.\n\nHaving set up beachheads in Asia, Europe, and Africa, China\u2019s AI companies are\nnow pushing into Latin America, a region the Chinese government describes as a\n\u201ccore economic interest.\u201d China financed Ecuador\u2019s $240 million purchase of a\nsurveillance-camera system. Bolivia, too, has bought surveillance equipment\nwith help from a loan from Beijing. Venezuela recently debuted a new national\nID-card system that logs citizens\u2019 political affiliations in a database built\nby ZTE. In a grim irony, for years Chinese companies hawked many of these\nsurveillance products at a security expo in Xinjiang, the home province of the\nUighurs.\n\nIf China is able to surpass America in AI, it will become a more potent\ngeopolitical force, especially as the standard-bearer of a new authoritarian\nalliance.\n\nChina already has some of the world\u2019s largest data sets to feed its AI\nsystems, a crucial advantage for its researchers. In cavernous mega-offices in\ncities across the country, low-wage workers sit at long tables for long hours,\ntranscribing audio files and outlining objects in images, to make the data\ngenerated by China\u2019s massive population more useful. But for the country to\nbest America\u2019s AI ecosystem, its vast troves of data will have to be sifted\nthrough by algorithms that recognize patterns well beyond those grasped by\nhuman insight. And even executives at China\u2019s search giant Baidu concede that\nthe top echelon of AI talent resides in the West.\n\nHistorically, China struggled to retain elite quants, most of whom left to\nstudy in America\u2019s peerless computer-science departments, before working at\nSilicon Valley\u2019s more interesting, better-resourced companies. But that may be\nchanging. The Trump administration has made it difficult for Chinese students\nto study in the United States, and those who are able to are viewed with\nsuspicion. A leading machine-learning scientist at Google recently described\nvisa restrictions as \u201cone of the largest bottlenecks to our collective\nresearch productivity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s ascent to AI supremacy is a menacing prospect: The country\u2019s political\nstructure encourages, rather than restrains, this technology\u2019s worst uses.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese computer-science departments have gone all-in on AI. Three\nof the world\u2019s top 10 AI universities, in terms of the volume of research they\npublish, are now located in China. And that\u2019s before the country finishes\nbuilding the 50 new AI research centers mandated by Xi\u2019s \u201cAI Innovation Action\nPlan for Institutions of Higher Education.\u201d Chinese companies attracted 36\npercent of global AI private-equity investment in 2017, up from just 3 percent\nin 2015. Talented Chinese engineers can stay home for school and work for a\nglobally sexy homegrown company like TikTok after graduation.\n\nChina will still lag behind America in computing hardware in the near term.\nJust as data must be processed by algorithms to be useful, algorithms must be\ninstantiated in physical strata\u2014specifically, in the innards of microchips.\nThese gossamer silicon structures are so intricate that a few missing atoms\ncan reroute electrical pulses through the chips\u2019 neuronlike switches. The most\nsophisticated chips are arguably the most complex objects yet built by humans.\nThey\u2019re certainly too complex to be quickly pried apart and reverse-engineered\nby China\u2019s vaunted corporate-espionage artists.\n\nChinese firms can\u2019t yet build the best of the best chip-fabrication rooms,\nwhich cost billions of dollars and rest on decades of compounding\ninstitutional knowledge. Nitrogen-cooled and seismically isolated, to prevent\na passing truck\u2019s rumble from ruining a microchip in vitro, these automated\nrooms are as much a marvel as their finished silicon wafers. And the best ones\nare still mostly in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and\nTaiwan.\n\nAmerica\u2019s government is still able to limit the hardware that flows into\nChina, a state of affairs that the Communist Party has come to resent. When\nthe Trump administration banned the sale of microchips to ZTE in April 2018,\nFrank Long, an analyst who specializes in China\u2019s AI sector, described it as a\nwake-up call for China on par with America\u2019s experience of the Arab oil\nembargo.\n\nBut the AI revolution has dealt China a rare leapfrogging opportunity. Until\nrecently, most chips were designed with flexible architecture that allows for\nmany types of computing operations. But AI runs fastest on custom chips, like\nthose Google uses for its cloud computing to instantly spot your daughter\u2019s\nface in thousands of photos. (Apple performs many of these operations on the\niPhone with a custom neural-engine chip.) Because everyone is making these\ncustom chips for the first time, China isn\u2019t as far behind: Baidu and Alibaba\nare building chips customized for deep learning. And in August 2019, Huawei\nunveiled a mobile machine-learning chip. Its design came from Cambricon,\nperhaps the global chip-making industry\u2019s most valuable start-up, which was\nfounded by Yi\u2019s colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nBy 2030, AI supremacy might be within range for China. The country will likely\nhave the world\u2019s largest economy, and new money to spend on AI applications\nfor its military. It may have the most sophisticated drone swarms. It may have\nautonomous weapons systems that can forecast an adversary\u2019s actions after a\nbrief exposure to a theater of war, and make battlefield decisions much faster\nthan human cognition allows. Its missile-detection algorithms could void\nAmerica\u2019s first-strike nuclear advantage. AI could upturn the global balance\nof power.\n\nOn my way out of the Institute of Automation, Yi took me on a tour of his\nrobotics lab. In the high-ceilinged room, grad students fiddled with a giant\ndisembodied metallic arm and a small humanoid robot wrapped in a gray\nexoskeleton while Yi told me about his work modeling the brain. He said that\nunderstanding the brain\u2019s structure was the surest way to understand the\nnature of intelligence.\n\nI asked Yi how the future of AI would unfold. He said he could imagine\nsoftware modeled on the brain acquiring a series of abilities, one by one. He\nsaid it could achieve some semblance of self-recognition, and then slowly\nbecome aware of the past and the future. It could develop motivations and\nvalues. The final stage of its assisted evolution would come when it\nunderstood other agents as worthy of empathy.\n\nI asked him how long this process would take.\n\n\u201cI think such a machine could be built by 2030,\u201d Yi said.\n\nBefore bidding Yi farewell, I asked him to imagine things unfolding another\nway. \u201cSuppose you finish your digital, high-resolution model of the brain,\u201d I\nsaid. \u201cAnd suppose it attains some rudimentary form of consciousness. And\nsuppose, over time, you\u2019re able to improve it, until it outperforms humans in\nevery cognitive task, with the exception of empathy. You keep it locked down\nin safe mode until you achieve that last step. But then one day, the\ngovernment\u2019s security services break down your office door. They know you have\nthis AI on your computer. They want to use it as the software for a new\nhardware platform, an artificial humanoid soldier. They\u2019ve already\nmanufactured a billion of them, and they don\u2019t give a damn if they\u2019re wired\nwith empathy. They demand your password. Do you give it to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would destroy my computer and leave,\u201d Yi said.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cYes, really,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, it would be time to quit my job and go\nfocus on robots that create art.\u201d\n\nIf you were looking for a philosopher-king to chart an ethical developmental\ntrajectory for AI, you could do worse than Yi. But the development path of AI\nwill be shaped by overlapping systems of local, national, and global politics,\nnot by a wise and benevolent philosopher-king. That\u2019s why China\u2019s ascent to AI\nsupremacy is such a menacing prospect: The country\u2019s political structure\nencourages, rather than restrains, this technology\u2019s worst uses.\n\nEven in the U.S., a democracy with constitutionally enshrined human rights,\nAmericans are struggling mightily to prevent the emergence of a public-private\nsurveillance state. But at least America has political structures that stand\nsome chance of resistance. In China, AI will be restrained only according to\nthe party\u2019s needs.\n\nIt was nearly noon when I finally left the institute. The day\u2019s rain was in\nits last hour. Yi ordered me a car and walked me to meet it, holding an\numbrella over my head. I made my way to the Forbidden City, Beijing\u2019s historic\nseat of imperial power. Even this short trip to the city center brought me\ninto contact with China\u2019s surveillance state. Before entering Tiananmen\nSquare, both my passport and my face were scanned, an experience I was\nbecoming numb to.\n\nIn the square itself, police holding body-size bulletproof shields jogged in\nsingle-file lines, weaving paths through throngs of tourists. The heavy police\npresence was a chilling reminder of the student protesters who were murdered\nhere in 1989. China\u2019s AI-patrolled Great Firewall was built, in part, to make\nsure that massacre is never discussed on its internet. To dodge algorithmic\ncensors, Chinese activists rely on memes\u2014Tank Man approaching a rubber\nducky\u2014to commemorate the students\u2019 murder.\n\nThe party\u2019s AI-powered censorship extends well beyond Tiananmen. Earlier this\nyear, the government arrested Chinese programmers who were trying to preserve\ndisappeared news stories about the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the articles\nin their database were banned because they were critical of Xi and the party.\nThey survived only because internet users reposted them on social media,\ninterlaced with coded language and emojis designed to evade algorithms. Work-\narounds of this sort are short-lived: Xi\u2019s domestic critics used to make fun\nof him with images of Winnie the Pooh, but those too are now banned in China.\nThe party\u2019s ability to edit history and culture, by force, will become more\nsweeping and precise, as China\u2019s AI improves.\n\nWresting power from a government that so thoroughly controls the information\nenvironment will be difficult. It may take a million acts of civil\ndisobedience, like the laptop-destroying scenario imagined by Yi. China\u2019s\ncitizens will have to stand with their students. Who can say what hardships\nthey may endure?\n\nChina\u2019s citizens don\u2019t yet seem to be radicalized against surveillance. The\npandemic may even make people value privacy less, as one early poll in the\nU.S. suggests. So far, Xi is billing the government\u2019s response as a triumphant\n\u201cpeople\u2019s war,\u201d another old phrase from Mao, referring to the mobilization of\nthe whole population to smash an invading force. The Chinese people may well\nbe more pliant now than they were before the virus.\n\nBut evidence suggests that China\u2019s young people\u2014at least some of them\u2014resented\nthe government\u2019s initial secrecy about the outbreak. For all we know, some new\nyouth movement on the mainland is biding its time, waiting for the right\nmoment to make a play for democracy. The people of Hong Kong certainly sense\nthe danger of this techno-political moment. The night before I arrived in\nChina, more than 1 million protesters had poured into the island\u2019s streets.\n(The free state newspaper in my Beijing hotel described them, falsely, as\npolice supporters.) A great many held umbrellas over their heads, in\nsolidarity with student protesters from years prior, and to keep their faces\nhidden. A few tore down a lamppost on the suspicion that it contained a\nfacial-recognition camera. Xi has since tightened his grip on the region with\na \u201cnational-security law,\u201d and there is little that outnumbered Hong Kongers\ncan do about it, at least not without help from a movement on the mainland.\n\nDuring my visit to Tiananmen Square, I didn\u2019t see any protesters. People\nmostly milled about peacefully, posing for selfies with the oversize portrait\nof Mao. They held umbrellas, but only to keep the August sun off their faces.\nWalking in their midst, I kept thinking about the contingency of history: The\npolitical systems that constrain a technology during its early development\nprofoundly shape our shared global future. We have learned this from our\nadventures in carbon-burning. Much of the planet\u2019s political trajectory may\ndepend on just how dangerous China\u2019s people imagine AI to be in the hands of\ncentralized power. Until they secure their personal liberty, at some\nunimaginable cost, free people everywhere will have to hope against hope that\nthe world\u2019s most intelligent machines are made elsewhere.\n\nThis article appears in the September 2020 print edition with the headline\n\u201cWhen China Sees All.\u201d\n\nRoss Andersen is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
