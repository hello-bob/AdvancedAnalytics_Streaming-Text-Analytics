It\u2019s the way things are done. Stop signs are red. Salespeople get\ncommissions.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis is a practice so deeply ingrained that almost everyone assumes that\ncommissions are an unalloyed good, and that salespeople won\u2019t work without\nthem. I\u2019ll return to that notion about work shortly, but it\u2019s somewhat amazing\nthat commissions are so widely lauded when they come laden with so many\nrecurring problems. These issues pop up with distressing regularity.\n\nThere are all kinds of problems with commissions, for example, high turnover\nas salespeople shop jobs to get a slightly more lucrative commission system.\nAlways attempting to maximize personal benefit which results in system gaming\nlike making fake phone calls to hit call numbers, sandbagging deals into the\nnext quarter, sniping new leads, and so on (the list here is actually\nendless).\n\nThe problems include infighting over who gets credit for accounts and sales.\nThey include constantly comparing territories and account value to determine\nfairness between salespeople. They include an enormous amount of overhead as\neach salesperson sedulously tracks every transaction no matter how minute to\nmake sure they get paid on it (by the way, they hate having to do this, and\nit\u2019s a staggering waste of time. It\u2019s also a place where weak salespeople like\nto hide out).\n\nAll of this is organizational dysfunction, and it\u2019s a recipe for resentment\nand distrust among your team.\n\nManagement then tries to correct for these problems. They constantly drop or\nadd ballast. They have to carefully structure the pay plan, the territories,\nthe lead assignments. They have to referee disputes, tweak the various\nsystems, and try to keep everyone happy. It\u2019s like a spinning top and every\ntime it starts to wobble, management has to try to nudge it back. It\u2019s a large\namount of effort spent propping up a system that we have all just assumed is\nnecessary.\n\nBut it gets even worse.\n\nIn research by Dan Ariely and others it appears that higher incentives,\nactually reduce performance. That\u2019s a perverse and counter-intuitive result,\nbut in several different kinds of experiments, groups that were promised the\nlargest amount of money as a reward for doing a task performed that task more\nslowly, and completed the tasks less often.\n\nAnd yet the paladins defending commissions are everywhere.\n\nThey say that commission-based pay maximizes autonomy. Assume there are ten\n\u201cunits\u201d of pay which, of course, can be divided up in all kinds of ways; eight\nunits of salary and two units of commission, or one unit of salary and nine\nunits of commission. How best to do this is the source of several different\nkinds of holy war.\n\nThis means, they say, that for every unit of base salary that gets added to\nthe pay mixture in place of commission there is an increase in employer\ncontrol, or put the other way round, a reduction in autonomy. More salary in\nthe mix destroys the space for independence and kills the morale of the\nworker. It turns motivated independent free-agent sales people into wage\nslaves.\n\nBut it gets even worse, according to the defenders of commissions, and here is\nthe crux of their argument.\n\nThey say that without the potential to make extra money for your efforts\u2014that\nis without a one-for-one relationship between a piece of work and the\nresultant money\u2014that there is no real motivation to work, or, god forbid, to\ndo any extra work. How do you keep salespeople hungry if you don\u2019t pay them\ncommissions? This is the great inscrutable puzzle in sales pay. Too much\nsalary and not only do salespeople lose their independence they become slugs\non top of it.\n\nSalespeople are lazy and greedy and unethical and that it is only the sweet\nsmell of more lucre that gets them to shed their pajamas each morning?\n\nAccording to this view sales people are only motivated by a specific type of\npay\u2014the commission, and the magic is in finding, like Goldilocks, that place\nthat\u2019s just so perfectly just right. Because of this we regard all the\npathologies commissions create as just part of the price.\n\nBut could it be possible that we\u2019ve got cause and effect reversed here? Is it\npossible that the stereotype of the slimy salesperson, and the derangement of\nthe culture they so often get blamed for, are actually the result of the way\nthey are paid instead of the kind of people they are? Could commissions,\nrather than the people, be the primary cause of dysfunctional sales cultures?\n\nThink for a second: we don\u2019t insist that other kinds of workers be paid on\ncommissions. Only an amazing idiot pays a programmer by lines of code. We\ndon\u2019t assume that programmers will dog it if they are paid only salary.\nActually, we think just the opposite; they will work hard because they care\nabout the work they\u2019re doing, and they won\u2019t need lashings, or thumbscrews, or\nother popular forms of motivation. We assume they are internally motivated.\nThis is one of the hallmarks of the enlightened software industry. Development\nisn\u2019t (usually) conveyor belt work. It doesn\u2019t (usually) suck the soul out of\nyou. It\u2019s creative, it\u2019s mind work and it operates on an entirely different\nrhythm from traditional kinds of labor, so heavy external control tends to be\ncounter-productive.\n\nAnd this is true of other workers today\u2014designers and writers and interaction\nexperts, for example. They work on this different rhythm, and are trusted to\ndo so, not coerced by the style of pay they receive, and in good work places,\nnot too often by a manager either. A writer may impose a rigid schedule on\nherself, but any manager who attempts to impose a similar sort of external\nauthoritarian control is suffering from a kind of insanity given how out of\nsynch such management is with the demands of a lot of today\u2019s work. And so it\nis with attempts to control with pay.\n\nThe different pay systems, then, leave us with two kinds of workers; the lazy\nsalesperson who needs to be coerced with direct rewards, and programmers who\ncan be trusted to go about their day and get good work done. It\u2019s just weird\nwhen you think about it.\n\nBut, these are actually two different views of workers, not necessarily two\nkinds of workers.\n\nThe tension between these views of workers was described in the 1960s by\nDouglas MacGregor in his book The Human Side of Enterprise. He suggested that\nmanagers had two views of motivation, and that a manager\u2019s theory of\nmotivation determined company culture. The first view he called Theory X which\nassumes that people are lazy, want to avoid work and need to be controlled,\ncoerced, punished, and lavishly rewarded in order to perform. Sounds like some\nsort of S&M dungeon to me. Theory X demands a lot of managerial control and\ntends to demotivate, generate hostility, and generally make people into sour\npusses.\n\nThe second he called Theory Y which assumes that people are self-motivated,\nderive satisfaction from their work, are creative, and thrive when given\nautonomy.\n\nWith these two views in hand, we now have a way to describe why sales\ncommissions create so much dysfunction. Commissions assume a Theory X world.\nIt assumes salespeople are lazy. They need external motivation to shake off\nthe moss. If you pay them on salary, they just won\u2019t get things done. The\ncommissions view then makes the mistake of presuming that this can be fixed\nwith either larger overall commissions or a greater percentage of total pay\ncoming from commissions.\n\nBut if Theory X doesn\u2019t fit and is a degrading way to treat employees, then\ndoing more of it gets you nothing but more degradation and misery, right?\n\nThe Theory X way of doing sales compensation, I now think, has habituated us\ninto accepting deranged and dysfunctional sales behavior as if it\u2019s just the\ncost of doing business.\n\n##### We Get Rid of Commissions\n\nGetting rid of commissions lets us forget about policing the wobble. Now, it\nis not necessarily the case that commissions are always bad, or always fail,\nor are wrong for you. It\u2019s just that they come with real problems, and you\nneed to carefully weigh both your desired company culture, and the costs of\npolicing your commissions system against the expected increase in performance,\nwhich is a very hard calculation to make.\n\nFor us, it\u2019s been a great success, and at least from that perspective it might\nbe time we punch the Theory X, commissions-based sales culture right in the\nnose. Real redemption might lie in removing the source of the derangement and\ntreating sales people like we treat programmers and other workers that we\nimplicitly trust.\n\n### Subscribe to Dan\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Dan Ostlund \u00b7 Launched 17 hours ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Must You Pay Sales People Commissions?\n\nostlund.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dan Ostlund\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
