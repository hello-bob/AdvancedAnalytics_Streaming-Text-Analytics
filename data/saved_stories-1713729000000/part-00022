It\u2019s fair to say that nobody expected much of it. Internally,\nat Nintendo\u2019s Kyoto HQ, the portable console was reportedly not a well-loved\nproject. But within two weeks, it had sold out its entire 300,000-unit initial\nrun. The Game Boy would arrive later that year in the US, and across the rest\nof the world over the next couple of years. Everywhere it went, it proved just\nas popular. Thirty-five years and almost 120m sales later, it is still the\nfourth best-selling games console in history.\n\nLike Sony\u2019s Walkman, the Game Boy is a tech design icon of its time, still\ninstantly recognisable from its silhouette alone. Developed by a team led by\nSatoru Okada and Gunpei Yokoi in Kyoto, the Game Boy is perhaps the preeminent\nexample of Yokoi\u2019s \u201clateral thinking with withered technology\u201d maxim, a do-\nmore-with-less technological principle that endures at Nintendo to this day.\nIt\u2019s so simply designed \u2013 with four buttons and a cross-shaped directional pad\n\u2013 that you already know how to use it as soon as you look at it. Thanks to its\ngreyscale screen, the battery lasted for days of play. And most importantly\nfor accident-prone kids of the 90s (and their parents), you could throw it off\na bridge and it would probably still work.\n\nGunpei Yokoi\u2019s design principles made the Game Boy an international\nphenomenon. Photograph: AP\n\nThe Game Boy wasn\u2019t the first handheld console, and it wasn\u2019t even the best\none of that era. It was chunky and retro-looking even for the late 80s. Its\nscreen had no backlight, but it was also sensitive to glare from bright\nsunshine, so you had to go searching for the perfect amount of light, craning\nover the screen (or buy one of those big square portable lamps for it, which\nrequired even more batteries). The Atari Lynx and the Sega Game Gear,\nmeanwhile, arrived not long after with far superior hardware and colour\ngraphics.\n\nGame over: voice of Mario retiring after three decades, Nintendo announces\n\nRead more\n\nBut it was the Game Boy that became a best-seller, and spawned a line of\ndirect and spiritual successors from the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance\nto the Nintendo DS and even its Switch, all consoles that you can hold in your\nhands. The reason why is that, unlike its rivals, it had extraordinary games\nwhose vibrancy transcended the confines of its tiny greyish-green screen.\n\nThe best-remembered of these is undoubtedly Tetris. Tetris wasn\u2019t specifically\nmade for Nintendo\u2019s pint-sized console \u2013 you could play it on computers from\n1984 onwards \u2013 but it turns out that the Game Boy was made for Tetris. Alexey\nPajitnov\u2019s shape-slotting puzzle game found a perfect home on this little\nconsole, whose rudimentary graphical power was quite enough to render a few\nconfigurations of falling blocks. In the US and Europe, the Game Boy came\nbundled with the game \u2013 which is why, when you think of Tetris\u2019s earworm theme\ntune, it\u2019s probably the bleepy 8-bit Game Boy version that arrives in your\nmind.\n\nBlock rockin\u2019 blocks: Tetris battles became a staple of many family holidays.\nPhotograph: Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nYou could also play Tetris against a friend, due to the Game Boy\u2019s most\nforward-thinking feature: a port on its side that let you connect consoles\ntogether with a cable. It was this that would inspire Satoshi Tajiri, a quiet\nprogrammer who had a childhood fascination with bugs, to create the Game Boy\u2019s\nmost enduring game: Pok\u00e9mon. Out of pixels and pure imagination, Pok\u00e9mon\nconjured a world packed with characterful creatures in which kids and adults\nalike could lose themselves, trading and battling over those link cables.\nReleased in the dying days of the Game Boy, it nonetheless became a\nphenomenon.\n\nIt remains incredible to me that such a nerdy little game \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon battles\nare largely about numbers and type match-ups \u2013 became the single most\nprofitable entertainment franchise on Earth, more so than Mickey Mouse and\nStar Wars. It\u2019s a testament to the creative vision of its creators \u2013 and to\nthe imaginations of 90s children, who were unbothered by the rudimentary\npresentation. But it also tells us something about the power and intimacy of\nhandheld gaming. On televisions, gaming was rooted to the living room or the\nbedroom; on the Game Boy, it became part of family holidays, long car trips,\nlunch breaks at work. Games became part of the fabric of everyday life.\n\nThe handheld console produced many hit franchises. Photograph: Nintendo\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps this that has helped games such as Super Mario Land and the\nwistful, otherworldly The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening live so long in\nthe memories of those who played them. We remember playing Zelda on the train\nto work, at that first job where we met a lifelong friend; Pok\u00e9mon after\nschool, in the playground, with pals huddled around; Tetris on that holiday\nwhere we ended up in a high-score stand-off with our brother. A lot of people\nstill have their Game Boys, tucked in a drawer or an attic box. Their\nsentimental value is such that people can\u2019t quite bring themselves to throw\nthem out.\n\nThere\u2019s a photo I really love of four kids with 90s bowl-cuts crowded around a\nwoman focused intently on a Game Boy. You can just about make out the\ncartridge inside; it\u2019s Super Mario Land. As far as I know the provenance of\nthis photo is lost to time, but I like to think that it\u2019s her Game Boy, and\nshe\u2019s showing the kids the way through one of its tougher levels. This image\nis a perfect encapsulation of this console and how it felt to play it, for me.\nThe Game Boy was played by everyone, girls and boys, men and women, shared\namong families; it was a portal to other, smaller worlds, and it introduced\nmillions to the magic of games.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Games\n  * Nintendo\n  * Tetris\n  * Pok\u00e9mon\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
