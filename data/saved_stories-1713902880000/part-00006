A new mode of underwater fiber laser induced\nplasma detonation wave propulsion is proposed, which achieves control of the\nlaser focal point through the design of microcavity structure morphology\ncoupled with fiber optics and research on the performance of fiber laser\npropulsion structure. Furthermore, the control of the movement direction of\nsmall particles entering and exiting can be achieved, which solves the problem\nof low energy coupling efficiency of laser plasma in underwater environments\nand difficulty in effectively applying propulsion force to the surface of the\npushed object. By utilizing underwater plasma fiber laser induction to achieve\ndirectional propagation of detonation waves, we aim to improve the thrust and\nimpulse coupling coefficient structural performance of laser propulsion. We\nfocus on the morphology and energy conversion characteristics of fiber micro-\ncavity structures and the study provides theoretical support and guidance for\nfuture research on underwater laser induced plasma detonation wave dynamics\nwhile achieving particle targeting, fixed-point, and fixed-depth propulsion.\n\nMethods\n\nWe utilize the theory and method of directional propagation of detonation\nwaves through underwater fiber laser induced plasma, aiming to improve the\nthrust and impulse coupling coefficient structural performance of laser\npropulsion. Meanwhile, for the microcavity structural performance of\nunderwater fiber laser propulsion, we combine the analysis of laser plasmon\ndetonation theory to build a microstructure underwater laser plasma propulsion\nmodel and numerical simulation scheme. Simulation research is conducted by\nstructural morphology and numerical characteristics. Firstly, to address the\nissues of low impulse coupling coefficient and divergent effects in underwater\nlaser propulsion without microcavities, we numerically simulate the flow field\nwhen the microsphere is propagated by an underwater fiber laser under the same\nlaser energy but different microsphere positions. This illustrates the\nnecessity of adding structural constraints for underwater fiber laser\npropulsion and objecting the rust and pulse coupling coefficient without\nmicrocavities as a reference. Then, based on rectangular microcavities, we\nsimulate the flow field of underwater fiber laser pulse for microcavities with\ndifferent lengths and diameters while maintaining a constant distance between\nthe microsphere and the laser focus. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations\nof the performance of open, U-shaped microcavities, double tube microcavities,\nand structures with blocking forces, aiming to establish a mapping\nrelationship between the morphology of microcavities and the changes in the\nforce and weight coupling coefficients of microspheres through comparative\nanalysis of numerical results.\n\nResults and Discussions\n\nNumerical simulations yield the force curve and impulse coupling coefficient\nof the microsphere when the laser focus-to-microsphere distance changes\nwithout microcavities. The maximum impulse coupling coefficient is 0.117\ndyne/W (Fig. 3), and the flow field situation of underwater fiber laser\npropulsion at 0.2 \u03bcs without micro cavities shows higher pressure in the\nsymmetrical range of 30 to 90 degrees, indicating poor directional laser\npropulsion effects, which demonstrates the necessity of adding structural\nconstraints (Fig. 4). By adding a rectangular microcavity, the impulse\ncoupling coefficient can be improved to the order of 10^3 (Tables 1-2)\ncompared to that without microcavities. However, as the microcavity length\nincreases, the peak thrust decreases, reaching a maximum of about 140 dyne/W\n(Fig. 7). As the diameter increases, the impulse coupling coefficient\nincreases, but the growth rate slows down (Fig. 9). The changes in force on\nthe microsphere and the impulse coupling coefficient are obtained for U-shaped\nmicrocavities, double-tube microcavities, and microcavities with blocking\nstructures. The U-shaped micro cavity increases the total applied force on the\nmicrosphere by approximately 0.002 N and improves the impulse coupling\ncoefficient by 20 dyne/W (Fig. 12). When propelled by double-tube\nmicrocavities, the microsphere experiences a thrust of approximately 0.103 N\nand an impulse coupling coefficient of 340 dyne/W (Fig. 14). In the case of\nmicrocavities with blocking structures, the peak thrust is approximately 0.067\nN, which represents a 44% increase (Fig. 17), while the impulse coupling\ncoefficient is approximately 260 dyne/W, indicating an 86% increase (Table 3).\n\nConclusions\n\nWe propose several microcavity structures to solve the low impulse coupling\ncoefficient and divergent effects of underwater fiber laser propulsion without\nmicrocavities. By conducting numerical simulations on the flow fields of\ndifferent microcavity structures, we obtain the thrust curves and impulse\ncoupling coefficients after adding the respective microcavities. The addition\nof rectangular microcavities can significantly improve the impulse coupling\ncoefficient of underwater fiber laser propulsion to the order of 10^3 and\nconcentrate the effects of laser propulsion. Meanwhile, when the distance\nbetween the laser focus and the microsphere remains constant, increasing the\nlength of the microcavity decreases the peak thrust, while increasing the\ndiameter increases the impulse coupling coefficient, albeit at a decreasing\nrate. Compared to rectangular microcavities, U-shaped microcavities, double-\ntube microcavities, and microcavities with blocking structures provide greater\nenhancements in force on the microsphere and impulse coupling coefficients.\nAmong the four types of microcavities, double-tube microcavities show the\ngreatest enhancement effect. The results demonstrate that the addition of\nmicrocavities can improve the efficiency of underwater fiber laser propulsion\nand provide corresponding enhancement effects for the four microcavity\nstructures.\n\nKeywords\n\nimpulse coupling coefficientlaser opticsmicrocavity structureperformance\noptimizationunderwater laser propulsion\n\nAbstract\n\nGet PDF(in Chinese)\n\nFigures&Tables (21)\n\nEquations (0)\n\nReferences (33)\n\nGet Citation\n\nCopy Citation Text\n\nYang Ge, Hanyang Li, Hongtao Wang, Xianqi Tang, Gaoqian Zhou, Xulong Yang.\nPerformance of Short Micro-Cavity Structure for Underwater Fiber Nanosecond\nLaser Propulsion[J].
