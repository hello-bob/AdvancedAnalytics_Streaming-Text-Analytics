An\namazing experience,\" he said.\n\nImage: Jean-Michel Jarre has become the first passenger to fly in the AirCar.\nPic: KleinVision\n\nThe vehicle transforms in minutes from sports car to plane and became the\nfirst flying car to complete an intercity flight in 2021.\n\nThe car has a 1.6 litre BMW engine although KleinVision's co-founder Anton\nZajac told Sky News: \"As soon as the technology improves, we will simply run\non batteries.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are bridging the gap between the road and the sky, giving cars\nthe freedom they symbolised 50 years ago.\"\n\nIn order to get that freedom, you'll need not only a driver's licence and a\npilot's licence but also a specialised two-to-three month flying course in\norder to operate the AirCar. Mr Zajac hopes it'll hit the market in around a\nyear after being approved for flight in 2022.\n\nImage: The AirCar takes around a minute-and-a-half to go from plane to car.\nPic: KleinVision\n\nIt was made in Slovakia by Professor Stefan Klein and Mr Zajac but theirs\nisn't the only flying car taking off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, Alef Aeronautics's futuristic-looking Model A became the first\nroad-worthy flying car to receive approval for test flights from the Federal\nAviation Administration in July 2022.\n\nIt has already had nearly 3,000 pre-orders - and unlike KleinVision's AirCar,\nit is electric.\n\nRead more from Sky News: First known test dogfight between AI and human pilot\ncarried out The female gamers competing for thousands of pounds Bitcoin's\nhighly anticipated 'halving' event takes place\n\nThe start-up is backed by Elon Musk's SpaceX and can \"drive on the street,\ntake off vertically when needed, and fly overhead above traffic,\" according to\nAlef's website.\n\nHowever, it is considered a \"low-speed vehicle\" so it won't be able to drive\nfaster than about 25mph and would still require US government approval to be\ntested on public roads.\n\nImage: The KleinVision AirCar is a two-seat flying car made in Slovakia. Pic:\nKleinVision\n\nIn March, KleinVision sold the rights to the technology that powers its cars\nto a Chinese company called Hebei Jianxin Flying Car Technology Company.\n\nChina is leading the charge in developing flying car technology, although most\nof it focuses on electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp\n\nKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following\nSky News\n\nTap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nThe UK government said it expected electric flying taxis to be a reality by\n2030 in its Future of Flight action plan.\n\n\"This is not science fiction.
