A new demo\nshows that generative AI models make it possible to search for content in\nnovel ways, without restriction. The ultimate goal of the research project is\nto shift the Internet's power balance from governments and large corporations\nback to consumers.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, peer-to-peer file-sharing took the Internet by storm.\n\nThe ability to search for and share content with complete strangers was\nnothing short of a revolution.\n\nIn the years that followed, media consumption swiftly moved online. This\nusually involved content shared without permission, but pirate pioneers\nultimately paved the way for new business models.\n\nThe original \u2018pirate\u2019 ethos has long since gone. There are still plenty of\nunauthorized sites and services, but few today concern themselves with\ndecentralization and similar technical advances; centralized streaming is the\nnew king with money as the main motivator.\n\n## AI Meets BitTorrent\n\nThere are areas where innovation and technological progress still lead today,\nmostly centered around artificial intelligence. Every month, numerous new\ntools and services appear online, as developers embrace what many see as\nunlimited potential.\n\nHow these developments will shape the future is unknown, but they have many\nrightsholders spooked. Interestingly, an \u2018old\u2019 research group, that was\nalready active during BitTorrent\u2019s heyday, is now using AI to amplify its\ntechnology.\n\nResearchers from the Tribler research group at Delft University of Technology\nhave been working on their Tribler torrent client for nearly two decades. They\ndecentralized search, removing the need for torrent sites, and implemented\n\u2018anonymity\u2018 by adding an onion routing layer to file transfers.\n\nMany millions of euros have been spent on the Tribler research project over\nthe years. Its main goal is to advance decentralized technology, not to\nbenefit corporations, but to empower the public at large.\n\n\u201cOur entire research portfolio is driven by idealism. We aim to remove power\nfrom companies, governments, and AI in order to shift all this power to self-\nsovereign citizens,\u201d the Tribler team explains.\n\n## Decentralized AI-powered Search\n\nWhile not every technological advancement has been broadly embraced, yet,\nTribler has just released a new paper and a proof of concept which they see as\na turning point for decentralized AI implementations; one that has a direct\nBitTorrent link.\n\nThe scientific paper proposes a new framework titled \u201cDe-DSI\u201d, which stands\nfor Decentralised Differentiable Search Index. Without going into technical\ndetails, this essentially combines decentralized large language models (LLMs),\nwhich can be stored by peers, with decentralized search.\n\nThis means that people can use decentralized AI-powered search to find content\nin a pool of information that\u2019s stored across peers. For example, one can ask\n\u201cfind a magnet link for the Pirate Bay documentary,\u201d which should return a\nmagnet link for TPB-AFK, without mentioning it by name.\n\nThis entire process relies on information shared by users. There are no\ncentral servers involved at all, making it impossible for outsiders to\ncontrol.\n\n## Endless Possibilities, Limited Use\n\nWhile this sounds exciting, the current demo version is not yet built into the\nTribler client. Associate Professor Dr. Johan Pouwelse, leader of the\nuniversity\u2019s Tribler Lab, explains that it\u2019s just a proof of concept with a\nvery limited dataset and AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cFor this demo, we trained an end-to-end generative Transformer on a small\ndataset that comprises YouTube URLs, magnet links, and Bitcoin wallet\naddresses. Those identifiers are each annotated with a title and represent\nlinks to movie trailers, CC-licensed music, and BTC addresses of independent\nartists,\u201d Pouwelse says.\n\nWe tried some basic searches with mixed results. That makes sense since\nthere\u2019s only limited content, but it can find magnet links and videos without\ndirectly naming the title. That said, it\u2019s certainly not yet as powerful as\nother AI tools.\n\nIn essence, De-DSI operates by sharing the workload of training large language\nmodels on lists of document identifiers. Every peer in the network specializes\nin a subset of data, which other peers in the network can retrieve to come up\nwith the best search result.\n\n## A Global Human Brain to Fight Torrent Spam and Censors\n\nThe proof of concept shows that the technology is sound. However, it will take\nsome time before it\u2019s integrated into the Tribler torrent client. The current\ngoal is to have an experimental decentralized-AI version of Tribler ready at\nthe end of the year.\n\nWhile the researchers see this as a technological breakthrough, it doesn\u2019t\nmean that things will improve for users right away. AI-powered search will be\nslower to start with and, if people know what they\u2019re searching for, it offers\nlittle benefit.\n\nThrough trial and error, the researchers ultimately hope to improve things\nthough, with a \u201cglobal brain\u201d for humanity as the ultimate goal.\n\nMost torrent users are not looking for that, at the moment, but Pouwelse says\nthat they could also use decentralized machine learning to fight spam, offer\npersonal recommendations, and to optimize torrent metadata. These are concrete\nand usable use cases.\n\nThe main drive of the researchers is to make technology work for the public at\nlarge, without the need for large corporations or a central government to\ncontrol it.\n\n\u201cThe battle royale for Internet control is heating up,\u201d Pouwelse says, in a\nPirate Bay-esque fashion.\n\n\u201cDriven by our idealism we will iteratively take away their power and give it\nback to citizens. We started 18 years ago and will take decades more. We\nshould not give up on fixing The Internet, just because it is hard.\u201d\n\nThe very limited De-DSI proof of concept and all related code is available on\nHuggingface. All technological details are available in the associated paper.\nThe latest Tribler version, which is fully decentralized without AI, can be\nfound on the official project page.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * ai\n  * tribler\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\n### AI-Startup Launches Ever-Expanding Library of Free Stock Photos and Music\n\n  * April 13, 2024, 11:42 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\n### \u2018The New York Times Needs More than \u2018Imagined Fears\u2019 to Block AI\nInnovation\u2019\n\n  * March 29, 2024, 23:52 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\n### Music Industry Threatens \u2018Deepfake AI Music\u2019 Service With Legal Action\n\n  * March 20, 2024, 17:10 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nGoogle Drive Flags Text Files With \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d As Copyright Infringements\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nGoogle Drive Flags Text Files With \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d As Copyright Infringements\n\nPolice Drop Criminal Investigation into Pirate Bay Co-Founder\n\nThe Interview Is A Pirate Hit With 200k Downloads (Updated)\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14967\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
