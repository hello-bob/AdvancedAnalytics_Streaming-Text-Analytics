The\nperformance is surprisingly smooth, as web-audio works sparingly with\nresources. The original goal was a 3D animation, but I want Rockr to run\nsmoothly on all devices, even those without a WebGPU.\n\n# Folders and Subfolders\n\nFolder views are now accessible in the songlist. Although plenty of file\nexplorer solutions exist in the npm index, I considered many of them quite\ninvassive regarding the design. So I lent a hand myself.\n\nThe overall design looks a bit \"Mirror's Edgy\" now. Might become even more\nMirror's edgy later on:\n\n# More Tracks\n\n2 more Audiopacks are online: Villians Laughing und Transformer-Soundeffects.\n\nVillians Laughing:\n\n  * Agent_smith\n  * barbossa_and_skeletons\n  * Barney_Stinson\n  * chucky\n  * DarkEmperor\n  * general_grievous\n  * Helmut\n  * Joker\n  * megatron\n  * Mojo_Jojo\n  * Patrick_Star\n  * Peter_Griffin\n  * plancton\n  * Prince\n  * principleSkinner\n  * robot\n  * Spongebob_Dennis\n  * timmys_dad\n  * tom_vs_jerry\n  * Vicky\n\nTransformer Soundeffects:\n\n  * Transformers\\Barricade\n  * Transformers\\Blackout\n  * Transformers\\Bonecrusher\n  * Transformers\\Bumblebee\n  * Transformers\\Frenzy\n  * Transformers\\Ironhide\n  * Transformers\\Jazz\n  * Transformers\\Megatron\n  * Transformers\\OptimusPrime\n  * Transformers\\Ratchet\n  * Transformers\\Starscream\n\n# Mobile Optimizations\n\nThe mobile experience was optimized. The idea with the vertically mirrored\ntexts made sense for my very specific use case, but not for all other use\ncases. The window.trigger events will be adapted as soon as I have completed\nthe optimisations for jQuery Mobile.\n\n# To Dos\n\nAccording to my To Dos, I have achieved all my goals and implemented more\nfeatures than originally planned. New planned features include:\n\n  * [ ] 100+ audio packs\n  * [ ] Cooler audio visualisation\n  * [ ] Provide parameters for sound effects\n  * [ ] Revision of the user interface\n  * [ ] RDF & Sparql implementation\n  * [X] Reiterate on the tracklist\n  * [X] Audio-Visualization\n  * [X] Help Menu\n  * [X] Fonts: Source Code Pro and Orbitron\n  * [X] Responsive\n  * [X] Hotkeys\n  * [X] Metadata\n\nMarkus\n\n04.05.2024\n\nHome\n\nWorks\n\nBlog\n\nAbout\n\nRockr\n\n#Rock n Roll\n\n#Music Production\n\n#Web Development\n\nBack\n\n# Subscribe\n\nGet a mail when I publish a new work\n\n", "frontpage": false}
