For some number of reasons, a lot of\npeople are just resistant to the supply story. To someone seeking anti-supply\ntalking points, it seems like a really good point. I have written a little bit\nbefore about why it really isn\u2019t an informative piece of evidence.\n\nOne thing you\u2019ll commonly see is a chart like Figure 1. It only extends from\n2000, and the y-axis is very truncated. Figure 1 represents about a 5% range\nin scale.\n\nFigure 1\n\nHere, I want to go into household size. Household size is basically the\nflipside of homes per capita. Household size declined sharply from the 1960s\nthrough the 1980s. A small portion of that was due to more adults living\nalone, but almost all of it was due to fewer children (Figure 2).\n\nAlso, you can see here how Figure 1 truncates the y-axis. Average household\nsize is basically the reciprocal of homes per capita. You can see here that if\nFigure 1 was extended to the 1970s, it would look like a flat line since the\n2000s. Though, still it is true that homes per capita is at an all time high\nand average household size is at an all time low.\n\nFigure 2\n\nBasically, adults were becoming a larger portion of the total population, so\nwe had to expand the housing supply much faster than population growth because\nchildren live, dorm style, with their parents, and adults generally live on\ntheir own or with a spouse.\n\nFigure 3 shows the number of new homes (both completions on-site, and\nmanufactured homes shipped) annually, as a percentage of the existing stock of\nhomes. Population growth was about 1% for the whole period from 1965 to 2008,\nbut from the 60s to the 80s, the housing stock was being expanded by 2% or 3%\nannually to house all those extra households.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAfter 2008, population growth dropped to about three-quarters of a percent for\na few years and then after about 2016, dropped again to about a half percent.\nThen it dropped to nearly zero during the pandemic. It has recovered back to\nabout a half percent, and with strong demand for immigration, that seems like\nit is likely to persist for a while. (Obviously there is big talk about that\nin the presidential campaign. I\u2019m not oblivious to that, but I\u2019m not going to\ngo into that here.)\n\nSo, the big numbers of housing production in the 1970s were sort of a one-time\nspike of demand that can\u2019t really happen again and that doesn\u2019t need to be\nrepeated. On the other hand, the chart makes clear how ridiculous the 2000s\nbubble stories are. The housing glut thesis that was canonized was completely\nunempirical. There is nothing in the history of housing markets to suggest\nthat there is some tipping point where demand becomes inelastic in an\noversupplied condition. And if there was, there was nothing about production\nlevels in 2005 that would have triggered such a condition. Americans believed\nsomething that couldn\u2019t possibly be true, and the economics profession, as a\nwhole, was useless as a corrective.\n\nThere was already a regional dearth of housing before 2008, but even with the\ndecline in population growth, the lack of production after 2008 created a\nsizeable national shortage that private forecasters massively undercount. The\nJEC estimated the shortage at 20 million units, which is about where I would\nput it.\n\nBut, wait, if we are short 20 million homes, then how can homes per capita be\nat all time highs?\n\nHomes per capita is at all time highs because a lot of the drop in household\nsize, even recently, was from having fewer children, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4\n\nHousehold size levelled off in the 1990s, and so it has become common for it\nto be treated as a measure that reverts to a constant. Obviously,\nhistorically, in the US, it hasn\u2019t been remotely constant, and\ninternationally, it also changes over time more often than it is stable. This\nis a statistical error. If your model conclusions depend on assuming a\nconstant level of homes per capita then your model isn\u2019t going to be able to\ntell you anything about supply conditions.\n\nAlso, these household size numbers are based on occupied units. Vacant homes\ndon\u2019t contain a household, so they don\u2019t affect the average household size\nmetric. But, since 2008, vacancies have been declining steeply. Lacking\nadequate new construction, we have been harvesting vacant units. Vacancy rates\nare basically down to the minimum functional level now, so there isn\u2019t much\nmore to be utilized there.\n\nIn Figure 5, using Census HVS data, I estimate homes per capita, including\nvacant homes. The \u201cPersons per Occupied Home\u201d and \u201cAdults per Occupied Home\u201d\nmeasures are the measures from the household size data above. The \u201cPersons per\nHome\u201d and \u201cAdults per Home\u201d measures are homes per capita estimates that\ninclude vacant homes.\n\n(You might notice that persons per home has moved up slightly in this chart,\neven though earlier I wrote that persons per home was at an all-time low. In\nthese charts, I estimated population with Census data from table HH-6. Figure\n1 used BEA population estimates. The differences are minor. As I mentioned\nabove, the scale used in Figure 1 is very tight and amplifies very small\nchanges.)\n\nRicher economies have tended to have fewer children. But, richer economies\nalso tend to have more vacant homes - second homes, vacation homes, homes\nrented to travelers, etc. A lot of the supply truther discourse singles all\nthose uses out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a supply problem. If we tax vacancies, keep\nforeigners from buying pieds-\u00e0-terre, and ban Airbnb\u2019s, we\u2019d have plenty of\nhomes.\u201d Those complaints tend to be made with a tone that is in objection to\nsupply-centered narratives, but they really are confirmations of the point\nthat we lack supply. Really, they aren\u2019t economic arguments. They are cultural\narguments. They are simply steps in the process of authoritarian control that\nwould be necessary to maintain the housing deprived status quo. To keep the\nbuilt environment from changing, we need to keep restricting more groups who\nwould use it.\n\nFigure 5\n\nIt\u2019s a reactionary cultural argument masquerading as economics. As I have\nmentioned before, Phoenix, throughout its history, has contained a large\nnumber of seasonally vacant homes. Phoenix grew quickly for decades, when new\nhomes were built at a scale that kept the entire valley affordable. Now that\nwe have cut down many avenues for building, vacancies and alternate uses will\nnaturally be a target for blame, but they\u2019ve been here all along.\n\nThere is no feasible future with affordable housing that doesn\u2019t also include\na lot of new vacant and seasonal homes and homes used lightly by people of\nmeans. Those who aim for the path that includes affordable homes but not other\nhomes will always object to the changes that will be necessary to create\naffordable housing for working class Americans. Some of them are cynically\nmotivated, some are deceived, and some are sincere ideologues. It doesn\u2019t\nreally matter which they are. If they think housing will become more abundant\nand affordable by blocking the wrong kinds of it, they will inevitably not be\nhelpful.\n\nAnyway, on the homes per capita numbers in Figure 5, you can see that persons\nper home and adults per home both continued to decline through the 2000s.\nThen, persons per home levelled off and adults per home actually started to\nrise.\n\nIn the y-axis scale of Figure 2, adults per household looks basically flat.\nBut, in Figure 6, I focus on just that number, with a tighter scale. Adults\nper household (or adults per occupied home) and adults per home (either\noccupied or vacant). Have actually changed quite a bit.\n\nIn Figure 5, you can see that even adults per household has risen since 2008.\nSo, homes per capita is at all time highs because of the declining number of\nchildren. Adults per household bottomed at 1.91 and has increased up to 1.96.\nIn other words, homes per adult is not at all-time highs.\n\nReturning adults per occupied home to 1.91 would call for about 4 million\nunits itself.\n\nFigure 5\n\nBut, remember, many of the new households were occupying formerly vacant\nunits. Vacancies are far too low now. Adults per home bottomed out at about\n1.65 and has risen back up to 1.76. Getting that back to the pre-2008 level\nwould require about 11 million homes.\n\nBut, again, neither adults per household nor adults per home was stable.\nAdults per home had a pretty linear 40-year downslope that would, by now, be\nbelow 1.6 adults per home if those trends had continued. And it would take\nabout 20 million more homes to get in that ballpark.\n\nA lot of those homes would probably be Airbnb\u2019s, seasonal retirement homes in\nthe south, second homes, etc. Being against that is just being against change,\nprogress, shared affluence, and human flourishing. And, in practice, we won\u2019t\neven get adults per occupied home back down to the pre-2008 level if we try to\ndo it by opposing all the \u201cwrong\u201d kinds of housing. There really are two very\ndifferent sides here. The choice between them is not subtle. You can support a\nreturn to affordable housing by supporting all kinds of housing. Or, you can\nblock a return to affordable housing by blocking affordable housing. Or, you\ncan block a return to affordable housing by blocking the \u201cwrong\u201d types of\nhousing.\n\nWe are already 15 years into a cultural and economic battle that is so\nimportant, it turned the direction of adults per house upward for, likely, the\nfirst time since the start of the industrial revolution. Fifteen years in, by\nthat measure, we have reversed economic progress by nearly 40 years. There is\nso much ground we have to make up. And, also, the reactionary position will\nhave to continue to dig deeper and get worse - rounding up immigrants, blaming\nthe homeless, stoking fear and distrust of financial institutions. I\u2019m sorry\nif I\u2019m sounding too shrill. It all happens in slow motion around us, so we\nadapt to the new normal. But the tent encampments in all the urban parks are a\nlong way from what should be considered normal. We are already deeply into a\ncultural battle. And you can see that it is a cultural battle, because it is\ndifficult to simply establish a plurality of support to admit obvious things.\n\nIf this continues, it will destroy the fabric of mutual trust that has managed\nto miraculously hold this country together for 250 years. The challenge is to\nopen the eyes of enough victims of these policy choices that 50%+1 of the\ncountry can address it on the empirical level rather than the aesthetic level,\nand to stop this devolution before it gets worse.\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Household Size and the Housing Stock\n\nkevinerdmann.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Housing Shortage Is Larger Than You Think: Part 2\n\nLance Lambert reported on a couple of different pieces of housing analytics\nthat make for an interesting pairing, when you put on the EHT-colored...\n\nDec 19, 2023 \u2022\n\nKevin Erdmann\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Housing Shortage Is Larger Than You Think: Part 2\n\nkevinerdmann.substack.com\n\n2\n\n\"Rising Home Prices Are Mostly from Rising Rents\"\n\nThe First of a Series of Papers at Mercatus\n\nAug 21, 2022 \u2022\n\nKevin Erdmann\n\n13\n\nShare this post\n\n#### \"Rising Home Prices Are Mostly from Rising Rents\"\n\nkevinerdmann.substack.com\n\n21\n\nMarket Power in Housing Construction\n\nPart 1 of a Cantankerous 3 part series.\n\nFeb 21 \u2022\n\nKevin Erdmann\n\n23\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Market Power in Housing Construction\n\nkevinerdmann.substack.com\n\n12\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Kevin Erdmann\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
