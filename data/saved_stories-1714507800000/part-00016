But attorneys for the hotel chain admitted in\nan April 10 hearing that it had never used AES-128 during the time of the\nbreach.\n\nIn fact, it hadn\u2019t been using any encryption at all at the time but rather had\nbeen using secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1), which is a hashing mechanism and\nnot encryption.\n\nDuring the hearing of the US District Court for the District of Maryland\nSouthern Division, Judge John Preston Bailey ordered Marriott \u201cto correct any\ninformation on its website within seven days.\u201d\n\nMarriott did not issue a news release, nor did it flag the change on its\nhomepage. Instead, it added two sentences to a page on its website from Jan.\n4, 2019. The only way for consumers, shareholders, reporters or anyone else to\nsee it is if they happened to click on the five-year-old page.\n\n0 seconds of 37 minutes, 14 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n37:14\n\n37:14\n\nThe two-sentence update reads: \u201cFollowing an investigation with several\nleading data security experts, Marriott initially determined that the payment\ncard numbers and certain passport numbers in the database tables involved in\nthe Starwood database security incident that Marriott reported on November 30,\n2018, were protected using Advanced Encryption Standard 128 encryption\n(AES-128). Marriott has now determined that the payment card numbers and some\nof the passport numbers in those tables were instead protected with a\ndifferent cryptographic method known as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1).\u201d\n\n## Marriott has not said why it erroneously stated it had used AES-128\n\nMarriott has thus far not answered any of the critical questions surrounding\nthe admission. What made the company initially think that it had used AES-128,\nassuming that it did indeed believe that? After forensic investigations by\noutside firms \u2014 including Accenture, Verizon, and CrowdStrike \u2014 how did no one\nnotice that there in fact had been no encryption in place? And if they did\nnotice, why was Marriott repeating the false encryption claim? Perhaps most\nimportantly, when and how did Marriott discover the truth?\n\nDouglas Brush, a special master with the US federal courts and the chief\nvisionary officer for Accel Consulting who is not working on the Marriott\ncase, said this twist from Marriott has potentially serious implications for\nthe enterprise. Beyond Marriott, it illustrates some of the dangers associated\nwith any false claims in a breach case.\n\n\u201cDid Marriott make material misrepresentations to their underwriters to obtain\ncoverage before and during the event to cover the losses? If Marriott did\nindeed make material misrepresentations, it would constitute a clear violation\nof the contract with the carrier. This could potentially lead to the carrier\nsuing for recovery on the coverages,\u201d Brush said. \u201cAdditionally, as part of\nthe M&A due diligence, who the heck said there was a certain encryption\nstandard in place around the data? Buyer, seller, both? This now brings in SEC\nissues because the due diligence missed something that now has a long tail and\nsignificant material impact. Further, if this gets noticed and pressed, will\nit impact the 2024 stock prices and be an 8-K disclosure?\u201d\n\nAs of March 2019, the company had reported $28 million in expenses related to\nthe breach.\n\n## AES-128 and SHA-1 are two very different security approaches\n\nBrush added that the technical nature of these two very different security\napproaches (AES-128 and SHA-1) raises questions over how it could have\npossibly been missed that encryption was not in place. For example, when\nMarriott purchased the systems from Starwood, it would have had to integrate\nthe two systems. \u201cTo integrate the systems, you had to have known the\nencryption scheme,\u201d Brush said.\n\n#### Explore related questions\n\n  * When did Marriott discover the truth about its encryption methods?\n  * How do data breaches impact a company's stock prices?\n  * How do data security experts investigate breaches like Marriott's?\n  * How do data breaches affect consumer trust in a company?\n  * How do companies typically respond to data breaches, and what are the best practices?\n\nWhen asked to make a security comparison between AES-128 and SHA-1, Fuad\nHamidli \u2014 a cryptographer and senior lecturer with the New Jersey Institute of\nTechnology \u2014 said \u201cSHA-1 is not secure. It is broken\u201d and that SHA-1 \u201cis bad\nbecause it is not secure from a cryptographic perspective. I don\u2019t know of any\nalgorithm that can break AES-128. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to protect data\nwith SHA-1.\u201d\n\nPhil Smith, who builds encryption products as the encryption product manager\nfor Open Text, agreed with Hamidli\u2019s assessment. \u201cYou are not going to brute\nforce an AES-128. You can crack SHA-1 in less than an hour.\u201d\n\n## Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the misidentification thwarted fraud-finding\nefforts\n\nAttorneys for consumers suing Marriott argued to Judge Bailey that the new\ninformation is serious because it is well accepted that SHA-1 is not\nencryption but rather a hashing algorithm that can be hacked very quickly. \u201cIn\nfact, card brands don\u2019t even allow you to protect information using that kind\nof algorithm,\u201d attorney Amy Keller said.\n\n\u201cAnd then the other issue is Marriott said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry because we\u2019ve found\nno widespread evidence of fraud.\u2019 The problem with that statement is it\nignores the fact that when you tell people certain information is encrypted,\ntwo things happen. The first is that card brands like Mastercard and VISA stop\ninvestigating for widespread fraud. So, if the card brand determined that\nwidespread fraud could not have happened because the information was\nencrypted, and so the kind of information that they were looking for is now\nlost forever because that was five years ago.\u201d\n\nIn a court filing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel added that a declaration from liability\nexpert Mary Frantz stated that the protection of payment card data through\nSHA-1 is functionally the same as no encryption, \u201cas any hacker using a modern\nlaptop could have revealed the payment card and passport numbers exfiltrated\nfrom Marriott\u2019s database.\u201d\n\n## Marriott disagrees that the issue is serious and information has been lost\n\nLisa Ghannoum, representing Marriott, disagreed with Keller\u2019s contentions,\nincluding that information has been lost. \u201cThat is simply not the case,\u201d\nGhannoum said. \u201cThe relevant parties are preserving information. In fact, the\nplaintiffs asked the defendants to preserve information and we agreed to that.\nWe would have done it anyway. The notion that information has been lost\nforever is simply not accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cVerizon, an independent third party, came to the same conclusion that\nMarriott initially had, that data in these involved tables were protected by\nAES-128 encryption, as did Marriott\u2019s other technical experts, including\nCrowdStrike. It worked with a specialized team in response,\u201d Ghannoum said.\n\u201cIt was only recently that Marriott had reason to question that. It moved with\nall due speed in order to verify whether or not that was the case, and as soon\nas it realized that there was a correction needed, it made that correction.\u201d\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news\n\n#### UnitedHealth hackers exploited Citrix vulnerabilities, CEO to testify\n\nIn the written testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CEO\nAndrew Witty said after gaining access, the threat actor moved laterally\nwithin the systems using sophisticated methods and exfiltrated data.\n\nBy Prasanth Aby Thomas\n\nApr 30, 2024 3 mins\n\nHacker Groups Cyberattacks Vulnerabilities\n\n  * news\n\n#### Most attacks affecting SMBs target five older vulnerabilities\n\nAttackers target flaws for a reason: Even years after they are discovered,\nthey still work.\n\nBy John Dunn\n\nApr 30, 2024 4 mins\n\nThreat and Vulnerability Management Network Security Vulnerabilities\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### Close the barn door now!
