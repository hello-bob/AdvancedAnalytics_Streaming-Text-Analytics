Whenever. Wherever.\n\nDosu works around the clock so you don't have to. Dosu responds in the user's\nnative language within minutes. Our AI-powered engine often solves the problem\non the spot, closing issues before you even see them!\n\nNo more stale issues.\n\nLike any good baker, Dosu knows the moment something goes stale. Dosu keeps a\nwatchful eye on open issues, resolving those that you might have missed and\ndeprecating issues that no longer exist. It'll even ask you if it's not sure.\n\nKeep best practices in practice.\n\nRemember those style guides that you wrote three years ago? No? Well, Dosu\ndoes. Dosu understands rules and guidelines in a way that only a human can,\nbut enforces them in a way that only a machine can, keeping your code up to\nyour standards.\n\nAutomatic documentation.\n\nDosu is a wizard when it comes to documentation, even when there is none. Not\nonly will it remind you to update your documentation and help you write it,\nbut Dosu can also ride shotgun as you code that next big feature, answering\nquestions about external code as if you're sitting next to the author.\n\n4000+ issues resolved by Dosu\n\nDosu has already helped thousands of developers.\n\n  * Overseeing a popular open source repo can be a monumental task. We field close to 100 issues per day, and the ground work that Dosu does keeps our team feeling organized and focused on the real work.\n\nJacob Lee\n\nFounding Engineer, Langchain\n\n  * As a fast-growing startup, Quivr's user onboarding experience is constantly changing, but it's still important that we make a strong first impression. That's where Dosu helps by shepherding new users through the onboarding process, answering questions along the way. It's faster than we can be, and speaks every language. Not bad.\n\nStan Girard\n\nCEO/Founder of Quivr\n\ncoming soon\n\nSlack, Linear, Jira & Zendesk integrations\n\nDosu will be able to integrate with all of your favorite tools very soon.\n\nTrusted by a global community of developers\n\n5955+\n\nRepos Dosu is installed on\n\n25k+\n\nusers Dosu has helped\n\n14+\n\nlanguages Dosu speaks\n\n  * Guido Rietbroek\n\nSuperb and helpful.
