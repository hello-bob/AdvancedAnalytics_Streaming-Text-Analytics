As\nwe've seen in the past, the Pro series is based on AMD's existing consumer-\noriented processor models but comes with additional features that tailor them\nfor the commercial market. With the consumer versions of these processors, AMD\nwas the first x86 company to bring its AI-processing neural processing unit\n(NPU) to the mobile and desktop PC market. Those same AI acceleration features\nare now headed to commercial users, allowing AMD to lay claim to being the\nfirst with professional CPUs armed with NPUs for laptops and workstations.\n\nImage 1 of 8\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\nAMD's in-built XNDA engine powers the NPU, and the company touts that its\nmobile processors have an advantage over Intel's competing Core Ultra\nprocessors with 16 TOPS of NPU performance, outperforming the Meteor Lake\nNPU's 11 TOPS. AMD also maintains a slimmer lead in overall system TOPS, which\nincludes both the CPU and GPU AI processing power, taking the lead with 39\nTOPS over Intel's 34 TOPS. AMD's desktop Ryzen 8000 APUs also have an in-built\nNPU engine that delivers 16 TOPS, whereas Intel has yet to release a processor\nfor desktop PCs with an integrated AI engine.\n\nNotably, neither AMD nor Intel's chips meet Microsoft's next-gen AI PC\nrequirement for 45 TOPS of performance from the NPU, though both companies say\ntheir next-gen chips, Strix Point and Lunar Lake, respectively, will meet that\nbar. The 45 TOPS requirement is meant to enable Microsoft to run AI elements\nof Copilot locally, and it isn't clear how a future Windows update to enable\nthat functionality will pan out with the current generations of AMD and Intel\nprocessors. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite Arm chips will debut with 45 TOPS of\nperformance from its NPU in the middle of the year. Apple's M3 processors\nprovide 18 TOPS of NPU performance but obviously aren't impacted by\nMicrosoft's requirements.\n\nThe ability to run AI workloads locally helps alleviate critical privacy\nconcerns in the commercial space. It also delivers latency, performance, and\nbattery life advantages for AI applications (power efficiency is dramatically\nbetter with the NPU than running the same AI workload on the GPU). However,\nunleashing that performance requires tightly coupled software solutions, and\nin many respects, the early war for AI dominance will come down to developer\npartnerships.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nThe AI ecosystem is still raw as developers work to leverage NPU acceleration\nin their products, but AMD, Microsoft, and others are working to build the\nfoundations that will enable a broad swath of AI-accelerated features in\nsoftware and Windows. AMD cites that it will have 150+ ISV (independent\nsoftware vendor) partnerships to develop AI-driven solutions in 2024, in\ncontrast to Intel's broadening AI Developer Program, which has 100 ISV and\n100+ IHV (integrated hardware vendor) partnerships thus far.\n\nNaturally, unleashing the power of locally-run AI starts with the hardware.\nLet's take a closer look at the silicon.\n\n## AMD Ryzen Pro 8040-series processors\n\nImage 1 of 9\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\nAs noted, the Ryzen Pro 8040-series processors are based on the consumer-\noriented 'Hawk Point' processors \u2014 you can learn the details of this Zen\n4-powered lineup here. The U-series processors slot in for the 15-28W TDP\nrange, while the HS variants are carved into 20-28W and 35-54W swimlanes\nspanning the Ryzen 9, 7, and 5 product lines, with the 45W models geared for\nworkstations.\n\nCore counts range from six cores and 12 threads with Ryzen 5 up to eight cores\nand 16 threads with Ryzen 7 and 9. Peak clock rates remain the same as the\nconsumer variants. Notably, the Ryzen 5 Pro 8540U comes without an integrated\nNPU, just like the consumer variant. All other key criteria, like clock\nspeeds, iGPU, and cache, remain the same.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

The company\nalso claims an 18% average advantage over the 28W Core Ultra 7 165H.\n\nAMD also says its 45W Ryzen 9 Pro 8945HS for workstations delivers a 50%+\nadvantage in the Topaz Labs AI-powered video application over the 45W Intel\nCore Ultra 9 185H and up to 77% faster time to the first token with the Llama\n2 LLM. AMD also shared benchmarks with a wider range of AI models, like facial\nand object recognition, among others. Claimed performance advantages range\nfrom 5% to 23% across a spate of more general CPU-centric applications.\n\nThe company also claims a 46% battery life advantage over the Intel Core Ultra\n7 165H during a Teams workflow and a slight advantage over the Apple M3 Pro\nCPU. However, the Apple processor is missing from any of AMD's direct\nperformance comparisons.\n\n## AMD Ryzen Pro 8000-series APUs\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\nThe Ryzen Pro 8000-series for desktop PCs is built upon the foundation of the\npowerful 8000G APU series for the consumer market, which you can read more\nabout here and here. All of these models have an in-built NPU AI acceleration\nengine.\n\nOnce again, all relevant specs remain identical to the consumer models, with\noptions spanning from four cores and eight threads up to eight cores and 16\nthreads across the Ryzen Pro 3, 5, and 7 families. The standard 8000G models\nhave a configurable 45-65W TDP range, whereas the GE models slot in for a\nlower-power 35W TDP.\n\nOverall, AMD claims a 19% average uplift over Intel's competing Core i7-14700,\nwith a peak of a 3X advantage in the Time Spy graphics benchmark. That isn't\nsurprising, given the powerful combination of the Zen 4 CPU with the RDNA 3\ngraphics engine. AMD also claims from 33% to 76% less power consumption across\na span of different configurations.\n\n## AMD Ryzen Pro Technologies\n\nImage 1 of 9\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\n(Image credit: AMD )\n\nThe integrated AMD Pro Technologies suite is the key difference between AMD's\nPro models and its standard consumer chips. This hardware and software suite\nincludes features like AMD Pro Security, which includes multiple layers of\nsecurity that leverage proprietary OEM solutions and in-built Windows 11\nfeatures, AMD memory guard, Microsoft Pluton, and the AMD Secure processor.\nThe 8000-series family marks the first desktop PCs to integrate Microsoft\nPluton security functionality and cloud-based remote manageability.\n\nThe AMD Pro Manageability features simplify provisioning, system imaging, and\ndeployment tasks, while the AMD Pro Business Ready suite ensures stability and\nincludes a quality and reliability guarantee. AMD points out that it offers\nthe full suite of Pro Technologies on all of its processor models, whereas\nIntel bifurcates support for segmentation purposes.\n\nAMD's OEM platforms have a range of refreshed products built on the\nunderpinnings of the 8040- and 8000-series processors. The Ryzen Pro series is\navailable to AMD's OEM partners now.\n\nPaul Alcorn\n\nManaging Editor: News and Emerging Tech\n\nPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware\nUS.
