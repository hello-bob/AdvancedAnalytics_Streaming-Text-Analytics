On the one hand, it is hard not to hear\nsuch news and think that it is another sign that ham radio isn\u2019t in a healthy\nspace. After all, in an ideal world, [Martin Jue] \u2014 the well-known founder of\nMFJ \u2014 would have found an anxious buyer. Not only is the MFJ line of ham radio\ngear well regarded, but [Martin] had bought other ham radio-related companies\nover the years, such as Ameritron, Hygain, Cushcraft, Mirage, and Vectronics.\nNow, they will all be gone, too.\n\nHowever, on a deeper reflection, maybe we shouldn\u2019t see it as another nail in\nham radio\u2019s coffin. It is this way in every industry. There was a time when it\nwas hard to imagine ham radio without, say, Heathkit. Yet they left, and the\nhobby continued. We could name a slew of other iconic companies that had their\nday: Eico, Hammarlund, Hallicrafters, and more. They live on at hamfests,\ntheir product lines are frozen in time, and we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll see a used market\nfor MFJ gear well into the next century.\n\nMaybe you aren\u2019t a ham and wonder why you would care. Turns out MFJ made\nthings of interest to anyone who worked with RF transmitting or receiving. If\nyou were a shortwave listener, they had antennas and related gear for you.\nThey also made antenna analyzers and network analyzers that were very cost-\neffective compared to other options. If you wanted clean power supplies, MFJ\nhad quite the selection of those. They even had a great selection of variable\ncapacitors and inductors, which are tough to find in small quantities. You\ncould even get air-wound coil stock, knobs, meters, and toroids.\n\nSure, most of what they sold was things only hams or other radio operators\nwanted\u2014that was the nature of the company. But their loss will be felt by more\nthan just the ham community. Someone, of course, will step into the void as\nthey always do.\n\nSo farewell MFJ. We will miss you, but we look forward to meeting your\nreplacement, whoever that might be. While you can spend a lot of money on ham\nradio, you can get started for $50 or less. Oddly, we haven\u2019t directly\nfeatured much MFJ gear on Hackaday over the years, but we have mentioned a\nfew.\n\nPosted in NewsTagged ham radio, mfj\n\n## 24 thoughts on \u201cFarewell MFJ\u201d\n\n  1. CJay says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 4:27 am\n\nBack in the days when Heahtkit shut down there were a lot of competitors to\nfill the gap left.\n\nMFJ occupy a larger space with a wider range of goodies so their closure will\nleave a *huge* gap in the market and I\u2019m really not sure there\u2019s any one\ncompany can fill it so I think we\u2019re going to lose a lot of the niche products\nMFJ produce which is a real shame.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of people out there who will slate them and there are a few\nproducts in their lineup which have a rep for poor build quality (not\nexperiences it personally) but it\u2019s an iconic brand which really seems to\ncare.\n\nMy own experience of them was of always excellent and friendly service, only a\nyear or so ago I needed a couple of \u2018keycaps\u2019 for an MFJ 259 analyser, I was\nfully willing to pay but they insisted not and shipped them for free from the\nUS to the UK bundled in with a printed catalogue which is filled with all\nsorts of stuff I just didn\u2019t know they sold, very reminiscent of the joy of\nthe Radioshack or Maplin catalogues.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Generally the un-willingness of the\nowners to evolve into what the market is buying now, is what causes them to go\nout of business.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

There is certainly innovation\nin amateur radio, but not so much in the segment MFJ operated in.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  4. bstriggo says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 5:37 am\n\nMy first thought was that the demise of Hygain and Cushcraft would leave an\nirrepairable hole in the beam antenna supply. A quick google search reveals a\nnumber of suppliers posed to fill the gap. Life goes on.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have put off ordering that replacement IF xformer for my MFJ Cub,\nthough.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  5.

I got to meet him a few Dayton trips in the\npast and thanked him many a time for his ingenuity. It all started with a CW\nfilter that set him up until now. I still wanted to get an ALS-600 for the\nhouse (and get some help to raise my antennas). Thank you, once again Mr.\nJue...your legacy lives on with many in the Ham community. 73 de KC8KVA\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  6.

Ham radio for me has always been about\nexperimentation and technical ability, and that seems to have been lost these\ndays. The cool thing about MFJ stuff was that you could open the box and\ntinker if you needed to do that. The current \u2018trend\u2019 if you will seems to be\nabout appliance operation. Plug the rig in, turn it on, and smack the crap out\nof the local repeater. Boom, you\u2019re a ham! You may not know SWR from SWL, but\nby golly you can talk anywhere with your Baofeng! So MFJ will be missed, if\nfor no other reason than I learned so much from tinkering with their gear.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Please let me educate you.\n\nThe reason why hardware-solutions are dying out is because the current\ngeneration has lost the touch to it.\n\nSimilarly how the last generation(s) lost touch to tube era technology. It\u2019s\nnot lack of interest or fascination, though. They\u2019re being alienated to it,\nsimply.\n\nKids these days grow up with digital technology and don\u2019t even really know\nphysical electronics anymore. In fact, we can be glad if they can handle real\ndesktop PCs, still.\n\nSo it\u2019s only natural that they keep a distant to bare metal electronics. They\nknow about programming languages and libraries, but not about ohm\u2019s law.\nTransistors? Resistors? Diodes? What are they?!\n\nHowever, if they have a chance to play with electro-mechanical relays or see\nthem in action, they\u2019re absolutely interested!\n\nIt just needs people to de-mystify analog electeonics a bit. So they can have\ntheir own experience of success.\n\nOnce they realize they have the power to make something work without the help\nof an microcontroller or a computer, they surely will occasionally make use of\ntheir new skills.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    3. Joshua says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 2:43 pm\n\n\u201cPlug the rig in, turn it on, and smack the crap out of the local repeater. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really VHF/UHF that\u2019s the problem, but the ongoing \u201csport\u201d craze on\nthe poor shortwave, I think.\n\nBecause, especially the VHF/UHF amateurs used to be modern back in the\n60s/70s. These were the ones that were part of the early days of microcomputer\nhistory, when people met in computer clubs and did make homebrew stuff. The\nshortwave freaks of the day didn\u2019t even notice and were deeply stuck in the\npast. They had their mechanical telex machines, at best.\n\nBut back on topic. As correctly stated, amateur radio was about fascination,\nexperiments and making friends over the air waves.\n\nThings like CW, Contest and FT8 are all about dipomas and self-esteem. It\u2019s\nthat elitism and greed that\u2019s disgusting, I think.\n\nIn these days, amateur radio must be exciting again. Experiments with new\nfields, like lasers or microwave links. Or underwater communication. Or geo-\nstationary satellites. Something fresh and new.\n\nF*ck shortwave and the jerks operating there. They can continue this hobby in\ntheir retirement homes.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m somewhat annoyed by those contesters that ruin every weekend,\nwhen normal people have their freetime. They just waste spectrum space for\ntheir own amusement, without taking care of others. It\u2019s amateur radio of its\nworst. They\u2019re shameful.\n\nThat\u2019s no wonder why laymen question why radio amateurs have so many rights.\nTo the laymen, it\u2019s not understandable why precious frequencies are being\ngiven away to hobbyists for no reason.\n\nIn the past, the legitimation for this was that amateur radio was experimental\nradio. Amateurs were doing a bit of research everytime they were on the air\nwaves, so everyone dud benefit from a radio amateur\u2019s activity. Things like\nobserving propagation of radio waves. Or studying atmospheric interference.\n\nThese things still exist, sure. There are reverse beacon projects, for\nexample. But what about the typical ham?\n\nHe\u2019s gotten a lazy consumer with its 817 or UV-5 on his desk. When he \u201cbuilts\nsomething himself\u201d, it\u2019s something like a primtive USB-soundcard to UV-5 cable\nor a poorly made antenna.\n\nAll of this makes me very sad, because it\u2019s not a technical problem, but a\nproblem of bad character and attitude. All the modern technology on this world\ncan\u2019t fix the people.\n\nEspecially the old ones are to be blamed, I think. Not all of them, of course,\nbut many of them. It was their duty to keep the flame burning, rather than\npassing on the ashes. But they got lazy, started to rest on their existing\nglory of days gone bye.\n\nOr worse, they began to make fun of their younger selves, threw their old\nstuff away and said \u201cnow I do have something better than what I had back\nthen\u201d. That way, they\u2019re basically discouraging the youth to step into their\nfootsteps. Such old fools. *sigh*\n\nThese oldtimers were the first to give a way homebrew radios and equipment for\nshiny new radios from the catalog. They essentially created the industry of\nclosed-platform radios that can\u2019t be repaired or modified anymore.\n\nThey have bought those closed radios for years, so that Yaesu, Kenwood, Icom\nand other manufacturers continued more and more to make consumer radios rather\nthan amateur radios.\n\nTwo or three decades ago, amateurs should have started to boycott radio\ntransceivers that couldn\u2019t be seviced, repaired and modified anymore (space\ninside the chassis for custom circuit boards).\n\nAmateurs should have stood up and say no. They should have stayed true to\ntheir amateur nature, true to their principles. But it didn\u2019t happen. And so\nradio amateurs made themselves replaceable and irrelevant.\n\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion, of course. As a CBer I can\u2019t speak for the\namateurs, also. It\u2019s just sad what happened to the ham spirit. If only a few\nwould act in a way being defined in that code of honor.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    4.

I think it\u2019s an overabundance of supply. $25 new 2 meter\nhandhelds, SDR everything and digital modes could mean the market doesn\u2019t have\nroom for the MFJ line anymore.

My antenna analyzer\nseems to work OK, but now, for almost the same price, I can get a VNA from\nAliExpress.\n\nThey bought Cushcraft, who made decent antennas, so I\u2019ll miss that. Their\npower supplies were a bit on the expensive side. But they were a reliable and\nreasonably priced source, even if the quality was...variable. I do think they\nused their position as the only supplier of ham radio basics to keep their\nprices up, but then, demand was always going to be low, so...\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
