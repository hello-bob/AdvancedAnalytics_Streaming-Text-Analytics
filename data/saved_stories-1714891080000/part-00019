He\nfounded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The\nVerge in 2012.\n\nMay 3, 2024, 3:46 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: Laura Normand / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft is overhauling its security processes after a series of high-profile\nattacks in recent years. Security is now Microsoft\u2019s \u201ctop priority,\u201d the\ncompany outlined today in response to ongoing questions about its security\npractices and the US Cyber Safety Review Board\u2019s labeling of Microsoft\u2019s\nsecurity culture as \u201cinadequate.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is now making it clear to every employee that\nsecurity should be prioritized above all else. The Verge has obtained a memo\nfrom Nadella to Microsoft\u2019s more than 200,000 employees, where he discusses\nthe new security overhaul and how the company is learning from attackers to\nimprove its security processes. Nadella also makes it explicitly clear that\nemployees should not make security tradeoffs:\n\n> If you\u2019re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority,\n> your answer is clear: Do security. In some cases, this will mean\n> prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new\n> features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems. This is key to\n> advancing both our platform quality and capability such that we can protect\n> the digital estates of our customers and build a safer world for all.\n\nNadella wants Microsoft employees to approach the challenge of overhauling\nsecurity \u201cwith both technical and operational rigor,\u201d even looking at every\nline of code as an opportunity to improve Microsoft\u2019s security. \u201cIt\u2019s\neveryone\u2019s top priority and our customers\u2019 greatest need,\u201d says Nadella.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Microsoft overhaul treats security as \u2018top priority\u2019 after a series of failures\n  * Microsoft needs to win back trust\n  * Microsoft could have prevented Chinese cloud email hack, US cyber report says\n  * Microsoft says Russian hackers stole source code after spying on its executives\n  * Microsoft is overhauling its software security after major Azure cloud attacks\n\nInterestingly, Nadella also mentions prioritizing security over supporting\nlegacy systems. Microsoft has a long history of supporting its software\nproducts for many years past the norm, sometimes even extending this to\ndecades of support or compatibility. Nadella drops a small hint here that the\ncompany may need to alter this approach for a secure future.\n\nMicrosoft has faced a series of security issues in recent years. Chinese\ngovernment hackers targeted Microsoft Exchange servers with zero-day exploits\nin early 2021, enabling them to access email accounts and install malware on\nservers hosted by businesses. Last year, Chinese hackers breached US\ngovernment emails thanks to a Microsoft Cloud exploit. Recently, the same\nRussian state-sponsored hackers that were behind the SolarWinds incident,\nknown as Nobelium or Midnight Blizzard, were able to spy on the email accounts\nof some members of Microsoft\u2019s senior leadership team last year and even steal\nsource code earlier this year.\n\nYou can read more about Microsoft\u2019s big overhaul and the security challenges\nthe company has faced in recent years. Nadella\u2019s full memo is also below.\n\n> Today, I want to talk about something critical to our company\u2019s future:\n> prioritizing security above all else.\n>\n> Microsoft runs on trust, and our success depends on earning and maintaining\n> it. We have a unique opportunity and responsibility to build the most secure\n> and trusted platform that the world innovates upon.\n>\n> The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cyber Safety\n> Review Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023,\n> underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers,\n> as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly\n> sophisticated threat actors.\n>\n> Last November, we launched our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) with this\n> responsibility in mind, bringing together every part of the company to\n> advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy\n> infrastructure. I\u2019m proud of this initiative, and grateful for the work that\n> has gone into implementing it. But we must and will do more.\n>\n> Going forward, we will commit the entirety of our organization to SFI, as we\n> double down on this initiative with an approach grounded in three core\n> principles:\n>\n> \u2022 Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or\n> service.\n>\n> \u2022 Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by\n> default, require no extra effort, and are not optional.\n>\n> \u2022 Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be\n> improved to meet current and future threats.\n>\n> These principles will govern every facet of our SFI pillars as we: Protect\n> Identities and Secrets, Protect Tenants and Isolate Production Systems,\n> Protect Networks, Protect Engineering Systems, Monitor and Detect Threats,\n> and Accelerate Response and Remediation. We\u2019ve shared specific, company-wide\n> actions each of these pillars will entail - including those recommended in\n> the CSRB\u2019s report which you can learn about here. Across Microsoft, we will\n> mobilize to implement and operationalize these standards, guidelines, and\n> requirements and this will be an added dimension of our hiring and rewards\n> decisions. In addition, we will instill accountability by basing part of the\n> compensation of the senior leadership team on our progress towards meeting\n> our security plans and milestones.\n>\n> We must approach this challenge with both technical and operational rigor,\n> and with a focus on continuous improvement. Every task we take on - from a\n> line of code, to a customer or partner process \u2013 is an opportunity to help\n> bolster our own security and that of our entire ecosystem. This includes\n> learning from our adversaries and the increasing sophistication of their\n> capabilities, as we did with Midnight Blizzard. And learning from the\n> trillions of unique signals we\u2019re constantly monitoring to strengthen our\n> overall posture. It also includes stronger, more structured collaboration\n> across the public and private sector.\n>\n> Security is a team sport, and accelerating SFI isn\u2019t just job number one for\n> our security teams \u2014 it\u2019s everyone\u2019s top priority and our customers\u2019\n> greatest need.\n>\n> If you\u2019re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority,\n> your answer is clear: Do security. In some cases, this will mean\n> prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new\n> features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.
