After on- and off-\ncampus groups criticized the decision and the university said it received\nthreats, it pulled her from the graduation speakers schedule.\n\n(Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)\n\nBy Jaweed Kaleem\n\nStaff WriterFollow\n\nApril 15, 2024 7:40 PM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nSaying \u201ctradition must give way to safety,\u201d USC on Monday made the\nunprecedented move of canceling the upcoming graduation speech of an\nundergraduate valedictorian who has come under fire for her pro-Palestinian\nviews.\n\nThe move, according to USC officials, is the first time the university has\nkept a valedictorian from the traditional chance to speak onstage at the\nannual commencement ceremony, which typically draws more than 65,000 people to\nthe Los Angeles campus.\n\nIn a campuswide letter, USC Provost Andrew T. Guzman cited unnamed threats\nthat have poured in shortly after the university publicized the\nvaledictorian\u2019s name and biography this month. Guzman said attacks against the\nstudent for her pro-Palestinian views have reached an \u201calarming tenor\u201d and\n\u201cescalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and\ndisruption at commencement\u201d in May.\n\nCalifornia\n\n### Berkeley schools chief will testify at congressional hearing over\nantisemitism charges\n\nEnikia Ford Morthel, the superintendent of Berkeley Unified School District,\nwill testify in May in front of a congressional committee on charges of\nantisemitism in her schools.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, we have decided that our student valedictorian\nwill not deliver a speech at commencement. ... There is no free-speech\nentitlement to speak at a commencement. The issue here is how best to maintain\ncampus security and safety, period,\u201d Guzman wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe student, whom the letter does not name, is biomedical engineering major\nAsna Tabassum. USC officials chose Tabassum from nearly 100 student applicants\nwho had GPAs of 3.98 or higher.\n\nBut after USC President Carol Folt announced her selection, a swarm of on- and\noff-campus groups attacked Tabassum. They targeted her minor, resistance to\ngenocide, as well as her pro-Palestinian views and \u201clikes\u201d expressed through\nher Instagram account.\n\nWe Are Tov, a group that uses the Hebrew word for \u201cgood\u201d and describes itself\nas \u201cdedicated to combating antisemitism,\u201d posted Tabassum\u2019s image on its\nInstagram account and said she \u201copenly promotes antisemitic writings.\u201d The\ngroup also criticized Tabassum for liking Instagram posts from another group,\nTrojans for Palestine. Tabassum\u2019s Instagram bio links to a landing page that\nsays \u201clearn about what\u2019s happening in Palestine, and how to help.\u201d\n\nThe campus group Trojans for Israel also posted on its Instagram account,\ncalling for Folt\u2019s \u201creconsideration\u201d of Tabassum for what it described as her\n\u201cantisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.\u201d The group said Tabassum\u2019s Instagram\nbio linked to a page that called Zionism a \u201cracist settler-colonial ideology.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\n\n### \u2018I can\u2019t focus on anything but rage.\u2019 Pro-Palestinian protests roil elite\nPomona College\n\nClaremont Colleges students and faculty rallied on campus less than a week\nafter 19 students were arrested for occupying the Pomona College president\u2019s\noffice.\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nIn a statement, Tabassum opposed the decision, saying USC has \u201cabandoned\u201d her.\n\n\u201cAlthough this should have been a time of celebration for my family, friends,\nprofessors, and classmates, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have\nsubjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising\nbelief in human rights for all,\u201d said Tabassum, who is Muslim.\n\n\u201cThis campaign to prevent me from addressing my peers at commencement has\nevidently accomplished its goal: today, USC administrators informed me that\nthe university will no longer allow me to speak at commencement due to\nsupposed security concerns,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am both shocked by this decision and profoundly disappointed that the\nuniversity is succumbing to a campaign of hate meant to silence my voice. I am\nnot surprised by those who attempt to propagate hatred. I am surprised that my\nown university\u2014my home for four years\u2014has abandoned me.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Guzman said the university has been \u201cin close contact with\nthe student\u201d and would \u201cprovide her support.\u201d He added that \u201cwe weren\u2019t\nseeking her opinion\u201d on the cancellation.\n\n\u201cThis is a security decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about the identity of the\nspeaker, it\u2019s not about the things the valedictorian has said in the past. We\nhave to put as our top priority ensuring that the campus and community is\nsafe.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\n\n### \u2018Please leave!\u2019 A Jewish UC Berkeley dean confronts pro-Palestinian\nactivist at his home\n\nUC Berkeley professor Erwin Chemerinsky and his wife, professor Catherine\nFisk, got into a heated argument with a pro-Palestinian protester during a\ndinner at their home.\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nAnother campus official who was part of the decision, Erroll Southers, said\nthreats came in via email, phone calls and letters. Southers is USC\u2019s\nassociate senior vice president for safety and risk assurance.\n\nIndividuals \u201csay they will come to campus as early as this week,\u201d Southers\nsaid. He did not elaborate.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups, including the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on\nAmerican-Islamic Relations, have called for USC to reinvite Tabassum to speak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUSC cannot hide its cowardly decision behind a disingenuous concern for\n\u2018security,\u2019\u201d CAIR-LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.\n\nIn another statement, the USC Palestine Justice Faculty Group said it\n\u201cunequivocally rejects\u201d Tabassum being uninvited.\n\n\u201cThe provost\u2019s action is another example of USC\u2019s egregious pattern of\nsupporting anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim racism,\u201d the group said.\n\nTimes staff writers Jenna Peterson and Angie Orellana Hernandez contributed to\nthis report.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### USC cancels appearance by director Jon Chu, others amid valedictorian controversy\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * ### USC students protest the \u2018silencing\u2019 of valedictorian with cancellation of speech\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n  * ### Letters to the Editor: Canceled valedictorian speech is another self-inflicted black eye for USC\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nCaliforniaEducation\n\nJaweed Kaleem\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nJaweed Kaleem is a national correspondent at the Los Angeles Times.
