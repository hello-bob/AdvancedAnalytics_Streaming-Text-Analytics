We will write a more detailed thesis on this, but the TL;DR is,\n\n  * 75% open-source projects go to open-source purgatory because maintainers can\u2019t keep up with early-adopters\u2019 request for more\u2014more features, more performance, more security.\n  * Maintainers have one of two ways out of this Catch 22.\n    * Get early community contributions and users raising their hands to be co-maintainers.\n    * Find monetization routes to quit their day job and take up their OSS projects on full-time AKA turning to COSS.\n  * Commercial open-source software AKA COSS often leaves early adopters behind in the favor of more affluent buyers.\n\nWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s right by early adopters\u2014the rocket-fuel for the earliest\ngrowth engines at COSS companies. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to leave them in\nthe lurch when you find more affluent buyers. It doesn\u2019t sit right by us.\n\n## Plane One is an attempt at not leaving anyone behind.\n\nPlane is extremely popular already and while we are now experimenting with\ntiered SaaS packages, in talking to you, our earliest adopters, the one thing\nthat\u2019s been repeated more than anything else is the unwillingness to be locked\nin to ongoing pricing commitments just for ease of installation, instance\ngovernance, and security controls.\n\nPlane One serves you, the owners and admins of self-managed instances\u2014\u2014over\n40% of our users today\u2014\u2014with a one-time license fee for security and\nperformance essentials all teams need minus the SaaS pricing commitments that\nnot all teams can afford. It places no restrictions on users, projects,\nissues, or storage. It lasts a lifetime if you choose to stay on the version\nyou paid for. And it affords us a sustainable business model that doesn\u2019t come\nat the price of leaving you behind. If and when you are ready to upgrade to\nthe next version, choose the next one-time license or one of our tiered plans.\n\nFor obvious reasons, Plane One is not for our Cloud users, all of them on the\nFree plan today. The same no-restrictions policy applies to them, too, with\nthe exception of Drive and storage when we launch it.\n\n## Plane One isn\u2019t a pricing innovation. It doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nThink of Plane One as a Jira Server license minus the Support fees on your\nexisting versions or the headache of package choices. We aren\u2019t trying to\nreinvent parts of that pricing wheel that worked for over two decades, just\ntaking out the niggly bits that didn\u2019t work for us when we were Atlassian\ncustomers.\n\nWe also took our inspiration from ONCE.COM, including the name of this plan.\nIt is commendable that one of the most popular names in proprietary SaaS and a\nbellwether of the SaaS movement opened up a new B2B pricing model, but we see\nit being right up the COSS alley. We hope to take that baton from Basecamp and\nrun with it in open-source.\n\nHopefully, this becomes the de-facto first for all other COSS companies, but\nwe are more than happy if it just works for you.\n\nThank you for reading, for being an early adopter, and for your continued\nfaith. We wouldn\u2019t be here without you.\n\nCEO, Plane\n\nCOO, Plane\n\nPlane Logo\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Docs\n  * Status\n\n### Company\n\n  * Changelog\n  * Pricing\n\n### Legal\n\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n\u00a9 2024 Plane.
