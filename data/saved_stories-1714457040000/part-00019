It's part of a wave of ideas Japanese booksellers are trying to compete with online spaces. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\nBy Alex K.T. Martin Staff writer\n\nSHARE\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print\n\nApr 22, 2024\n\nRight outside the north exit of Chofu Station in western Tokyo is Shinko\nSyoten, a brick-and-mortar bookstore that Hideharu Yahata\u2019s father-in-law\nopened in 1968 \u2014 back when Japan was on one of the most rapid economic growth\ntrajectories the world has ever seen.\n\nA spate of major magazines were founded during the 1960s including Josei\nSeven, Shukan Post, Weekly Playboy and the Weekly Shonen Jump, a manga\nanthology that has since become the best-selling comic magazine in history.\nWriters like Seicho Matsumoto and Sohachi Yamaoka were churning out\nblockbuster novels while how-to-books on improving everything from English\nlanguage skills to sex lives sold in the millions.\n\nBy the time Yahata left his job as an engineer at a manufacturing firm and\nbegan working at his family\u2019s bookstore in 2002, however, the golden age for\nbooksellers seemed to be over. Japan was mired in a prolonged period of\neconomic stagnation following the burst of the asset price bubble in the early\n1990s, and while there were still plenty of bookshops in Chofu, things soon\ntook a downward turn with the emergence of new technology.\n\n\u201cOne by one they closed. I think five or six in the neighborhood have shut\ndown over the years, and a couple more during the past year or two,\u201d says\nYahata, who is also chairman of the Japan Federation of Booksellers' Trade\nAssociations (Nisshoren).\n\nTokyo\u2019s Jimbocho area is something of a mecca for book lovers. It is filled with both new and used bookstores and, increasingly, a new style of independent shop. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\n\u201cBefore the internet, bookstores were where people went to gather\ninformation,\u201d the 56-year-old tells The Japan Times from the organization\u2019s\noffice near Tokyo\u2019s \u201cbook town\u201d of Jimbocho.\n\n\u201cBut other retail channels such as convenience stores and Book Off, the used-\nbooks chain, began to proliferate. Meanwhile, online bookstores like Amazon\nate into our revenue,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, smartphones and social media made it\nso even fewer people purchase at physical shops.\u201d\n\nThe number of bookstores nationwide, which stood at around 20,000 back around\nthe time Yahata joined his family business, had plunged to 10,918 by March\nthis year, according to the Japan Publishing Organization for Information\nInfrastructure Development. The Research Institute for Publications, in the\nmeantime, says that the ratio of e-comics to physical copies \u2014 and to a much\nlesser extent, e-books and e-magazines \u2014 has soared, accounting for a third of\n\u00a51.6 trillion (around $12 billion at the time) in publication sales in 2023.\n\nSo, are real-word bookstores doomed? Not quite. While they have been\nchallenged by technology and a shrinking and aging population, recent years\nhave also seen smaller, independent bookstores catering to more diverse and\npersonalized tastes spring up across the country, while bigger outfits are\nexperimenting with curation, luxury experiences and even unstaffed shops.\n\nHideharu Yahata, chairman of the Japan Federation of Booksellers\u2019 Trade Associations, says that, before the internet, bookstores were where communities gathered for information. | ALEX K.T. MARTIN\n\nWhether that\u2019s enough to save a declining business is still unknown, but the\ncentral government has taken notice, with the trade ministry establishing a\nteam last month to promote local bookshops.\n\n\u201cA bookstore is a place where someone can browse a list of books of all\ngenres,\u201d Trade Minister Ken Saito said during a news conference on March 12.\n\u201cWe believe this is an advantage over the internet and other media in terms of\nbroadening a person's horizons.\u201d\n\n### From papyrus to pixels\n\nThrongs of tipsy cherry blossom lovers are gathered at Tokyo\u2019s Ueno Park on a\nrecent afternoon to party under the pink blooms. Among them is Takuro\nKawakami, who\u2019s waiting for an acquaintance with a can of beer in hand and\nflicking through social media feeds and comic book apps on his smartphone.\n\n\u201cI rarely buy books unless there\u2019s something I specifically need,\u201d says the\nused car parts dealer who\u2019s in his late 30s and hails from neighboring Saitama\nPrefecture. \u201cAnd besides, it's difficult to read physical books when you\u2019re\nmoving or holding something.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey by the government\u2019s Agency for Cultural Affairs,\n47.3% of respondents said they hadn\u2019t read a single book in a month, while\n67.3% said they are reading less. These statistics reflect a concerning trend\nfor readers: Over one-fourth of Japan\u2019s 1,741 municipalities no longer have\nany bookstores, according to a 2022 study by the Japan Publishing Industry\nFoundation for Culture.\n\nA distinct relationship between booksellers, distributors and publishers served the industry well decades ago when bookstores were thriving. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\n\u201cA lack of bookstores erodes reading habits,\u201d says Nisshoren secretary general\nKazuyuki Ishii. \u201cE-commerce sites like Amazon and Rakuten can\u2019t fill the void.\nThe mere existence of a bookshop contributes to that area\u2019s reading culture.\u201d\n\nStarting a bookstore is no easy feat, however, and could cost tens of millions\nof yen depending on the amount of floor space. Besides finding affordable\nproperty and employees, bookshop owners need substantial capital to stock\ntheir store\u2019s shelves with new titles before opening. And for each publication\nsold, booksellers typically earn around 22% or 23% of the sales price \u2014 it's a\nlow-margin, high-volume enterprise. Add to that the drop in sales in recent\nyears of magazines, once the primary moneymaker, and it's not a vocation for\nentrepreneurs looking to earn quick cash.\n\nThere\u2019s a distinct system in place, too. The three major players in Japan\u2019s\nbook business are the publisher, the wholesale distributor and the bookseller.\nA fixed price for publications is set by publishers under the resale price\nmaintenance system, enabling the distribution of a wide variety of titles in\nsmall volumes and making possible royalty payments for books with a small\ncirculation.\n\nPublishers generally do business with distributors on a consignment basis,\nwith the distributor then selling books and magazines to the retail market on\na returnable basis, meaning booksellers can return unsold publications within\na set period of time in order to avoid stocking up on unpopular titles, which\nnow applies to around 40% of cases.\n\nA woman peruses books at Hontasu Tameike Tameike-Sannno Metro Pia, better known as just \"Hontasu,\" an unstaffed bookstore in the bowels of Tameike-Sanno Station in Tokyo. | ALEX K.T. MARTIN\n\nThe distributors, the big two being Nippon Shuppan Hanbai Inc. \u2014 more widely\nknown as \u201cNippan\u201d \u2014 and Tohan Corp., then, are essentially intermediaries\nbetween publishers and bookstores.\n\nAnd with roughly 200 or so publications released every day, most bookstores\nhave relied on these distributors to choose and deliver what they sell. In\nother words, the selection of books that are key to sales has largely been\ninfluenced by the algorithms of the distributors, not by the tastes and\nstrategies of bookstore owners and clerks.\n\nThis system functioned well during the heyday of bookstores, Ishii says, \u201cwhen\neverything flew off the shelves.\u201d When he joined his organization back in\n1987, Ishii recalls, there were around 25,000 bookstores, 10 distributors and\nabout 4,000 publishers in Japan compared to roughly 3,000 operating now.\n\n\u201cBut the age of mass publications resulting in mass profits is over \u2014 the\nsystem itself is getting old,\u201d Ishii says, adding that, with book sales\nwaning, stores are now looking for more original selections to cater to their\nparticular consumer demographics and a system that allows them to do so.\n\n### Creating \u2018touchpoints\u2019\n\nOn any given weekday, more than 80,000 passengers pass through Tokyo Metro\u2019s\nTameike-Sanno subway station located near the National Diet Building and the\nPrime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nThere\u2019s no kindly antiquarian suggesting novels and magazines to prospective\nreaders here. Instead, inside a white and blue storefront, titles are arranged\non shelves for passersby to peruse at their leisure and purchase at automatic\ncheckouts \u2014 no employees necessary.\n\n\u201cDespite the high volume of passengers, there are no bookstores around here,\u201d\nsays Kotaro Minami, Nippan\u2019s brand manager for Hontasu, Japan\u2019s first\ncompletely staff-free bookstore. The distributor opened it inside the station\nin September last year.\n\nSitting at a Starbucks across the underground passageway from Hontasu, Minami\nexplains how, according to Nippan\u2019s estimate, a bookstore is considered a\nviable business if there are 30,000 commuters using a nearby station. \u201cBut\neven when bringing up that threshold to 50,000, there are 83 stations in Tokyo\nand its three surrounding prefectures that don\u2019t have enough bookstores.\u201d\n\nKotaro Minami stands in the staffless Hontasu bookshop located underground in Tameike-Sanno Station in Akasaka. | ALEX K.T. MARTIN\n\nNippan\u2019s unmanned bookstore is the distributor's answer to the current crisis\nimpacting the industry. A chronic labor shortage has seen wage costs grow,\nwhile the fall in the number of booksellers naturally translates to less\nopportunities for people to interact with physical books, something those in\nthe industry refer to as \u201ctouch points.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a distributor, our sales are directly impacted by the falling number of\nbookstores, so we feel compelled to think of a sustainable business model for\nshops to survive,\u201d Minami says. \u201cAnd while it\u2019s difficult to reduce rent,\nlabor costs could be cut by operating a staff-less store.\u201d\n\nTo enter Hontasu, customers need to access a QR code using their smartphones\nvia the Line messaging app. All payments are cashless, and security cameras\nmonitor the isles during operating hours. Minami says that so far, on average,\naround 200 to 250 people visit the bookstore on weekdays, of which roughly 40%\nmake purchases.\n\nShoppers at Hontasu are expected to pay for purchases themselves. They must access a QR code to do this, using smartphones via the Line messaging app. | ALEX K.T. MARTIN\n\nThe plan is to open another three to five directly managed Hontasu shops\nduring the current fiscal year, and have another 30 bookstores adopt the\nunmanned system in the same period. \u201cOver the next three years, we\u2019d like to\nsee around 100 bookshops use our system,\u201d Minami says.\n\nHontasu is among the new business models the industry has seen in recent\nyears. Nippan also operates Bunkitsu, a chic store in Roppongi that doubles as\na cafe and workspace, and which requires a \u00a51,650 ($10.70) entrance fee,\nallowing guests to read and buy curated books.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to increase touch points where consumers can interact with\nbookstores,\u201d Minami says. \u201cOr else bookshops are really going to disappear.\u201d\n\n### Shared shelves\n\nIt has been a year since Masayuki Waki moved his bookshop from the hipster\nneighborhood of Shimokitazawa to a two-story house near Soshigaya-Okura\nStation, farther west in Tokyo\u2019s residential Setagaya Ward.\n\nThe first floor of the establishment is packed with shelves selling both used\nand new publications ranging from children\u2019s picture books to English novels.\nEach shelf has an owner who rents the space for \u00a54,400 ($28.50) a month.\n\nWaki, an author and writer specializing in bookstores, opened his outlet,\nBookshop Traveller, in 2018, and is one of the pioneers in the trend of\nrenting out shelves.\n\nMasayuki Waki first opened his outlet, Bookshop Traveller, in 2018. There he rents out shelves for \u00a54,400 a month to other book sellers. | ALEX K.T. MARTIN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stable yet not very profitable business model,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s\nfun, and the shop functions as a hub for book lovers as well as an event space\nand a place for promotional activities.\u201d\n\nThe system, called tanagashi (literally, \u201crenting out shelves\u201d) serves\nmultiple purposes. It\u2019s a low-risk entry point for those aspiring to open\ntheir own bookstore and is good PR for booksellers that want their brand to be\nknown to a wider audience.\n\nIn fact, similar shared shops have been cropping up across Japan, allowing\nbibliophiles to interact with each other and foster a sense of community.\n\nPassage is a \"shared bookstore\" that takes inspiration from the streets of Paris. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\nIn Jimbocho, for example, a shared bookstore called Passage opened in 2022.\nThe shop is inspired by the shopping streets of Paris and features sets of\nshelves named after streets in France, each operated by a different owner.\nAlso, later this month, Naoki Prize-winning author Shogo Imamura is opening\nHonmaru, another similar bookstore in Jimbocho that allows both individuals\nand businesses to rent shelves.\n\nAs a writer, Waki primarily focuses on covering so-called independent\nbookstores. While the term can also apply to old-school mom-and-pop shops,\nit\u2019s now mostly used to refer to smaller shops with a distinct edge, including\nmixed-space enterprises where books are sold alongside clothes, coffee,\nstationary and other goods and services.\n\n\u201cThe stereotype for what bookstores must be gradually dissolved starting in\nthe early 2000s and now encompasses various forms,\u201d Waki says, adding that the\nnumber of these new bookstores has been growing, with 100 or so opening last\nyear.\n\nThe structural issues the industry harbors remain, however, along with the\ndemographic woes affecting the economy. Waki says many new bookshop owners\ngive up after two or three years, overwhelmed by the work and investments\nnecessary in keeping their businesses going.\n\nThe culture of reading and selling books gives Tokyo's Jimbocho neighborhood a distinct character. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine magazines making a comeback, while the shrinking\npopulation will likely see more people flock to bigger cities where floorspace\ncomes at a premium,\u201d Waki says. \u201cAnd in that scenario, the distribution system\nas it is may not be sustainable.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Japan\u2019s book reading culture is facing certain demise,\nthough. The history of papyrus dates back thousands of years, and the\nsignificance of physical books can\u2019t be overstated, Waki says; there\u2019s a sense\nof possession lacking with e-books. The various new forms through which books\nare being sold now is testament to their enduring allure.\n\nThe focus, then, is to find a way that allows these new bookstores and owners\nto survive, Waki says, for which an industry-wide brainstorming session is\nhappening right now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be pessimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s not much we can\ndo about the falling population, but we want to somehow preserve the book-\nloving community and its ecosystem, as well as the joy of reading a physical\nproduct.\u201d\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nbooks(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/books),\nbookstores(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/bookstores),\nJimbocho(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/jimbocho),\nDIGITALIZATION(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/digitalization),\nDEPOPULATION(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/depopulation),\nCHOFU(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/chofu),\nTOKYO(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/tokyo), CHIYODA\nWARD(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/chiyoda-ward)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
