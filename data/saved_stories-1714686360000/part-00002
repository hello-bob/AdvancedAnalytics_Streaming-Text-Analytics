According to South Carolina\nauthorities, Barnett died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nDean's death is likely to again draw attention to Boeing, which has been under\nincreased scrutiny from regulators and airlines since an emergency exit door\nblew off a Boeing 737 Max in midair in January after it took off from Portland\nInternational Airport.\n\nA Virgin Australia Boeing 737 is seen landing at Gold Coast Airport in\nAustralia on May 01, 2024.

He returned to Spirit in late May 2021 as a product and process\nverification (PPV) core quality auditor. He later became a level 2 stress\nengineer, until his contract was terminated by the company in late April 2023.\n\nExclusively Available to Subscribers Try it now for $1\n\nIn October 2022, he flagged what he said were serious manufacturing defects to\nmanagement, but said that nothing was done. According to the lawsuit, Spirit\n\"concealed\" the issues flagged by Dean from investors until they were revealed\nby independent reporting in August 2023, 10 months later.\n\nRead more\n\n  * Southwest Airlines issues $75 vouchers for some customers\n  * Southwest Airlines is in trouble\n  * American Airlines flight diverted after hitting bird\n\nThe whistleblower claimed that the company had fired him in retaliation for\nflagging the defects at the Wichita plant, using a \"false justification\" (the\nfailure to spot a manufacturing flaw in the fittings that attach the vertical\ntail fin to the fuselage during an audit) as a pretext to \"scapegoat and\nsilence him,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nDean had also filed a complaint against Spirit with the Federal Aviation\nAdministration, accusing the company of \"serious and gross misconduct by\nsenior quality management of the 737 production line\" at the manufacturer. The\ninvestigation concluded that Dean's allegations had substance, but did not\nprovide further details.\n\nDean's sudden death at the age of 45 was announced by his aunt and sister on\nsocial media on Tuesday. His mother wrote on Facebook that he had contracted\npneumonia in April and suffered a stroke following an MSRA infection.\n\nThe Seattle Times wrote that Dean \"had been in good health and was noted for\nhaving a healthy lifestyle,\" but had died after contracting \"a sudden, fast-\nspreading infection.\"\n\nDean's lawyer Brian Knowles described his death to Al-Jazeera as a \"loss to\nthe aviation community and the flying public.\" Newsweek contacted Knowles Law\nFirm for comment by email early on Thursday.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with Josh Dean's family. This sudden loss is stunning news\nhere at Spirit and for his loved ones,\" a spokesperson for Spirit told\nNewsweek.\n\nBarnett was found dead in an apparent suicide in March in the midst of giving\ndepositions against Boeing, alleging that the company retaliated against him\nfor exposing safety issues with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. An investigation\ninto his death is still ongoing.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988\nSuicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"988\" to the Crisis Text Line\nat 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.\n\nUpdate, 5/2/2024, 5:20 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include more\nbackground information.\n\nUpdate, 5/2/2024, 9:28 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a comment\nfrom Spirit.\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nGiulia Carbonaro\n\nShare on TwitterShare on LinkedIn\n\nGiulia Carbonaro is a Newsweek Reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on\nU.S. and European politics, global affairs and housing.
