We are a proxy server for the Go Modules\ndownload API.\n\nSee our documentation site https://docs.gomods.io for more details on the\nproject.\n\nWe are looking for people who would like to become core maintainers of this\nproject. Please see issue #1734 for more details.\n\n# Project Status\n\nDevelopment teams at several companies are using Athens in their everyday\ndevelopment workflows.\n\nThis means that they are running their own Athens servers, hooking them up to\ntheir own storage backends (see here for the list of storage backends that\nAthens supports), and configuring their local Go development environments to\nuse that Athens server.\n\nWe encourage you to try it out, consider using it in your development\nworkflow, and letting us know if you are using it by adding a comment to this\nGitHub issue.\n\n# More Details Please!\n\nThe proxy implements the Go modules download protocol.\n\nAthens proxies are highly configurable, so they can work for lots of different\ndeployments. For example, proxies support a wide variety of storage drivers\nincluding:\n\n  * Cloud blob storage services\n  * MongoDB\n  * Content distribution networks (CDNs)\n  * Shared disk\n  * In-memory\n\n# Development\n\nSee DEVELOPMENT.md for details on how to set up your development environment\nand start contributing code.\n\nSpeaking of contributing, read on!\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you use Athens for your development workflow, we hope that you'll consider\ncontributing back to the project. Athens is widely used and has plenty of\ninteresting work to do, from technical challenges to technical documentation\nto release management. We have a wonderful community that we would love you to\nbe a part of. Absolutely everyone is welcome.\n\nThe quickest way to get involved is by filing issues if you find bugs or find\nthat you need Athens to do something it doesn't.\n\nIf you'd like to help us tackle some of the technical / code challenges and\nyou're familiar with the GitHub contribution process, you'll probably be\nfamiliar with our process for contributions. You can optionally find or submit\nan issue, and then submit a pull request (PR) to fix that issue. See here for\nmore of the project-specific details.\n\n> If you're not familiar with the standard GitHub contribution process, which\n> Athens mostly follows, please see this section of our documentation to learn\n> how to contribute. You can also take advantage of @bketelsen's great video\n> on how to contribute code. The information in these documents and videos\n> will help you not only with this project, but can also help you contribute\n> to many other projects on GitHub.\n\nIf you decide to contribute but aren't sure what to work on, we have a well\nmaintained list of good first issues that you should look at. If you find one\nthat you would like to work on, please post a comment saying \"I want to work\non this\", and then it's all yours to begin working on.\n\n> We do recommend that you choose one of the issues on the above list, but you\n> may also consider a different one from our entire list. Many of the issues\n> on that list are more complex and challenging.\n\nBefore you do start getting involved or contributing, we want to let you know\nthat we follow a general philosophy in how we work together, and we'd really\nappreciate you getting familiar with it before you start.\n\nIt's not too long and it's ok for you to \"skim\" it (or even just read the\nfirst two sections \ud83d\ude04), just as long as you understand the spirit of who we are\nand how we work.\n\n# Getting Involved Without Contributing Pull Requests or Issues\n\nIf you're not ready to contribute code yet, there are plenty of other great\nways to get involved:\n\n  * Come talk to us in the #athens channel in the Gophers slack. We\u2019re a really friendly group, so come say hi and join us! Ping me (@arschles on slack) in the channel and I\u2019ll give you the lowdown\n  * Get familiar with the technology. There's lots to read about. Here are some places to start:\n\n    * Gentle Introduction to the Project - the basics of why we started this project\n    * The Download Protocol - the core API that the proxy implements and the go CLI uses to download packages\n    * Proxy Design - what the proxy is and how it works\n    * Go modules wiki - context and details on how Go dependency management works in general\n    * \"Go and Versioning\" - long articles on Go dependency management details, internals, etc...\n\n# Built on the Shoulders of Giants\n\nThe Athens project would not be possible without the amazing projects it\nbuilds on. Please see SHOULDERS.md to see a list of them.\n\n# Coding Guidelines\n\nWe all strive to write nice and readable code which can be understood by every\nperson of the team. To achieve that we follow principles described in Brian's\ntalk Code like the Go team.\n\n  * Printed version\n  * Gophercon RU talk\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThis project follows the Contributor Covenant (English version here) code of\nconduct.\n\nIf you have concerns, notice a code of conduct violation, or otherwise would\nlike to talk about something related to this code of conduct, please reach out\n@arschles on the Gophers Slack.\n\nAthens banner attributed to Golda Manuel\n\n## About\n\nA Go module datastore and proxy\n\ndocs.gomods.io\n\n### Topics\n\ngo golang package-manager dependency-manager proxy proxy-server goproxy\ndependencies package-control athens go-modules\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n4.3k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n95 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n485 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 23\n\nv0.13.3 Latest\n\nApr 14, 2024\n\n\\+ 22 releases\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 190\n\n\\+ 176 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 94.1%\n  * Shell 2.7%\n  * PowerShell 1.6%\n  * Other 1.6%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
