The\nresults \u2013 while edited \u2013 are surprisingly convincing, right down to the\nmessiest parts of our humanity.\n\nWhat would you ask if you found yourself sitting across the screen from an\ninteractive, digital version of... Well, yourself?\n\nWell-known Silicon Valley figure Reid Hoffman \u2013 co-founder of LinkedIn, former\nboard member of Paypal, OpenAI, and Co-founder of Inflection AI \u2013 recently\nfound himself in exactly this situation, interviewing an AI avatar of himself\ncreated using generative AIs from Hour One (for video) and 11ElevenLabs (for\naudio).\n\nMore Stories\n\nTechnology\n\nAI voice analysis gives suicide hotline workers an emotional dashboard\n\nRobotics\n\nInterview: Suzanne Gildert leaves Sanctuary to focus on AI consciousness\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nThese AI models were trained specifically on the last 20 years of \"in real\nlife\" (IRL) Reid's writings, speeches, interviews and podcasts. So they're\nfull of his own personal ideas, turns of phrase, tone of voice, and indeed\nphysical mannerisms \u2013 and designed to recreate how Hoffman himself would\nlisten, react, answer and converse with another individual.\n\nAI Reid and IRL Reid Hoffman\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nThe idea is for public figures to be able to offer one-on-one personal\ninteractions, for purposes ranging from coaching to simple fan interactions,\nto far more people, and at far lower cost than they could ever schedule in the\nflesh.\n\nIt's a pretty incredible concept, which we first encountered in a chat with\nMotion Capture master Remington Scott of Hyperreal, a company that creates\ndigital twins of celebrities, musicians, authors \u2013 Whether they're currently\nalive or not.\n\n\"We're working with a best-selling author,\" Scott told us. \"He's had more than\n20 books on the New York Times list. Talented guy. And he wants to create a\nconversational AI \u2013 you'll talk to him, he'll talk to you. So the training\nmodel we've used for his conversational brain is all his work. It's not cross-\npollinated with other things like ChatGPT is, this is his own words. So you're\nspeaking directly to the words that he says, and the thoughts and feelings\nhe's collected. We do tests, asking him and the AI the same questions. And he\ncan't see the AI's answers, but they'll both answer almost exactly the same.\nIt's as authentic as it's gonna get.\"\n\nSo we knew this was coming, but this is the first time we've someone\ninterviewing their own digital copy. \"I think these avatars,\" writes Hoffman,\n\"when built thoughtfully, have the potential to act as mirrors to ourselves \u2013\nones that reflect back our own ideas and personality to examine and consider.\"\n\nReid posted the following 14 minute-long Reid vs Reid interview to YouTube.\nThe conversation appears completely seamless and flowing, but we'd take that\nwith a grain of salt. There's typically an awkward processing pause between\nquestion and answer with most conversational AIs we've encountered, and\nthere's a jump-cut in the video every time AI Hoffman goes to speak \u2013 so\nthere's clearly some editing magic involved here.\n\nReid Hoffman meets his AI twin - Full\n\nBut one of the most striking things is the body language \u2013 even if it's\nprobably been adjusted afterward for timing. AI Reid appears to be in a\nconstant state of active listening, and seems downright playful at times\nwhilst listening to IRL Reid speak \u2013 nodding its head, smiling, shrugging and\nin general being very much on-vibe when it's not talking.\n\nIt almost looks like too much, honestly \u2013 until you flip through a couple of\nMasters of Scales podcast videos and see how enthusiastically IRL Hoffman\nspeaks with his guests... I'm now convinced AI Reid is giving this exactly the\nright amount of sauce.\n\nAt first glance while watching AI Reid, you can tell that there's something\nnot quite right. Something synthetic. But that's also because you know what\nyou're looking at \u2013 and either way, this technology is relatively new; at the\ncurrent rate of AI progress, it's likely to get astronomically better long\nbefore you'd expect. Within a few months, or years at most, there's every\nchance you'll struggle to tell a real person from an AI avatar in a video\nchat.\n\nJust the sheer... Humanity of this thing can be astounding at times. When AI\nReid speaks, you can audibly hear each sharp inhalation breath between\nsentences, the same as IRL Reid does when he's excited and explaining\nsomething. Small details like these make AI Reid remarkably believable.\n\nThere are moments when AI Reid fidgets impatiently, waiting for IRL Reid to\nfinish talking as if it already knows the answer to his questions. It\nreplicates IRL Hoffman almost disturbingly well in movement and in timing \u2013\nand while the timing might be down to editing, the movement certainly isn't.\n\nThere are other moments that highlight why you might want to be very careful\nin front of cameras, if the vision's going to train up an AI model. Our\nfavorite, below, is around 11:44 in the video, when AI Reid wipes its runny\nnose as it listens and nods, then slowly, deliberately, contemplatively smears\nan AI-generated booger on the table.\n\nThere's a certain quiet dignity in it\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nThe idea of having a digital twin of yourself can create plenty of exciting,\ncreative, educational and helpful opportunities, as Hoffman outlines in his\nAI-self interview. Doctors having the ability to \"see\" dozens or more patients\nsimultaniously. Teachers teaching around the world, tailoring their\ncommunications personally to thousands of students learning at different\nlevels concurrently.\n\nIndeed, Digital AI twins have already started taking people's place for\nstressful situations like, say, video interviews for remote jobs:\n\n> Nothing to see here, just my AI clone taking a job interview\n> pic.twitter.com/CZYverCsjy\n>\n> \u2014 Aidan (@aidancramer) March 18, 2024\n\nIt won't take long for them to get good enough to win contracts away from\nmeat-space competitors \u2013 and possibly even do quite decent work, now that I\nthink about it, as long as they can avoid going to the Christmas party.\n\nAnd that's about the least of our problems; this also has the potential get\nvery dark; interactive clones can now be harnessed for all sorts of purposes.\n\nPeople are already being scammed by the likeness of Taylor Swift and Joe Rogan\nthrough clever deepfake videos \u2013 AI counterparts offer an entirely new level\nof manipulative coercion. Your elderly relatives already fall for phone scams\n\u2013 imagine how much more effective these could be if it was a fully interactive\nvideo call using your face, your voice, your speech patterns... Or Tom Hanks.\nOr Donald Trump.\n\nAI Reid looks up while pondering his next words... but what does AI Reid\nactually see?\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nAssuming you'll have the choice, would you allow everything you've ever done,\nwritten, and recorded to be databased and turned into a digital copy of\nyourself that can interact freely, without you being there to audit its\nresponses? How would you use it? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nSource: Reid Hoffman\n\nView gallery - 6 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.

However,\nwhat the AI says still comes down to a large language model, which still\nlimits the AI to the text it is fed. In the end, the AI does not know if it is\nspouting nonsense, but it does it with impeccable grammar. And pickles shall\nconquer the world with corn-fed octopuses. Is it true? Is it real? The AI, at\nleast for now, cannot know. Let that be a warning to those that would rely on\nthis technology to do their thinking for them.\n\nBrian M May 1, 2024 03:37 AM\n\n@jimbo92107 'the AI does not know if it is spouting nonsense,'\n\nUnfortunately that also applies to us humans as well, we just call it a\nbelief, a political opinion or similar.\n\nIf the multi-verse exists maybe ' And pickles shall conquer the world with\ncorn-fed octopuses' might be true. Although suspect it probably isn't!\n\nIts quite likely that we can counteract the 'nonsense AI output, with perhaps\nfurther AI's who can verify and flag dubious outputs, just like us humans know\nwhen someone is talking nonsense, but that might also be a belief or political\nopinion!\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
