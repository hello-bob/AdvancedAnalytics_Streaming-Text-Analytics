Lentz/Getty Images)\n\nWhen it comes to its connection to the sky, Stonehenge is best known for its\nsolar alignments.\n\nEvery midsummer's night tens of thousands of people gather at Stonehenge to\ncelebrate and witness the rising Sun in alignment with the Heel stone standing\noutside of the circle. Six months later a smaller crowd congregates around the\nHeel stone to witness the midwinter Sun setting within the stone circle.\n\nBut a hypothesis has been around for 60 years that part of Stonehenge also\naligns with moonrise and moonset at what is called a major lunar standstill.\nAlthough a correlation between the layout of certain stones and the major\nlunar standstill has been known about for several decades, no one has\nsystematically observed and recorded the phenomenon at Stonehenge.\n\nThis is what we are aiming to do in a project bringing together\narchaeologists, astronomers and photographers from English Heritage, Oxford,\nLeicester and Bournemouth universities as well as the Royal Astronomical\nSociety.\n\nThere is now an abundance of archaeological evidence that indicates the solar\nalignment was part of the architectural design of Stonehenge. Around 2500 BC,\nthe people who put up the large stones and dug an avenue into the chalk seemed\nto want to cement the solstice axis into the architecture of Stonehenge.\n\nArchaeological evidence from nearby Durrington Walls, the place where\nscientists believe the ancient people who visited Stonehenge stayed, indicates\nthat of the two solstices it was the midwinter one that drew the largest\ncrowd.\n\nBut Stonehenge includes other elements, such as 56 pits arranged in a circle,\nan earthwork bank and ditch, and other smaller features such as the four\nstation stones. These are four sarsen stones, a form of silicified sandstone\ncommon in Wiltshire, that were carefully placed to form an almost exact\nrectangle encompassing the stone circle.\n\nOnly two of these stones are still there, and they pale in comparison to their\nlarger counterparts as they are only a few feet high. So what could their\npurpose be?\n\nOnly two of the station stones are still there. (Drone Explorer/Shutterstock)\n\n## Lunar standstill\n\nThe rectangle that they form is not just any rectangle. The shorter sides are\nparallel to the main axis of the stone circle and this may be a clue as to\ntheir purpose. The longer sides of the rectangle skirt the outside of the\nstone circle.\n\nIt is these longer sides that are thought to align with the major lunar\nstandstill. If you marked the position of moonrise (or set) over the course of\na month you would see that it moves between two points on the horizon. These\nsouthern and northern limits of moonrise (or set) change on a cycle of 18.6\nyears between a minimum and a maximum range \u2013 the so-called minor and major\nlunar standstills, respectively.\n\nThe major lunar standstill is a period of about one and a half to two years\nwhen the northernmost and southernmost moonrises (or sets) are furthest apart.\nWhen this happens the Moon rises (and sets) outside the range of sunrises and\nsets, which may have imbued this celestial phenomenon with meaning and\nsignificance.\n\nThe range of Moonrise positions on the horizon during minor and major lunar\nstandstills. (Fabio Silva, CC BY-NC)\n\nThe strongest evidence we have for people marking the major lunar standstill\ncomes from the US southwest. The Great House of Chimney Rock, a multi-level\ncomplex built by the ancestral Pueblo people in the San Juan National Forest,\nColorado, more than 1,000 years ago.\n\nIt lies on a ridge that ends at a natural formation of twin rock pillars \u2013 an\narea that has cultural significance to more than 26 native American tribal\nnations. From the vantage point of the Great House, the Sun will never rise in\nthe gap between the pillars.\n\nHowever, during a major standstill the Moon does rise between them in awe-\ninspiring fashion. Excavations unearthed preserved wood that meant researchers\ncould date to the year episodes of construction of the Great House.\n\nOf six cutting dates, four correspond to major lunar standstill years between\nthe years AD1018 and AD1093, indicating that the site was renewed, maintained\nor expanded on consecutive major standstills.\n\nReturning to southern England, archaeologists think there is a connection\nbetween the major lunar standstill and the earliest construction phase of\nStonehenge (3000-2500 BC), before the sarsen stones were brought in.\n\nSeveral sets of cremated human remains from this phase of construction were\nfound in the southeastern part of the monument in the general direction of the\nsouthernmost major standstill moonrise, where three timber posts were also set\ninto the bank. It is possible that there was an early connection between the\nsite of Stonehenge and the Moon, which was later emphasised when the station\nstone rectangle was built.\n\nThe major lunar standstill hypothesis, however, raises more questions than it\nanswers. We don't know if the lunar alignments of the station stones were\nsymbolic or whether people were meant to observe the Moon through them.\nNeither do we know which phases of the Moon would be more dramatic to witness.\n\n## A search for answers\n\nIn our upcoming work, we will be trying to answer the questions the major\nlunar standstill hypothesis raises. It's unclear whether the Moon would have\nbeen strong enough to cast shadows and how they would have interacted with the\nother stones. We will also need to check whether the alignments can still be\nseen today or if they are blocked by woods, traffic and other features.\n\nThe Moon will align with the station stone rectangle twice a month from about\nFebruary 2024 to November 2025, giving us plenty of opportunities to observe\nthis phenomenon in different seasons and phases of the Moon.\n\nTo bring our research to life, English Heritage will livestream the\nsouthernmost Moonrise in June 2024, and host a series of events throughout the\nyear, including talks, a pop-up planetarium, stargazing and storytelling\nsessions.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, our partners at the US Forest Service are developing\neducational materials about the major lunar standstill at Chimney Rock\nNational Monument. This collaboration will result in events showcasing and\ndebating the lunar alignments at both Stonehenge and at Chimney Rock.\n\nFabio Silva, Senior Lecturer in Archaeological Modelling, Bournemouth\nUniversity; Amanda Chadburn, Member of Kellogg College, University of Oxford\nand Visiting Fellow in Archaeology, Bournemouth University, and Erica\nEllingson, Professor in Astrophysics, Emeritus, University of Colorado Boulder\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
