He is economical with his words, sometimes coming across as cryptic (but he is not a bad person).\n\n### 1\\. Clever code\n\nOne day, the novice asked the master, \"I optimized 10 lines of Python code\ninto a single line using a list comprehension, and the new code is very\nelegant. Why did my pull request get rejected?\"\n\nThe master replied, \"I was the one who rejected your PR.\"\n\nSeeing the novice's surprise, the master added, \"I wrote those 10 lines of\ncode a month ago.\"\n\nThe novice blushed, but still didn't want to give up his PR, so he argued,\n\"But right next to the function I changed is a similar function with much more\ncomplex one-liners. Why were they getting merged?\"\n\n\"Oh, that was code I wrote 10 years ago,\" the master replied.\n\n### 2\\. One line of code and five lines of comments\n\nOne day, the novice asked the master, \"I write a lot of code every day,\nfulfilling many requirements, but why doesn't my programming level improve?\"\n\nThe master replied, \"Let me see what you've been writing.\"\n\nThe novice opened his computer. The master pointed to an ordinary line of\nvariable assignment code on the screen and said, \"The day you realize you need\nto put five lines of comments before that is the day you've grown.\" With that,\nthe master walked away.\n\n### 3\\. Delete the comments\n\nOne day, the novice asked the master, \"I write a lot of code every day,\nfulfilling many requirements, but why doesn't my programming level improve?\"\n\nThe master replied, \"Let me see your code.\"\n\nThe novice opened his laptop. The master pointed to a section of comments on\nthe screen and said, \"Delete that.\"\n\nThe novice did as instructed. After pondering for a moment, the novice\nexclaimed, \"I get it! You mean we should focus on the descriptiveness of the\ncode itself, rather than relying too much on the comments!\"\n\nThe master shook his head and said, \"No, I just wanted to check your typing\nskills, and from what I've observed, you can't even touch type. Then the\nmaster walked away.\n\n### 4\\. Microservice architecture skills\n\nOne day the novice asked the master, \"How can I improve my microservice\narchitecture skills?\"\n\nThe master replied, \"Let me see your code.\"\n\nThe novice opened his laptop. The master noticed that the project's utils\ndirectory was many times larger than all the other modules combined.\n\n\"If you don't know how to organize modules, you essentially can't 'architect'\nanything else.\" The master said, then turned and walked away.\n\n### 5\\. Beyond the code linter\n\nOne day, the novice approached the master.\n\n\"The code linter introduced to the project yesterday is incredibly powerful.\nI've noticed that everyone's code quality is now almost identical,\" the novice\ncontinued, asking, \"I wonder, if a linter can help everyone write equally good\ncode, where does the oft-mentioned 'better coding skills' actually manifest\nitself?\"\n\nThe master pondered for a moment before answering, \"Ten years ago, when\ndriving on the highway, drivers had to maintain a steady speed and keep the\ncar centered between the lane lines. Surprisingly, it took a considerable\namount of driving experience to accomplish this simple task of driving 'steady\nand centered'.\"\n\nThe master went on to say, \"But now most cars are equipped with assisted\ndriving features that can easily perform the task mentioned earlier. You'll\nnotice that once on the highway, some drivers start browsing TikTok on their\nphones, while others stay focused on the road, ready to optimize their route\nand take over in emergency scenarios that machines still struggle with.\"\n\nSeeing the novice deep in thought, the master added, \"Driving is not just\nabout keeping the car steady and centered in the lane, just as software\ndevelopment is not just about submitting code that passes linter's quality\ncheck. Good programmers are always aware that there are many more important\nproblems to solve.\"\n\nThe novice nodded in agreement. But then, as if suddenly struck by a\nfrightening thought, he said hesitantly, \"However, the technology for assisted\ndriving is constantly evolving. There will come a day when drivers on the\nhighway will be able to completely let go, without having to do anything at\nall.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the master glanced at the ChatGPT window on the screen and\nfell into deep thought. Finally, he spoke deliberately, \"Yes, you're right. I\nthink the same applies to software development.\" Then, the master suddenly\nstood up and walked slowly towards the green grass outside the door, his\nfigure appearing somewhat forlorn.\n\n\u00a9 2009 - 2024 by piglei.
