While Bricobio works towards genetically altering cats so they\nchange color when in the presence of radioactive material, the NHIA Type 1\nclass is working to insert the idea that if a cat changes color, that space\nmight be dangerous to others.

Their solution\nconsisted of two steps:\n\n  1. Engineer a cat that changes colour in response to radiation.\n\n  2. Create a culture around this cat, such that if your cat changes colour, you should move someplace else.\n\nThis requires a combination of scientific work in biology as well as social\nsciences and art, and there are many questions to consider:\n\n  * How do we actually engineer this cat?\n  * What are some of the scientific challenges?\n  * How do we create this culture?\n  * What types of art are more effective?\n\nand much more...\n\n# WHAT DOES THE RAY CAT MEAN FOR YOU?\n\nThis project is as multi-faceted as it can be. Everyone's expertise and\nopinions are welcome and encouraged. We are here to challenge each other, ask\nquestions, learn and share knowledge and perspectives with eachother.\n\n# WHAT DOES THE RAY CAT MEAN FOR YOU?\n\nThis project is as multi-faceted as it can be.
