Subscribe to T-Minus to\nmake sure you\u2019re part of the journey.\n\nThough cost is a barrier for some people, others live in remote or rural\nplaces where they couldn\u2019t get high-speed internet even if they could afford\nit \u2014 the infrastructure simply isn\u2019t in place, and internet providers aren\u2019t\ninterested in building it.\n\nSatellite internet: Thanks to the falling cost of rocket launches, the\ncheapest way to close this digital divide may be through satellites, which can\nbeam high-speed internet down to any location on Earth as long as there\u2019s a\ndirect line of sight between the satellite and a receiver.\n\nOther companies, like Starlink, have already been pursuing this for years, but\nthey place their satellites into low-Earth orbit, which is about 340 miles\nabove Earth. Astranis plans to put internet satellites into geosynchronous\nequatorial orbit (GEO), which is more than 22,000 miles above the ground.\n\nThis higher orbit means one satellite can \u201csee\u201d more of the planet\u2019s surface,\nand as a result, fewer satellites can provide coverage to a larger area. (The\ndownside of the extra distance is that it takes longer for the signal to\ntravel, so GEO satellite internet isn\u2019t ideal for applications that require\nlow latency, like online gaming.)\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Astranis launched its first satellite in April 2023, and though it\nwas initially working \u201cperfectly,\u201d an issue with a solar array put it out of\ncommission before it could start providing internet access to people in\nAlaska, as was originally planned.\n\nThe company already has orders to deploy nine more satellites over the next\ntwo years, though, and on April 10, it unveiled a new, larger model called\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\n\nAccording to Astranis, Omega will be able to provide 50 gigabits per second\n(Gbps) of bandwidth, four or five times more than its original \u201cMicroGEO\u201d\nmodel\u2019s 10-12 Gbps. It\u2019s just 50% heavier (400 kg vs 600 kg), though, which\nhelps keep launch costs down.\n\n\u201cAstranis Omega [is] a broadband communications system with better pound-for-\npound performance than any other geostationary satellite in orbit today,\u201d\nwrote Gedmark in a blog post.\n\nLooking ahead: Astranis expects to deploy its first Omega satellite in 2026,\nwith each one having a lifespan of about 8-10 years. As is the case with its\nMicroGEO satellites, the startup plans to operate the Omega satellites itself,\nleasing their broadband capacity to customers across the globe.\n\n\u201cThere are 3 to 4 billion people in the world that do not have reliable access\nto broadband internet...And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve gotta fix,\u201d said Gedmark.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!
