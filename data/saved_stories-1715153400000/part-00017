In 1993 the\ncollection was started and has been updated every 6 months since then. The\nreport lists the sites that have the 500 most powerful computer systems\ninstalled. The best Linpack benchmark performance achieved is used as a\nperformance measure in ranking the computers. The TOP500 list has been updated\ntwice a year since June 1993.\n\nThe Linpack Benchmark is a measure of a computer\u2019s floating-point rate of\nexecution. It is determined by running a computer program that solves a dense\nsystem of linear equations. The paper \u201cThe LINPACK Benchmark: Past, Present,\nand Future\u201d by Jack Dongarra, Piotr Luszczek, and Antoine Petitet provides a\nlook at the details of the benchmark and provides performance data in graphics\nform for a number of machines on basic operations.
