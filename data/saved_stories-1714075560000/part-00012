They can sell the space directly to the advertisers or\ngo through an intermediary. Ad.txt files are aimed at combating certain types\nof ad fraud.\n\nHowever, in the U.S. through the Registry Team, the Cybersecurity\nInfrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) explicitly forbids the use of .gov\nwebsites for any commercial activities that benefit private individuals or\nentities, including online advertising.\n\nThe company said it into any .gov U.S. government domains with the ability to\nhost programmatic ads, and found four domains with an ads.txt file that are\npotentially in violation of CISA rules:\n\n  * mcdowellcountywv.gov/ads.txt\n  * fortdeposital.gov/ads.txt\n  * cohassetpolicema.gov/ads.txt\n  * sports.celina-tx.gov/ads.txt\n\nAccording to their investigation, the first three domains each list only one\nvendor in their ads.txt file\u2014Google. The site sports.celina-tx.gov, however,\nlists dozens of partners in its ads.txt file. Although it displays no ads on\npublic pages, the footer suggests it is managed by a vendor named\nSportsEngine[.]com.\n\n## U.K. government sites and ad brokers\n\nHowever, in the UK, advertising is permitted on .gov.uk websites with certain\nrestrictions. The .gov and .gov.uk sites identified by Silent Push publish an\nads.txt file that specifies the companies allowed to automatically sell the\nsite\u2019s ad space to advertisers upon a visitor\u2019s arrival.\n\nA handful of authorities have been identified allegedly using the file\nincluding Transport for London, the country\u2019s national weather service the Met\nOffice, as well as various councils around England and Wales.\n\nSilent Push states: \u201cWhilst programmatic advertising is not prohibited on UK\ncouncil websites, allowing a Chinese ad vendor with a questionable past to\ncollect data on visitors to UK public sector websites is problematic for\nreasons that are self evident.\u201d\n\nThe Council Advertising Network (CAN) is a U.K.-based organization that\ncreates revenue for local authorities throughout the UK by managing digital\npremium and programmatic advertising on council websites.\n\nCAN oversees the ads.txt files for all the mentioned UK domains. These files\ncontained account IDs confirming that Yeahmobi was authorized to display ads\nand access visitor data from these domains.\n\nAfter ReadWrite reached out, CAN confirmed that Yeahmobi were being removed\nfrom their publisher ads.txt files. In a statement, CAN said: \u201cWe take these\nmatters very seriously, and after looking into this in some detail with the\nteam, we have never had any ad quality issues with Yeahmobi in the past, nor\nare we aware of any Chinese links, but as a precaution we are removing them\nfrom all our publisher ads.txt files until further notice.\n\n\u201cWe have also reached out to the native advertising partner working with them\nto ask for more insight into these claims,\u201d they added.\n\nUPDATED: With response from the Council Advertising Network\n\nFeatured image: Canva\n\n#### About ReadWrite\u2019s Editorial Process\n\nThe ReadWrite Editorial policy involves closely monitoring the tech industry\nfor major developments, new product launches, AI breakthroughs, video game\nreleases and other newsworthy events.
