Expand responsibly or lose. In the new version,\nmodern Catan needs energy. To get that energy players have to build power\nplants, and those plants can run on renewable energy or fossil fuels. Power\nplants operated on fossil fuels allow you to build faster but also create more\npollution. Too much pollution causes catastrophes.\n\nBuilding renewable energy-based power plants has benefits in the new game,\nincluding minimizing pollution for everyone, but it also makes you grow\nslower.

The reality is always so\nmuch more complex,\" said Benjamin Teuber, managing director of Catan's\nproduction company and co-developer of the new game. Games, he adds, need to\nbe fun.\n\nCatan: New Energies makes players choose between renewable energy or fossil\nfuel-based power plants. The latter allows you to grow faster but creates more\npollution. Catan GmbH hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nCatan GmbH\n\nCatan: New Energies makes players choose between renewable energy or fossil\nfuel-based power plants. The latter allows you to grow faster but creates more\npollution.\n\nCatan GmbH\n\nThe newest iteration of Catan will hit shelves this summer. And it aims to\nmirror reality in a couple of clear ways: Energy from fossil fuels creates\nmore planet-altering pollution than renewables; too much pollution leads to\nbad things; those bad things are felt unequally.\n\n\"Sometimes flooding hits everybody, just as we see [in the real world],\" said\nTeuber. \"It doesn't matter who created the pollution. It affects everyone.\"\n\nTeuber, who co-developed New Energies with his late dad, Klaus Teuber, said\nthe game was an old idea they dusted off during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's\none that's become increasingly relevant as the real world grapples with the\neffects of real pollution: a rapidly warming planet that's worsening\nwildfires, floods, and heatwaves.\n\nThe game's developers are aware of the relevancy. \"It's a very interesting\ntopic in every culture that we publish in,\" Teuber said.\n\nPolls show climate change is viewed as a major concern across many parts of\nthe world. But adapting to the changes and addressing its roots have proven\ndifficult. Teuber said he thinks board games can help move the conversation\nforward. Board games generally require people to sit around a shared table, to\nread each other, to negotiate and take risks, \"without having a severe and bad\nconsequence,\" he said. \"Unless divorce is the result.\"\n\nClimate change experienced through board games\n\nCatan: New Energies is not the only new board game centered on climate change.\nDaybreak, the latest game from the creator of Pandemic, a popular cooperative\nboard game, tasks players with working together to cut carbon emissions and\nlimit global warming.\n\nIn a blog post on Daybreak's website, the game's co-designer Matteo Menapace\nwrote that he and co-creator Matt Leacock were inspired to make the game\nbecause they were both worried about climate change and weren't sure what to\ndo about it.\n\n\"The problem with the question 'what can I do about climate change,' is how it\nimplies climate action is like a single-player game, with you alone fighting\nagainst this huge invisible enemy,\" Menapace wrote. They believe addressing\nclimate change and its causes will require a collective effort. That's why\nDaybreak requires \"total cooperation,\" Menapace wrote. \"It's a big leap from\nthe current state of climate (in)action, but not an unreasonable one... and we\naim for this game to play a role in accelerating this shift.\"\n\nCatan Studio, the developer and publisher of Catan games, isn't as explicit in\nits intentions with its new game. The phrase \"climate change\" doesn't show up\nin any of the Catan: New Energies' promotional materials, packaging, or\nrulebooks. \"Pollution\" is the catch-all term for the problem.\n\nTeuber said they talked about adding the term but decided to focus on energy\nand presenting players with the option of fossil fuels or renewable. \"We\nassume players will draw their own conclusions as they engage with the game,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe game's studio does note in its press materials that according to\n\"evidence-based research and expert sources, [the] new game elements will get\nplayers thinking and talking about important issues.\"\n\nA 2019 review of published research on board games and behavior by a team of\nJapanese researchers showed that \"as a tool, board games can be expected to\nimprove the understanding of knowledge, enhance interpersonal interactions\namong participants, and increase the motivation of participants.\" Though, it\nnoted, the number of published studies on the topic is limited.\n\nDialogue from gameplay\n\n\"What games are really powerful at is starting dialogues,\" said Sam\nIllingworth, an associate professor of science communication at Edinburgh\nNapier University in the UK.\n\nIn the gaming world, there's a concept called the Magic Circle \u2014 a theory\nattributed to Johann Huizinga, a Dutch cultural historian, who in the 1930's\nposited that play creates a separate world with separate rules.\n\n\"It's the idea that we suspend disbelief on the gaming table,\" Illingworth\nsaid. \"Like in the game Monopoly, it's perfectly good \u2013 strictly advisable \u2013\nfor me to want to bankrupt you, which is behavior that's morally repugnant\naway from the gaming table, but it means that those social hierarchies can\nbreak down and we can have conversations that we wouldn't normally be able to\nhave.\"\n\nIn 2019, Illingworth co-designed a playable expansion to the original Catan\nthat added climate change and sustainability to the gameplay. They called it\nCatan: Global Warming and posted the rules and instructions on how to adapt a\nregular Catan game online.\n\nIn the add-on, if players add too many greenhouse gasses, the whole island is\ndestroyed and nobody wins. \"So that creates a game state where psychologically\nthere's obvious causality between actions and what happens, right?\"\nIllingworth said. \"So rather than just having a conversation about what might\nhappen, you're actually experiencing it.\"\n\nIn Catan: New Energies, if pollution reaches too high a level to continue, the\nwin goes to the person who built the most renewable energy power plants.\n\nWhile workshopping the new game with colleagues, Teuber said they would often\nplay too aggressively, aiming to \"grow, grow, grow,\" they would build out\nfossil fuel power plants, he said. \"We always manage to over pollute.\"\n\nTest groups did the same. But after those games, the players would often come\nback and say, \"We had heavy discussions afterwards,\" Teuber said. \"We all felt\nkind of bad, we learned and thing or two, and the next game we played\ndifferently.\"\n\n  * fossil fuel\n  * renewable energy\n  * gaming\n  * air pollution\n  * board games\n  * climate change\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Climate\n\n#### Startups want to geoengineer a cooler planet.
