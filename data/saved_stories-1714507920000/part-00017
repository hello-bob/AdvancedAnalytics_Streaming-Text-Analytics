Still, we\u2019re repeating the same steps over and over again for every\n> project: designing the data model, setting up migrations and models,\n> installing Filament, creating panels and resources, setting up multitenancy\n> and billing, configuring CI, and the list goes on. That\u2019s why I built\n> Whizzy: to push your productivity beyond what frameworks already offer.\n\nZep Fietje\n\nDesigner of Filament Founder of Whizzy\n\n> Filament was built to make your domains front and center in your codebase,\n> not generic UI components. Whizzy\u2019s generation tools supplement that by\n> starting to describe your domains to Filament, wrapped up in a really neat\n> interface to control everything.\n\nDan Harrin\n\nFounder of Filament\n\n> Whizzy generated my first Laravel 11 app in less than a minute \ud83e\udd2f, complete\n> with 2 Filament panels and a bunch of models.
