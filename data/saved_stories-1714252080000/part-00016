When American consumers have no\nway of knowing who is showing up at their doors, and there is no\naccountability process in place, it creates safety risks, especially for women\nand the elderly.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to all three senators via email for comment.\n\nNewsletter\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nYour Morning Starts Here\n\nBegin your day with a curated outlook of top news around the world and why it\nmatters.\n\nBy clicking on SIGN ME UP, you agree to Newsweek's Terms of Use & Privacy\nPolicy.

The risk is related to using false information to\ncircumvent background checks and gain access to customers' home addresses.\n\nBut the companies told Newsweek that the claims brought forward by the\nlawmakers don't jive with their protocols.\n\nExclusively Available to Subscribers Try it now for $1\n\nRead more\n\n  * California gets 150,000 new citizens\n  * Donald Trump friend questioned at airport: \"Never been treated like that\"\n  * Mexican diplomat slams migrant crackdown, says America \"needs them\"\n\n\"To help ensure that Dashers are who they say they are and prevent access by\nindividuals looking to abuse our platform, we've built a robust, multi-layered\nidentity verification and safety screening process for anyone who wants to\ndeliver through our platform,\" a DoorDash spokesperson told Newsweek via email\non Friday.\n\n\"To be clear: there is no place on the DoorDash platform for those that can't\nor won't verify their identity. Every Dasher is required to have their own\nverified account.\"\n\nThe company also said that account sharing, or when individuals gain\nunauthorized access to or share Dasher accounts, is strictly prohibited and is\nin violation of the company's terms of service\u2014resulting in the individuals\nbeing deactivated from the platform if caught.\n\nPrior to being allowed to make deliveries on the company's behalf, every U.S.\nDasher undergoes what it described as \"multi-layered, ongoing verification,\"\nincluding verification of identity in addition to undergoing additional\ncriminal and motor vehicle (if applicable) background checks.\n\nThe same protocols exist at Grubhub, a spokesperson told Newsweek via email on\nFriday.\n\nVerification includes inputting a valid name and email address, as well as\nuploading an eligible ID and prompting the individual to take a photo with\ntheir phone that matches the uploaded ID. Drivers of vehicles and mopeds must\nupload images of the front and back of their driver's licenses.\n\nBackground checks include information such as a legal name, address and Social\nSecurity number.\n\n\"Account sharing is completely unacceptable on Grubhub and will result in\nimmediate termination,\" a Grubhub spokesperson said. \"Delivery partners on our\nplatform must pass an extensive background check and agree to the Grubhub\nDelivery Partner Terms of Use, which require maintaining the confidentiality\nand security of their account at all times.\n\n\"If we find anyone misrepresenting their identity or granting unauthorized\naccess to an account, they'll be removed from the platform.\"\n\nNewsweek also asked each company if they had any concerns about what the\nallegations could mean for their businesses, and if such concerns have been in\nany way relayed to the senators in question. No responses were received.\n\n\"All couriers who deliver with Uber are required to hold a valid right to work\nin the U.S., pass a criminal background check, and be over the age of 18,\" an\nUber Eats spokesperson told Newsweek via email. \"If a courier is found to be\nsharing their account or using a fraudulent account, we remove their access to\nour platform, no exceptions.\n\n\"We appreciate the senators' concerns and plan to respond to their letter with\nmore information on our strict policies and processes in place to help prevent\nand address account sharing.\"\n\nThe senators have requested for the companies to respond to the following\nquestions by May 6:\n\n  * What steps are you taking to increase security on your application and ensure that account holders are the only individuals delivering food through your services?\n  * What are the consequences for an account holder who sells access to their account?\n  * How many account holders have you suspended for selling access to their account?\n  * Have you received any reports from consumers regarding this growing problem? If so, how many?\n\nUpdate 4/26/24, 3:40 p.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Uber\nEats.\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nNick Mordowanec\n\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek reporter based in Michigan.
