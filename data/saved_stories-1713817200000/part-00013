QDEL should be on your radar.\n\nScharon Harding - 4/22/2024, 11:00 AM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty\n\n#### reader comments\n\n61\n\nWhat comes after OLED?\n\nWith OLED-equipped TVs, monitors, and other gadgets slowly becoming more\nreadily available at lower prices, attention is turning to what the next\nlandmark consumer display tech will be.\n\nMicro LED often features in such discussions, but the tech is not expected to\nstart hitting consumer devices until the 2030s. Display makers are also\nplaying with other futuristic ideas, like transparent and foldable screens.\nBut when it comes to technology that could seriously address top user\nconcerns\u2014like image quality, price, and longevity\u2014quantum dots seem the most\npertinent at the moment.\n\nQuantum dots are already moving in the premium display category, particularly\nthrough QD-OLED TVs and monitors. The next step could be QDEL, short for\n\"quantum dot electroluminescent,\" also known as NanoLED, screens. Not to be\nconfused with the QLED (quantum light emitting diode) tech already available\nin TVs, QDEL displays don't have a backlight. Instead, the quantum dots are\nthe light source. The expected result is displays with wider color spaces than\ntoday's QD-OLEDs (quantum dot OLEDs) that are also brighter, more affordable,\nand resistant to burn-in.\n\nIt seems like QDEL is being eyed as one of the most potentially influential\ndevelopments for consumer displays over the next two years.\n\nIf you\u2019re into high-end display tech, QDEL should be on your radar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## What is QDEL?\n\nYou may know QDEL as NanoLED because that's what Nanosys, a quantum dot\nsupplier developing the technology, calls it. QDEL has gone by other names,\nsuch as QLED\u2014before Samsung claimed that acronym for LCD-LED TVs that use\nquantum dots. You may also see QDEL referred to as QD-EL, QD-LED, or EL-QD. As\nthe alphabet soup suggests, there are still some things to finalize with this\ntech. This article will mostly use the term QDEL, with occasional references\nto NanoLED.\n\nIf none of those names sound familiar, it's probably because you can't buy any\nQDEL products yet. Suppliers suggest that could change in the next few years;\nNanosys is targeting 2026 for commercial availability.\n\nThat timeline seems pretty ambitious, though, considering the limited number\nof prototypes we've seen and the limitations still facing QDEL (more on that\nbelow). But even if we don't see QDEL for a while, there are reasons to keep\nan eye on the tech.\n\nDavid Hsieh, senior research director for displays at research firm Omdia,\ntold me via email that when it comes to consumer gadgets, he expects QDEL will\nmost impact TVs, PC displays, and the automotive industry. If commercialized\nand mass-produced, QDEL can have a cost-to-performance ratio better than that\nof OLED, but it would still struggle to compete with LCD-LED on a cost basis.\n\nA 2023 whitepaper (PDF) from Nanosys and manufacturing partner Sharp Display\ndescribes an inkjet printing manufacturing process that is applicable to QDEL\nmonitors and TVs. The photolithography process is reportedly harder because\nquantum dots get damaged in the process, but it can expand QDEL applications\nto include tablets, laptops, smartphones, wearables, and AR/VR products. Jeff\nYurek, Nanosys' VP of marketing, confirmed to me via email that Nanosys\nexpects to see QDEL products made with photolithography come to market first.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n61\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
