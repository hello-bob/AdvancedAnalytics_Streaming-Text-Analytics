Continued hope comes from a belief that autonomous vehicles and ones\nconnected to communications networks could help to meet global goals to reduce\nemissions and limit injuries and deaths in cars. The role of sustainable\nmobility looms large over the European Green Deal, whose 2050 deadline\ndovetails with a parallel \u201cVision Zero\u201d target in the United States to\neliminate roadway fatalities.\n\nThe new field of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, in which individual\ncars would communicate wirelessly with one another as well as traffic signs\nand other infrastructure, could help reach those targets. A paper published 11\nMarch in the IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology argues that\nV2X\u2014underpinned by 5G and 6G networks\u2014can \u201cpave the way toward safe,\naffordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems, as well as improve\nroad safety.\u201d As the paper notes, if V2X could dynamically coordinate traffic,\nthe result would be less congestion, freer-flowing transportation, safer\nstreets, and reduced emissions.\n\nIn 2021, more than 7,300 pedestrians were killed in the United States.\n\nThe researchers in Spain and Sweden who authored the paper focused on future\nsmart cities with high population density. They identify three current trends\nleading toward sustainable V2X communications: Climate-neutral infrastructure\nand vehicle-user equipment; \u201ccloudification\u201d and edge computing; and big data\nand AI.\n\nThe researchers envision a model with roadside units linked to both cellular\nand cloud-computing networks. These units would be able to communicate with\nsmart traffic signals, road sensors, units on board individual vehicles, and\nedge and cloud nodes. There\u2019s also a need to connect pedestrians and\nbicyclists so that vehicles and vehicle infrastructure know they\u2019re\nthere\u2014either through passive detection or by actively signaling the network\nwith onboard Internet of Things devices.\n\nIntegrating pedestrians into a V2X system could help stem a troubling rise in\npedestrian deaths in the U.S. since about 2009, especially at night. In 2021,\nmore than 7,300 pedestrians were killed in the United States, and 75 percent\nof those deaths occurred between sunset and sunrise.\n\nThe authors note the potential for an Internet of Vehicles\u2014a network of\nconnected autonomous vehicles, in other words\u2014that could boost communications\nefficiency by optimizing transmission rates, channels, and times. An Internet\nof Vehicles could create dynamic 3D maps of traffic and pedestrian flow,\ncommunicate object locations between cars to avoid collisions, and monitor air\npollution and vital signs of drivers or passengers in vehicles.\n\nOne challenge of connecting every car to a wireless network is the massive\namounts of generated data. In response, the researchers outline the potential\nfor 6G network trends\u2014including virtualization, moving network functions to\nthe cloud, and edge computing\u2014to handle the load.\n\nThere\u2019s also a place for AI in V2X systems. AI can enable real-world and real-\ntime fuel and emissions monitoring, as well as vehicle platooning, in which\nvehicles travel together in autonomous, tightly spaced chains to save fuel and\nfree up road space. It could also help with speed harmonization to gradually\nlower the speeds before congested areas and therefore eliminate stop-and-go\ntraffic.\n\nWith V2X and autonomous cars both in their infancy, Sandra Roger, one of the\npaper\u2019s authors, an IEEE Senior Member, and associate professor at Valencia\nPolytechnic University, acknowledged enormous challenges ahead, including\nthose that technology alone can\u2019t address. For one thing, data-privacy\nadvocates and fans of old-school human driving will likely shudder at the idea\nof centralized monitoring and control over streets and roads, despite\npotential upsides.\n\n\u201cUse cases such as speed harmonization would involve convincing drivers to\nleave some or all control over vehicle speed to automated systems, and this\nmay face resistance due to trust issues and perceived loss of control,\u201d Roger\nsaid in an email to IEEE Spectrum.\n\nRoger identified other challenges, such as legal liability in accidents,\ncybersecurity and privacy concerns, and regulatory agreement on vehicle-to-\nvehicle (V2V) protocols and safety standards. She is also concerned about\nstandardization and interoperability among automakers and other manufacturers.\n\nInfrastructure upgrades are another heavy lift. \u201cUpgrading traffic signal\nsystems to accommodate connected vehicles can be costly and disruptive,\nespecially in urban areas with heavy traffic,\u201d Roger said.\n\nStill, the authors recognize that V2X likely will not be in existence\neverywhere. They conclude: \u201cAddressing sustainable mobility in rural or\nsuburban areas will need a different solution,\u201d since V2X deployment seems\nunlikely due to those cost-benefit trade-offs.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * 5G Just Got Weird \u203a\n  * The Crash-Proof Car \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Vehicle-to-everything - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nautonomous vehiclesclimate techcellular networkswireless communicationsmart\ncities\n\nLawrence Ulrich\n\nLawrence Ulrich is an award-winning auto writer and former chief auto critic\nat The New York Times and The Detroit Free Press.\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nAerospaceNewsTelecommunications\n\n## How NASA is Hacking Voyager 1 Back to Life\n\n18 hours ago\n\n4 min read\n\n1\n\nAerospaceNewsComputing\n\n## \u201cVideo Games\u201d for Flies Shed Light on How They Fly\n\n05 May 2024\n\n3 min read\n\n2\n\nThe InstituteCareersNews\n\n## IEEE\u2019s Honor Society Expands to More Countries\n\n03 May 2024\n\n3 min read\n\n## Related Stories\n\nArtificial IntelligenceNewsTransportationJournal Watch\n\n## Neural Reactions to Fear Make AI Drive More Safely\n\nComputingNewsTransportation\n\n## The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d Doesn\u2019t Work for Self-Driving Cars\n\nRoboticsArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## Video Friday: Autonomous Car Drifting\n\n", "frontpage": false}
