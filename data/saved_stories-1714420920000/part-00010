Specifically:\n\n  1. The manufacturer must not supply devices that use default passwords, which can be easily discovered online, and shared. If the default password is used, a criminal could log into a smart device and use it to access a local network, or conduct cyber attacks.\n  2. The manufacturer must provide a point of contact for the reporting of security issues which \u2013 if ignored \u2013 could make devices exploitable by cyber criminals.\n  3. The manufacturer must state the minimum length of time for which the device will receive important security updates. When updates are no longer provided, devices are easier to hack, or may stop working as designed.\n\n### Note:\n\nMost smart devices are manufactured outside the UK, but the PSTI act also\napplies to all organisations importing or retailing products for the UK\nmarket. Failure to comply with the act is a criminal offence, with fines up to\n\u00a310 million or 4% of qualifying worldwide revenue (whichever is higher).\n\n## What smart products are affected by the new law?\n\nThe law applies to any \u2018consumer smart device\u2019 that connects either to the\ninternet, or to a home network (for example by wifi). This may include:\n\n  * smart speakers, smart TVs and streaming devices\n  * smart doorbells, baby monitors and security cameras\n  * cellular tablets, smartphones and games consoles\n  * wearable fitness trackers (including smart watches)\n  * smart domestic appliances (such as light bulbs, plugs, kettles, thermostats, ovens, fridges, cleaners and washing machines)\n\n## How is the NCSC helping retailers and consumers?\n\nThe NCSC has produced a \u2018point of sale\u2019 (POS) leaflet for retailers to\ndistribute in-store to their customers. It explains how the PSTI regulation\naffects consumers, and why it\u2019s important to choose smart products that\nprotect against the most common cyber attacks.\n\nWe\u2019d encourage all retailers to download and print the POS leaflet from the\nlink below. This can be distributed free of charge.\n\nWe\u2019ve already worked alongside major retailers to produce co-branded versions\nof these materials. If you\u2019d like to add your own organisation\u2019s name or logo\nto the leaflet, please contact us directly on citizensteam@ncsc.gov.uk.\n\nThe reverse side of the leaflet explains the important steps consumers should\nfollow before they start using their smart devices. These steps are summarised\nbelow. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the NCSC\u2019s guidance\n\u2018Smart devices: using them safely in your home\u2019.\n\n## How can consumers make sure their smart devices are secure?\n\nUnlike conventional electrical items, consumers can't simply switch on a smart\ndevice and start using it immediately. Here are the two most important things\nto do.\n\n  1. 1\n\n#### Check the default settings\n\nSome smart devices might not be secure when first switched on, so consumers\nshould check the following:\n\n     * If the device comes with a default password (either to control the device itself, or to access an \u2018app\u2019 for the device), they should change it.\n     * Criminals know all the obvious passwords (like \u20181234\u2019), so consumers should create a secure password, for example by combining three random words.\n     * If the device or app offers two-step verification (2SV), consumers should turn it on. 2SV (which is sometimes called multi-factor authentication or MFA) makes it much harder for criminals to access devices, even if they know the password.\n\n  2. 2\n\n#### Install the latest software and app updates\n\nApplying updates promptly will protect smart devices from criminals and also\nadds new features, keeping devices working as they should.\n\n     * If consumers receive a prompt to update a device (or app), they should not ignore it.\n     * Consumers should turn on the 'automatic updates\u2019 option if available (so they don\u2019t need to remember to apply future updates).\n     * For detailed instructions about updating a specific device, consumers should refer to the support area within the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\n## Download the POS leaflet\n\nThe following leaflet is available as a PDF file. Please contact us if you\u2019d\nlike to receive this in a different file format, or if you'd like to produce a\nversion that contains your own branding.\n\n#### Carla V Citizen Resilience Officer, NCSC\n\n## Downloads\n\n  * pdf\n  * 311 KB\n\n#### New security law for smart devices - April 2024\n\nLeaflet explaining why this new law is required and how it affects you - as a\nconsumer.\n\n## Topics\n\nBack to top\n\nDownload / Print article PDF\n\n##### Share\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\n##### Share\n\n##### Copy Link\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\n##### Share\n\n##### Copy Link\n\n##### Written By\n\nCarla V\n\nCitizen Resilience Officer, NCSC\n\n  * ##### Published\n\n    * 29 April 2024\n\n  * ##### Written For\n\n    * Individuals & families\n    * Small & medium sized organisations\n    * Large organisations\n\n  * ##### Part of blog\n\n    * NCSC publications\n\n##### Written By\n\nCarla V\n\nCitizen Resilience Officer, NCSC\n\n  * ##### Published\n\n    * 29 April 2024\n\n  * ##### Written For\n\n    * Individuals & families\n    * Small & medium sized organisations\n    * Large organisations\n\n  * ##### Part of blog\n\n    * NCSC publications\n\nBack to top\n\n## Also see\n\nBLOG POST\n\n  * 18 April 2024\n\n#### 'NCSC Cyber Series' podcast now available\n\nListen to all five episodes now, covering a wide range of cyber security\ntopics.\n\nGUIDANCE\n\n#### Guidance for high-risk individuals on protecting your accounts and\ndevices\n\nNEWS\n\n  * 9 November 2023\n\n#### Black Friday bargain hunters warned of enhanced online scams after\nmillions lost last year\n\nLatest Cyber Aware campaign aims to help shoppers protect themselves online in\nthe run up to the festive period.\n\n## Follow us\n\n## ABOUT NCSC\n\n  * What we do\n  * What is cyber security?\n  * Equality, diversity and inclusion\n  * Incident management\n  * Leadership team\n  * Careers\n\n## INFORMATION FOR...\n\n  * Individuals & families\n  * Self employed & sole traders\n  * Small & medium sized organisations\n  * Large organisations\n  * Public sector\n  * Cyber security professionals\n\n## ADVICE & GUIDANCE\n\n  * All topics\n  * All articles\n  * Cyber Aware\n\n## EDUCATION & SKILLS\n\n  * Schools\n  * Higher education\n  * Professional skills & training\n  * Working with the NCSC\n  * CyBOK\n  * Research & Academia\n  * CyberFirst\n\n## PRODUCTS & SERVICES\n\n  * Overview\n  * Browse products & services\n  * Verify a supplier\n  * NCSC certification\n  * Evaluation partners\n  * Cyber Essentials\n  * Active Cyber Defence (ACD)\n\n## KEEP UP TO DATE\n\n  * CYBERUK\n  * NCSC blog\n  * NCSC news\n  * Reports & advisories\n  * Speeches\n  * Subscribe\n\n## ABOUT THIS WEBSITE\n\n  * Privacy notice\n  * Cookies\n  * Accessibility\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Social media policy\n\n## USEFUL LINKS\n\n  * GCHQ\n  * MI5\n  * SIS\n  * NPSA\n  * GOV.UK\n\n## CONTACT THE NCSC\n\n  * General enquiries\n  * Media Centre\n  * Report an incident\n  * Report a vulnerability\n  * Report phishing scam\n  * Verify an NCSC contact\n\n## Search\n\n### Popular searches\n\nCyber Aware\n\nCyber Essentials\n\nCYBERUK\n\nPasswords\n\nPhishing\n\nRansomware\n\n", "frontpage": false}
