How would you describe that\nproject?\n\nIt's actually one of the projects that I love the most. It started in the\nUnited States when I had a Fulbright Scholarship at USC\u2019s School of Cinematic\nArt in 2017. I interviewed a group of ten Mexican children that were living in\nLos Angeles. I asked them how they would redesign the city if they were the\nleaders.\n\nI fell in love with their answers. So when I returned in Romania, I initiated\nthe project, Government of Children. I interviewed 100 Romanian children to\nsee how they would design the next century of our country. We interviewed them\nand documented the interviews in a film.\n\nThen we collaborated with architects, landscape designers, 3D artists \u2014 to\ncreate these futuristic prototypes of society that they imagined. It was a\ncollaboration between kids and adults, ultimately. What came out was a virtual\nreality experience called Tangible Utopias, which had initially just one\nfuturistic city, then three, then five, then ten, and so on. We are still\nworking on it so it's an open world right now.\n\nThis year we\u2019re doing the second Government of Children, and expanding to\nother countries. We interviewed children in Kyrgyzstan, Bolivia, India, the\nRepublic of Moldova, and Romania again, and a community of kids with sight\ndeficiency. Together with them, we prototyped Velvet City, which has buildings\nmade of velvet so that you cannot get hurt.\n\nAnd that, to me, was one of the most transformative processes I have been\nthrough as an artist. I just love the interaction with this community, and I\nfeel a huge responsibility in delivering their ideas. There are so many\nnuances to it.\n\nArchitectural prototype of a blooming building designed in Midjourney,\nprompted by Ioana Mischie, serving as a inspiration for Government of Children\n2, feature doc, currently in post-production phase, produced by Studioset.\n\nLike what?\n\nEvery country differs heavily. For example, when I asked the kids in Cameroon\nhow they would see the ideal futuristic city, all of them, all the 20 kids,\nwere saying that for them, the ideal futuristic city has potable water. We\ngenerally go for cities that are highly edgy and ultra modernized and ultra\ninnovative. But then these communities care about things that other countries\ndon't even consider anymore. My long term goal is to create this project not\nonly with an artistic outcome, but also as a societal manifesto.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see the state of our societies through the eyes of kids\nand to build on it. This is why I fell in love with transmedia storytelling to\nbegin with \u2014 not only as an art form, but also as a prototyping tool, because\nwe can actually use film and VR to prototype future societies.\n\nI'm interested in the words people choose to use for their practice. I wonder\nif I can ask you about transmedia and why that\u2019s the term you\u2019re drawn to.\nWhat does that term, transmedia, mean for you?\n\nI came across it as a student, that Henry Jenkins created the term. Later\nHenry was my professor at USC. It describes a holistic form of art, a holistic\nform of storytelling that is not limited to only one format. It's not limited\nto only what we are trained in school \u2014 \u201chey, write 52 pages long for a script\nfor television.\u201d It's mostly about, \u201chey, create a concept for a holistic\nworld.\u201d\n\nThen you can expand it through multiple platforms to multiple target\naudiences, to multiple purposes, ultimately. It\u2019s a holistic approach,\nsometimes associated with world building. But I use this term because I want\nto pay a tribute to my professor, to Henry Jenkins, who coined it.\n\nRight now, I'm prototyping a format of concepts that is not only transmedia,\nbut ideally transdisciplinary, transpatial \u2014 in a way that a concept can apply\nto multiple countries, not just to one. It's also trans-perspectivist, in the\nsense that if you have a certain situation, you can depict it from multiple\nperspectives, not just one.\n\nI'm also playing with what I love to call transreal storytelling, which is\nplaying with a story in reality, but also in virtual reality. How do you\ncreate the bridge between the two, the two realities, if you will, and many\nothers?\n\nThis term inspired me to be creative about the practice that I have and to\nkeep searching for new methodologies and ways of practice. It's a methodology\nthat I use and try to expand on. It\u2019s a transmedia futurism, using\nstorytelling for prototyping futures.\n\nAnd all of this was before today\u2019s big AI boom, right?\n\nWhen this happened, five years ago, there was none of this AI.\n\nHas AI changed your process or made anything new possible? How are you folding\nthis kind of \u201cfuturistic\u201d technology into your practice?\n\nDuring my PhD, I coined this concept called Infinite Cinema. I was inspired by\nseveral movements in the cinema world, such as expanded cinema from the 60s \u2014\nGene Youngblood said that expanded cinema is a form of expanded consciousness,\nand I was inspired by many other movements like interactive cinema, touch\ncinema, culinary cinema, vertical cinema, live cinema and so on.\n\nSo I ended up creating infinite cinema more as a philosophy of, let's say,\nartistic utopia somehow. But when I created this concept, there was no\ntechnology for it. Like, it was mostly a philosophy of creating infinite\nstories, having infinite authorship, and having an infinite form of\nspectatorship, but there was no way to bring it to life with the technology we\nhad back then, five years ago \u2014\n\nHow did you describe infinite cinema five years ago?\n\nWell, it was hard to describe through practical case studies! So I was mostly\ndescribing it from a theoretical point of view. For example, for the\nauthorship, I was saying an infinite cinema work of art doesn't have just one\nauthor, but mostly a network of authors, someone who initiates a concept, then\nsomeone who continues it, then someone who evaluates it, and so on.\n\nSo it's a chain of authors that continues through time and space. Then I would\ndescribe this idea of infinite explorers in a way or the equivalent of\nspectators, and I would describe them in comparison. Like, for example, in the\npast, spectators were looking at the Mona Lisa or any kind of painting or film\nfrom afar, right? But now they are watching it from within. And basically they\nare also having this freedom to jump from one world to the other.\n\nSo you were grounding it kind of theoretically, and then aiming to produce\nthis effect through whatever storytelling tools might have been available.\n\nI was prototyping these schemes \u2014 \u201cwhat could this look like?\u201d Government of\nChildren, for example, could be seen as a prototype for multiple potential\nauthors in the future, because the kids will grow and they can turn into the\nleaders of the project for new generations of kids.\n\nI didn't have any particular case study that is holistic enough to explain the\nconcepts. But now with the emergence of AI, I feel we are tapping into a form\nof collective consciousness that is already there. Like infinite authorship is\nalready within the AI in just one picture in some ways. So it's interesting\nbecause it somehow accelerates the theory in a very funny way.\n\nBecause when we look at an image it\u2019s produced from this collection of images.\nSo in a sense, the theory became practical!\n\nI remember I had this conversation with my professor many years ago when\ntransmedia was seen as this abstract terminology and the practice was behind\nit somehow. So the theory was ahead of the practice. Now I feel it's the other\nway around.\n\nSomehow the practice is ahead of the theory, and we try to keep up to adjust\nthe two in a very harmonious manner. So it's a funny setting, but I think a\nvery intriguing one for anyone in this world. Like I used to joke with one of\nmy friends, perhaps these kinds of transitions only happen once a century,\nright? In some ways we are super lucky to witness this kind of technological\nand philosophical transition. And of course, we have the responsibility of\nusing it for constructive purposes because it can go wild, it can affect\nethics, but hopefully we will have the wisdom to use it well.\n\nWhen did you first start working with AI in the practical sense?\n\nI first experimented with AI, actually, for Government of Children. We simply\nran out of budget.\n\nWe created a lot of CGI, and at some point we ran out of budget and we didn't\nhave money to visualize all the ideas that the kids had. So we took AI as an\nopportunity to visualize some of the ideas we couldn't afford.\n\nI feel it brings added value into the film to see them in comparison to the\nhuman designed CGI. It's a beautiful case study right now. So the film will be\nlaunched probably next year, but we are still working on it to finish the post\nproduction. But this was perhaps my first interaction with AI in film and it\nwas a very pleasing one, and one that felt rewarding also for the kids I\ninteracted with.\n\nThen for the Story & Code program, it\u2019s a very interesting experience because\nI work in the same team with Stein, who is an animator, and has huge\nexperience with all the technicalities and methodologies of animation.\n\nSo I could focus on experimenting with AI. What we discovered is that\ninitially, most of our original ideas for stories were narrative, shaped by\nour familiarity with film stories. So most of our concepts were action driven,\nmotion driven and very cinematic. And while playing with AI without a concept,\nfor example, just for understanding the technology, we realized there are so\nmany other concepts to explore that have no connection to film directly.\n\nFor example, one of our ideas was to create an Instagram project about\nmemories and how we crop reality to include or exclude different details. For\nexample, if the two of us take the same ferry trip, we will remember different\ndetails. Perhaps a shoelace, a sunlight accent, hair in the wind or something\nlike that.\n\nWe were intrigued by having many, many details of certain memories and having\na continuous journey that people could feed with information about their own\nmemories. And basically, on Instagram, it would be displayed as an endless\nstory, in a way, with details from our memories. And it would be like a\ncollective memory consciousness. But this is, let's say, a more philosophical\nidea.\n\nWe have at least 50 other ideas. That's the funny part. It's a technology that\nallows you to be very playful because you have so much time to try and to fail\nor succeed. You can be very prolific. This is our case right now, in some ways\nwe are over prolific!\n\nWe need to trim down our experimentation and to really choose the essence,\nwhich will be important. But right now we have this odyssey of experimentation\nand surprises. For example, sometimes we prompt a certain script and we get\nsomething surprising that takes us into a completely different place. You\nstart from something, but you somehow co-create with AI indirectly and you end\nup having something that is different, sometimes better.\n\nAt the same time, I'm not personally, I don't know, a fan of AI. I'm mostly a\nconcept driven person and less of a platform driven person, so everything\nstarts from a powerful concept and then gets expanded. My core activity is\ncreative practice and trying to come up with unconventional solutions for\nvarious kinds of messages that I want to share with this world. I think we\nneed to use AI wisely and have a powerful concept before using it. I believe a\nlot in combining the best skills of humans with the best skills of machine\nlearning and to have holistic outcomes. I'm not so passionate about trying the\nlatest technologies just for the sake of trying it. I'm still confident in\nstorytelling as a human force.\n\nAs somebody who has worked with collaborative structures, with humans of\ndiverse ages and international backgrounds \u2014 I wonder where you see AI fitting\nin. Do you see AI as like a collaborator, or more as a platform for\nfacilitating that collaboration? Or as a media format of its own? How do you\nconceptualize that relationship?\n\nMaybe I see it as a support system. When I talk about film and VR, I've been\nstudying this for years, I feel comfortable doing it. But I have a passion in\nthe field of fashion, and I never had a chance to study it. Right. And in this\nfield I also don't have any drawing talent. If I were to create a fashion\nproject, even just a concept driven one, AI is extremely helpful to help me\nshape a mood or a specific collection.\n\nAt the same time, I think it has the danger of standardization. Personally,\nafter a while a platform like Midjourney becomes very repetitive and\npredictable. The danger of AI is the repetitiveness and the lack of\ninnovation, because it's only based on data from the past. It's very hard to\ntrain an AI to innovate. It will always refer to data that existed previously.\n\nSo my current challenge is, how can I innovate using AI, perhaps focusing my\nown mind and heart on the core of innovation. This is what I'm trying to\nfigure out \u2014 how can I contribute to what AI cannot offer?\n\nOf course, this is right now, I don't know what will happen in ten years.\nPerhaps we will also have AI inventors, or who knows? But right now, we need\nto train ourselves for something Pagan Kennedy called Inventology. It would be\nso nice to actually have schools focusing on innovation and invention and\ninviting kids and adults to actually invent the next objects, the next needed\nlayers of our world. I'm a very strong advocate for this.\n\nWorking with children to imagine the future, and now thinking about AI as\nanother input, you really have all these different input streams that are\ninteracting with each other. I wonder if there are strategies for steering\nthrough these streams, ways to differentiate between these imaginaries when\nyou're working with kids, designers, artists and AI?\n\nI'm having this dilemma every day because right now we already have around 20\nfuture cities prototyped in different manners and methodologies, with most of\nthem with human teams. Recently we started to include AI as well. I was\nthinking of creating a project called the Atlas of Tangible Utopias, where I\ncould include all of them and simply say for each: how it was created, what\nwas the method behind it, etc. So that everyone can compare and contrast and\nconclude which one they like better? This is my current way to organize what\nwe are doing, just being transparent about how we are doing everything.\n\nI usually also every, I don't know, three years or every five years, I try to\nwrite an article about the practice and to kind of say what was the hardship\nwe went through? What were our observations from interacting with kids but\nalso with adults? What were the ups and downs? And it always differs. I\nrecently did it with ten children from the Republic of Moldova, and it always\ncomes out differently because children operate in their own different way.\n\nAnd when you combine or remix their ideas with the ideas of other adults, it's\nalways a surprising result. But also, I need to mention, after leading more\nthan probably 600 interviews, there are patterns that emerge. I'm happy to say\nit's a generation that loves nature and they are very keen on preserving\nnature. This is just one of the elements we encounter in all of the futuristic\ncities.\n\nI'm a very dedicated systemic thinker. I love to create systems, not only\nprojects. And this is why this project is so intriguing to me, because it\nobliges me to create a system for, say, how can you travel through these\ncities? I wanted to create a website so that you can choose which kids from\nwhich countries to hear, which ages, social backgrounds and so on. Then the\nfilm is customized to your own interests.\n\nRight now we are doing it the classic way, editing the film.I have to choose\nsome ideas to leave some others out. But this is my dream for the future, to\ngive this power to the spectators. And this is just one of the many projects,\nbut I love creating these ontological projects.\n\nThat\u2019s a great term, what are some examples?\n\nWe also have this piece on adapting human dreams in VR. I started it in a very\ndifficult moment of my life when my father had a brain tumor. I learned that\npeople with brain tumors often cannot dream anymore. So I started to collect\ndream narratives, and I\u2019ve adapted the first one in VR with the hope that this\nproject will also travel \u2014 not only in museums, but also in hospitals and\nperhaps be used in a therapeutic manner. And it didn't happen, the therapeutic\npart, because the pandemic came and no one could enter hospitals anymore.\n\nBut I'm hoping to achieve this therapeutic layer one day, because I feel in my\nmind, art is not just made for a museum or a cinema hall or a headset. Art\nexists and should exist everywhere in society, in schools, in hospitals, on\nthe streets. I believe these are the best display means for any artistic\nproject. And when I say infinite cinema, I also mean creating projects that\nnot only belong to the cinema, but belong anywhere, to a village or to a super\nhigh end city. They can speak to you because they speak about universal things\nwe have in common.\n\nIt\u2019s been fun for me to contemplate the idea of a cinematic experience that\nlasts forever, but how long is forever with these projects? What limits are\nyou up against?\n\nI'm aware that our societies have constraints, but I would love to create\nthese projects in an ongoing manner for the long term, even after I will not\nbe on planet Earth anymore. I'm hoping to somehow create a mechanism for them\nto continue. But we still operate in a system where you get funding for one\nstandalone project, not for a long term project.\n\nSo every year we start from scratch, which is the paradox, the power world. So\nno matter how much I would love to advocate for infinite cinema or transmedia\nstorytelling, I do know how difficult this is, especially in a country like\nRomania, to actually have continuity in your practice.\n\nIt's not easy.\n\nSometimes you need to do a lot of pro bono work combined with, at times\ncommercial work to make it survive. But in the long run, I believe there is\nsomething truly pioneering and truly beautiful emerging.I guess this is what\nkeeps us fighting in some ways.\n\nAny reservations you have about how these technologies are being rolled out?\nSome of the Blockchain and NFT stuff is very tied to this promise of\ncontinuity; but there are also a lot of controversies in that space \u2014 AI, of\ncourse, is no stranger to controversy either \u2014 maybe even VR.\n\nOh, I'm super skeptical as well. I usually start from being skeptical before\nattempting any solutions. The big concern for me is not confusing continuity\nwith addiction. I feel contemporary technology is highly addictive. It obliges\nyou to stay stuck to a screen.\n\nPeople are spending more time in front of their screen than the amount they\nspend sleeping, for example, which is super worrying, right? Like, our eyes\ndon't rest anymore. They are always paying attention to something, always\nabsorbing something, sometimes not even what is helpful for us to absorb. So\nit's a very worrying situation.\n\nMy biggest question is, how can we use technology for good? How can we\nactually interrupt this addiction wisely? Let's say a transmedia artwork can\nhave both a virtual part, but also a part that happens in real life. You could\ninterrupt a project in a very meaningful manner and enjoy the sunlight, and\nthen go back after a while and contemplate further. We need these strategies\nto make sure that we don't alienate people. My mission is certainly not\ncreating ongoing projects where people would not blink. It\u2019s about ongoing\nconcepts.\n\nBut the point is, of course, we need time to enjoy life in so many different\nways than just being exposed to an artwork. Government of Children, it's an\ninteresting case study because we have the film, we have the VR, but we also\nhave a lot of educational debate, activities, and games around the project.\nWhen we display it in schools, it's a balance between screen time \u2014 which is\nusually tiny \u2014 and debate, or actual drawing. I believe in this mix.\n\nDuring my PhD I was upset about this idea that everyone was coming up with\ndystopias for the future. All of these dystopias are claiming it's an excess\nof technology, an excess of robots, no more people anymore. And I was like,\nbut wait, we don't have to dive into only science fiction, we can create\nanother type of fiction.\n\nSo I created another genre called Noetic Fiction, which instead of inviting\nyou to create futures around the advancement of technology, it actually\ninvites you to create and imagine futures around the advancement of human\nconsciousness. Like, how could this world evolve if we would evolve\ndifferently and we would behave differently?\n\nOne of the kids I interviewed really enriched this opinion. I was sharing with\nher the results and these beautiful futuristic cities, and she was telling me,\nyeah, all these cities look amazing. But I don't think the future will only\nconsist of beautiful buildings. I think it should consist of beautiful humans\n\u2014 how will humans behave and treat one another? And I was like, wow, you're so\nright.\n\nYou're a genius!\n\nWe need to think about ourselves first in terms of how to shape our own minds\nand hearts in a more constructive manner. Because right now many of us feel\nvery disoriented and it's just not right to have teenagers that feel so\ndisappointed about life, right? I mean, they are in perhaps one of the most\nactive parts of their lives.\n\nStill from Tangible Utopias: The Tubes City, VR Experience, Written/Directed\nby Ioana Mischie, Art Director and 3D Artist: Alexandru Pop, produced by\nStoryscapes\n\nHow do you think we can find that kind of optimism in our own practice? I\nstruggle with optimism in the design space right now, because so much of it\nseems to be entangled with a kind of narrow \u2014 often exploitative \u2014 view of\nwhat technology is meant to do and who it is designed for.\n\nSo I don't know. I start from the premise that stories and concepts do shape\nthe world we live in. Like every single thing, a chair, a table, a door,\neverything was created from an idea first. So my expectation is if we come up\nwith better concepts and better genres and better methodologies, we can\nactually end up living in better societies and better neighborhoods and better\nart communities.\n\nI'm pretty sure there is causality there. We rarely think about it because as\nartists, we go to film school or to another art school and you directly learn\nthe craft, but you rarely think about the essence of that craft or how it can\nbe completely revolutionized. Actually, in the US, I think you're doing this\nmore often than us, in Romania. In Romania, a lot of people take things for\ngranted and formats for granted, and they don't necessarily think about\npushing boundaries at the same pace that US students and professors do.\n\nI also think a lot about the way people talk on LinkedIn. It is only about\nachievements. Like, okay, achievements, achievements, ways of success and\nmeasuring success. I think at times we just need to stop, just to stop from\ndoing anything and just contemplate on where we are now. How can we contribute\nas artists? What kind of new formats do we need? What kind of new stories do\nwe need, and do we want?\n\nWe need these conversations before just rushing into things, because otherwise\nthe ones that are paving the way are, let's say, the technology creators for\nVR, right? I mean, the headset owners are the ones that are commissioning the\ncontent and the ones that are generating the practical trends. Right? These\ntrends should come from more directions, not just from the technological\nstakeholders, because they would be mostly interested in having people in\ntheir headsets as long as possible. The essence of our world is not just about\nthat.\n\nIt's also about how we can learn things, how we can stimulate lifelong\nlearning, communication between generations \u2014 which is so hard to facilitate\nnow because the generations are completely disrupted from each other. And,\nyeah, it's a complex, complex world. But I do feel we have a lot of tools to\ncreate amazing projects and amazing methodologies. But, yeah, it's not easy.\n\nHow does that thinking make its way into an artistic practice?\n\nIn my creative practice, I'm usually driven, like probably the majority of\ncreators, to aesthetics. I want my projects to look a certain way. I focus a\nlot on art direction, on the quality of visuals and audio and so on. But I\nthink we need to talk about ethics just as much as we talk about aesthetics.\n\nWhen we watch a film, okay, we watch a documentary. But if that documentary\nwas filmed without the consent of people I don't know, we are already entering\na very blurry ethical landscape. So perhaps the film is brilliant, but let's\ndiscuss also what's the process behind it so that we can ideally achieve\nartworks that are brilliant also from an ethical point of view. Right? And\nthat's harder to define because, what is a brilliantly ethical project? We\ndon't even know with certainty what ethics is.\n\nSo, as a funny thing, I was proposing back in the days, just like we have a\ndirector of photography in films, how about we have a director of ethics,\nsomeone who is in some ways responsible with social research or the research\nof the impact of the project in certain communities. That person could be a\nstrong facilitator for expanding the horizons of a certain work.\n\nI'm playing with this right now, but I'm coming from Romania, which was an ex\ncommunist country, and I don't want by any chance to fall under censorship\nbecause the director of ethics could tell you, \u201coh, this cannot be done!\u201d\nThat's not the point. Mostly I mean, to have an advisor that encourages you to\nhave perspectives from many fronts, let's say, or, I don't know, to kind of\nmake sure you don't impose your own judgment.\n\nWe need to talk about it. Sometimes people consider it dangerous because who\nare you to talk about ethics? People think you need to be a saint in order to\ntalk about ethics. I don't think you need to be a saint. You just need to be a\nhuman being and to have an open dialogue about this.\n\nIn the AI space right now, a lot of people see AI and they just immediately\nsay, well, that's unethical. It's built on data sets of other artists and\nthings like that. You use AI occasionally, in a broad set of tools where human\ncreativity, creativity of kids, is obviously at the center. But we are both\nworking through lots of questions, pretty openly, in the Story and Code\nprogram. How are you navigating these issues about AI?\n\nI think it's important to talk about it. I remember I attended a workshop. I\ndon't remember the name of the speaker that said this. He was saying that\nright now we are using AI and we are surprised by it because we are witnessing\nit for the first time. So everything is a surprise for us.\n\nBut our kids might use it nonstop and for them, it might be an over\nstandardized practice. Right now the novelty of AI fuels a lot of controversy\nand a lot of enthusiasm. Like everything is, if you want, super polarized in a\nway, because it's so new. We are either in love, hating it, we just have these\nstrong emotions about it. No one is neutral about AI.\n\nI think we need to keep a skeptical eye \u2014 to be creative with it, but in some\nways not to, let's say, change our entire creative practice around it and to\nbecome dependent on AI exclusively. I don't think that\u2019s the value of our\ncreativity.\n\nAnother aspect about the current context is that the emergence of AI invites\npeople to think about posthumanism more. I don't think that's the right\ndirection of thinking, or perhaps I'm not the one to judge, but I believe more\nin something called post-technologism. I believe humans are here to enrich the\nplanet. These technologies, all of them, are very ephemeral. And the question\nis not, oh, who will come after humans? Like, it\u2019s not which kind of robot\nreplaces us. But what will come after AI should depend on what kind of\ntechnology we need to express valuable ideas.\n\nAnd right now, I feel AI is an interesting step. I really love playing with\nit. It's not the last one. It's not a destination, it's a tool we play with.\nWe will conclude with the affordances of AI, what are the best practices\naround it? How can you use it? Is it an art form in itself? Is it\nsynthography, this art of synthesis? Or is it just a tool to help you do film\nand classical art forms?\n\nAlso, the copyright question is very important. Who owns those artworks? But\nultimately, I think even the copyright topic is so biased with the conventions\nof our world, right? Because ultimately we perhaps don't need the idea of\ncopyright in the way it was understood by now, because there are so many\nfamous artists that were inspired by the imaginaries of other people, but they\nwere the only ones credited. So in this sense, AI is not necessarily so\nunfair.\n\nIt's just acknowledging that it's based on many data sets, it's based on many\nimaginaries, and we finally have the chance to combine and compile and see\nalso, it's so fascinating to see what people are creating with AI and to see\nwhat they\u2019re interested in. I don't plan to use AI with shadowy intentions or\nto make myself, let's say, more lazy by using AI. But I do plan to use it when\nI feel there is no other better way to dive into a form of visual collective\nconsciousness.\n\nIf I were to compile and research thousands of pictures by myself, it would\ntake ten years to do so. So I think let's appreciate the bright side of it. At\nthe same time, while not exaggerating on it, there are more aspects. There was\nthis idea of the quantified self, right? There was this theoretician, Steve\nLohr who said we are not living in capitalism anymore. We are living in data-\nism, which is a society driven by data. And our purpose in life is to provide\ndata. I can see this happening right now, but I don't believe in this system.\n\nI'm hoping to replace this system with something much better. I don't believe\nin this movement of the quantified self. I don't think our life resides in the\nnumber of steps we take or the number of data posts we make. I believe a lot\nin what Lee Humphries called the Qualified Self, which is, what is the quality\nof our inner selves? What is unmeasurable? I believe in that.\n\nThanks for reading!
