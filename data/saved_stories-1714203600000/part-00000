(Photo from JImmy Carter Presidential Library)\n\nWashington, D.C., July 18, 2023 \u2013 A set of highly secret emergency action\nplans kept inside the closely guarded \u201cFootball\u201d that traveled with the\nPresident at all times and that would give the federal government sweeping\nemergency powers were of \u201cdoubtful legality,\u201d \u201cbadly out of date,\u201d and \u201ceven\nillegal,\u201d according to top government officials whose views are memorialized\nin declassified records posted today by the National Security Archive.\n\nSince the late 1950s, U.S. military personnel traveling with the President\nhave carried a special case known variously as the \u201csatchel,\u201d the \u201cblack bag,\u201d\nthe \u201cemergency actions pouch\u201d and, as it is perhaps best known, the\n\u201cFootball.\u201d Epitomizing presidential control of nuclear weapons, the Football\nand the military aides who carry it enable the President to make decisions\nabout the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a sudden military crisis.\n\nWhile the existence of the Football has been known since the 1960s, reliable\ndetails about its contents have been relatively scarce. During the Cold War,\nand possibly later, they included proclamations and executive orders known as\nPresidential Emergency Action Documents (PEADs) for use in a national\nemergency. Edward A. McDermott, who led the federal Office of Emergency\nPlanning in the 1960s, said the purpose of the documents was \u201cto clothe the\nPresident with formal emergency powers,\u201d although he said some were of\n\u201cdoubtful legality,\u201d perhaps because they included the suspension of habeas\ncorpus, a declaration of martial law, and the authorization of mass arrests\nand arbitrary detentions.\n\nToday\u2019s posting by the National Security Archive includes several documents\nabout the contents of the PEADs and the Carter administration\u2019s efforts to\nrevise directives considered \u201cbadly out of date.\u201d The President\u2019s second\ncousin, Hugh Carter, Jr., who played a leading role in White House emergency\nplanning, said he was \u201cconcerned that the entire PEADs series is obsolete\ngiven the total devastation which could be expected from a thermonuclear\nattack.\u201d By 1980, the PEADs had been revised and updated and were ready to be\nplaced in the President\u2019s \u201cemergency portfolio.\u201d\n\nAlso included in the posting are documents on the Carter administration\u2019s\narrangements to assign a Football to Vice President Walter Mondale, with one\npermanently stationed at his residence. This was in keeping with Mondale's\nsubstantive and innovative role in national security policy. It remains\nunclear whether the four vice presidents who held the office between Johnson\nand Mondale were assigned Footballs, but so far there is no evidence to\nsuggest that they were.\n\nThe posting also includes excerpts from interviews conducted by William\nManchester while researching his book, The Death of a President (New York:\nHarper and Row, 1967), which shed light on the Football arrangements during\nthe Kennedy administration. General Chester Clifton, one of the White House\nmilitary aides who was with Kennedy in Dallas on the day he was assassinated,\nexplained that a military aide was always near the President because the\nFootball included \"emergency war orders.\u201d\n\nAccording to Captain Tazewell Shepard, Naval Aide to President Kennedy, the\nmilitary aides had responsibility for the contents of the Football \u201cwhenever\nand wherever the President goes.\u201d The exception was when the President was in\nWashington, D.C., in which case the satchel stayed at the White House and did\nnot \u201cchase him around.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s posting also features a gallery of recently released photos from the\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library showing military officers carrying the\nFootball in a variety of situations, including during overseas travel with the\nPresident. Released as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request, the\nimages show the routine and unique role played by the Football and its\nhandlers in presidential entourages. Some of the photos were released with\nexcisions while other images were denied in full.\n\n### Background\n\nThe existence of the Football became publicly known in the first few years of\nthe Johnson administration. The first mention of it in the national press may\nhave been in the syndicated \u201cAllen-Scott Report\u201d in July 1965 which quoted\nWhite House aide Jack Valenti saying that that \u201cthe \u2018black bag\u2019 or \u2018football,\u2019\nas we call it, goes wherever the President travels.\u201d The Football connected\nthe President to the Strategic Air Command, according to Valenti, who added\nthat there were a \u201cdozen military aides who carry the briefcase on a shift\nbasis.\u201d The article also suggested that President Johnson may have been\nuncomfortable with the arrangement because Valenti denied \u201cpublished reports\nPresident Johnson is transferring some of the functions of his military aides\nto the Pentagon.\u201d[1] Four months later, Bob Horton of The Baltimore Sun\nreported that the \u201csatchel\u201d included a \u201cportfolio of cryptographic orders\u201d to\nthe Joint Chiefs to authorize a nuclear retaliation. An authorizing message\ncould be sent by telephone, teletype or microwave radio. Horton also learned\nthat, through arrangements established by the Defense Communications Agency,\nthe authorizing messages could be sent to the North American Air Defense\nCommand or the Strategic Air Command.[2]\n\nManchester\u2019s book was probably the first to mention the Football, and with his\nfocus on interviewing the people who were with and near President Kennedy at\nthe time of his assassination, Manchester learned a great deal about the\nmilitary aides and warrant officers who traveled with the President and who\nwere responsible for the Football. Among the interviewees were White House\nmilitary aides, including Tazewell Shepard, Godfrey McHugh, and Chester\nClifton, and Joint Chief of Staff Chairman Maxwell Taylor. Excerpts from the\ninterviews, on file at the Wesleyan University Library, are published here for\nthe first time and include rich details about the Football, its contents, and\nthe arrangements for carrying it. While such interviews have to be read\ncautiously and skeptically, the fact that they took place only months after\nthe events lends them credibility.\n\nOne interesting episode that Manchester describes in a footnote is how, in\nearly 1961, President Kennedy\u2019s security staff offered a satchel and a\nmilitary aide to Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who turned down the\narrangement for reasons still unknown. While future revelations may help\nclarify Johnson\u2019s reasons for declining the offer, Manchester\u2019s discussion\nwith Maxwell Taylor confirmed that high level military leaders were concerned\nthat he had not received a briefing about the \u201ccontents\u201d of the Football\nbefore he became President in Dallas on November 22, 1963.[3] Years later,\nafter he left office, Johnson suggested that he found the presence of the\nmilitary aide and the Football to be stressful.[4]\n\nOne element of the Football\u2019s contents that is seldom discussed is a set of\nPresidential Emergency Action Documents\u2014previously known as Emergency Action\nPapers\u2014consisting of presidential proclamations and executive orders on a\nrange of issues for use in a national emergency.[5] Originating during the\nEisenhower administration as Emergency Action Documents (or EADs), they\nderived their presumed \u201clegal authority\u201d from the \u201cextraordinary powers of the\nPresident under the Constitution.\u201d While none of them appear to have been\ndeclassified, Federal Emergency Plan D-Minus, dated April 1959, outlined them,\nincluding one declaring \u201cthe existence of an unlimited national emergency and\na state of civil defense emergency.\u201d Left unsaid was an imponderable: Who,\nafter nuclear war had begun, would be around to implement, much less obey,\nsuch edicts?\n\nOne of the proclamations authorized the Director of the Office of Civil and\nDefense Mobilization to determine when a state government or one of its\npolitical subdivisions was \u201cunable or unwilling to perform essential civil\nfunctions\u201d and to \u201ctake responsibility for those functions\u201d with the\nassistance of military commanders who had resources \u201cnot needed for the\nconduct of military operations.\u201d This and another proclamation authorizing the\nSecretary of Defense \u201cto maintain public order and enforce Federal, State and\nlocal laws\u201d when \u201cnecessary\u201d would have created the conditions for the\nimposition of martial law. Another proclamation authorized the \u201capprehension\nof persons considered dangerous to national security,\u201d while an executive\norder established an Office of Censorship to \u201ccensor communications crossing\nthe borders of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe EADs were later renamed Civil Emergency Action Documents and then\nPresidential Emergency Action Documents, and their contents have been revised\nover time, but most of the details remain classified. The results of a 1962\nupdating, consisting mostly of changes in presentation and organization, were\nforwarded from Edward McDermott, the Director of the Office of Emergency\nPlanning, to Captain Tazewell Shepard on the White House staff on October 29,\n1962. The contents were essentially the same as the EADs that Eisenhower had\nturned over to the Kennedy administration, although McDermott had plans to\n\u201cimprove\u201d them and add new directives. McDermott said the directives included\ndocuments designed to clothe \u201cthe President with formal emergency powers, to\nprovide control over individuals for internal security purposes, to dispose of\nnormal administrative requirements, to augment the armed forces, to assume\nfunctions of State and local governments in exceptional circumstances, to\nmobilize resources, and miscellaneous others.\u201d McDermott also had some\nmisgivings, suggesting that some of the orders, which he did not specify, were\nof \u201cdoubtful legality.\u201d\n\nWhere McDermott took the PEADs review process after October 1962 remains to be\nlearned but reviewing and updating occurred during the Carter administration.\nOne of the characteristics of Jimmy Carter's Presidency was his significant\ninterest in crisis planning, including the problem of emergency relocation and\ncontinuity of government arrangements in the event of nuclear war. This was a\nperiod when perceived vulnerabilities made government and military officials\nmore and more apprehensive about the security of command and control systems.\nMoreover, as recent biographers have pointed out, compared to many of his\npredecessors, Jimmy Carter was personally secure enough to give Vice President\nWalter Mondale a significant role in national security policy because he\nrecognized that in a dire emergency the Vice President had to be ready to\nassume the presidency. Accordingly, Mondale was assigned a Football and one\nwas eventually deployed to his official residence.[6]\n\nIn keeping with the strong interest in emergency planning, White House\nofficials worried about the status of the PEADs. Not only was Zbigniew\nBrzezinski\u2019s military assistant, William Odom, troubled over the \u201clegality\u201d of\nsome of them, President Carter\u2019s second cousin, Hugh Carter, Jr., who played a\nkey role in White House emergency planning, had become \u201cconcerned that the\nentire PEADs series is obsolete given the total devastation which could be\nexpected from a thermonuclear attack on the US.\u201d Those concerns necessitated\n\u201can updated approach to reconstituting order and organization at the local,\nstate and federal levels of the Government.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly Hugh Carter\u2019s worries meant for the updating of the PEADs is not\nclear, but the review had been completed by May 1980, and the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) turned over the updated documents to the\nWhite House so they could be included in the Football. What happened to the\norder concerning habeas corpus is not known. However, it is clear that some\nlegal issues had not been entirely resolved. In one case, FEMA director John\nMacy said it was inappropriate to seek OMB and DOJ clearance for a PEAD on\nnational resources mobilization that was initially approved by President\nRichard Nixon in 1970 \u201cbecause of its reliance on the \u2018implied\u2019 powers of the\nPresident and in the absence of a definitive legal basis for the PEAD.\u201d\n\nFuture declassifications and archival research may shed additional light on\nthe role of the PEADs in federal emergency planning and their evolution during\nthe decades of the Cold War. In particular, long-pending declassification\nrequests now before the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel may\nsomeday lead to the release of more details on the Football arrangements\nduring the 1960s.\n\nNote: Thanks to Brenna Larson, Special Collections, Wesleyan University\nLibrary, for providing access to the William Manchester interviews, the West\nVirginia Department of Archives and History for providing a copy of an article\nfrom the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, and Bill Geerhart for sharing information\nand insights on the history of the Football.

A new\nitem for the file was an Emergency Message, EM-5, which would make \u201cavailable\natomic weapons to NATO and to such other allies as may be programmed to use\nU.S. atomic weapons.\u201d As the purpose of the stockpile was for emergency use in\na military crisis, a presidential order to make those nuclear weapons\navailable to NATO allies was a necessary element in the Satchel.\n\nDocument 2\n\nMemorandum from Edward A. McDermott to Captain Tazewell Shepard, \u201cCivil\nEmergency Action Documents,\u201d with attachments, October 29, 1962, Top Secret\n\nOct 29, 1962\n\nSource\n\nNational Archives, Record Group (RG) 396, Records of Office of Emergency\nPreparedness, Accession 64A927, box 2, Emergency Planning[7]\n\nOne of the early elements of the Football or \u201cblack bag\u201d were Civil Emergency\nAction Documents, later known as Presidential Emergency Action documents\n(PEADS). Eisenhower had bequeathed the Kennedy administration 24 of the\ndocuments, which Office of Emergency Planning Director Edward McDermott sent\nin a repackaged and reorganized format to President Kennedy\u2019s Naval Aide\nCaptain Tazewell Shepard, who had the emergency planning portfolio at the\nWhite House. President Kennedy had not formally approved the documents.\n\nWhether the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the update or if it was already in\nthe works is not known. According to McDermott, the 24 documents that he was\nsending to Shepard were ones that had been cleared by the agencies, not\nnecessarily the most important items. According to McDermott, the contents of\nthe EADs were essentially the same as the ones that Eisenhower had left the\nKennedy administration, although he had plans to \u201cimprove\u201d them and add new\ndirectives. He thought some were of \u201cdoubtful legality,\u201d although he did not\nspecify which ones. Their purpose was to \u201cto clothe the President with formal\nemergency powers, to provide control over individuals for internal security\npurposes, to dispose of normal administrative requirements, to augment the\narmed forces, to assume functions of State and local governments in\nexceptional circumstances, to mobilize resources, and miscellaneous others.\u201d\n\nDocument 3\n\nWilliam Manchester Interview with Major General Chester Clifton, 21 April\n1964, excerpts\n\nApr 21, 1964\n\nSource\n\nWesleyan University Library, Special Collections, William Manchester Papers\n\nGeneral Chester Clifton, one of the White House military aides who was with\nKennedy on the day he was assassinated, explained that they always stayed\nclose to the President because of the \u201cemergency war orders\u201d kept inside the\nFootball. According to Clifton, \u201cKennedy was the first President to realize\u201d\nthat the exceedingly short period of warning before a missile attack\nnecessitated the Football arrangement. \u201cThe Joint Chiefs of Staff got through\nto him and explained it.\u201d The warrant officers who carried the black bag would\nbe in closer proximity to the President than the military aides, but in a\ncrisis the aide was responsible for getting the emergency orders \u201cto the\nPresident and \u2018instanter as possible.\u2019\u201d According to Clifton, Kennedy \u201chad us\nbrief Lyndon Johnson on the black bag,\u201d and that \u201cwe told Lyndon Johnson on\nAir Force One,\u201d just after Kennedy was assassinated, \u201cthat this black back was\naround.\u201d Nevertheless, as the interviews with Maxwell Taylor and Tazewell\nShepard suggest, neither were confident that Johnson was aware of the\nFootball\u2019s contents.\n\nDocument 4\n\nWilliam Manchester interview with General Godfrey McHugh, 6 May 1964, excerpts\n\nMay 6, 1964\n\nSource\n\nWesleyan University Library, Special Collections, William Manchester Papers\n\nAlso at Dallas with Kennedy on the day of his assassination, McHugh also\nprovided Manchester with details on some of the Football\u2019s contents. In\naddition to information on how to communicate with the British Prime Minister\nand the French President, the Football included booklets with explanations of\nattack options and estimated casualties. The military information was\npresented in \u201ccartoons and color schemes to make the thing more understandable\nto the President.\u201d The warrant officer who carried the satchel knew the\ncombination for unlocking it but did not know what was inside. Only the\nmilitary aide knew the contents.\n\nDocument 5\n\nWilliam Manchester Interview with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Maxwell\nTaylor, 5 May 1964, excerpt\n\nMay 5, 1964\n\nSource\n\nWesleyan University Library, Special Collections, William Manchester Papers\n\nTaylor explained his concern about the Football on the day of the Kennedy\nassassination. \u201cI knew that the courier with the satchel was with the\nPresident and that the contents of the satchel had not been explained to\nLyndon Johnson.\u201d According to Manchester\u2019s account in Death of a President,\nthe previous Vice President, Richard Nixon had been assigned a \u201csatchel,\u201d and\nNaval Aide Shepard saw to it that one was given to Vice President Lyndon\nJohnson, but said it was \u201creturned with the explanation that Johnson did not\nwant it.\u201d[8]\n\nDocument 6\n\nWilliam Manchester Interview with Captain Tazewell Shepard, 1 May 1964\n\nMay 1, 1964\n\nSource\n\nWesleyan University Library, Special Collections, William Manchester Papers\n\nAccording to McHugh, Tazewell Shepard, who ran the White House emergency plans\noffice, was \u201cclosest\u201d to the Football set-up. Shepard recounted that his\nresponsibilities included developing plans for relocating the President in a\ncrisis and managing the contents of the Football \u201cwhenever and wherever the\nPresident goes.\u201d The exception was when the President was in Washington, D.C.,\nin which case the satchel stayed at the White House and did \u201cnot chase him\naround,\u201d in part because the President remained in constant contact with the\nDefense Department. The protocol eventually extended to local events. For\nexample, when Ronald Reagan was at the Washington Hilton in March 1981, a\nFootball carrier was in his entourage. Like others, that officer ducked to the\nground during the attempted assassination of the President.\n\nShepard did not travel to Texas after the assassination but met Air Force One\nwhen it returned to Andrews Air Force Base with President Johnson, who had\njust been sworn in. He recalled that General Taylor and Secretary of Defense\nMcNamara were there and \u201cwere concerned that I brief the new President on\nemergency plans.\u201d Following Taylor\u2019s instructions, Shepard met with Johnson at\nthe Executive Office Building that evening.\n\n### Part II: Developments During the Carter Administration\n\nDocument 7\n\n[Federal Preparedness Agency] Briefing for Vice President Mondale, prepared by\nDalimil Kybal, 11 August 1977, Unclassified\n\nAug 11, 1977\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, National Security Adviser Brzezinski\nMaterial: General Odom File. box 26, Federal Preparedness Agency, 2/76-12/77\n\nIn keeping with Walter Mondale\u2019s significant role in national security policy,\na briefing was prepared for him on key elements of federal emergency planning,\nincluding continuity of government arrangements, civil emergency preparations,\nand Presidential Emergency Action Documents (PEADs). According to the\nbriefing, written by Dalimil Kybal, then acting director of the Federal\nPreparedness Agency (a forerunner of the Federal Emergency Management Agency),\nthe PEADS were an element of the \u201cEmergency Portfolio\u201d assigned to the\nPresident and the Vice President. Noting their origin in the late 1950s, Kybal\nwrote that there were about 20 PEADs and that they were collectively known as\n\u201cEmergency Plan D.\u201d They covered a range of issues, including the declaration\nof war, the use of military forces to maintain law and order (martial law),\nthe possible suspension of habeas corpus, and censorship of international\ncommunications. The PEADS had been recently updated and were at the Office of\nManagement and Budget for review, which had delayed its approval.\n\nDocument 8\n\nMemorandum from William Odom to Zbigniew Brzezinski, \u201cWeekly Report,\u201d 26\nOctober 1978, Secret\n\nOct 26, 1978\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, National Security Adviser Brzezinski\nMaterial: General Odom File, box 59, Weekly Reports, 2/77-12/78\n\nBriefing Brzezinski on the problem of \u201cbadly out of date\u201d PEADs, Odom\nsuggested that some were \u201ceven illegal.\u201d With OMB continuing to sit on the\nrevised PEADs, the problem reached Hugh Carter, Jr., the President\u2019s second\ncousin, who played an informal role in emergency management issues. Carter and\nthe NSC told OMB Director James McIntyre about the problem, who quickly\napproved the PEADs (apparently he was unaware of them). Nevertheless, Odom\nbelieved it necessary to do more to improve the PEADs once \u201cwe work out how\nthe civil side of the Federal government would transit from peacetime to\nwartime functions.\u201d\n\nDocument 9\n\nMemorandum from Denis Clift, Assistant to the Vice President for National\nSecurity Affairs, to Tred Davis and Marty Beaman, Assistant Director, White\nHouse Military Office, \u201cPEADs,\u201d 29 November 1978, Secret\n\nNov 29, 1978\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, Walter F. Mondale Papers, box 112, Vice\nPresidential Chronological Files, 11/1978\n\nThe review of the new set of PEADs was apparently in its final stages with\nClift observing that he considered the \u201cproposed changes primarily in terms of\nwhether or not they make it easier or more difficult to govern under\ncircumstances following a nuclear exchange.\u201d He said that two that he saw as\nthe \u201cmost significant directives in terms of actually governing the country\u201d\nhad \u201cbeen modified in ways which are to me not altogether clear in their\nimpact.\u201d What specifically concerned Clift were the \u201climits and/or constraints\nplaced on the authority of the Office of Defense Resources (new PEAD 5) to\ncarry out its many tasks\u201d and \u201cthe Secretary of State\u2019s (new PEADs 16 and 17)\nability to constrain foreign diplomatic and other related activities within\nthe United States.\u201d Two previous PEADs concerning censorship and the temporary\nsuspension of habeas corpus had been recommended for deletion.\n\nEspecially concerning to Clift was that some of the language in the PEADs\nconcerning the role of Congress and the \u201cpeacetime rights and privileges\u201d of\ncitizens could have the effect of \u201cunnecessarily constraining the\neffectiveness of those who would be charged with attempting to govern the\ncountry during a time of extreme hardship and deprivation.\u201d The implication\nwas that, in a nuclear crisis, presidential authority was necessary to\nsupplant traditional constitutional rights.\n\nDocument 10\n\nMemorandum from Denis Clift to Vice President Mondale, with Mondale memorandum\nattached, \u201cPEADS,\u201d 1 March 1979, Secret\n\nMar 1, 1979\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, Walter F.

Noting how\n\u201ccomplex\u201d the problem of updating the PEADs was, Clift observed that Hugh\nCarter was under pressure from the Pentagon on SIOP and on National Command\nAuthority survivability issues, problems that were compounded by understaffed\nand ineffective civilian emergency planning leadership. The Federal\nPreparedness Agency has \u201cnot been up to the challenge.\u201d\n\nAccording to Clift, a \u201cfull time FEMA Director with savvy and political clout\nshould be appointed to take the lead for the NSC in the PEAD update.\u201d His\nclosing recommendation was that Mondale \u201cschedule a meeting with Zbig and Hugh\nCarter to receive a status report on the PEADs update and to invite their\nrecommendations on steps to expedite the update.\u201d\n\nDocument 13\n\nMemorandum from William Odom to Zbigniew Brzezinski, \u201cMeeting with the Vice\nPresident and Hugh Carter on the PEADs and FEMA,\u201d 14 May 1979, Secret\n\nMay 14, 1979\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, National Security Adviser Brzezinski\nMaterial: General Odom File, box 8, Chron, 2/1/79-6/18/79\n\nOdom believed that nothing could be decided at the meeting with Mondale and\nHugh Carter, but he saw a few points about C^3I and FEMA that were worth\nmaking. The PEADs updating has been completed. The larger question was whether\n\u201cthe system of NCA survivability and war mobilization, implicit in the PEADs\n[is] adequate for today.\u201d Odom explained that, \u201cOur mobilization and economic\nemergency management system (as spelled out briefly in the PEADs) is neither\nadequate for nuclear war conditions nor adaptable to lesser contingency\nplans.\u201d He saw a \u201creal danger that FEMA's Executive Order will not even\ninclude the proper authority to permit a solution to this problem.\u201d The\nconfirmation of John Macy as FEMA director was necessary \u201cto make us more\nconfident\u201d in the ongoing review of emergency management and economic\nmobilization policy.\n\nDocument 14\n\nMemorandum from William Odom to Zbigniew Brzezinski, \u201cPresidential Emergency\nAction Documents (PEADS),\u201d with attachments, 6 May 1980, Secret\n\nMay 6, 1980\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, National Security Adviser Brzezinski\nMaterial: General Odom File, box 11, Chron, 3/1/80-6/30/80\n\nOdom informed Brzezinski that FEMA director John Macy had sent in the revised\nPEADS, the result of \u201cthe first thorough up-date in a decade.\u201d Brzezinski sent\nthe revised PEADs to Hugh Carter for \u201cproper disposition.\u201d In his letter\nenclosing the PEADs, Macy informed Brzezinski that they \u201cshould be transmitted\ndirectly to the White House Military Office and substituted for the documents\nwhich are now in the President\u2019s \u2018emergency portfolio.\u2019\u201d He noted that\nPresident Nixon had approved PEAD No. 5, \u201cProviding for the Mobilization of\nthe Nation's Resources,\u201d in March 1970 and that it had been only slightly\nrevised during the recent update. \u201cBecause of its reliance on the \u2018implied\u2019\npowers of the President and in the absence of a definitive legal basis for the\nPEAD, it was deemed inappropriate to seek OMB and DOJ clearance at this time.\u201d\n\nDocument 15\n\nMemorandum from [Chief of Staff] Richard Moe to the Vice President, \u201cTalking\nPoints for Luncheon with the President --Tuesday, August 5, 1980,\u201d with\nattachments, 4 August 1980, Secret\n\nAug 4, 1980\n\nSource\n\nJimmy Carter Presidential Library, Walter F. Mondale Papers, box 203\n\nOne item for discussion in the conversation recorded here was the recent\npublication by Bill Gulley, former Director of the White House Military\nOffice, of a \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoir, Breaking Cover (Simon & Schuster). Moe\nfound pages 178-194 \u201cquite remarkable for the detailed revelations they offer\non certain parts of the National Command Authority, White House Emergency\nProcedures, the NEACP aircraft, the Football, relocation sites and emergency\nprocedures.\u201d Odom had copies of the pages and was preparing a guidance\nmemorandum. Moe recommended to the Vice President that Harold Brown and\nZbigniew Brzezinski provide him \u201cand the President with an assessment of any\ndamage caused -- clearly this does cause damage \u2013 and recommendations for\nremedying the problem.\u201d\n\nAmong the revelations in Gulley\u2019s book was that the \u201cWhite House Emergency\nProcedures\u201d manual \u201csets out exactly what\u2019s supposed to happen in the event of\na sudden attack,\u201d including the steps that the Pentagon will \u201ctake to notify\nthe White House and how the White House will respond.\u201d In a crisis, it was the\ntask of the White House Military Office to ensure that the President gets the\nFootball \u201cbecause it\u2019s only the President who can issue the orders.\u201d\nNevertheless, Gulley found that the \u201centire retaliatory strike capability is\nvulnerable\u201d because the President is \u201cscandalously underprotected against a\nfull military attack.\u201d[9]\n\n### Part III: Photos of the Football and Its Holders During the George W.
