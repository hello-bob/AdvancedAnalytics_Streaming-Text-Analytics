In this new series,\nwe\u2019ll look at a new company\u2019s website each week, and write around 200 words\nworth of our honest feedback about it.\n\nToday, we\u2019re talking about one of the most successfully ascendant software\ncompanies of the 2020s, particularly in the database space \u2013 PlanetScale. It\u2019s\nkind of a trip to take a look at this page now, because we helped out with\ntheir messaging way back when they did their first public launches. A lot has\nchanged since then, and the posture that the team wanted to take at launch \u2013\nthat this was the ultimate MySQL database platform, is now true, because\nthat\u2019s what it says right as soon as you hit the web page:\n\nThe ultimate MySQL database platform PlanetScale is the world\u2019s most advanced,\nfully-managed MySQL database platform.\n\nAnd then the CTAs: Sign up and Contact us\n\nTo evaluate all of this in terms of messaging and positioning, and leaving any\npersonal history that I may have with the company out of it \u2013 this is clearly\na cool, collected, and very confident stance to take. PlanetScale is in it\u2019s\n\u201cmiddle period\u201d \u2013 not at the beginning stages where it\u2019s completely necessary\nto explain both the category and the product to everyone who visits your\nwebsite, but not quite in the stratospheric Enterprise mode where your H1\ntalks about magic quadrants and how you helped Samsung save 4.7B by switching\nto your product.\n\nAbove the fold we also have a strong set of logos, and notably, no imagery at\nall. A spare and interesting choice, design-wise. There\u2019s also one more sort\nof \u201ccheater\u201d H0, a trick we also like to use at Reify, which says Scale,\nperformance, and reliability powered by Vitess \u2013 more social proof, and a very\nstrong technical backing at that.\n\nPlanetScale\u2019s homepage assumes that you already know what PlanetScale is,\nyou\u2019re probably shopping it against only one or two major competitors, and\nyou\u2019re on the fast track to trying it out as soon as you can. At this rate, we\ncan only assume their H1 will be refer to the case study of a multinational\ncorporation within 18-24 months.\n\nWant our opinion on your homepage or messaging? Or want to chat more about\nmessaging and positioning? Book some time here.!\n\n##### Get in touch Our Writing\n\n", "frontpage": false}
