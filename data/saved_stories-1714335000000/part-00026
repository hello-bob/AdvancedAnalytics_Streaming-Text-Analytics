When\nit comes to energy, few events have baffled outsiders more.\n\nIn the face of climate change, calls to expedite the transition away from\nfossil fuels, and an energy crisis precipitated by Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of\nUkraine, Berlin\u2019s move to quit nuclear before carbon-intensive energy sources\nlike coal has attracted significant criticism. (Greta Thunberg prominently\nlabelled it \u201ca mistake\u201d.)\n\nThis decision can only be understood in the context of post-war socio-\npolitical developments in Germany, where anti-nuclearism predated the public\nclimate discourse.\n\nFrom a 1971 West German bestseller evocatively titled Peaceably into\nCatastrophe: A Documentation of Nuclear Power Plants, to huge protests of\nhundreds of thousands \u2013 including the largest-ever demonstration seen in the\nWest German capital Bonn \u2013 the anti-nuclear movement attracted national\nattention and widespread sympathy. It became a major political force well\nbefore even the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.\n\nA 30,000-strong protest at the site of a nuclear power plant being constructed\nin Brokdorf, Germany, 1971. FLS / Alamy\n\nIts motivations included: a distrust of technocracy; ecological, environmental\nand safety fears; suspicions that nuclear energy could engender nuclear\nproliferation; and general opposition to concentrated power (especially after\nits extreme consolidation under the Nazi dictatorship).\n\nInstead, activists championed what they regarded as safer, greener, and more\naccessible renewable alternatives like solar and wind, embracing their promise\nof greater self-sufficiency, community participation, and citizen empowerment\n(\u201cenergy democracy\u201d).\n\nThis support for renewables was less about CO2 and more aimed at resetting\npower relations (through decentralised, bottom-up generation rather than top-\ndown production and distribution), protecting local ecosystems, and promoting\npeace in the context of the cold war.\n\n## Germany\u2019s Energiewende\n\nThe contrast here with Thunberg\u2019s latter-day Fridays for Future movement and\nits \u201clisten to the experts\u201d slogan is striking. The older activist generation\ndeliberately rejected the mainstream expertise of the time, which then\nregarded centralised nuclear power as the future and mass deployment of\ndistributed renewables as a pipe dream.\n\nThis earlier movement was instrumental in creating Germany\u2019s Green Party \u2013\ntoday the world\u2019s most influential \u2013 which emerged in 1980 and first entered\nnational government from 1998 to 2005 as junior partner to the Social\nDemocrats. This \u201cred-green\u201d coalition banned new reactors, announced a\nshutdown of existing ones by 2022, and passed a raft of legislation supporting\nrenewable energy.\n\nThat, in turn, turbocharged the national deployment of renewables, which\nballooned from 6.3% of gross domestic electricity consumption in 2000 to 51.8%\nin 2023.\n\nThese figures are all the more remarkable given the contributions of ordinary\ncitizens. In 2019, they owned fully 40.4% (and over 50% in the early 2010s) of\nGermany\u2019s total installed renewable power generation capacity, whether through\ncommunity wind energy cooperatives, farm-based biogas installations, or\nhousehold rooftop solar.\n\nMost other countries\u2019 more recent energy transitions have been attempts to\nachieve net-zero targets using whatever low-carbon technologies are available.\nGermany\u2019s now-famous \u201cEnergiewende\u201d (translated as \u201cenergy transition\u201d or even\n\u201cenergy revolution\u201d), however, has from its earlier inception sought to shift\naway from both carbon-intensive as well as nuclear energy to predominantly\nrenewable alternatives.\n\nIndeed, the very book credited with coining the term Energiewende in 1980 was,\nsignificantly, titled Energie-Wende: Growth and Prosperity Without Oil and\nUranium and published by a think tank founded by anti-nuclear activists.\n\nConsecutive German governments have, over the past two and a half decades,\nmore or less hewed to this line. Angela Merkel\u2019s pro-nuclear second cabinet\n(2009-13) was an initial exception.\n\nThat lasted until the 2011 Fukushima disaster, after which mass protests of\n250,000 and a shock state election loss to the Greens forced that\nadministration, too, to revert to the 2022 phaseout plan. Small wonder that so\nmany politicians today are reluctant to reopen that particular Pandora\u2019s box.\n\nAnother ongoing political headache is where to store the country\u2019s nuclear\nwaste, an issue Germany has never managed to solve. No community has consented\nto host such a facility, and those designated for this purpose have seen\nlarge-scale protests.\n\nInstead, radioactive waste has been stored in temporary facilities close to\nexisting reactors \u2013 no long-term solution.\n\n## Nuclear remains unpopular\n\nNational polls underscore the Teutonic aversion to nuclear. Even in 2022, at\nthe height of the recent energy crisis, a survey found that 52% opposed\nconstructing new reactors, though 78% supported a temporary extension of\nexisting plants until summer 2023. The three-way Social Democratic-Green-\nLiberal coalition government ultimately compromised on mid-April 2023.\n\nToday, 51.6% of Germans believe this was premature. However, a further\ndeferral was deemed politically unfeasible given the trenchant anti-nuclearism\nof the Greens and sizeable cross sections of the population.\n\nDespite some public protestations to the contrary (the main opposition CDU\nparty declared in January that Germany \u201ccannot do without the nuclear power\noption at present\u201d), in private few political leaders think the country will,\nor even realistically can, reverse course.\n\nAs an industry insider told me, talk of reintroducing nuclear to Germany is\n\u201cdelusional\u201d because investors were \u201cburnt ... too many times\u201d in the past and\nnow \u201cwould rather put their money into safer investments\u201d. Moreover, \u201cit would\ntake decades to build new [nuclear] power stations\u201d and electricity is no\nlonger the sector of concern, given the rapid buildout of renewables, with\nattention having shifted to heating and transport.\n\nGerman nuclear power (purple) has largely been replaced by renewables\n(yellow), not coal (black and brown). Clean Energy Wire, CC BY-SA\n\nPredictions that the nuclear exit would leave Germany forced to use more coal\nand facing rising prices and supply problems, meanwhile, have not transpired.\nIn March 2023 \u2013 the month before the phaseout \u2013 the distribution of German\nelectricity generation was 53% renewable, 25% coal, 17% gas, and 5% nuclear.\nIn March 2024, it was 60% renewable, 24% coal, and 16% gas.\n\nOverall, the past year has seen record renewable power production nationwide,\na 60-year low in coal use, sizeable emissions cuts, and decreasing energy\nprices.\n\nThe country\u2019s energy sector, it seems, has already moved on. In the words of\none industry observer: \u201cOnce you switch off these nuclear power stations,\nthey\u2019re out.\u201d And there\u2019s no easy way back.\n\nFor better or worse, this technology \u2013 in its present form at least \u2013 is dead\nin the water here. For many Germans, it will not be missed.\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read about climate change as much as you\u2019d like? Get a\nweekly roundup in your inbox instead.
