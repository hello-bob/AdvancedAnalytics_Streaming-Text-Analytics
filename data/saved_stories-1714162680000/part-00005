I sued them for libel, and they admitted fault and settled,\npaying me costs and damages.\n\nTheir allegations were sensational and squalid, but unfounded. Their source\nwas the resentment of one woman following a relationship in 2018, which I\nended against her wishes. She fabricated or was offered an alternative\nnarrative, which developed into claims of a pattern of behaviour, and\nculminated in the defendants\u2019 publication of an open letter, which they now\nagree is defamatory.\n\nIn two years of legal action, the defendants never presented any evidence to\nsupport their allegations, and admitted in court that they had no proper\nreason to make them. They have given undertakings to the court not to publish\nfurther or similar defamatory statements, or have anyone else do so on their\nbehalf.\n\nNo signatory contacted me about the allegations before publication. I received\nno warning, and had no knowledge of the claims\u2019 substance. I only discovered\nwhat I was accused of at the same time as I learned of my indefinite exclusion\nfrom the community; at the same time everyone else found out. I had no\nopportunity to defend myself. It is no coincidence that the absence of due\nprocess led to an abject injustice.\n\nThe experience of cancellation and enduring the online hysteria was traumatic.\nI responded by withdrawing from the life I knew. Its consequences hurt me and\npeople close to me, and have been immiserating.\n\nMy employment opportunities were obliterated. My charitable and educational\nprojects, and my small business, could not continue. Despite my transferable\nskills, the allegations were a transferrable red flag recognised across\nprogramming communities and industries, and I have barely earned a living\nsince. It has taken two years of legal action to receive fair scrutiny in a\nforum reliant on facts. This outcome finally vindicates me.\n\nMany familiar with the open letter will be surprised by this outcome, given\nthe certainty expressed by some of the letter\u2019s supporters. But they should\nquestion why no defence of my libel claim was ever offered. They should seek\nanswers for how so many people became so convinced without evidence. And the\ndefendants\u2019 co-signatories should reassess the credibility of everything that\ncompelled them to support the open letter.\n\nNonetheless, I believe the open letter\u2019s authors were convinced it was the\nright thing to do. I believe that they wished to show their kindness in\nresponse to a story which shocked them. Many of them I have known for years,\nand know to be good, moral people who were mistaken, and would not wish to be\nmistaken.\n\nGood people can make mistakes, without becoming bad people. So, I offer them\nthe respect and compassion I believe they deserve. I recognise their good\nintent, and I interpret its consequences charitably. We owe each other\ncivility in ceding the time and space necessary to reflect upon this in open\nenquiry, without coercion or urgency, so everyone can reach a better\nunderstanding of this outcome, and of one another.\n\nI have avoided naming any third parties here, and I urge others to do the\nsame. I know too well how it feels to be the subject of online harassment, and\nI do not wish it upon anyone. I reject the culture of blame and escalation.\n\nI have not been idle since 2021. I\u2019ve spent much of my time writing Scala 3,\nwhich I believe is an exceptional platform for software development, and\ndeserves far greater success. I am motivated to be part of that success, and I\nwill start sharing my work again soon.\n\n\u2588\n\nConsent Order and Statement in Open Court (The Honourable Mrs Justice Steyn\nDBE)\n\n", "frontpage": true}
