This release includes next-generation web application firewall (WAF) and\nbot management capabilities, and extends HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s legendary\nperformance and flexibility to support applications using the UDP transport\nprotocol. Supported by industry-leading benchmark results, these landmark\nfeatures offer customers a powerful solution to the challenges of security,\nlatency, and scale.\n\n## # New to HAProxy Enterprise?\n\nHAProxy Enterprise elevates the world\u2019s fastest and most widely used software\nload balancer and API gateway with premium support, robust multi-layered\nsecurity, and centralized management, monitoring, and automation with HAProxy\nFusion. HAProxy Enterprise and HAProxy Fusion provide a secure application\ndelivery platform for modern enterprises and applications.\n\nTo learn more, contact our sales team for a demonstration or request a free\ntrial.\n\n## # What\u2019s new?\n\nHAProxy Enterprise 2.9 includes exclusive new enterprise features plus all the\nfeatures from the community version of HAProxy 2.9. For the full list of\nfeatures, read the release notes for HAProxy Enterprise 2.9.\n\nNew and exclusive in HAProxy Enterprise 2.9 are the following important\nfeatures:\n\n  * The next-generation HAProxy Enterprise WAF powered by our unique Intelligent WAF Engine provides exceptional accuracy, zero-day threat detection, ultra-low latency, and simple management with optional OWASP Core Rule Set compatibility. Our industry-leading WAF performance virtually eliminates the security impact of false negatives and the noise of false positives, with a balanced accuracy of 98.53% measured in testing based on open source WAF benchmark data.\n\n  * The new HAProxy Enterprise Bot Management Module provides fast, reliable, and flexible identification and categorization of bots attempting to access websites or applications, with 100% local processing for low latency and no external dependencies. Our proven real-world performance shows the ability to catch previously unidentified bots while supporting 2X more requests per second on one instance than the nearest competitor.\n\n  * The new HAProxy Enterprise UDP Module provides fast and reliable UDP proxying and load balancing alongside HAProxy\u2019s existing broad protocol support. Our best-in-class UDP performance is capable of reliably handling 3.8 million Syslog messages per second (46Gb/s) \u2013 4.6X faster than the nearest enterprise competitor.\n\nWe announced the release of HAProxy 2.9 in December 2023, which included\nfaster performance, more flexibility, and better visibility. The features from\nHAProxy 2.9 are now available in HAProxy Enterprise 2.9.\n\n## # Ready to upgrade?\n\nWhen you are ready to start the upgrade procedure, go to the upgrade\ninstructions for HAProxy Enterprise.\n\n## # Next-generation WAF brings app security without compromises\n\nOne reason why HAProxy Enterprise is so popular is the bundled web application\nfirewall (WAF). In HAProxy Enterprise 2.9, security is better than ever. The\nnext-generation HAProxy Enterprise WAF brings industry-leading accuracy,\nperformance, and simplicity.\n\n### # Why a next-generation WAF?\n\nPreviously, HAProxy Enterprise included multiple WAF options including an\nAdvanced WAF and a ModSecurity WAF based on the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS).\n\n  * Customers using the Advanced WAF found it to be extremely fast and powerful, but the skill requirements were relatively high.\n\n  * Meanwhile, customers using the ModSecurity WAF appreciated the simplicity and industry-standard CRS compatibility, but the open source ModSecurity WAF introduced more latency and higher false positives than many customers were comfortable with.\n\nAs we looked at the other WAF options on the market we also realized that low\naccuracy was a common problem, leaving users struggling to manage many false\npositives and to mitigate the damage caused by application attacks that slip\nthrough a WAF undetected.\n\nWe wanted to give customers a WAF experience that combined the speed of the\nAdvanced WAF, the simplicity of the ModSecurity WAF, and unprecedented\naccuracy to strengthen security and eliminate the noise. This goal led us to\ncreate the next-generation HAProxy Enterprise WAF, which delivers security\nwithout compromise.\n\n### # What can you do with HAProxy Enterprise WAF?\n\nOut-of-the-box, the HAProxy Enterprise WAF provides ultra-low latency\nprotection against application attacks. This includes common attacks such as\nSQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and\nLocal File Inclusion (LFI), as well as emerging and zero-day threats. You can\noptionally use the industry-standard OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) compatibility\nmode to maximize compatibility and transparency where needed.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise WAF is part of HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s multi-layered security,\nwhich also includes the new Bot Management Module and Global Rate Limiting\n(powered by the Global Profiling Engine). You can combine accurate WAF\ndetection and blocking with the other powerful layers in the security suite to\ncreate highly customizable threat management strategies \u2013 from simple to\nadvanced.\n\n### # Why should you use HAProxy Enterprise WAF?\n\nThree reasons:\n\n  1. Stronger security with exceptional balanced accuracy measured using open source WAF benchmark data, virtually eliminating the security impact of false negatives and the noise of false positives.\n\n  2. Higher performance ensures ultra-low latency threat detection and traffic filtering while keeping resource use and operational costs low.\n\n  3. Simple to set up and manage with out-of-the-box behavior suitable for most deployments.\n\nThe next-generation HAProxy Enterprise WAF powered by the unique Intelligent\nWAF Engine brings industry-leading efficacy and performance. The Intelligent\nWAF Engine is a single low-latency process based on the company\u2019s unique data\nscience, security analytics, and real-world datasets. It identifies security\nthreats using a non-signature-based detection system capable of blocking\nemerging and zero-day threats without requiring users to create and manage\nlong or complex lists of rules.\n\nLet\u2019s talk accuracy. WAF accuracy can be calculated by measuring the true\npositive rate and the true negative rate:\n\n  * True positive rate refers to the proportion of dangerous traffic correctly identified by the WAF. Dangerous traffic incorrectly identified as safe is a \u201cfalse negative\u201d.\n\n  * True negative rate refers to the proportion of safe traffic correctly identified by the WAF. Safe traffic incorrectly identified as dangerous is a \u201cfalse positive\u201d.\n\nThe average of these two values is called \u201cbalanced accuracy\u201d. The vast\nmajority of WAFs on the market do well at one metric but not the other,\nresulting in poor scores for balanced accuracy (generally below 90%).\nNaturally, we wanted to have a go ourselves, so we followed the same\nmethodology with the new HAProxy Enterprise WAF.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise WAF powered by the Intelligent WAF Engine achieved:\n\n  * a true-positive rate of 99.61%\n\n  * a true-negative rate of 97.45%\n\n  * a resulting balanced accuracy rate of 98.53%,\n\nThis result comfortably beats the category average. It means that false\npositives are a thing of the past, reducing the impact on legitimate users and\nthe operational burden of monitoring security alerts. It also means that false\nnegatives are virtually eliminated, reducing the risk that malicious traffic\nwill cause downtime, data loss, fraud, and more.\n\nWhen using the optional OWASP CRS compatibility mode, we measured an\nimpressively low false-positive rate of 1.78% at paranoia level 2 (compared\nwith 28.36% for the ModSecurity WAF at the same paranoia level) resulting in\nreduced noise and a better user experience.\n\nHow about performance? WAF performance can be evaluated by the latency (the\ntime taken to process each request) incurred with a variety of attack payloads\nand traffic volumes. The HAProxy Enterprise WAF provides high-performance\nthreat detection and filtering with latency below measurable thresholds for\nthe majority of attack payloads, meaning no performance penalty for security\nand virtually zero impact on legitimate traffic.\n\nPerformance is also improved significantly when using the optional OWASP CRS\ncompatibility mode. With a realistic mix of safe and suspicious traffic\n(approximately 5% suspicious), the HAProxy Enterprise WAF achieves on average\n15X lower latency than the ModSecurity WAF using the OWASP CRS.\n\nThis incredible accuracy and performance is available out-of-the-box to users\nof HAProxy Enterprise 2.9. You won\u2019t need to write and maintain your own\ncustom WAF rules. With the power of the Intelligent WAF Engine, it just works.\nThis industry-leading performance in a simple package helps customers protect\ntheir business and reputation, simplify security, and reduce the impact on\napplication performance and user experience.\n\n## # New bot management makes identifying bots and categorizing your traffic a\nbreeze\n\nOur customers have implemented some impressive bot management strategies using\nHAProxy\u2019s tools for traffic profiling, tracking, and filtering. Now, it\u2019s even\neasier to use HAProxy Enterprise as a powerful alternative to a separate bot\nmanagement solution. The new Bot Management Module provides fast, reliable,\nand flexible bot identification and categorization with low latency and deep\nintegration with HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s multi-layered security controls.\n\n### # Why bot management?\n\nHAProxy Enterprise has long enabled users to identify bot traffic using a\ncombination of tools, such as:\n\n  * the Verify Crawler module, which verifies the identity of bots claiming to be valid crawlers, such as the Googlebot web crawler,\n\n  * the Fingerprint modules, which use multiple data points to accurately identify clients and requests,\n\n  * the Global Profiling Engine, which provides a comprehensive and up-to-date view of client behavior across a cluster and enables Global Rate Limiting.\n\nFrom DoS attacks to content scraping, the risks from bot traffic are growing\nyearly. Failure to identify and block malicious bots could result in downtime,\ndata theft, fraud, and more, affecting an organization\u2019s reputation and\nrevenue. Additionally, bot traffic can significantly increase resource use,\nwhich increases operational costs and could affect application performance for\nlegitimate human users.\n\nTo combat the rising risks, we wanted to make effective bot management more\naccessible and more powerful. In HAProxy Enterprise 2.9, customers have a new\nweapon in their arsenal against bots. The new HAProxy Enterprise Bot\nManagement Module is simple to set up and uses HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s unique\nadvantages to make it faster, more reliable, and more flexible than the\nmarket-leading alternatives.\n\n### # What can you do with the HAProxy Enterprise Bot Management Module?\n\nHAProxy Enterprise\u2019s Bot Management Module works out-of-the-box to identify\ntraffic accurately, categorizing it as human, suspicious, bot, verified\ncrawler (search engines), or verified bot/tool/app (non-browser).\n\nYou can combine accurate bot identification with the other powerful layers in\nthe security suite (including the next-generation HAProxy Enterprise WAF and\nGlobal Rate Limiting) to create customizable, high-performance, and low\nlatency bot management and rate limiting strategies \u2013 from simple to advanced.\n\n### # Why should you use the HAProxy Enterprise Bot Management Module?\n\nThree reasons:\n\n  * Fast performance eliminates latency and ensures rapid bot identification and enforcement of bot management policies even under heavy load (eg. DoS attack).\n\n  * Reliable bot management with a simple architecture reduces complexity and keeps your data local and secure.\n\n  * Flexible and customizable bot management shares intelligence with other powerful security layers for smarter, more holistic decision-making and enforcement.\n\nFor most users, we expect the simple answer to be: why wouldn\u2019t you use it? \ud83d\ude42\nYou can enable it in moments, and since it\u2019s built into HAProxy Enterprise \u2013\nthe world\u2019s fastest software load balancer and API gateway \u2013 it works quickly\nand efficiently even under heavy load.\n\nBut the real question for many customers is: why use this instead of one of\nthe market-leading bot management solutions?\n\nUnfortunately, bot management solutions often come with significant\ncompromises (not even counting the extra cost).\n\n  * Latency: solutions that pass requests through an additional layer, sometimes in a different network location, add latency (in addition to the often-quoted processing time) that affects the user experience.\n\n  * Complexity: solutions that require a constant or frequent connection to the vendor\u2019s cloud (for example, for automatic updates to the detection algorithm) introduce complexity and an additional point of failure, putting reliability and data privacy at risk.\n\n  * Lack of integration: solutions without deep integration with other security layers, such as with the WAF and anomaly detection layers, make decisions with incomplete information and do not give users the flexibility to enhance and customize their bot management strategy.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise\u2019s Bot Management Module uses reputational signals and\nscoring based on HAProxy Technologies\u2019 security expertise, data science, and\nlarge real-world datasets to identify traffic accurately. Importantly, all the\ndetection, processing, and enforcement is local to the HAProxy Enterprise\ninstance. It does not add additional layers to the request path and does not\nrequire an external connection. This minimizes latency, maximizes reliability,\nand gives you the flexibility to deploy anywhere you like \u2013 such as in air-\ngapped environments.\n\nWith deep integration with HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s multi-layered security, you\ncan customize your organization\u2019s bot management to meet your unique needs and\ntraffic profile. You can customize your enforcement policies with options\nincluding blocking, tarpitting, challenging, and rate limiting.\n\nBut how good is it at identifying bots? While this is hard to test in a\nbenchmark scenario, in real-world deployments with early adopters the HAProxy\nEnterprise Bot Management Module helped a top eCommerce website handling\n300,000 requests per second identify heavy amounts of suspicious traffic and\navoid crippling outages. As much as 20% of traffic was identified as\nanomalous, which their previous system had accepted without raising any\nsecurity concerns. HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s efficiency also resulted in cost\nsavings, supporting 2X more requests per second on one instance than the\nnearest competitor.\n\nThis fast, reliable, and flexible bot management solution helps customers\nprotect their business and reputation and reduce the resource cost of serving\nrequests from unwanted bots.\n\n## # UDP load balancing is here \u2013 and it was worth the wait\n\nWe heard from a few of you that you wanted UDP in HAProxy Enterprise, to\nsupplement the existing support for TCP, QUIC, HTTP, and everything else. And\nby \u201ca few\u201d, I mean this was our most requested feature. Well, the wait is over\nand we promise it was worth it. HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s UDP Module delivers best-\nin-class performance for software load balancers, capable of reliably handling\n3.8 million Syslog messages per second.\n\n### # Why UDP?\n\nAdding UDP proxying and load balancing to HAProxy Enterprise is a critical\nmove to simplify application delivery infrastructure. Previously, those with\nUDP applications might have used another load balancing solution alongside\nHAProxy Enterprise, introducing inconsistent performance, management, and\ndeployment form factors. No one wants to deal with that extra complexity. By\nincluding UDP support in HAProxy Enterprise, alongside support for TCP, QUIC,\nSSL, HTTP and everything else HAProxy is known for, we provide customers with\na simple, unified solution with the flexibility to proxy and load balance many\nmore applications.\n\n### # What can you do with the HAProxy Enterprise UDP Module?\n\nHAProxy Enterprise\u2019s UDP Module supports proxying and load balancing for time-\nsensitive UDP applications including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 DNS, NTP, RADIUS,\nand Syslog traffic.\n\nYou can now combine UDP proxying and load balancing with HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s\npowerful features such as health checks and monitoring, extending HAProxy\nEnterprise\u2019s reliability to more applications \u2013 while avoiding the complexity\nand overhead of managing multiple products.\n\n### # Why should you use the HAProxy Enterprise UDP Module?\n\nIt\u2019s fast. It wouldn\u2019t be HAProxy if it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise customers have long benefited from HAProxy\u2019s legendary\nperformance in load balancing TCP/HTTP traffic. When we decided to add UDP\nsupport, we resolved that UDP would not be treated as a second-class citizen\nin HAProxy Enterprise. It had to meet our high standards for performance and\nreliability.\n\nCustomers using HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s UDP Module benefit from faster and more\nreliable UDP load balancing compared with other software load balancers. We\nmeasured excellent throughput and reliability when testing HAProxy\nEnterprise\u2019s UDP Module with Syslog traffic.\n\nTest parameters:\n\n  * A single instance of HAProxy Enterprise 2.9.\n\n  * A network with 100Gb/s bandwidth.\n\n  * Log servers with a bandwidth of 40Gb/s capable of receiving 3.3M messages per second.\n\n  * A log line message size of 1,472 Bytes.\n\n  * A payload of 2 million log messages sent via the load balancer to the log servers.\n\nSyslog UDP bandwidth| Syslog UDP messages per second| Message delivery rate  \n---|---|---  \nHAProxy Enterprise| 46Gb/s| 3.8M/s| 99.2%  \n  \nIn our tests, we saw that HAProxy Enterprise\u2019s UDP Module is capable of\nprocessing 3.8 million messages per second \u2013 up to 4.6X faster than the\nnearest enterprise competitor.\n\nReliability was also excellent. UDP is a connectionless transport protocol\nwhere some packet loss is expected due to a variety of network conditions and,\nwhen it happens, is uncorrected because (unlike TCP) there is no client-server\nconnection to identify and correct packet loss. Despite this, we saw that\nHAProxy Enterprise\u2019s UDP Module achieved a very high delivery rate of 99.2%\nwhen saturating the log server\u2019s 40Gb\u2019s bandwidth \u2013 4X more reliable message\ndelivery than the nearest enterprise competitor.\n\nThis best-in-class UDP performance compared with other software load balancers\nhelps customers scale higher, eliminate performance bottlenecks, reduce\nresource utilization on servers and cloud compute, and decrease overall costs.\n\n## # Try HAProxy Enterprise 2.9\n\nThe world\u2019s leading companies and cloud providers trust HAProxy Technologies\nto protect their applications and APIs.
