However, current approaches for language-based\n> assistance can only answer questions about a single video. We propose an\n> approach that first automatically generates large amounts of visual\n> instruction tuning data involving pairs of videos from HowTo100M by\n> leveraging existing step annotations and accompanying narrations, and then\n> trains a video-conditioned language model to jointly reason across multiple\n> raw videos. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance at identifying\n> differences between video pairs and ranking videos based on the severity of\n> these differences, and shows promising ability to perform general reasoning\n> over multiple videos.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16222 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16222v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16222arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tushar Nagarajan [view email] [v1] Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:49:59 UTC (6,043\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Step Differences in Instructional Video, by\nTushar Nagarajan and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
