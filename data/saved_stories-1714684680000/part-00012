You read. We think.\n\n\u00ab Back to blog\n\n## A few observations following my latest US trip\n\nI spent 2 weeks in the US last month -first in NYC and then in SF. I've been\nsurprised by a few things. In no particular order:\n\n\ud83c\udf0e immigrants are everywhere. Like somewhere else you can meet them in low-\nstatus jobs but unlike somewhere else you also meet them at every other layer\nof the society -all the way to the top; and whatever that 'top' would mean\nexactly, you'll meet immigrants there. This is so empowering. I remember the\nstory of a brown couple living in Paris for 15 years, they loved the city and\ntheir lives over there but when their kids were teenagers they realised that\nthe only examples for them of people with the same color skin were in the\nkebab restaurants so they left. They now live in Boston. Their kids can still\nmeet people with the same color skin in local restaurants of course, but also\nas researchers, big company manager, startup CEO, politicians, journalists,\nyou name it.\n\nPortals of the Past from the San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\ud83d\udee0 it seems like everyone is looking ahead; which is so thrilling. Of course it\nmight be deeply related to my point above. In a society where so many people\nare coming from somewhere else, you're less inclined to 'protect the past' and\nshould indeed obsess more on 'building a better future'. 'AI' or 'blockchain'\nare neither insults nor complete unknown words. I've met a few young kids who\nwanted to 'build robots' or 'work on autonomous cars' later in life so they\nstarted learning to code and exploring machine learning. I was astonished.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 I think that one is a direct consequence of above: optimism and action are\nvalued by most. \"You think XYZ isn't optimized, could be done better, should\nlook differently, well, go ahead, do it. And meanwhile, let us know how we can\nhelp.\" These sentences are so rooted in action. You're not afraid of failure.\nActually there might be no failure. You'll either succeed or learn. Being\nstronger, smarter, wiser for whatever comes next. Because there'll always be a\n'next chapter' anyway so nothing to be worried about really.\n\n\ud83c\udf55 again, a direct consequence of above: the pie feels infinite. So don't\nstress too much how the current pie is sliced among people, focus on growing\nthe pie and everyone will benefit a bigger slice. Simple. Which is why success\nis so much celebrated. In my everyday interaction people always provided help.\nIt really felt like they truly wanted us to succeed, in the biggest way\npossible. And never did I feel some jealousy or anger about it.\n\n\ud83c\udf06 as a European, I geographically think on a 'city-basis'. If you ask me, I\nlive in Lyon; when I go to Paris I hit up my friends based over there,\nregardless of their arrondissement [district]. In both NYC and SF people were\ndefining themselves and thought on a 'neighborhood-basis'. It's not NYC per\nse, it's Manhattan or Brooklyn. Well, it's actually not even Manhattan or\nBrooklyn, it's Washington Square, the Village, Fort Green or Williamsburg.\nSame in California. At first I was throwing 'SF' for everything from the city\nitself to the Bay Area or Berkeley and Oakland but nope, people talked about\nPalo Alto, Haight-Ashbury or Noe Valley.\n\nNeedless to highlight the caveat here: all of the above is heavily biased,\nnon-complete and subjective. I did love my time over there so much, I'll be\nback for the whole summer in Berkeley, CA with the kids. I can't wait. And I\ntruly look forward for them to experiencing this energy and discovering such a\nmelting pot.\n\nUpvote Upvoted 0\n\nLike this post?\n\n0 responses\n\n### kev\n\n\"LE NEW CONSUMER\" with Objet.
