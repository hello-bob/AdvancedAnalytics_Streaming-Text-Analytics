Like other members of\nmy generation I was an early, enthusiastic adopter of the smartphone, but like\nJonathan Haidt, over the intervening decades I\u2019ve become increasingly\nskeptical of them. The digital world\u2019s enabled fantastic things, and is\nconvenient and entertaining beyond all reason, but its totally ubiquitous use\nis producing negative byproducts of world-altering magnitude \u2013 isolation,\ndepression, division \u2013 and we\u2019re only starting to acknowledge the dark road\nthey\u2019re leading to.\n\nSo getting to the trailhead, I happily stuffed my smartphone into a deep\npocket, and didn\u2019t take it out again until we\u2019d left the forest.\n\nI was surprised that my compatriots didn\u2019t feel the same way. Like, at all.\nNot only were they not looking to get away from their phones, but they\u2019d pull\nthem out at every opportunity, looking for signal every time we reached a high\nridge. Smartwatches were paired with the phones so that one would never have\nto be parted from a screen for too long. With hiking poles involved it takes a\nmodicum of effort to push them aside and yank a phone out of a pocket or\npouch, but a watch? Easy. Those can checked once every minute or two with\nbarely a flick of the wrist. The symbiotic relationship between computer and\nhuman grows ever more intense, trending to a place where the two are\ninexorably intertwined.\n\nBy the end of the trip I felt like my detox was successful. I was having novel\nideas and thinking freely in a way that\u2019s escaped me since my pre-phone days\nof the 90s and early 2000s. But this momentary victory quickly turned to\ndefeat as it only took a day or two back in civilization for it all came\nrushing back. The idle scrolling, the YouTube rabbit holes, the outrage\nmachine.\n\nI\u2019m still working on an overarching thesis for what to do about it, but my\ngeneral sentiment is that technology is good, computers are good, and the\ninternet is the greatest tool in history, but the ways in which we casually\nrelate to technology are bad. I think my ideal is to have intense, timeboxed\nsessions with fixed objectives in mind, like my objective to finish writing\nthis article, or finish a project at work, and with longer periods of non-\ntechnology between, with the phone mercifully silent, left charging in a\ndistant room.\n\nDid I make a mistake?
