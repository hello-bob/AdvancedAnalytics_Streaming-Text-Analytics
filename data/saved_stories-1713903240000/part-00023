Whether you're editing text, writing code, or\nmanipulating data, it'll be there for you at every step. In a few minutes - or\neven less - you'll be ready to code. Let's explore the different options\navailable to you.\n\n### Installing VS Code in a Few Clicks\n\nMost of the time, you'll install VS Code on your main workstation. The\nsimplest way is to use the package manager that comes with your operating\nsystem, or even the app store.\n\nWindows, you can install VS Code directly from the Microsoft Store\naka.ms/vscode-msstore in one click. Are you more of a command-line person? You\ncan use WinGet, Windows' package manager. Just execute the following command\nin the terminal:\n\n    \n    \n    winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode\n\n> Tip: WinGet is available by default in some versions of Windows 11. You can\n> learn more about WinGet in the official documentation:\n> https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/\n\nLinux, you can install VS Code using a package. You'll find all package\nformats (Debian, RPM, etc.) for your needs on the downloads page\ncode.visualstudio.com. The example below shows how to install the x64 version\non a Debian or Ubuntu OS.\n\n    \n    \n    wget -O vscode.deb https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64 sudo apt install ./vscode.deb\n\n> Learn More: VS Code is also available on Snaps, the app store for Linux. If\n> you're not familiar with Snaps, you can learn more on the official site:\n> https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd.\n\nMac: You can download the app from the official website. Then, simply drag and\ndrop the application into your Mac's Applications folder. If you're a HomeBrew\nuser (https://brew.sh), you can install VS Code with the command:\n\n    \n    \n    brew install --cask visual-studio-code\n\n### Portable Usage\n\nDo you remember \"portable apps\"? Those applications run from a USB drive,\nwithout installation? Even though this trend has declined, you can still be\nthe coding superhero without being the administrator of your workstation. Just\ndownload the \"zip\" (or \"tar.gz\") version of VS Code. You can then simply\nexecute code.exe (or its equivalent depending on your operating system) to\nwork with VS Code.\n\nIf you use this version regularly, you may want to keep your settings between\ndifferent sessions. In that case, you will need to create a data (or code-\nportable-data) folder at the same level as the VS Code executable.\n\n> Learn More: You can find more information on the portable version of VS Code\n> on the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable\n\n### Using VS Code Without Installing\n\nAre you at a friend's house and need to code quickly? The horror, there's only\nNotepad on their computer! Fortunately, VS Code comes to your rescue.\n\nSimply visit the site vscode.dev and you're ready to code, without installing\nanything!\n\nThis version of VS Code, running directly in your browser, can do wonders. It\ncan open a file from your computer, after your permission of course, or access\na Git repository.\n\n> Did You Know? If you use GitHub, you can use the \"github.dev\" editor. All\n> you have to do is press the . key on any GitHub repository to launch the\n> editor. You can also visit github.dev\n\nSome limitations exist on this web version. For instance, the integrated\nterminal or code compilation are unavailable. Some extensions - such as Live\nShare - are functional, others are not.\n\n### VS Code on Your Servers\n\nNeed access to a remote server? No \"Remote Desktop\" access? No problem, VS\nCode has two super solutions for you: SSH and VS Code Server.\n\nThe \"Remote - SSH\" extension allows you to connect to a remote server via SSH\nand use VS Code as if you were connected directly. You'll have access to the\nterminal and remote file system. We'll look more closely at how to install\nextensions in a later section.\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where you don't have direct SSH access:\nworkstation behind a firewall, Windows workstation, etc... In this case, you\ncan use VS Code Server. This mode of VS Code allows you to create a secure\ntunnel between your workstation and the remote workstation. The connection\nbetween the two machines is secured via your GitHub account. Therefore, you\ncannot use this tool to share your machine with someone else.\n\n> Important: Although VS Code Server does not directly expose your server to\n> the Internet, it creates an entry point on your machines. Before using it on\n> such workstations as production servers, ensure you fully understand the\n> implications for your Threat Model.\n\nTo start, install VS Code CLI on the target workstation, launch the magic\ncommand code tunnel, and authenticate with GitHub. If you're on a workstation\nwith a visual interface (like your desktop PC), activate the tunnel via the\naccounts menu.\n\nOnce the tunnel is activated, you can access your target workstation simply\nfrom vscode.dev. You can also access it from another workstation using the\nRemote - Tunnels extension.\n\n### Updating VS Code\n\nBy default, Visual Studio Code automatically suggests installing updates as\nthey become available. You can then choose to install it immediately or on the\nnext editor shutdown. Unless you're working with a portable version or have\nopted to disable this function, updating VS Code is a breeze.\n\nNow, let's talk cadence! The teams dedicated to VS Code unveil a minor version\nevery month. To fully enjoy what VS Code has to offer, consider following this\nmonthly rhythm. Some months may have more than one minor version, especially\nif there's security vulnerability or a regression. That's why it's strongly\nrecommended to enable automatic updates.\n\n### Staying Ahead with the Insider Edition\n\nFor the more daring, eagerness for new features, you can use the \"Insider\"\nedition of VS Code. This version is updated daily and gives you access to the\nlatest features before everyone else. Of course, it's like playing with a\nprototype - it can be a bit risky for production use. But don't worry, you can\nhave this version and the stable version side-by-side on your computer.\n\nYou can download the insiders version at\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/, and even access the web version at\nhttps://insiders.vscode.dev/.\n\n# results matching \"\"\n\n# No results matching \"\"\n\n", "frontpage": true}
