Shortly after\nsetting sail from the city\u2019s port, the vessel had lost power, and with it\ncontrol over its engine and navigation instruments. It was on course to hit\nthe Francis Scott Key Bridge, an important artery for commuters and goods that\nspans the Patapsco River. Minutes after the call, the Dali struck one of the\nbridge\u2019s pylons, causing the whole structure to collapse. First responders\nmanaged to close the bridge, but six construction workers who were filling\npotholes on the road, all immigrants from Central America, are presumed dead.\nNow one of America\u2019s busiest ports is closed. Rebuilding the bridge will take\nyears.\n\nThe Baltimore bridge crash is a global story. The Dali was on its way to Sri\nLanka with a cargo of around 4,700 containers, including some with hazardous\nmaterials. It was chartered to the Danish shipping giant Maersk, flew the flag\nof Singapore, and was managed by the Singaporean company Synergy Marine. Its\nowner, the Singapore-based entity Grace Ocean Private Limited, is in turn a\nsubsidiary of Grace Ocean Investment Limited, registered in the British Virgin\nIslands.\n\nInvestigations into what caused the Dali\u2019s blackout are ongoing. It could have\nbeen human error or a mechanical problem. In 2023 inspectors at a port in\nChile found a faulty pressure gauge that was fixed before the vessel left.\nAuthorities are also looking into whether an unregulated \u201cdirty\u201d shipping fuel\nled to engine failure.\n\nContinue reading for just $1 an issue!\n\nChoose a Digital subscription or our best deal\u2014All Access\u2014that includes print\nand digital issues, full archive access, and the NYR App!\n\nView Offers\n\nOr register for a free account to read just this article.
