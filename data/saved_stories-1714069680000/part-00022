While he cannot sell his\nstock until September due to the terms of a lockup agreement, the shares\u2019\nfluctuating value have at times made him one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people\non paper.\n\nAfter a stunning landing on New York\u2019s Nasdaq stock exchange, the value of\nTrump\u2019s social media company \u2013 which trades as DJT \u2013 has fallen drastically.\nThe stock hit a high of almost $80 on its opening day, but declined in fits in\nthe following weeks.\n\nTrump Media\u2019s CEO, Devin Nunes, has suggested that short sellers betting on\nthe loss of value may have been responsible for manipulating the stock.\n\nShares in Trump Media tanked further last week, falling 12% after the company\nrevealed it could sell millions of additional shares in the coming months.\nThey fell another 8% on Tuesday, even as they enabled Trump to qualify for his\nearn-out shares.\n\nThe company has also faced political scrutiny over the firm\u2019s financial\nbackers. A Democratic-aligned group issued a call earlier this month for\nlawmakers to investigate the company over allegations of influence peddling,\nafter the Guardian reported that a Russian-American businessman under federal\ncriminal investigation helped prop up the company.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

While its user base is tiny compared\nwith more established social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), the\nplatform has outgrown other rightwing apps.\n\nTrump is now on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, with prosecutors alleging that\nhe sought to undermine the 2016 presidential election through making illegal\nhush-money payments to cover up his affair with adult film star Stormy\nDaniels. Trump\u2019s defense lawyers have maintained he is innocent of all 34\nfelony counts of falsifying business documents, in what is the first criminal\ntrial of a former president in US history.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Business\n  * Donald Trump\n  * Social media\n  * Digital media\n  * Stock markets\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
