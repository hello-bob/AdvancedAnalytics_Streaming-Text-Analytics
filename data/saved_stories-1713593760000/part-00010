Barack Obama campaigned directly on the issue of\nthe \u201cdwindling middle class\u201d during his 2008 presidential run and appointed\nvice-president Joe Biden to lead a middle class task force specifically to\nbolster this demographic. Despite some recent economic improvement, Senator\nBernie Sanders of Vermont just two months ago cautioned that \u201cthe reality is\nthat the middle class today in this country is in desperate shape and the gap\nbetween the very very wealthy and everyone else is going to grow wider.\u201d\nConcerns about status likely will not be leaving the public consciousness any\ntime soon.\n\nOf course, status differences are not simply relevant to economic standing,\nbut they appear to be on our minds at all times. As renowned neuroscientist,\nMichael Gazzaniga, has noted, \u201cWhen you get up in the morning, you do not\nthink about triangles and squares and these similes that psychologists have\nbeen using for the past 100 years. You think about status. You think about\nwhere you are in relation to your peers.\u201d Between CEO and employee,\nquarterback and wide receiver, husband and wife, status looms large. Recent\nwork by social scientists has tackled the topic, elucidating behavioral\ndifferences between low-status and high-status individuals, and the methods by\nwhich those at the bottom of the totem pole are most successful at climbing to\nthe top.\n\nPsychologist PJ Henry at DePaul University recently published an article\ndemonstrating that low-status individuals have higher tendencies toward\nviolent behavior, explaining these differences in terms of low-status\ncompensation theory. Henry began this work by observing that murder rates were\nhigher in regions with landscapes conducive to herding compared to regions\nthat are conducive to farming, consistent with prior research showing an\nassociation between herding-based economies and violence. The traditional\nexplanation for this pattern, popularized by psychologists Dov Cohen and\nRichard Nisbett, is that herding cultures have a propensity for maintaining a\nCulture of Honor. The story goes that because herders from Southern Britain\noriginally settled in the Southern United States (and also established a\nherding economy on the new land), this left them in an economically precarious\nposition. The possessions of these herdsmen\u2014the most important of which was\ntheir livestock\u2014was susceptible to theft, forcing individuals to develop a\nquick trigger in response to threats, economic or otherwise. In comparison,\nthe farming economy of the North was far more secure, requiring a less\naggressive and protective stance toward one\u2019s personal resources.\n\nHenry took on the traditional Culture of Honor hypothesis to suggest instead\nthat differences between herding and farming cultures in violence actually\nstem from differences in status. His theory is based on a considerable\npsychological literature demonstrating that individuals from low-status groups\n(e.g. ethnic minorities) tend to engage in more vigilant psychological self-\nprotection than those from high-status groups. Low-status people are much more\nsensitive to being socially rejected and are more inclined to monitor their\nenvironment for threats. Because of this vigilance toward protecting their\nsense of self-worth, low-status individuals are quicker to respond violently\nto personal threats and insults.\n\nHenry first examined archival data on counties across the American South to\nshow that murder rates from 1972 to 2006 were far higher in counties that were\ndry and hilly (conducive to herding) than those that were moist and flat\n(conducive to farming). Above and beyond the effect of geography, however, the\nlevel of status disparities in a particular county explained these increased\nmurder rates. Even after accounting for the general level of wealth in a given\ncounty (wealthier counties tend to have lower murder rates), status disparity\nstill predicted murder rates. Not content with merely looking at the United\nStates, Henry analyzed data from 92 countries around the world, to find a\nreplication of this pattern. From Albania to Zimbabwe, greater status\ndisparities predicted greater levels of violence.\n\nTo provide evidence that tendencies for psychological self-protection were the\ncrucial critical link between status and violence, Henry assessed survey data\nfrom over 1,500 Americans. In this nationally representative sample, low-\nsocioeconomic status (low-SES) individuals reported far more psychological\ndefensiveness in terms of considering themselves more likely to be taken\nadvantage of and trusting people less.\n\nFinally, in an experiment with both high- and low-SES college students, Henry\ndemonstrated that boosting people\u2019s sense of self-worth diminished aggressive\ntendencies amongst low-status individuals. Henry asked some students in the\nexperiment to write about a time when they felt important and valuable. Other\nstudents did not receive this assignment, but instead completed a rote task\nabout defining nouns. In a second portion of the experiment, all participants\nanswered questions about how willing they would be to respond aggressively to\nthreats. Consistent with the general population studies, college students from\nlow-SES backgrounds expressed more willingness to respond aggressively to\ninsults, but this tendency diminished markedly for those who first wrote about\nthemselves as important and valuable.\n\nAlthough this pattern of low-status compensation is important on its own, it\nis also unfortunate given a separate body of research on how people actually\nattain higher status. This research, recently summarized in an article by\npsychologists, Cameron Anderson and Gavin J Kilduff, shows that those who are\neffective in attaining status do so through behaving generously and helpfully\nto bolster their value to their group. In other words, low-status individuals\u2019\naggressive and violent behavior is precisely the opposite of what they should\nbe doing to ascend the societal totem pole.\n\nAnderson and Kilduff demonstrated in one study that people in a group math\nproblem-solving task who merely signaled their competence through being more\nvocal attained higher status and were able to do so regardless of their actual\ncompetence on the task. Research by psychologists Charlie L. Hardy and Mark\nVan Vugt, and sociologist Robb Willer have shown that generosity is the key to\nstatus. People afford greater status to individuals who donate more of their\nown money to a communal fund and those who sacrifice their individual\ninterests for the public good. Demonstrating your value to a group\u2014whether\nthrough competence or selflessness\u2014appears to improve status. Anderson and\nAiwa Shirako suggest that the amplifier for this effect is the degree to which\none has social connections with others. Their studies involved MBA students\nengaging in a variety of negotiations tasks. They showed that individuals who\nbehaved cooperatively attained a more positive reputation, but only if they\nwere socially embedded in the group. Those who behaved cooperatively, but\nlacked connections went unnoticed. Social connectedness had similar effects\nfor uncooperative MBA students. Those who were selfish and well-connected saw\ntheir reputation diminish.\n\nThe sum of these findings can begin to explain the troubled circumstances of\nthose lowest in status. Ongoing efforts to maintain a positive view of oneself\ndespite economic and social hardships can engage psychological defense\nmechanisms that are ultimately self-defeating. Instead of ingratiating\nthemselves to those around them \u2013 this is the successful strategy for status\nattainment - low-status individuals may be more prone to bullying and hostile\nbehavior, especially when provoked. Research identifying factors that lead to\nsuccessful status-seeking provides some optimism, though. Individuals capable\nof signaling their worth to others rather than being preoccupied with\nsignaling their worth to themselves may be able to break the self-defeating\ncycle of low-status behavior.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nAdam Waytz is an Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations at\nNorthwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
