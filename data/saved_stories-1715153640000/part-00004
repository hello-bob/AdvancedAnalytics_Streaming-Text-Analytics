The exercise involved both live exercises and computer\nsimulations, costing US$250 million (equivalent to about $423M in 2023), the\nmost expensive war game in US military history.^[1] MC02 was set in 2007,\nintended to be a test of future military \"transformation\"\u2014a transition towards\nnew technologies that enabled network-centric warfare, and providing a more\neffective command and control of current and future weaponry and tactics. The\nsimulated combatants were the United States, referred to as \"Blue\", and a\nfictitious state in the Persian Gulf, \"Red\", often characterized as Iran or\nIraq.^[2]^[3]\n\nMC02 was an experiment mandated by Congress in 2000 to \"explore critical war\nfighting challenges at the operational level of war that will confront United\nStates joint military forces after 2010.\"^[4] The simulation took two years of\nplanning and involved 13,000 troops. The Red force, led by retired Marine\nCorps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, used numerous asymmetrical tactics\nunanticipated by the Blue force, resulting in initial major successes. Over\nthe course of the simulation, constraints were placed on the Red force's\nability to free-play \"to the point where the end state was scripted\",^[4]\nresulting in a Blue victory.\n\n## Constraints[edit]\n\nSince the war game allowed for a ship-to-shore landing of ground troops at\nsome (unknown) point during the 14 day exercise, and because their naval force\nwas substantial, the Blue force was positioned on the shore-side of the\nregion's active shipping lanes to keep them from impacting commerce during the\nexercise. This placed them near the Red shore rather than at a \"standoff\"\ndistance. Conducting the war games during peacetime also meant that there were\na large number of friendly/unaligned ships and aircraft in the zone,\nrestricting the use of automated defense systems and more cautious Rules of\nEngagement. Red's tactics took full advantage of these factors, and to great\neffect.\n\n## Exercise action[edit]\n\nLt. Gen. Paul Van Riper\n\nRed, commanded by retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper,\nadopted an asymmetric strategy, in particular, simulating using old methods to\nevade Blue's sophisticated electronic surveillance network. Van Riper\nsimulated using motorcycle messengers to transmit orders to front-line troops\nand World-War-II-style light signals to launch airplanes without radio\ncommunications in the model.\n\nRed received an ultimatum from Blue, essentially a surrender document,\ndemanding a response within 24 hours. Thus warned of Blue's approach, Red used\na fleet of small boats to determine the position of Blue's fleet by the second\nday of the exercise. In a preemptive strike, Red launched a massive salvo of\ncruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces' electronic sensors and\ndestroyed sixteen warships: one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of\nBlue's six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would\nhave resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the\ncruise missile offensive, another significant portion of Blue's navy was\n\"sunk\" by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional\nand suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue's inability to detect them as\nwell as expected.\n\nSuch defeat can be attributed to various shortfall in simulation capabilities\nand design that significantly hindered Blueforce fighting and command\ncapabilities. Examples include: a time lag in intelligence, surveillance, and\nreconnaissance information being forwarded to the Blueforce by the simulation\nmaster, various glitches that limited Blue ships point-defense capabilities\nand error in the simulation which placed ships unrealistically close to Red\nassets.^[5]^[6]\n\n## Exercise suspension and restart[edit]\n\nAt this point, the exercise was suspended, Blue's ships were \"re-floated\", and\nthe rules of engagement were changed; this was later justified by General\nPeter Pace as follows: \"You kill me in the first day and I sit there for the\nnext 13 days doing nothing, or you put me back to life and you get 13 more\ndays' worth of experiment out of me. Which is a better way to do it?\"^[2]\n\nAfter the war game was restarted, its participants were forced to follow a\nscript drafted to ensure a Blue Force victory. Among other rules imposed by\nthis script, Red Force was ordered to turn on their anti-aircraft radar in\norder for them to be destroyed, and during a combined parachute assault by the\n82nd Airborne Division and Marines air assaulting on the then new and still\ncontroversial CV-22, Van Riper's forces were ordered not to shoot down any of\nthe approaching aircraft.^[7]^[8] Van Riper also claimed that exercise\nofficials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against\nBlue Force, and that they also ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons\nsystems against Blue Force and even ordered the location of Red Force units to\nbe revealed.^[9] The postmortem JFCOM report on MC02 would say \"As the\nexercise progressed, the OPFOR free-play was eventually constrained to the\npoint where the end state was scripted. This scripting ensured a blue team\noperational victory and established conditions in the exercise for transition\noperations.\"^[10]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nThe rule changes following the restart led to accusations that the war game\nhad turned from an honest, open, free playtest of U.S. war-fighting\ncapabilities into a rigidly controlled and scripted exercise intended to end\nin an overwhelming U.S. victory,^[8] alleging that \"$250 million was\nwasted\".^[11] Van Riper was extremely critical of the scripted nature of the\nnew exercise and resigned from the exercise in the middle of the war\ngame.^[12] Van Riper later said that Vice Admiral Marty Mayer altered the\nexercise's purpose to reinforce existing doctrine and notions within the U.S.\nmilitary rather than serving as a learning experience.\n\nVan Riper also stated that the war game was rigged so that it appeared to\nvalidate the modern, joint-service war-fighting concepts it was supposed to be\ntesting.^[9] He was quoted in the ZDF\u2013New York Times documentary The Perfect\nWar (2004)^[13] as saying that what he saw in MC02 echoed the same view\npromoted by the Department of Defense under Robert McNamara before and during\nthe Vietnam War, namely that the U.S. military could not and would not be\ndefeated.\n\nResponding to Van Riper's criticism, Vice Admiral Mayer, who ran the war game\nand who was charged with developing the military's joint concepts and\nrequirements, stated the following:^[9]\n\n> Gen. Van Riper apparently feels he was too constrained. I can only say there\n> were certain parts where he was not constrained, and then there were parts\n> where he was in order to facilitate the conduct of the experiment and\n> certain exercise pieces that were being done.\n>\n> \u2014 Vice Admiral Marty Mayer\n\nNavy Captain John Carman, Joint Forces Command spokesman, said the war game\nhad properly validated all the major concepts which were tested by Blue Force,\nignoring the restrictions placed on Van Riper's Red Force that led them to\nsucceed. Based on these findings, Carman stated that recommendations based on\nthe war game's result on areas such as doctrine, training, and procurement\nwould be forwarded to General Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs\nof Staff.^[9]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Borger, Julian (2002-08-21). \"War game was fixed to ensure American victory, claims general\".
