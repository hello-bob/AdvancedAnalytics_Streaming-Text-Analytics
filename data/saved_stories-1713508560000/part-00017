The majority of its population lives\non the southern coastline of the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in\nthe northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean.^[11] The capital is\nPorto-Novo, and the seat of government is in Cotonou, the most populous city\nand economic capital.^[citation needed] Benin covers an area of 114,763 km^2\n(44,310 sq mi),^[4] and its population in 2021 was estimated to be\napproximately 13 million.^[12]^[13] It is a small, tropical country. It is one\nof the least developed, with an economy heavily dependent on agriculture, and\nis an exporter of palm oil and cotton. Some employment and income arise from\nsubsistence agriculture.^[14]^[better source needed]\n\nFrom the 17th to the 19th century, political entities in the area included the\nKingdom of Dahomey, the city-state of Porto-Novo, and other states to the\nnorth. This region was referred to as the Slave Coast of West Africa from the\nearly 17th century due to the high number of people who were sold and\ntrafficked during the Atlantic slave trade to the New World. France took over\nthe territory in 1894, incorporating it into French West Africa as French\nDahomey. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. As a sovereign\nstate, Benin has had democratic governments, military coups, and military\ngovernments. A self-described Marxist\u2013Leninist state called the People's\nRepublic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by\nthe multi-party Republic of Benin.^[15]\n\nThe official language of Benin is French, with indigenous languages such as\nFon, Bariba, Yoruba and Dendi also spoken. The largest religious group in\nBenin is Christianity (52.2%), followed by Islam (24.6%) and African\nTraditional Religions (17.9%).^[3] Benin is a member of the United Nations,\nthe African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation, the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation\nZone, Francophonie, the Community of Sahel\u2013Saharan States, the African\nPetroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority.\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nDuring French colonial rule and after independence on 1 August 1960, the\ncountry was named Dahomey, after the Kingdom of Dahomey. On 30 November 1975,\nthe country was renamed Benin following a Marxist\u2013Leninist military coup in\n1972.^[16] The Bight of Benin borders the country, and the bight takes its\nname from the Kingdom of Benin, located in present-day Nigeria.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Benin\n\n### Pre-colonial[edit]\n\nMap of the Kingdom of Dahomey, 1793.\n\nPrior to 1600, present-day Benin comprised a variety of areas with different\npolitical systems and ethnicities. These included city-states along the coast\n(primarily of the Aja ethnic group, and also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples)\nand tribal regions inland (composed of Bariba, Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye\npeoples). The Oyo Empire, located primarily to the east of Benin, was a\nmilitary force in the region, conducting raids and exacting tribute from the\ncoastal kingdoms and tribal regions.^[17] The situation changed in the 17th\nand 18th centuries as the Kingdom of Dahomey, consisting mostly of Fon people,\nwas founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the\ncoast.^[18] By 1727, King Agaja of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the\ncoastal cities of Allada and Whydah. Dahomey had become a tributary of the Oyo\nEmpire, and rivaled but did not directly attack the Oyo-allied city-state of\nPorto-Novo.^[19] The rise of Dahomey, its rivalry with Porto-Novo, and tribal\npolitics in the northern region persisted into the colonial and post-colonial\nperiods.^[20]\n\nIn the Dahomey, some younger people were apprenticed to older soldiers and\ntaught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the\narmy.^[21] Dahomey instituted an elite female soldier corps variously called\nAhosi (the king's wives), Mino (\"our mothers\" in Fongbe), or the \"Dahomean\nAmazons\". This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey\nthe nickname of \"Black Sparta\", from European observers and 19th-century\nexplorers such as Sir Richard Burton.^[22]\n\nThe Portuguese Empire was the longest European presence in Benin, beginning in\n1680 and ending in 1961 when the last forces left Ajud\u00e1.\n\nThe kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery^[23]\nor killed them ritually in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. By about\n1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated \u00a3250,000 per year by\nselling African captives to European slave-traders.^[24] The area was named\nthe \"Slave Coast\" because of a flourishing slave trade. Court protocols which\ndemanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's battles be\ndecapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area.\nThe number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per\ndecade by the 1860s.^[25] The decline was partly due to the Slave Trade Act\n1807 banning the trans-Atlantic slave trade by Britain in 1808, followed by\nother countries.^[24] This decline continued until 1885 when the last slave\nship departed the modern Benin Republic for Brazil, which had yet to abolish\nslavery. The capital Porto-Novo (\"New Port\" in Portuguese) was originally\ndeveloped as a port for the slave trade.\n\nDahomey Amazons with the King at their head, going to war, 1793.\n\nAmong the goods the Portuguese sought were carved items of ivory made by\nBenin's artisans in the form of carved saltcellars, spoons, and hunting horns\n- pieces of African art produced for sale abroad as exotic objects.^[26]\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\nSee also: Second Franco-Dahomean War\n\nA French depiction of the conquest of Dahomey in 1893\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, Dahomey had \"begun to weaken and lose its\nstatus as the regional power\". The French took over the area in 1892. In 1899,\nthe French included the land called French Dahomey within the larger French\nWest Africa colonial region.\n\nFrance sought to benefit from Dahomey and the region \"appeared to lack the\nnecessary agricultural or mineral resources for large-scale capitalist\ndevelopment\". As a result, France treated Dahomey as a sort of preserve in\ncase future discoveries revealed resources worth developing.^[27]\n\nThe French government outlawed the capture and sale of slaves. Previous\nslaveowners sought to redefine their control over slaves as control over land,\ntenants, and lineage members. This provoked a struggle among Dahomeans,\n\"concentrated in the period from 1895 to 1920, for the redistribution of\ncontrol over land and labor. Villages sought to redefine boundaries of lands\nand fishing preserves. Religious disputes scarcely veiled the factional\nstruggles over control of land and commerce which underlay them. Factions\nstruggled for the leadership of great families\".^[25]\n\nIn 1958, France granted autonomy to the Republic of Dahomey, and full\nindependence on 1 August 1960 which is celebrated each year as Independence\nDay, a national holiday.^[28] The president who led the country to\nindependence was Hubert Maga.^[29]^[30]\n\n### Post-colonial[edit]\n\nAfter 1960, there were coups and regime changes, with the figures of Hubert\nMaga, Sourou Apithy, Justin Ahomad\u00e9gb\u00e9, and \u00c9mile Derlin Zinsou dominating;\nthe first 3 each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country.\nThese 3 agreed to form a Presidential Council after violence marred the 1970\nelections.\n\nOn 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomad\u00e9gb\u00e9. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col.\nMathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and\nstating that the country would not \"burden itself by copying foreign ideology,\nand wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism\". On 30 November 1974,\nhe announced that the country was officially Marxist, under control of the\nMilitary Council of the Revolution (CMR), which nationalized the petroleum\nindustry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country the People's\nRepublic of Benin.^[31]^[32] The regime of the People's Republic of Benin\nunderwent changes over the course of its existence: a nationalist period\n(1972\u20131974); a socialist phase (1974\u20131982); and a phase involving an opening\nto Western countries and economic liberalism (1982\u20131990).^[33]\n\nIn 1974, under the influence of young revolutionaries \u2013 the \"Ligmangers\" - the\ngovernment embarked on a socialist program: nationalization of strategic\nsectors of the economy, reform of the education system, establishment of\nagricultural cooperatives and new local government structures, and a campaign\nto eradicate \"feudal forces\" including tribalism. The regime banned opposition\nactivities. Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou was elected president by the National\nRevolutionary Assembly in 1980, re-elected in 1984. Establishing relations\nwith China, North Korea, and Libya, he put \"nearly all\" businesses and\neconomic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin\nto dry up.^[34] K\u00e9r\u00e9kou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own\naphorisms such as \"Poverty is not a fatality\".^[34] The regime financed itself\nby contracting to take nuclear waste, first from the Soviet Union and later\nfrom France.^[34]\n\nIn the 1980s, Benin experienced higher economic growth rates (15.6% in 1982,\n4.6% in 1983 and 8.2% in 1984), until the closure of the Nigerian border with\nBenin led to a drop in customs and tax revenues. The government was no longer\nable to pay civil servants' salaries.^[33] In 1989, riots broke out when the\nregime did not have enough money to pay its army. The banking system\ncollapsed. Eventually, K\u00e9r\u00e9kou renounced Marxism, and a convention forced\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou to release political prisoners and arrange elections.^[34]\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was abolished as the country's form of government.^[35]\n\nThe country's name was officially changed to the Republic of Benin on 1 March\n1990, after the newly formed government's constitution was completed.^[36]\n\nYayi Boni's 2006 presidential inauguration\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou lost to Nic\u00e9phore Soglo in a 1991 election and became the first\nPresident on the African mainland to lose power through an election.^[37]\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, an election\nresulted in K\u00e9r\u00e9kou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed\nelection irregularities.^[38] In 1999, K\u00e9r\u00e9kou issued a national apology for\nthe substantial role that Africans had played in the Atlantic slave\ntrade.^[39]\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both\nwere barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of\ncandidates.^[40] On 5 March 2006, an election resulted in a runoff between\nYayi Boni and Adrien Houngb\u00e9dji. The runoff election was held on 19 March and\nwas won by Boni,^[41] who assumed office on 6 April.^[42] Boni was reelected\nin 2011, taking 53.18% of the vote in the first round\u2014enough to avoid a runoff\nelection. He was the first president to win an election without a runoff since\nthe restoration of democracy in 1991.^[43]\n\nIn the March 2016 presidential elections in which Boni Yayi was barred by the\nconstitution from running for a third term, businessman Patrice Talon won the\nsecond round with 65.37% of the vote, defeating investment banker and former\nPrime Minister Lionel Zinsou. Talon was sworn in on 6 April 2016.^[44]\nSpeaking on the same day that the Constitutional Court confirmed the results,\nTalon said that he would \"first and foremost tackle constitutional reform\",\ndiscussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of 5 years in order\nto combat \"complacency\". He said that he planned to slash the size of the\ngovernment from 28 to 16 members.^[45] In April 2021, President Patrice Talon\nwas re-elected, with more than 86.3% of the votes cast, in Benin's\npresidential election.^[46] The change in election laws resulted in total\ncontrol of parliament by president Talon's supporters.^[47]\n\nIn February 2022, Benin saw its largest terrorist attack in history.^[48]\n\nOn 20 February 2022, President Patrice Talon inaugurated an exhibition with 26\npieces of sacred art returned to Benin by France, 129 years after they were\nlooted by colonial forces.^[49]\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\nMain article: Politics of Benin\n\nIts politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative\ndemocratic republic in which the President of Benin is both head of state and\nhead of government, within a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised\nby the government. Legislative power is vested in the government and the\nlegislature. The judiciary is officially independent of the executive and the\nlegislature, while in practice its independence has been gradually hollowed\nout by Talon, and the Constitutional Court is headed by his former personal\nlawyer.^[50] The political system is derived from the 1990 Constitution of\nBenin and the subsequent transition to democracy in 1991.\n\nIt was ranked 18th out of 52 African countries and scored best in the\ncategories of Safety & Rule of Law and Participation & Human Rights.^[51] In\nits 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Benin\n53rd out of 169 countries. That place had fallen to 78th by 2016, when Talon\ntook office, and has fallen further to 113th.^[50] Benin has been rated\nequal-88th out of 159 countries in a 2005 analysis of police, business, and\npolitical corruption.^[52]\n\nIts democratic system \"has eroded\" since President Talon took office.^[50] In\n2018 his government introduced new rules for fielding candidates and raised\nthe cost of registering. The electoral commission, packed with Talon's allies,\nbarred all opposition parties from the parliamentary election in 2019,\nresulting in a parliament made up entirely of supporters of Talon. That\nparliament subsequently changed election laws such that presidential\ncandidates need to have the approval of at least 10% of Benin's MPs and\nmayors. As parliament and most mayors' offices are controlled by Talon, he has\ncontrol over who can run for president. These changes have drawn condemnation\nfrom international observers and led to the United States government partially\nterminating development assistance to the country.^[53]^[54]^[55]^[56]\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\nMain articles: Departments of Benin and Communes of Benin\n\nDepartments of Benin.\n\nBenin is divided into twelve departments (French: d\u00e9partements) which are\nsubdivided into 77 communes.

In 2015, public expenditure on education (all levels) amounted to 4.4%\nof GDP, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Within this\nexpenditure, Benin devoted a share to tertiary education: 0.97% of GDP.^[74]\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, the share of people enrolled at university rose from\n10% to 12% of the 18\u201325 year age cohort.

It is bounded by Togo to the west, Burkina\nFaso and Niger to the north, Nigeria to the east, and the Bight of Benin to\nthe south. The distance from the Niger River in the north to the Atlantic\nOcean in the south is about 650 km (404 mi). Although the coastline measures\n121 km (75 mi), the country measures about 325 km (202 mi) at its widest\npoint. Four terrestrial ecoregions lie within Benin's borders: Eastern Guinean\nforests, Nigerian lowland forests, Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, and West\nSudanian savanna.^[82] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean\nscore of 5.86/10, ranking it 93rd globally out of 172 countries.^[83]\n\nAtakora, 1 of Benin's 2 northernmost departments.\n\nBenin shows some variation in elevation and can be divided into 4 areas from\nthe south to the north, starting with the lower-lying, sandy, coastal plain\n(highest elevation 10 m (32.8 ft)) which is, at most, 10 km (6.2 mi) wide. It\nis marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean.\nBehind the coast lies the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic-covered plateaus of\nsouthern Benin (altitude between 20 and 200 m (66 and 656 ft)), which are\nsplit by valleys running north to south along the Couffo, Zou, and Ou\u00e9m\u00e9\nRivers.\n\nThis geography makes it vulnerable to climate change. With the majority of the\ncountry living near the coast in lower-lying areas sea level rise could have\neffects on the economy and population.^[84] Northern areas will see additional\nregions become deserts.^[85] An area of flatter land dotted with rocky hills\nwhose altitude reaches 400 m (1,312 ft) extends around Nikki and Save.\n\nA range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo; these\nare the Atacora. The highest point, Mont Sokbaro, is at 658 m (2,159 ft).\nBenin has fields, mangroves, and remnants of forests. In the rest of the\ncountry, the savanna is covered with thorny scrub and dotted with baobab\ntrees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest\nof Benin, the Reserve du W du Niger and Pendjari National Park has African\nbush elephants, lions, antelopes, hippopotamus and monkeys.^[62]^[verification\nneeded] Pendjari National Park together with the bordering Parks Arli and W\nNational Park in Burkina Faso and Niger are among the strongholds of the lion\nin West Africa; with an estimated 246\u2013466 lions, W-Arli-Pendjari harbors the\nlargest remaining lion population in West Africa.^[86] Historically Benin has\nserved as habitat for the endangered African wild dog, Lycaon pictus;^[87]\nthis canid is thought to have been locally extinct.\n\nAnnual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300 mm or about 51 inches. Benin\nhas 2 rainy and 2 dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from\nApril to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from September to\nNovember. The main dry season is from December to April, with a cooler dry\nseason from July to September. Temperatures and humidity are higher along the\ntropical coast. In Cotonou, the average maximum temperature is 31 \u00b0C (87.8\n\u00b0F); the minimum is 24 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F).^[62]\n\nVariations in temperature increase when moving north through savanna and\nplateau toward the Sahel. A dry wind from the Sahara called the Harmattan\nblows from December to March, when grass dries up, other vegetation turns\nreddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the\nskies to be \"overcast\". It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the\nfields.^[62]\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Benin\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\nMain article: Economy of Benin\n\nA proportional representation of Benin exports, 2019Extensive agriculture in\nthe north of Benin, near Djougou.Real GDP per capita development of Benin\nsince 1950\n\nThe economy is dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and\nregional trade. Cotton accounts for 40% of the GDP and roughly 80% of official\nexport receipts.^[88]\n\nReal GDP growth was estimated at 5.1 and 5.7% in 2008 and 2009, respectively.\nThe main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the\nmain export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP\nmostly because of Benin's geographical location, enabling trade,\ntransportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighboring\nstates.^[89] Benin's overall macroeconomic conditions were \"positive\" in 2017,\nwith a growth rate of around 5.6%. Economic growth was mostly driven by the\ncotton industry and other cash crops, the Port of Cotonou, and\ntelecommunications. A source of revenue is the Port of Cotonou, and the\ngovernment is seeking to expand its revenue base. In 2017, Benin imported\nabout $2.8 billion in goods such as rice, meat and poultry, alcoholic\nbeverages, fuel plastic materials, specialized mining and excavating\nmachinery, telecommunications equipment, passenger vehicles, and toiletries\nand cosmetics. Principal exports are ginned cotton, cotton cake and cotton\nseeds, cashew, shea butter, cooking oil, and lumber.^[90]\n\nAccess to biocapacity is lower than world average. In 2016, Benin had 0.9\nglobal hectares^[91] of biocapacity per person within its territory, less than\nthe world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.^[92] In 2016 Benin used\n1.4 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of\nconsumption. This means they use \"slightly under double\" as much biocapacity\nas Benin contains. As a result, Benin is running a biocapacity deficit.^[91]\n\nCotton field in northern Benin.\n\nIn order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign\ninvestment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new\nfood processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new\ninformation and communication technology. Projects to improve the business\nclimate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system,\nand the financial sector were included in Benin's US$307 million Millennium\nChallenge Account grant signed in February 2006.^[93]\n\nThe Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation,\nwith Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while\npressing for more rapid structural reforms. An \"insufficient\" electrical\nsupply continues to \"adversely affect\" Benin's economic growth and the\ngovernment has taken steps to increase domestic power production.^[61]\n\nWhile trade unions in Benin represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the\ninformal economy has been noted by the International Trade Union Confederation\n(ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality,\nthe use of child labor, and the continuing issue of forced labor.^[94] Benin\nis a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in\nAfrica (OHADA).^[95]\n\nCotonou has the country's only seaport and international airport. Benin is\nconnected by 2-lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo,\nBurkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available\nacross the country through operators. ADSL connections are available in some\nareas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections\n(since 1998) and a single submarine cable SAT-3/WASC (since 2001). Relief of\n\"high price\" is expected with the initiation of the Africa Coast to Europe\ncable in 2011.\n\nWith the GDP growth rate of 4\u20135% remaining consistent over 2 decades, poverty\nhas been increasing.^[96] According to the National Institute of Statistics\nand Economic Analysis in Benin, those living under the poverty line have\nincreased from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015.^[97]\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n#### National policy framework[edit]\n\nThe Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research is responsible for\nimplementing science policy. The National Directorate of Scientific and\nTechnological Research handles planning and coordination whereas the National\nCouncil for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of\nSciences, Arts, and Letters each play an advisory role. Financial support\ncomes from Benin's National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological\nInnovation. The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and\nTechnological Innovation carries out technology transfer through the\ndevelopment and dissemination of research results.^[74] Benin was ranked 120th\nin the Global Innovation Index in 2023.^[98]^[99]\n\nThe regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 when the science policy was\nprepared. This has been updated and complemented by new texts on science and\ninnovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):^[74]\n\n  * a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013);\n  * a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants;\n  * a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014;\n  * a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015).\n\nEqually important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing\npolicy documents:\n\n  * Benin Development Strategies 2025: Benin 2025 Alafia (2000);\n  * Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011\u20132016 (2011);\n  * Phase 3 of the Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector, covering 2013\u20132015;\n  * Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013\u20132017 (2014).\n\nIn 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health,\neducation, construction and building materials, transportation and trade,\nculture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate\nchange.^[74]\n\nSome so-called challenges facing research and development in Benin are:^[74]\n\n  * the unfavorable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers;\n  * the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and\n  * the mismatch between research and development needs.\n\n#### Human and financial investment in research[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts). This corresponds to\n115 researchers per million inhabitants. The \"main research structures\" are\nthe Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of\nAgricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in\nEducation, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for\nEntomological Research.^[74]\n\nThe University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the World Bank in 2014 to\nparticipate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in\napplied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million\nto Benin. The Association of African Universities has received funds to enable\nit to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa\ninvolved in the project.^[74]\n\nThere are \"no available data\" on Benin's level of investment in research and\ndevelopment.^[74]\n\nIn 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December\n2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and\nSierra Leone from Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, as\npart of a joint initiative by the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to\nhelp combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a reminder of the\nunderinvestment in West African health systems.^[74]\n\nThe Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural\ndevelopment in 2010, while the members of the African Union had agreed to\ncommit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the Maputo Declaration of 2003.\nThey reiterated this goal in the Malabo Declaration adopted in Equatorial\nGuinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to\ndevote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to\ntargets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss\nand bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. African leaders meeting in\nEquatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common\nstandard of measurement for the 10% target.^[100]\n\n#### Research output[edit]\n\nBenin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in\nWest Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation\nIndex Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants\ncataloged in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 for the Gambia,\n49.6 for Cape Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of\npublications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86\nto 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's \"main scientific collaborators\" were\nbased in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254),\nBelgium (198) and Germany (156).^[74]\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\nMain article: Transport in Benin\n\nTransport in Benin includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin\npossesses a total of 6,787 km of highway, of which 1,357 km are paved. Of the\npaved highways in the country, there are 10 expressways. This leaves 5,430 km\nof unpaved road. The Trans-West African Coastal Highway crosses Benin,\nconnecting it to Nigeria to the east, and Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast to the\nwest. When construction in Liberia and Sierra Leone is finished, the highway\nwill continue west to 7 other Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway connects Benin northwards to Niger, and\nthrough that country to Burkina Faso and Mali to the north-west.\n\nRail transport in Benin consists of 578 km (359 mi) of single track, 1,000 mm\n(3 ft 3+3\u20448 in) metre gauge railway. Construction work has commenced on\ninternational lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria, with outline\nplans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso. Benin will\nbe a participant in the AfricaRail project.\n\nCadjehoun Airport, located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to\nAccra, Niamey, Monrovia, Lagos, Ouagadougou, Lom\u00e9, and Douala, and other\ncities in Africa. Direct services link Cotonou to Paris, Brussels, and\nIstanbul.\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\nPalais Des Congres in Cotonou.\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\nSee also: Benin literature, Music of Benin, Cinema of Benin, and List of\nBeninese artists\n\nMusic group\n\nBeninese literature had an oral tradition before French became the dominant\nlanguage.^[101] F\u00e9lix Couchoro wrote the first Beninese novel, L'Esclave (The\nSlave), in 1929.\n\nPost-independence, native folk music was combined with Ghanaian highlife,\nFrench cabaret, American rock, funk and soul, and Congolese rumba.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nBiennale Benin, continuing the projects of some organizations and artists,\nstarted in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called \"Regard Benin\".\nIn 2012, the project became a biennial coordinated by a federation of local\nassociations. The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012\nBiennale Benin were curated by Abdellah Karroum.^[102]^[103]\n\n### Customary names[edit]\n\nSome Beninese in the south of the country have Akan-based names indicating the\nday of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the Akan\npeople such as the Akwamu and others.^[104]\n\n### Language[edit]\n\nMain article: Languages of Benin\n\nLocal languages are used as the many languages of instruction in elementary\nschools, with French introduced in later years. At the secondary school level,\nFrench is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are \"generally\ntranscribed\" with a separate letter for each speech sound (phoneme), rather\nthan using diacritics as in French or digraphs as in English. This includes\nBeninese Yoruba, which in Nigeria is written with both diacritics and\ndigraphs. For instance, the mid vowels written \u00e9, \u00e8, \u00f4, o in French are\nwritten e, \u025b, o, \u0254 in Beninese languages, whereas the consonants that are\nwritten ng and sh or ch in English are written \u014b and c. Digraphs are used for\nnasal vowels and the labial-velar consonants kp and gb, as in the name of the\nFon language Fon gbe /f\u00f5 \u0261\u0361be/, and diacritics are used as tone marks. In\nFrench-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies\nmay be seen.\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\nAcaraj\u00e9 is peeled black-eyed peas formed into a ball and then deep-fried.\n\nMain article: Benin cuisine\n\nThe cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In\nsouthern Benin cuisine, an ingredient is corn which has been used to prepare\ndough which has been served with peanut- or tomato-based sauces. Fish and\nchicken, beef, goat, and bush rat are consumed. A staple in northern Benin is\nyams which has been served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the\nnorthern provinces use beef and pork meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil\nor cooked in sauces. Cheese is used in some dishes. Couscous, rice, and beans\nare eaten, along with fruits such as mangoes, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi\nfruit, and pineapples.\n\nMeals are said to be generally light on meat and generous on vegetable fat.\nFrying in palm or peanut oil is a meat preparation, and smoked fish is\nprepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare corn flour, which is made into\na dough and served with sauces. \"Chicken on the spit\" is a recipe in which\nchicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. Palm roots are sometimes\nsoaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used\nin dishes. Some people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.^[citation needed]\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\nThe major sports in Benin are association football, basketball, golf, cycling,\nbaseball, softball, tennis and rugby union.^[105] In the early 21st century,\nbaseball and teqball were introduced to the country.^[106]^[107]\n\n### Traditional authorities[edit]\n\nBenin has numerous non-sovereign monarchies within the country, many of them\nderivative of pre-colonial kingdoms (such as Arda). Non-sovereign monarchs do\nnot have an official, constitutional role, and are largely ceremonial and\nsubservient to political and civil authorities. Despite this, they play an\ninfluential role in local political matters within their particular realms and\nare often courted by Beninese politicians for electoral support. Advocacy\ngroups, such as the High Council of Kings of Benin, represent the monarchs\nnationally.^[108]^[109]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Africa portal\n\n  * Index of Benin-related articles\n  * Outline of Benin\n  * Telephone numbers in Benin\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Benin\".
