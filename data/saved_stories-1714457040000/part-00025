This post will give you an overview of what it\nwas like and how to be successful if you also feel inclined to attempt it.\n\n## Why Illimani?\n\nI got this question a lot. The question itself is the answer. Not a lot of\npeople climb it and for me solitude makes an outdoor adventure more special.\nMost people seem to choose to do Huayna Potos\u00ed instead, which is also over\n6,000m but not quite 20,000 ft. So Illimani is higher and offers more solitude\nbut both are good options!\n\n## Preparation\n\nThe two things you need to do to prepare yourself physically before attempting\na high altitude climb are, in declining order of importance, (1) get\nacclimated to high altitude and (2) get into hiking shape.\n\nIt does not matter how in shape or how good of an athlete you are, if you are\nnot acclimated to high altitude you will fail. This means wasting a lot of\ntime and money and possibly also ruining your climbing partners' trips if you\nare sharing a guide and you all have to turn around because you can't\ncontinue. Furthermore, at Illimani levels of altitude you are putting your\nbody under enormous stress and death is a real possibility.\n\nI had a decent baseline as I was living in Denver at the time and doing a lot\nof mountain biking and hiking between 6,000 and 14,000 ft. I started this trip\nby flying to Mexico City (7,300 ft) and spending a few days there before going\non to Peru and doing the epic 8-day Huayhuash circuit which involves 10-16\nmiles per day of very arduous hiking between 12,000 and 16,000 ft. I then\nrecovered for a few days at Lake Titicaca (12,500 ft) before heading to La Paz\nand meeting up with my friends and climbing partners, Victor and John, who had\njust flown in from Denver. Together we then did 17,690 ft Charquini, which\nitself is a beautiful and highly recommendable climb.\n\nAproaching the summit of Charquini. The Bolivian sun is extremely intense and\nI will blame my first wrinkle on the massive sunburn I got on my forehead that\nday. Wear sunscreen!\n\nSo in total, before starting the Illimani climb, I had spent more than 2 weeks\nabove 7,000 ft, and at least half of that above 12,000 ft, with several forays\nto between 16,000 and 17,690 ft. This was decent but I felt like I was 90% to\nwhere I should have been before attempting a 21,000+ ft peak. I should have\nadded Huayna Potos\u00ed which is next to Charquini and just a hair under 20,000\nft, but alas we ran out of time.\n\nAlso, get into hiking-specific shape. Being in shape for other cardio-\nintensive sports will help but it's not the same.\n\nDoing the necessary physical preparation will not only ensure that you survive\nand don't waste your time. The more prepared you are the more you will enjoy\nthe experience.\n\n## Gear\n\nYou will be making your summit push before sunrise and temperatures get\nextremely low. I don't know how cold it was exactly, but based on what I was\nwearing and how cold I felt, I would say -15 F. It got much, much warmer on\nthe descent, once the equatorial sun had risen. I had to shed many layers.\n\nAssuming you are flying to La Paz, your capacity for bringing gear will be\nlimited. Almost everything you need is available for hire or purchase in La\nPaz and usually included if you hire a guide. However, I would bring the\nfollowing things since they are small and expensive / impossible to rent in La\nPaz:\n\n  * Glacier sunglasses (for while you're on the snow)\n  * Polarized sunglasses (for all other times)\n  * Light down jacket. Your guide will provide a thicker down jacket and a shell to go on top of this.\n  * Mountaineering socks\n  * Base layer\n  * Maybe: Your own worn-in mountaineering boots (these are expensive and your guide can provide them, but it's a much nicer experience to use your own, worn-in shoes. Blisters will ruin the experience. If you know you are not prone to blisters, using the guide's boots is fine).\n  * Lip balm with SPF\n  * High SPF broad spectrum sunscreen. Very high altitude + near the equator = pretty much the most intense sun you can experience.\n  * Sweatpants\n  * Neck Gaiter\n  * Windproof beanie\n  * Hiking backpack\n\nMake sure your guide provides the following:\n\n  * High-density down jacket\n  * Outer shell jacket\n  * Windproof mountaineering pants\n  * Crampons\n  * Gaiters\n  * Ropes, carabiners, harness, etc\n  * Helmet\n  * Ice axe\n  * First aid kit\n  * Mittens with liners\n  * Mountaineering tent\n  * Sleeping bag with very low temperature rating\n  * Food\n  * Honestly there is a lot more, which is why it's important to hire a good guide, or to know what you are doing.\n\nMe in full gear\n\n## Guide\n\nWe used Juancho and Julio from Altitud6000. A recent Google search did not\nturn up much for them, but if you are able to track them down, I can recommend\nthem. They were certified mountain guides and seemed to have plenty of\nexperience. They do, however, only speak Spanish. The service included\ntransportation to and from basecamp (about 5 hours each way), all meals cooked\nby a chef, porters to take everything up to high camp, and all the\nmountaineering and camping gear.\n\nWe paid them about $500 per person which seemed quite a bit cheaper than other\ncompanies. Western companies in particular are an order of magnitude more\nexpensive than this, and I don't see how they could be significantly better.\n\n## The Climb\n\n### Day One: Base camp\n\nThe guides picked us up from our hotel and after escaping the insane La Paz\ntraffic, we wound our way through the dry hills east of the city. Illimani\nmade the occasional appearance, each time larger than before. About an hour\nfrom our destination we stopped in a small town to pay an entrance fee and to\nbuy a mandatory poop container (which thankfully I did not have to use). The\nlocal authorities seem to be doing a good job of preserving their mountains.\nBoth Charquini and Illimani were in great shape with no signs of human waste\nand very little trash.\n\nAfter arriving at basecamp, we set up our tents, did a quick safety course,\nand a short sunset hike to the top of a nearby plateau.\n\nWhile this was happening, the chef (Juancho's girlfriend) was preparing\ndinner. The temperature began plummeting with the sun now completely gone. We\nall gathered in the dining tent and Juancho told us stories from his many\nyears of guiding, including how he had once traversed all four peaks of\nIllimani (see the first photo in this post). We then called it an early night.\n\n### Day Two: High camp\n\nWe began at a reasonable hour. The porters had arrived from the town where we\nhad bought the poop containers. They included a 70-year-old man, two 16-year-\nold girls who would not stop giggling the entire trip, and two younger men who\ndid most of the work. And in contrast to our expensive high-end gear, they\nwore tennis shoes or rubber boots. Instead of backpacks they used blankets\nfastened with a knot.\n\nOur porters\n\nIt was sunny and warm as we ascended a fairly easy, switch-backed trail which\nturned into loose sand and then into a pretty challenging, very long rock\nscramble.\n\nThe early stages of day one. Basically the entire route can be seen above my\nhead. Our high camp was at the top of the rock pyramid and the false summit\nwhich is just before the real summit is at the top of the snow.\n\nFinally, at around 18,000 ft, we reached our high camp, Nido de Condores\n(Condors' Nest). I would estimate we had climbed about 3,500 ft in roughly 5\nhours.\n\nThe spot was beautiful but rather inhospitable on a very exposed ledge at the\nfoot of the glacier, with nonstop freezing wind. We spent the first hour\ngathering rocks to tie down the tents and to build a wind barrier for the\nstove.\n\nThen there was nothing to do except eat, drink as much tea as possible, and\ntry to fall asleep, which proved quite difficult as the cold became extreme as\nnight fell.\n\n### Day Three: Summit day\n\nOur route on day three. Only the false summit can be seen.\n\nAfter managing a couple hours of sleep, I was awoken around midnight and told\nto get moving. It was so cold outside of my sleeping bag that although I am\nwriting this almost two years later, I can still feel the dread at the\nprospect of leaving that sleeping bag to fumble around for the rest of my\nclothes.\n\nFortunately the wind had stopped and after suiting up, we put on our crampons\nand began climbing the glacier into a clear but very cold night.\n\nJulio and I were roped up and Victor and John were with Juancho. We got a head\nstart, but because I had been the slowest climber on Charquini, I expected the\nother group to catch up to us in no time. Instead, to my surprise, the lights\nfrom their headlamps seem to fall further and further behind. It was obvious\nsomething was wrong and sure enough there eventually came a yell for us to\nstop and wait for them.\n\nStanding on steep ice, shivering because I was no longer producing body heat\nwas super fun. Finally they reached us. John had hit the wall and decided he\ncould no longer continue. Impressively, he had summoned the strength to climb\nthe last very long and steep pitch up to where I was, otherwise he would have\nforced Victor to turn around with him. Julio and I added Victor to our rope\nand continued our ascent as John and Juancho descended back to high camp.\n\nAfter a short while, we reached a small plateau which gave us some much needed\nrest. The sun then began to rise and revealed just how much we had left. I had\nfelt surprisingly strong up to this point but seeing what I thought was the\nsummit still so far above us was the crack in my mental fortitude that allowed\nthe fatigue to begin setting in. Julio then informed us that it was a false\nsummit we were seeing. My spirit was crushed. My pace began slowing\ndramatically and my requests for descansos became more and more frequent.\nEvery step became difficult. I started to develop a dry cough.\n\nMy face upon realizing how much we still had to climb just to get to the false\nsummit behind me.\n\nI felt the rope behind me tighten. Victor was completely exhausted too and\ntaking unannounced breaks. He had a far off look on his face and was muttering\nthings in Spanish.\n\nThe final push. The lights of La Paz behind us.\n\nJulio was starting to get concerned and told us to keep moving and that it\nwasn't too far to go. The true summit was in sight now. We put our heads down\nand climbed the last short pitch onto a ridge, and then a 50 yard flat\ntraverse, a victory amble, to the summit.\n\nLogramos! yelled Julio. We had done it. Victor immediately collapsed and\nactually began snoring. After his nap, we took photos and refueled with snacks\nwhile enjoying the view. Though it is not a volcano, Illimani seems like it\nwith its massive prominence commanding an airplane-like view over the\nsurrounding area.\n\nWe then began our descent. The temperature skyrocketed as the sun got higher\nand I had to take most of my layers off. The snow became slushy and we were\nable to do a lot of glissading which was fun and got us down in no time.\n\nWe approached our high camp waving our ice axes in celebration. The porters,\nwho had climbed up from basecamp again that morning, and now included two\n12-year-old boys, took photos of the crazy gringos. I collapsed in my tent and\ntook a nap.\n\nWe then climbed all the way down to basecamp and drove back to La Paz. I don't\nremember much of that drive!\n\nSleeping on the drive back to La Paz. I take sun protection very seriously.\n\nWe celebrated with some local fine dining, which gave me food poisoning, and I\nspent the next two days holed up in a La Paz hotel room, recovering from both\nthe climb and also puking my guts out.\n\nLa Paz has some creative restaurants, but watch out for food poisoning.\n\nIf anyone is need of an extreme weight loss program, I can highly recommend\nthe Bolivian mountaineering and food poisoning regimen. I looked like a POW\nafterwards.\n\nAnthony (Ant) Braun is a software engineer at Mindbody and an adventurer based\nin Washington, DC. Email him.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
