GURI is a core component of CaReSS,\n> which is responsible for validating incoming data with medical rules. Such\n> medical rules are manually implemented by medical experts based on medical\n> standards, regulations, and research. Since large language models (LLMs)\n> have been trained on a large amount of public information, including these\n> documents, they can be employed to generate tests for GURI. Thus, we propose\n> an LLM-based test generation and differential testing approach (LLMeDiff) to\n> test GURI. We experimented with four different LLMs, two medical rule engine\n> implementations, and 58 real medical rules to investigate the hallucination,\n> success, time efficiency, and robustness of the LLMs to generate tests, and\n> these tests' ability to find potential issues in GURI. Our results showed\n> that GPT-3.5 hallucinates the least, is the most successful, and is\n> generally the most robust; however, it has the worst time efficiency. Our\n> differential testing revealed 22 medical rules where implementation\n> inconsistencies were discovered (e.g., regarding handling rule versions).\n> Finally, we provide insights for practitioners and researchers based on the\n> results.\n\nComments:| 12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03664 [cs.SE]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03664v2 [cs.SE] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03664arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Erblin Isaku [view email] [v1] Fri, 16 Feb 2024 10:56:15 UTC (8,250 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 9 Apr 2024 08:08:52 UTC (8,250 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled LLMs in the Heart of Differential Testing: A\nCase Study on a Medical Rule Engine, by Erblin Isaku and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SE\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
