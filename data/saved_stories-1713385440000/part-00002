And also really\ngearing up towards what we think is going to be a strong year of 2025. That is\nreally backed up by some of the industry trends as we see them today. That\nmeans for us building a capacity and preparing for that ramp,\" he said.\n\n  * Where there's a will, there's Huawei to develop one's own chipmaking kit\n  * Samsung and SK halt sales of used chipmaking gear to brokers\n  * US wants ASML to stop servicing China-owned chip equipment\n  * Dutch government in panic mode over keeping ASML in the country\n  * Europe benched in high tech 'Champions League' says ASML\n\n### Who's the mystery customer?\n\nDassen says ASML is expecting to see higher volumes of its High NA (numerical\naperture) EUV equipment, which provides better resolution for smaller features\nwith the most advanced production processes. Intel was the first customer to\nreceive a TWINSCAN EXE:5200 system at its facility in Hillsboro, Oregon,\nearlier this year.\n\n\"The industry is really excited around High NA and for very good reasons,\"\nDassen claimed. \"If you look at the specifications of the High NA tool, it\nwill provide a transistor density that actually is 3x of the transistor\ndensity that you will have with a low NA tool. So it's a really big step up,\"\nhe said.\n\nFor the second quarter, ASML is forecasting net sales to be higher, between\n\u20ac5.7 billion ($6.06 billion) and \u20ac6.2 billion ($6.59 billion). Outgoing\nPresident and CEO Peter Wennink - who leaves this month - said the outlook for\nthe full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half expected to be stronger\nthan the first, in line with the industry's continued recovery from the\ndownturn.\n\nNot mentioned at all is the possibility of further export restrictions, which\nare likely as the US tries to curb China\u2019s semiconductor advances and leans on\nits allies to fall in line.\n\nHowever, with all the new chip plants being built outside China, ASML seems\noptimistic, and still expects to reach annual revenue in 2025 of between \u20ac30\nbillion ($31.9 billion) and \u20ac40 billion ($42.3 billion).\n\n\"I think we will find ourselves in 2025 in the midst of the upturn,\" said\nDassen. \"If you just look at all the fab openings that have been indicated by\nour customers. The recent news on positive outcomes of CHIPS Act money\nallocation. All of that is very strong, very supportive for new fab openings\nacross the globe.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * ASML\n  * China\n  * Semiconductor\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * ASML\n  * China\n  * Semiconductor\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * Hot Chips\n  * Integrated Circuit\n  * JD.com\n  * Loongson\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Shenzhen\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * ASML\n  * China\n  * Semiconductor\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * ASML\n  * China\n  * Semiconductor\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * Hot Chips\n  * Integrated Circuit\n  * JD.com\n  * Loongson\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Shenzhen\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Where there's a will, there's Huawei to develop one's own chipmaking kit\n\nExport restrictions and sanctions working well, we see\n\nSystems6 days | 26\n\n#### Pressuring allies not to fulfill chip kit service contracts with China\nnow official US policy\n\nXi Jinping warns 'no force' can stop country's science and tech progress\n\nSystems20 days | 14\n\n#### Six banks share customer info to help Singapore fight money laundering\n\nAsia in brief Plus: Google Cloud ANZ boss departs; Japan revives airliner\nambitions; China-linked attackers target Asian entities\n\nCyber-crime16 days | 4\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Intel preps export-friendly lower-power Gaudi 3 AI chips for China\n\nBeijing will be thrilled by this nerfed silicon\n\nAI + ML5 days | 5\n\n#### US senator wants to put the brakes on Chinese EVs\n\nFears of low-cost invasion and data spies spark call for ban\n\nSecurity2 days | 37\n\n#### China orders its telcos to rip and replace US chips with homegrown\nsilicon by 2027\n\nThere's no Huawei we saw that coming\n\nNetworks4 days | 76\n\n#### China scientists talk of powering hypersonic weapon with cheap Nvidia\nchip\n\nAnalysis Jetson module can efficiently process computational fluid dynamics\nmodels\n\nSystems20 hrs | 5\n\n#### Microsoft warns that China is using AI to stir the pot ahead of US\nelection\n\nBeware random inflammatory questions on social media \u2013 they may come from a\nthreat actor\n\nAI + ML12 days | 89\n\n#### Microsoft brings World of Warcraft and other Blizzard titles back to\nChina\n\nBattle with NetEase ends, peace deal will see games cross the Great Firewall -\nin both directions\n\nSoftware7 days | 6\n\n#### Chinese schools testing 10,000 locally made RISC-V-ish PCs\n\nToday's lesson covers the potential for Loongson's made-in-China architecture\nto hurt Microsoft and Intel\n\nPublic Sector12 days | 30\n\n#### TSMC sees semiconductor bounce as Q1 revenues rise 16.5%\n\nEarly figures post a $18.44B haul for industry bellwether\n\nPersonal Tech7 days | 1\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
