You take action to make a material\ndifference. You take every action you can, not as few actions as you can get\naway with.\n\nFor those paying attention, it\u2019s been doubtless and crystalline for a long\ntime that there is a causal link between the demands placed on military\nmembers and the incidence of suicide.\n\nUnits, career fields, and specialties ground into dust with constant\ndeployments, curtailed rest intervals, and relentless operational demands have\nhigher levels of suicide.\n\nWhich makes logical sense, and when acknowledged, makes the issue of suicide\nassailable. If we understand something, we can fix it.\n\nAnd yet the epidemic of military and veteran suicide persists.\n\nNot because it must do so.\n\nBut because those with the power to ameliorate it, the US military services,\ndon\u2019t care to fix it. We know this not from DoD\u2019s words or statements or\npolicies. But from its evident actions.\n\nShare\n\nTwo stories published over the last few days will likely have caught little\nnotice among major media outlets or their consumers.\n\nBut these two reports are damned important.\n\nThey illustrate DoD\u2019s frigid disregard for its own workforce, regardless of\nconstant lip-syncing, virtue signaling, and advertising to the contrary.\n\nSome participants in this chicanery are unwitting. But its masterminds are\nnihilistic shitlords unworthy of setting pins in a bowling alley, much less\nsetting policy for the volunteers who provide our defense.\n\nSuch lowly creatures perceive no duty of care. They perceive only a duty of\nobedience.\n\nLet\u2019s review the two stories I am talking about.\n\nFirst, the military services refuse to report whether units are complying with\na policy requiring minimum dwell times between deployments.\n\nThis matters because people serving in units which don\u2019t meet the tempo policy\nare twice as likely to kill themselves as others.\n\nWe only know because of investigative reporting conducted absent the\ncooperation of the disgusting, bloody-handed flesh merchants responsible to\nactually monitor and act on this policy.\n\nSecond, the services are refusing to provide data on suicide rates by job\ncode.\n\nThis matters because we know certain career fields have been under more\nchronic strain than others, and that this has crushed morale in such units.\n\nBy forcing the military services to acknowledge suicide does not settle evenly\non career fields, we can take a first step toward getting the services to\naddress manpower shortfalls to restore a sustainable tempo to these\nspecialties.\n\nBut of course, the services have employed bureaucratic stalling and\nsmokescreens to evade this acknowledgement. Because to do so would be to admit\nthey need more people.\n\nWhich would risk them being forced to pay for people when they\u2019d rather\nlubricate the pockets of defense contractors using your money and mine.\n\nAnd would risk them being held accountable for cutting manpower too short,\nlike when the US Air Force slashed 19,000 Airmen in a single year despite\nCongress giving them five years to do so ... only to report being 80,000 short\na few years later.\n\nBureaucracies bury what\u2019s dear to them under mountains of petrified shit to\nprotect against accountability, truth, or any erosion of control. Their\nactions give lies a head start on truth.\n\nFrom the time an issue is identified, it takes years or decades of drilling to\nget through all that shit and into the deeply buried chamber of truth, which\nis the only place an issue can be genuinely approached.\n\nLots of great people have drilled for years to pierce the chamber of truth of\nmilitary suicide. They\u2019ve beaten the bureaucrats at their own game, getting\nrequirements for operational tempo reporting and suicide by job code written\ninto law.\n\nNow is the time for the services to comply with that law, stop evading, and\nallow the truth of this issue to be exposed. This is the only way it can be\naddressed, which is how we can stop pushing people who volunteered to serve on\nour behalf so far beyond their limits that they can\u2019t cope.\n\nIn a recent interaction with retired USAF MSgt. Chris McGhee, I learned two\nthings.\n\n  1. Chris in an unheralded badass who has done as much as anyone to force the DoD to stop fucking around and deal in truth when it comes to suicide. The requirement for suicide numbers by job code is a result of his persistence and activism.\n\n  2. He reminded me of a scandalous example of suicide response by an Apple subcontractor which cultivated such miserable working conditions in its China factory that people starting throwing themselves off the building. The company\u2019s response was not to improve conditions ... but to install angled nets from its building to catch people and roll them back inside.\n\nThis is the metaphorical equivalent of what the military services have thus\nfar done to address suicide. Reactive, disingenuous, and pathetic.\n\nWe can and must expect better.\n\nAnd if bureaucrats refuse to follow the law, Congress should call hearings\nevery month until they do. Drag the service chiefs and their lackeys to public\naccount.\n\nAnd in those hearings, tie knots in the purse strings until every weapon,\nevery cash cow, every cherished teet of taxpayer largesse is conditioned upon\nthe basic, human, fundamental responsibility of actually caring about people\nkilling themselves because of how serving their country made them feel.\n\nNo more F-35s until you show you\u2019re serious, or at least law-abiding, on this\nissue.\n\nI am ashamed of my country when I see this level of cynical skullduggery on an\nissue as basic as taking care of the people who do our fighting for us.\n\nEver thus since we stopped holding our government accountable and accepted\nthat such betrayals are just part of the price of all that wonderful freedom\nafforded by our inept, cash-addled, louse-infested administrative state.\n\nWritten with unapologetic and seething anger ... alongside a malignant lump of\nregret for the preventable loss of fighting Americans who are overwhelmed by\nthe unreasonable demands of service and unable to see through the darkness to\nthe other side.\n\nWe owe them and their families so much more.\n\nThe Radar exists because you support it.
