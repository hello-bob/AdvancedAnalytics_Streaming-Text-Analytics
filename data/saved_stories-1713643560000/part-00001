Drake is dropping new music on something\ncalled Krakenfiles.com. Chris Black wonders if the post-streaming era will\nlook like Web 1.0.\n\nBy Chris Black\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nThis is an edition of the newsletter Pulling Weeds With Chris Black, in which\nthe columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture. Sign up here to get it in\nyour inbox every Thursday.\n\nLast week, a few of my trusted music sources on Twitter started whispering\nabout a new album that was a must-listen but only available to stream on\nYouTube. You could also send a suggested donation (as a gift on PayPal) to\nreceive CD-quality .wav files directly in your inbox. The Geocities website\nwas ugly and quirky, decidedly lo-fi in a Web 1.0 way. The same week the album\nin question, Diamond Jubilee, by Cindy Lee, a 32-song left-of-center fever\ndream marathon that sounds like Velvet Underground, T. Rex, and VU, and the\ngood Phil Spector projects combined with excellent production, synths, and\nfeedback, received a score of 9.1 on Pitchfork, the first 9.0+ since 2020. A\nrock-and-roll album garnering this much attention without a record label or\nthe support of digital-streaming platforms is unheard of. A small sect of\npeople, presumably real music fans, were willing to pay real money to enjoy\nthe music they love.\n\nI like Diamond Jubilee and am happy to pay for music, but downloading files\nand loading them onto my iPhone feels archaic and time-consuming. Drake also\n\u201cleaked\u201d a diss song last week, firing at everyone: Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross,\nThe Weeknd, and J. Cole. The song was making its rounds in my group chats.\nWhen I finished lunch and went to listen, I realized the link my friend had\nprovided was from Krakenfiles.com, a URL too good to make up. This response\nfrom Drake was hotly anticipated, and I am sure he has his reasons, but\navoiding DSPs when they are your bread and butter is also an exciting choice.\nVisiting weird websites to listen to and download music feels crazy in 2024, a\nthrowback to sitting in my parents\u2019 basement on the Dell, manically\ndownloading songs on Kazaa and Napster. I even saw a friend burn Diamond\nJubilee onto CDR.\n\nI Took Bass Lessons From a Punk Legend For a Year. I Learned About More Than\nJust the Bass\n\nBy Alex Scordelis\n\nHow Asake Became the Center of the World\u2019s Most Influential Music Scene\n\nBy Frazier Tharpe\n\nMarcus King Talks About Writing With Rick Rubin and \u201cStripping It Down to the\nCopper\u201d\n\nBy Will Schube\n\nWhile all this was happening, Coachella weekend was taking place in Indio,\nCalifornia. Several stories have been written about slowing ticket sales and\nbrands not heading to the desert this year. We reached the peak music festival\nlong ago, and now there is something for everyone, no matter which niche\ntickles your fancy. But when things of this magnitude flail, it feels like a\nshift is coming.\n\nCindy Lee is the alter ego of former Women frontman Patrick Flegel, who\nexpressed dim views of the streaming era in a 2023 interview. \u201cI think\neveryone should take their music off streaming platforms. Not even strike,\njust take it off,\u201d Flegel said. \u201cThey\u2019re begging for a penny a play, and it\u2019s\npitiful.\u201d In that same interview, Flegel acknowledged that the hardest part of\nputting out a project without the backing of streaming platforms or a\ntraditional record label is \u201cgetting anybody to give a shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where I\u2019m at now, in my mind,\u201d Flegel said, \u201cyou just need some regulars.\nSome people who\u2019ve got your back, are into what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAre there enough regulars out there to make it viable for other artists to\npull a Cindy Lee? Do people want to own music, support artists they love, and\ngo to shows that don\u2019t come flanked by hard-seltzer-sponsored off-site parties\nand influencer photo shoots? Are we heading back to a simpler time? Are we\ncurious again? Are we finally ready to discover music outside of TikTok?\n\nI doubt it, but this is one of the first times I have really seen cracks in\nthe fa\u00e7ade. The days when I could go to my local Virgin Megastore on a\nThursday at midnight to pick up the new releases on CD aren\u2019t coming back, but\nmaybe things will calm down and course correct a little bit. Streaming isn\u2019t\nthe best option. It is just the most convenient. If someone makes an effort to\npresent their work differently, I think it should be discussed, whether it\u2019s\nCindy Lee or the biggest rapper in the world.\n\nRelated Stories for GQPulling Weeds With Chris BlackMusic\n\nRead More\n\n  * Style\n\nJustin Bieber Wore Two Humongous Pairs of Balenciaga Sweatpants at the Same\nTime\n\nBy Eileen Cartter\n\n  * Style\n\nForty Years Later, the Air Jordan 1 High \u201985 \u2018Bred\u2019 Is Back\n\nBy Adam Cheung\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe Kendrick Lamar/Drake Beef, Explained\n\nBy Frazier Tharpe\n\n  * Culture\n\nHow Davis Clarke Became the Most Locked-In Man on the Internet\n\nBy Kate Lindsay\n\n## GQ COUPONS\n\nWayfair Coupon\n\n20% off $250 spend w/ Wayfair coupon code\n\nMichaels Coupon\n\nMilitary Members save 15% Off - Michaels coupon\n\nASOS Promo Code\n\nEnjoy 30% Off w/ ASOS Promo Code\n\nEbay Coupon\n\neBay coupon for +$5 Off sitewide\n\nPeacock TV Promo Codes\n\nEnjoy Peacock Premium for Only $1.99/Month Instead of $5.99\n\nSamsung Discount Code\n\n$100 discount on your next Samsung purchase* in 2024\n\nSince 1957, GQ has inspired men to look sharper and live smarter with its\nunparalleled coverage of style, culture, and beyond.
