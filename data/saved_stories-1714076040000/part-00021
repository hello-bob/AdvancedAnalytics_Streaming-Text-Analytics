Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim 2 are Germany's last three operating nuclear power plants and are scheduled to cease operation | Johannes Simon/Getty Images\n\nApril 14, 2023 11:00 am CET\n\nBy Zia Weise and Charlie Cooper\n\nThe shutdown of Germany\u2019s last nuclear power stations may be imminent, but its\ncritics aren\u2019t about to shut up.\n\nOn Saturday, the final three plants will be taken offline, marking the end of\natomic energy in the country and a major victory for anti-nuclear activists,\nwho have spent decades fighting for this moment.\n\nBut with the clock running down, criticism of the phaseout has only grown\nlouder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor opponents, the switch-off is nothing short of lunacy \u2014 running counter to\nEurope\u2019s efforts to swap fossil fuels for cleaner alternatives and diversify\nits energy supply.\n\nThe nuclear exit \u201cis a black day for climate protection in Germany,\u201d Jens\nSpahn, deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrat (CDU) opposition,\nsaid this week.\n\nThe issue also splits the governing coalition in Berlin, with the liberal Free\nDemocrats (FDP) calling for the nuclear plants to be kept on standby at the\nvery least.\n\n\u201cShutting down the world's most modern and safest nuclear power plants in\nGermany is a dramatic mistake that will have painful economic and ecological\nconsequences,\u201d said FDP deputy leader Wolfgang Kubicki.\n\nBut Climate Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens insisted in a statement\nThursday that switching off the remaining plants \u2014 which generated between 4\nand 6 percent of the country\u2019s power over the past year \u2014 won\u2019t affect energy\nsecurity.\n\nLast year, Habeck and his party were forced to accept a temporary delay to the\nphaseout, originally scheduled for the end of 2022, as Germany scrambled to\nsecure alternatives to Russian gas ahead of winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHabeck stressed that the decision to end nuclear power isn't only a Green one:\n\u201cWe are implementing a decision made by the [CDU] and the FDP in 2011,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThat year, following the meltdown of reactors at Japan\u2019s Fukushima plant,\nthen-Chancellor Angela Merkel enshrined the 2022 deadline in law.\n\nBut the first steps toward a phaseout were taken under a Social Democrat-Green\ngovernment in the early 2000s, following decades of campaigning by anti-\nnuclear activists who had tapped into a general skepticism toward atomic power\namong Germans.\n\nThe remaining three plants will be dismantled over the coming decades, Robert Habeck said | Emmanuele Contini/Getty Images\n\nFor the Greens, a party that grew out of the anti-nuclear movement, the\nshutdown will mark the fulfillment of their foundational promise.\n\n\u201cA long struggle will end on Saturday,\u201d said former Green Environment Minister\nJ\u00fcrgen Trittin, who negotiated the initial phaseout decision.\n\n### Changing views\n\nAttitudes in Germany, however, have shifted over the past two decades \u2014 and\neven many opponents of nuclear power are questioning the timing of the\nphaseout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA YouGov study published this week found only a quarter of Germans want the\nremaining plants to be switched off this weekend. About a third would back a\ntemporary extension, and another third prefer the shutdown be delayed\nindefinitely.\n\nEven Green voters have their doubts. Just over half \u2014 56 percent \u2014 of the\nparty\u2019s supporters want an immediate shutdown of the last reactors, according\nto the survey.\n\nBut the party leadership remains determined to put an end to nuclear energy in\nGermany, even as it has faced growing criticism for preferring to rely on\npolluting coal power plants in the event of a supply crunch.\n\nWhile the country has massively stepped up its deployment of renewables, it\nstill generates a third of its electricity from coal.\n\n\"This Green climate minister prefers to let coal-fired power plants run ...\nrather than climate-neutral nuclear power plants,\u201d the CDU\u2019s Spahn said,\naccusing the government of turning into a \u201ccoal coalition.\u201d\n\nThe Greens, in turn, say the slow pace of renewables expansion under previous\nCDU-led governments is to blame for Germany\u2019s continued coal dependence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Habeck, the nuclear phaseout plan is irreversible. The remaining three\nplants will be dismantled over the coming decades, he said, while ruling out\nthe construction of new reactors: \u201cThe construction of new nuclear plants has\nalways turned into an economic fiasco \u2014 whether in France, Great Britain or\nFinland.\u201d\n\nBut while Germany shuts its reactors down, many of its European neighbors are\ngoing in the opposite direction.\n\nFinland\u2019s new Olkiluoto 3 plant has completed testing and is ready to go\nonline next week.\n\nFrance \u2014 always at odds with Germany in its enthusiasm for nuclear energy \u2014 is\nembarking on a \u201crenaissance\u201d of its sector, with plans to build six new\nreactors with an option for another eight in the future. Paris has also\ngathered an alliance of 11 pro-nuclear countries within the EU and is pushing\nfor nuclear energy to benefit from the same incentives as renewables in the\nbloc\u2019s new green industry support plan.\n\nThe energy crisis sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had made many\ncountries think again about relying on gas as the \u201cbaseload\u201d back-up fuel to\nintermittent renewables, said a senior European Commission official. Instead,\nmany countries increasingly see nuclear in that role.\n\n\u201cThe wind is blowing in the French direction,\u201d the official said, speaking on\ncondition of anonymity to discuss a divisive topic within the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Tags\n\nCoal Electricity Energy Energy supply Environment EU-Russia relations Fossil\nfuels German politics Natural gas Nuclear power War in Ukraine\n\nRelated Countries\n\nFrance Germany Japan Russia\n\nRelated People\n\nAngela Merkel Jens Spahn Robert Habeck Wolfgang Kubicki\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nCDU European Commission The Greens\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## \u2018Blatantly illegal\u2019: Zelenskyy admin under fire for denying services to\nUkrainian men abroad\n\n2 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\n## Russia would lose a war with NATO, Poland warns\n\n4 HRS ago 3 mins read\n\nCommentary\n\n## India looks beyond Russia for defense imports\n\n11 HRS ago 6 mins read\n\n## Biden admin isn\u2019t fully convinced Ukraine can win, even with new aid\n\n18 HRS ago 6 mins read\n\n## More from Zia Weise\n\n## Bullets not bees: EU ditches green focus ahead of June election\n\nA draft priority list for the next five years goes heavy on defense, barely\nmentioning climate change.\n\nApr 11 5 mins read\n\n## EU\u2019s power sector emissions plummet as renewables surge\n\nBrussels called the 15.5 percent reduction in 2023 a \u201crecord.\u201d\n\nApr 4 2 mins read\n\n## Missing: A Socialist Green Deal vision\n\nAt a time when many want more government aid to help them survive a changing\nworld, the Socialists can\u2019t gain ground.\n\nApr 2 9 mins read\n\n## \u2018Bad\u2019 EU nature law needs to \u2018go back to the drawing board,\u2019 Belgian PM\nsays\n\nBelgium, which holds the Council presidency, is meant to act as an honest\nbroker in talks.\n\nMar 31 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
