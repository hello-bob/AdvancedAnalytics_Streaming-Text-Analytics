But it\nenvisions a very different use case: cognitive enhancement.\n\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\n\nIllustration: Boris SV/Getty Images\n\nAt a tech forum in Beijing last week, a Chinese company unveiled a \u201chomegrown\u201d\nbrain-computer interface that allowed a monkey to seemingly control a robotic\narm just by thinking about it.\n\nIn a video shown at the event, a monkey with its hands restrained uses the\ninterface to move a robotic arm and grasp a strawberry. The system, developed\nby NeuCyber NeuroTech and the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, involves\nsoft electrode filaments implanted in the brain, according to state-run news\nmedia outlet Xinhua.\n\nResearchers in the US have tested similar systems in paralyzed people to allow\nthem to control robotic arms, but the demonstration underscores China\u2019s\nprogress in developing its own brain-computer interface technology and vying\nwith the West.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nBrain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, collect and analyze brain signals, often\nto allow direct control of an external device, such as a robotic arm,\nkeyboard, or smartphone. In the US, a cadre of startups, including Elon Musk\u2019s\nNeuralink, are aiming to commercialize the technology.\n\nWilliam Hannas, lead analyst at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security\nand Emerging Technology (CSET), says China is quickly catching up with the US\nin terms of its BCI technology. \u201cThey\u2019re strongly motivated,\u201d he says of the\nAsian superpower. \u201cThey're doing state-of-the-art work, or at least as\nadvanced as anybody else in the world.\u201d\n\nHe says China has typically lagged behind the US in invasive BCIs\u2014that is,\nthose that are implanted in the brain or on its surface\u2014choosing instead to\nfocus on noninvasive technology that\u2019s worn on the head. But it\u2019s quickly\ncatching up on implantable interfaces, which are being explored for medical\napplications.\n\nMore concerning, though, is China\u2019s interest in noninvasive BCIs for the\ngeneral population. Hannas coauthored a report released in March that examines\nChinese research on BCIs for nonmedical purposes.\n\n\u201cChina is not the least bit shy about this,\u201d he says, referring to ethical\nguidelines released by the Communist Party in February 2024 that include\ncognitive enhancement of healthy people as a goal of Chinese BCI research. A\ntranslation of the guidelines by CSET says, \u201cNonmedical purposes such as\nattention modulation, sleep regulation, memory regulation, and exoskeletons\nfor augmentative BCI technologies should be explored and developed to a\ncertain extent, provided there is strict regulation and clear benefit.\u201d\n\nThe translated Chinese guidelines go on to say that BCI technology should\navoid replacing or weakening human decisionmaking capabilities \u201cbefore it is\nproven to surpass human levels and gains societal consensus, and avoid\nresearch that significantly interferes with or blurs human autonomy and self-\nawareness.\u201d\n\nThese nonmedical applications refer to wearable BCIs that rely on electrodes\nplaced on the scalp, also known as electroencephalography or EEG devices.\nElectrical signals from the scalp are much harder to interpret than those\ninside the brain, however, and there\u2019s a huge effort in China to use machine\nlearning techniques to improve analysis of brain signals, according to the\nCSET report.\n\nA handful of US companies are also developing wearable BCIs that arguably fall\nunder the category of cognitive enhancement. For instance, Emotiv of San\nFrancisco and Neurable in Boston are starting to sell EEG headsets intended to\nimprove attention and focus. The US Department of Defense has also funded\nresearch on wearable interfaces that could ultimately enable control of cyber-\ndefense systems or drones by military personnel.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

It has since funded substantial\nwork on BCIs for people with paralysis and blindness. China launched its own\nbrain project in 2016 with the goals of developing technologies both for\ndiagnosis and treatment of brain disorders and also for mimicking human\nintelligence and connecting humans and machines.\n\nIn a paper published last year, Kosal argued that China is more likely to\nwidely adopt BCI technologies in the commercial and military sectors due to\nits government structure, sociocultural norms, and because its neuroscience\nresearch goals are closely aligned with its military goals.\n\nShe says earlier adoption of BCIs could have implications for US national\nsecurity if these technologies are able to provide cognitive enhancement in\nwarfighters and merging of human and machine intelligence. \u201cIf that is\nsomething that a state can weaponize, that would change the nature of\nwarfare,\u201d she says.\n\nJustin Sanchez, a technical fellow at the nonprofit research organization\nBattelle, says it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that another country could pull\nahead in the BCI race. If that happens, the US could be at a disadvantage, he\nsays. \u201cIf we do not understand the medical uses and have those technologies\navailable here in the United States, then the control goes somewhere else, and\nthe same holds true on the national security side.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * He emptied a crypto exchange onto a thumb drive\u2014then disappeared\n\n  * The real-time deepfake romance scams have arrived\n\n  * Boomergasms are booming\n\n  * Heading outdoors?
