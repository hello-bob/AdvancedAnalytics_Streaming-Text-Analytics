I used to think it\nwas Opera, but they are now owned by a shady company and I don't trust them\nnow. They've also been forcing their \"AI\", \"Gaming Browser\" and \"VPN\" down my\nthroat. Opera GX doesn't even have Linux support. Opera used to be one of the\ntop browsers and was probably amazing for its time. (I never used it when it\nhad the Presto engine, except for on the 3DS.) I then briefly used Vivaldi,\nbut Vivaldi was slow on my laptop. For the past month or so, I've been using\nFirefox, but Firefox is basic, and I don't like being basic. I eventually\nfound the Floorp browser, and I like it so far. I only use it on my Linux\nlaptop and desktop, because there are currently no plans to make an Android\nversion. It works just fine with normal Firefox for Android.\n\n### First experience\n\nFrom the first launch, it looked similar to Microsoft Edge (which I briefly\nused on Linux, but we don't talk about that). I logged in with my Firefox\naccount, and the sync worked perfectly.\n\n### Deeper dive\n\nFloorp includes a sidebar, which contains Google Translate, the Ablaze Support\nwebsite, and the Floorp docs. It also contains a browser manager, bookmarks\nmenu, history, downloads, and notes tool. I also changed the browser to have\ntabs on the bottom bar.\n\n### Appearance\n\nMost of the time I just leave a browser on the default appearance, but Floorp\nhas themes that change the layout (probably userchrome.css), so I had to mess\naround with it. I use the Floorp Fluerial UI theme.\n\n### Score\n\nI give Floorp a 7/10 on an imaginary scale that I just made up.\n\nReply on Hacker News\n\n#browser #review\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
