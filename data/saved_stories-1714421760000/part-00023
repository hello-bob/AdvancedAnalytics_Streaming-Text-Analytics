Ismael, University of California - San Diego\n\nThe new paper, \"Pathfinder: High-Resolution Control-Flow Attacks Exploiting\nthe Conditional Branch Predictor,\" details two novel attacks that could\ncompromise the billions of Intel processors in use. Credit: Hosein Yavarzadeh\n\nResearchers have found two novel types of attacks that target the conditional\nbranch predictor found in high-end Intel processors, which could be exploited\nto compromise billions of processors currently in use.\n\nThe multi-university and industry research team led by computer scientists at\nUniversity of California San Diego will present their work at the 2024 ACM\nASPLOS Conference that begins tomorrow. The paper, \"Pathfinder: High-\nResolution Control-Flow Attacks Exploiting the Conditional Branch Predictor,\"\nis based on findings from scientists from UC San Diego, Purdue University,\nGeorgia Tech, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Google.\n\nThey discover a unique attack that is the first to target a feature in the\nbranch predictor called the Path History Register, which tracks both branch\norder and branch addresses. As a result, more information with more precision\nis exposed than with prior attacks that lacked insight into the exact\nstructure of the branch predictor.\n\nTheir research has resulted in Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\naddressing the concerns raised by the researchers and advising users about the\nsecurity issues. Today, Intel is set to issue a Security Announcement, while\nAMD will release a Security Bulletin.\n\nIn software, frequent branching occurs as programs navigate different paths\nbased on varying data values. The direction of these branches, whether \"taken\"\nor \"not taken,\" provides crucial insights into the executed program data.\nGiven the significant impact of branches on modern processor performance, a\ncrucial optimization known as the \"branch predictor\" is employed. This\npredictor anticipates future branch outcomes by referencing past histories\nstored within prediction tables. Previous attacks have exploited this\nmechanism by analyzing entries in these tables to discern recent branch\ntendencies at specific addresses.\n\nIn this new study, researchers leverage modern predictors' utilization of a\nPath History Register (PHR) to index prediction tables. The PHR records the\naddresses and precise order of the last 194 taken branches in recent Intel\narchitectures. With innovative techniques for capturing the PHR, the\nresearchers demonstrate the ability to not only capture the most recent\noutcomes but also every branch outcome in sequential order. Remarkably, they\nuncover the global ordering of all branches. Despite the PHR typically\nretaining the most recent 194 branches, the researchers present an advanced\ntechnique to recover a significantly longer history.\n\n\"We successfully captured sequences of tens of thousands of branches in\nprecise order, utilizing this method to leak secret images during processing\nby the widely used image library, libjpeg,\" said Hosein Yavarzadeh, a UC San\nDiego Computer Science and Engineering Department Ph.D. student and lead\nauthor of the paper.\n\nThe researchers also introduce an exceptionally precise Spectre-style\npoisoning attack, enabling attackers to induce intricate patterns of branch\nmispredictions within victim code. \"This manipulation leads the victim to\nexecute unintended code paths, inadvertently exposing its confidential data,\"\nsaid UC San Diego computer science Professor Dean Tullsen.\n\n\"While prior attacks could misdirect a single branch or the first instance of\na branch executed multiple times, we now have such precise control that we\ncould misdirect the 732nd instance of a branch taken thousands of times,\" said\nTullsen.\n\nThe team presents a proof-of-concept where they force an encryption algorithm\nto transiently exit earlier, resulting in the exposure of reduced-round\nciphertext. Through this demonstration, they illustrate the ability to extract\nthe secret AES encryption key.\n\n\"Pathfinder can reveal the outcome of almost any branch in almost any victim\nprogram, making it the most precise and powerful microarchitectural control-\nflow extraction attack that we have seen so far,\" said Kazem Taram, an\nassistant professor of computer science at Purdue University and a UC San\nDiego computer science Ph.D. graduate.\n\nIn addition to Dean Tullsen and Hosein Yavarzadeh, other UC San Diego co-\nauthors are. Archit Agarwal and Deian Stefan. Other co-authors include\nChristina Garman and Kazem Taram, Purdue University; Daniel Moghimi, Google;\nDaniel Genkin, Georgia Tech; Max Christman and Andrew Kwong, University of\nNorth Carolina Chapel Hill.\n\nResearchers communicated the security findings outlined in the paper to both\nIntel and AMD in November 2023. Intel has informed other affected\nhardware/software vendors about the issues. Both Intel and AMD plan to address\nthe concerns raised in the paper today through a Security Announcement and a\nSecurity Bulletin (AMD-SB-7015), respectively. The findings have been shared\nwith the Vulnerability Information and Coordination Environment (VINCE), Case\nVU#157097: Class of Attack Primitives Enable Data Exposure on High End Intel\nCPUs.\n\nMore information: Hosein Yavarzadeh et al, Pathfinder: High-Resolution\nControl-Flow Attacks Exploiting the Conditional Branch Predictor, Proceedings\nof the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for\nProgramming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 3 (2024).
