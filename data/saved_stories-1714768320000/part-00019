If you\u2019re a\nconsumer and run into this issue, Microsoft advises that you first launch the\nWindows \u201cGet Help\u201d app to inform Microsoft of the problem and possibly work\nthrough a solution.\n\n#### get windows 11 pro for cheap\n\n### Windows 11 Pro\n\nBest Prices Today: \u20ac49.99 at PC-WELT Software-Shop \u2013 Windows 11 Home | \u20ac69.99 at PC-WELT Software-Shop \u2013 Windows 11 Pro\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really sound like there is a solution, though. You could always try\nto uninstall the most recent security update. (Of course, you lose the\nprotections that accompany the most recent patch, too.) Otherwise, you\u2019ll have\nto wait until Microsoft fixes the problem \u2014 if there is a problem. Microsoft\nat least hasn\u2019t said that all VPNs are affected, possibly including our best\nVPN recommendations.\n\nIt\u2019s all bad news, of course, for anyone who likes to work at a coffee shop or\nairport, or who is travelling overseas where VPNs can be a way of life.\nHopefully Microsoft finds a fix soon.\n\n### Author: Mark Hachman, Senior Editor\n\nAs PCWorld's senior editor, Mark focuses on Microsoft news and chip\ntechnology, among other beats.
