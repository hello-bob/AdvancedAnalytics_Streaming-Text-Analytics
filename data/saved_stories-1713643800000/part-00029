The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

The brain tries to block out fragments of\ndisaster: the spray of shattered glass as one car slammed into another, the\nsmell of smoke. People with post-traumatic stress disorder sometimes constrict\ntheir lives, avoiding streets or smells or songs that make them think about\nwhat they\u2019ve experienced. But memories make themselves known \u2014 in nightmares,\nflashbacks, and intrusive thoughts.\n\nSince PTSD was first included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders in 1980, clinicians have identified a handful of therapies\nthat help people cope with traumatic memories. Over the past decade, a\nseemingly unconventional treatment has wedged its way into mainstream therapy.\n\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, better known as\nE.M.D.R., might look bizarre to an observer. The practice involves coaxing\npeople to process traumatic memories while simultaneously interacting with\nimages, sounds or sensations that activate both sides of the brain. Patients\nmight flit their eyes back and forth, following a therapist\u2019s finger or stare\nat bursts of light on alternating sides of a screen. The idea is to anchor the\nbrain in the current moment as a patient recalls the past.\n\nIn recent years, E.M.D.R. has attracted more attention, thanks in part to\nincreased demand for trauma treatment throughout the pandemic and celebrities\nwho have shared their experiences.

Bessel van der Kolk, the book\u2019s\nauthor, touts the treatment as one of the most effective ways to combat PTSD\nsymptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s not really an innovative treatment anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nsomething that\u2019s very well-established.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nE.M.D.R. employs bilateral stimulation \u2014 the use of images, sounds or\nsensations that activate both sides of the brain \u2014 to help anchor a patient in\nthe present as they recall memories.CreditCredit...\n\n## What is E.M.D.R.?\n\nThe psychologist Francine Shapiro developed E.M.D.R. in 1987 as she grappled\nwith her own disturbing memory \u2014 first, experimenting on herself, flitting her\neyes back and forth as she walked through a park, and then gradually expanding\nthe treatment to other people.\n\nTherapists carry out E.M.D.R. in eight phases that typically unfold over six\nto 12 sessions, although that number varies from person to person. Each\nsession tends to last between 60 and 90 minutes. First, a therapist will\ndiscuss the patient\u2019s current challenges, gathering information about their\nhistory, and then propose a plan for treatment, said Deborah Korn, a clinician\nand co-author of \u201cEvery Memory Deserves Respect.\u201d\n\nThe patient may need to \u201cfloat back\u201d from their current symptoms, she said,\nexploring a recent emotional outburst or panic attack to isolate the triggers\nthat provoked it. The goal is to identify a traumatic memory that a patient\ncan work through in the later E.M.D.R. phases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t show up saying \u2018I want to work on my traumatic memories\nfrom ages 5 to 11,\u2019\u201d Dr. Korn said. \u201cThey say, \u2018I\u2019m miserable.\u2019\u201d\n\n## Understand Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n\n### The invasive symptoms of PTSD can affect combat veterans and civilians\nalike. Early intervention is critical for managing the condition.\n\n  * Understanding the Brain: Decades of treatment of military veterans and sexual assault survivors have left little doubt that traumatic memories work differently from other memories. A group of researchers set out to find empirical evidence of what makes them stand them apart.\n  * E.M.D.R.: The once-experimental trauma treatment might look bizarre, but some clinicians say it\u2019s highly effective against PTSD. Here\u2019s how the therapy works.\n  * Removing the Stigma: Misconceptions about how PTSD develops and its symptoms, can prevent people from seeking treatment.\n  * Psychedelic Drugs: As studies continue to point to the therapeutic value of substances like MDMA, veterans are becoming unlikely advocates for their decriminalization.\n\nThen, the patient and clinician devise coping strategies, like breathing\nexercises or meditation to help combat dissociation, that a patient can use if\nthey become distressed during or between sessions.\n\nOnce those strategies are established, typically after one or two sessions,\nthe therapist instructs the patient to recall the most difficult aspect of the\ntraumatic event. It could be an image, sound or smell that intrudes on their\nthoughts most often; for some patients, the most vivid memory related to a\ntrauma took place just before an event transpired, said Sanne Houben, a\nresearcher at Maastricht University who studies E.M.D.R.\n\nPatients focus on the sensations and emotions they experience while thinking\nabout this aspect as they engage in activities like moving their eyes, tapping\non their body or hearing a faint beeping sound that alternates between their\nears. Each set of these bilateral stimulations typically lasts between 30 and\n60 seconds.\n\nVideo\n\nRapid eye movements are a common component of E.M.D.R. Some have even\ntheorized that the eye movement is similar to how they wobble during R.E.M.\nsleep, which could relax the amygdala, the center in your brain that processes\nfear and memory.CreditCredit...Sophie Park for The New York Times\n\nPeriodically, the therapist will ask the patient what they are noticing or\nfeeling, encouraging them to consider the memory from a present-day\nperspective. \u201cIf you say, \u2018It\u2019s all my fault,\u2019 a therapist might ask how old\nwere you, did you really think you could protect yourself as a child?\u201d said\nVaile Wright, the senior director of health care innovation at the American\nPsychological Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit there and think about\nthe memory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## How does E.M.D.R. work?\n\nPushing a patient to deliberately revisit the past isn\u2019t a feature of just\nE.M.D.R.; most therapies for PTSD, including prolonged exposure and cognitive\nprocessing therapy, prompt patients to \u201cactively go toward the trauma,\u201d said\nDr. Shaili Jain, a PTSD specialist at Stanford University.\n\nRevisiting trauma can activate the body\u2019s stress response \u2014 cortisol levels\nspike and heart rate jumps. But over time, the process can gradually\ndesensitize you to your memories, habituating your body to the stress and\nanxiety you experience when confronted with a reminder of the trauma.\n\n\u201cThat fight or flight response just gets brought down several notches, so\nyou\u2019re back in the driver's seat of your life,\u201d Dr. Jain said. \u201cInstead of\nricocheting off triggers.\u201d\n\nWith E.M.D.R., the added component of bilateral stimulation theoretically\nanchors the patient in the current moment as they\u2019re engaging with a trauma.\n\u201cWe use the phrase: one foot in the present, and one foot in the past,\u201d said\nMarianne Silva, a clinical social worker and E.M.D.R. practitioner at the V.A.\nNew England Healthcare System.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bilateral stimulation needs to be compelling enough to distract patients,\nbut not so overwhelming that they totally focus on it. Multiplication tables,\nfor instance, would require too much effort, said Richard McNally, a\npsychology professor at Harvard University.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWith E.M.D.R., we really see people move the past back into the past,\u201d Dr.\nKorn said.CreditCredit...Sophie Park for The New York Times\n\nOur brains do not have the capacity to completely focus on both the bilateral\nstimulation and the traumatic memory, Dr. Houben said. The theory behind\nE.M.D.R. is that memories become less vivid and emotional when a patient can\u2019t\nfocus on them completely.\n\n\u201cAt the end of a therapy session, you put it back in storage,\u201d Dr. McNally\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s in a degraded form. It\u2019s not quite as emotionally evocative.\u201d\n\n## Is E.M.D.R. effective?\n\nToday, clinicians generally consider E.M.D.R. an effective treatment for\ntrauma. The World Health Organization and American Psychological Association\nhave recommended it for people with PTSD and have issued guidelines for\nadministering treatment. In England, the National Institute for Health and\nCare Excellence, a rigorous authority in the psychological field, lists\nE.M.D.R. as a tool for adults grappling with trauma and children who have not\nresponded to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut scientists are debating whether E.M.D.R. is more effective than other\ntrauma treatment methods. Pim Cuijpers, a professor of clinical psychology at\nthe Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, analyzed nearly 80 studies on E.M.D.R. and\nfound that, while the research pointed to the treatment\u2019s positive effects,\n\u201cthe quality of research is really very bad,\u201d he said.\n\nMany psychological treatments lack rigorous studies, he said, but the evidence\nfor E.M.D.R. was particularly thin, with small sample sizes and potential bias\non the part of clinicians conducting the research.\n\nWhile E.M.D.R. is most likely effective, Dr. Cuijpers said, he cautioned\nagainst wholeheartedly endorsing the evidence behind the treatment.\n\nAnd there are very few studies that show E.M.D.R. works in the long-term, said\nHenry Otgaar, a researcher and professor of forensic psychology at Maastricht\nUniversity in the Netherlands.\n\nDr. Otgaar, Dr. Houben and other researchers are investigating whether\nE.M.D.R. increases a patient\u2019s susceptibility to false memories. While\ncreating false memories is a risk in many therapies, Dr. Houben said \u201cit\u2019s too\nearly to say if that\u2019s inherent to E.M.D.R.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen E.M.D.R. started becoming more widely publicized in the late 90s and\nearly 2000s, Dr. McNally, then a trauma researcher, was one of the most\noutspoken critics against the treatment \u2014 writing that E.M.D.R. was \u201cmerely\none of the many therapeutic fuzz-balls that litter the landscape of psychology\ntoday,\u201d in an issue of the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. He acknowledged that\nE.M.D.R. can desensitize people to their memories, but did not think there was\nconvincing evidence that the most distinctive feature of the therapy \u2014 the eye\nmovements \u2014 had any additional benefit. Today, the issue of whether processing\ntrauma with a therapist would lead to similar results remains up for debate;\nDr. Jain calls it \u201cthe multimillion dollar question.\u201d\n\nStill, there are patients and clinicians who swear by the treatment \u2014 and\nenough \u201csolid data\u201d to back it, Dr. Jain said. Patients report fewer PTSD\nsymptoms after sessions, Dr. Wright said, with fewer flashbacks and intrusive\nthoughts.\n\n## Who could E.M.D.R. work for?\n\n\u201cAnybody who has experienced trauma\u201d could benefit from E.M.D.R., said Trisha\nMiller, a psychotherapist at the Cleveland Clinic. People with mental health\nconditions beyond PTSD, like depression, eating disorders, phobias and\naddictions may also benefit from E.M.D.R., she added, although there is not\nyet robust research confirming that the treatment is effective for those\nconditions.\n\nPeople seeking E.M.D.R. practitioners should make sure they find a certified\nspecialist, Ms. Miller stressed. The E.M.D.R. International Association, which\nruns certification and training for the therapy, keeps a directory of\npractitioners who have been trained and certified by the organization.\n\n\u201cFrom a clinician\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m like, \u2018whatever works,\u2019\u201d Dr. Jain said.\n\u201cIf E.M.D.R. works for you, do it.\u201d\n\nAudio produced by Kate Winslett.\n\nDani Blum is a reporter for Well.
