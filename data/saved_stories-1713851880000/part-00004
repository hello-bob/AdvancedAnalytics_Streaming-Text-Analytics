Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques\n> and the necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs'\n> reasoning abilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by\n> data availability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-\n> learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to\n> refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy\n> of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and\n> planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce AlphaLLM for the\n> self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n> with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the\n> capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration\n> from the success of AlphaGo, AlphaLLM addresses the unique challenges of\n> combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the\n> vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of\n> feedback in language tasks. AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis\n> component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a\n> trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in\n> mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM significantly\n> enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the\n> potential for self-improvement in LLMs.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.12253 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.12253v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.12253arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Baolin Peng [view email] [v1] Thu, 18 Apr 2024 15:21:34 UTC (897 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via\nImagination, Searching, and Criticizing, by Ye Tian and Baolin Peng and\nLinfeng Song and Lifeng Jin and Dian Yu and Haitao Mi and Dong Yu\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
