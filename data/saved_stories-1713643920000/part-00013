Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-\n> scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA),\n> which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens\n> without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for\n> long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture\n> the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-\n> Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates\n> seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation\n> capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is\n> comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared\n> with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the\n> performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source\n> alternative.
