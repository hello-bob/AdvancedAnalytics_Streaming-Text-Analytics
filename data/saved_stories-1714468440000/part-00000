This work explores pretraining without attention by\n> using recent advances in sequence routing based on state-space models\n> (SSMs). Our proposed model, Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM\n> layers with a multiplicative gating architecture that has been effective in\n> simplified sequence modeling architectures. The model learns static layers\n> that do not consider pair-wise interactions. Even so, BiGS is able to match\n> BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE and can be extended to long-form\n> pretraining of 4096 tokens without approximation. Analysis shows that while\n> the models have similar average accuracy, the approach has different\n> inductive biases than BERT in terms of interactions and syntactic\n> representations.
