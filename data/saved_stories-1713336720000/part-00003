Here we examined the\neffects of chronic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus\nor the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-inhibiting compound Q134R on\nage-related canine brain atrophy from a longitudinal study in middle-aged\nbeagles (36 females, 7 males) undergoing behavioral enrichment. Annual MRI was\nanalyzed using modern, automated techniques for region-of-interest -based and\nvoxel-based volumetric assessments. We found that the frontal lobe showed\naccelerated atrophy with age, while the caudate nucleus remained relatively\nstable. Remarkably, the hippocampus increased in volume in all dogs. None of\nthese changes were influenced by tacrolimus or Q134R treatment. Our results\nsuggest that behavioral enrichment can prevent atrophy and increase the volume\nof the hippocampus but does not prevent aging-associated prefrontal cortex\natrophy.\n\nSignificance Statement Aging canines naturally show significant\nneuropathological similarities to human aging and AD, making them valuable\ntranslational models for testing disease-modifying treatments. We applied\nmodern, state-of-the-art longitudinal volumetric analysis approaches to\nevaluate treatment effects from structural MRI in a large cohort of middle-\naged beagles treated with the FDA approved calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus,\nor the experimental NFAT inhibitor, Q134R, while undergoing extensive\nbehavioral enrichment. We show increased hippocampal volumes across all dogs,\neven control placebo dogs, compelling evidence for a strong enrichment-related\nbenefit on hippocampal structural integrity. Our findings are the first of its\nkind to demonstrate benefits of behavioral intervention on longitudinal\nstructural brain changes in a higher mammalian model of aging and AD.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  * L.G.P.: personal financial interests, as he is the main shareholder of one of Aperus Pharma co Ltd's company shares.\n\n  * The study was supported by NIH/NIA R01AG056998 (EH/CN/CELS).
