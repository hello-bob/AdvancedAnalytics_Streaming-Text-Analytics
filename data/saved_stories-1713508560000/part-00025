I expect I am one of a very small number\nof people who read it.\n\nI still have an Amazon Alexa, which I find somewhat embarrassing to admit. But\nit was cheap and functional and I like to be able to play music with my voice\nor set an alarm without looking at a screen. I even occasionally use it to\nreorder things from Amazon, which as far as I can tell is the only way they\nmake any money from it.\n\nI am close to getting rid of it, though, because it constantly tries to upsell\nme to use \u201croutines.\u201d For example, I will ask \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s the weather?\u201d and\nit will respond, in its hauntingly monotonic female robot voice, \u201cIt\u2019s 45\ndegrees right now. By the way, I can tell you the weather and the news, and\nturn on your lights every morning when you wake up. Would you like me to do\nthat?\u201d\n\nOr, I will ask it to set a timer for 8 minutes, and it will say, \u201cokay \u2014 by\nthe way, you can play a trivia game while you wait. Would you like to do\nthat?\u201d\n\nGenerally, I just say \u201cNo,\u201d but sometimes I will say \u201cNo, and never ask me\nanything like that ever again.\u201d When I say that, the robot is silent, but I\nknow it is only a temporary respite. The next time I ask it a question, it\nwill glibly offer me another supposedly helpful add-on.\n\n##\n\nThe Tyranny of Metrics\n\nI am certain that the team working on Alexa at Amazon has an OKR centered on\nsomething like \u201cincreasing the percentage of Alexa users who use scheduled\nroutines or proprietary apps.\u201d If you don\u2019t know the term OKR, consider\nyourself lucky and don\u2019t look it up; for our purposes you can just think of it\nas a \u201ccorporate goal.\u201d\n\nThe team came up with this goal because it makes sense that they would want\npeople to use their thing a lot. The more people use their thing, the more\n\u201cvalue\u201d it imparts to them and the more bonded to Amazon they become. It\ntheoretically increases the lifetime value of the user (me) to use their thing\nmore.\n\nThe trouble with this is that while all of it makes sense, it fails to capture\nthe animosity built up by being pushy with features through a medium as\nintimate as voice in a user\u2019s home. Sure, they probably have \u201cguardrail\nmetrics\u201d like user retention or daily active users to ensure that there is no\nobvious downside to promoting these features, but these are blunt instruments.\n\nPerhaps they are measuring the number of users that churn from Alexa entirely,\nor some version of a Net Promoter Score in an email survey that they run. But\nit is very hard to attribute a user leaving a product to one specific change.\nSo, I expect they\u2019ve run tests that show that adding a given upsell doesn\u2019t\nnegatively impact user retention over some period, say 3 months. But it\u2019s\ndifficult to measure the impact of layering lots of these little annoyances on\ntop of each other, and each subteam within the Alexa org is incentivized to\npromote their own little feature (after all, they have to hit their OKRs!). So\nthe experience gets more and more bloated with upsells, until one day the user\nis so fed up he throws the Alexa out of his window, and it hits an innocent\nbystander, and they die a death that could have been avoided with a more\nthoughtful management structure.\n\n##\n\nWhat to do instead?\n\nI think Alexa would be a much better product if it had a person at the top who\nused the product a lot and could make decisions on behalf of the user. These\ndecisions would be informed by the data I mentioned above but they would not\nbe captured by the data; they would have a common sense, \u201clet\u2019s not make our\nusers miserable\u201d motivation. The extreme version of this is someone like Steve\nJobs, who ruled by decree and intuition, making decisions himself instead of\nrelying on incentive structures to produce the right outcomes.\n\nThe trouble with this setup is it requires the organization to place trust in\nhuman taste and judgment, and it requires that it lets go of the satisfying\nfeeling of being a master watchmaker and building an OKR machine where every\nteam produces something measurable and they all ladder up to the\norganization\u2019s goals to create the perfect product. Especially in products\nwhere a lot of the value comes from the feeling you get when you use the\nproduct (like a speaker you talk to inside your home), I don\u2019t think it is\npossible to build the perfect system with measurable goals and incentives,\nbecause the feeling of beautiful design or terrible design will not be\nmeasurable.\n\nThis is in contrast to Amazon\u2019s core shopping experience, where most of the\nvalue comes from the utility of being able to find anything you want to buy\nand get it delivered quickly. The feeling you get when you look at the\ncluttered homepage is not a great one, but that\u2019s okay, because it\naccomplishes what you need to get done.\n\nA product team must decide where on the spectrum of \u201cdelightful experience\u201d to\n\u201cpure utility\u201d its product belongs, and the further towards the delightful\nexperience it is, the more it must be designed with human taste and the harder\nit will be to build an OKR machine that outputs it.\n\n### Subscribe to Residual Thoughts\n\nBy Joe Hovde \u00b7 Launched 5 months ago\n\nInfo-tapas for infovores.

You have identified the disease of feature\nbloat and its cause!Another idea would be to let the user control the new or\nupsell feature presentation.
