A second paper published in April by a Stanford\nUniversity team in the US claims this figure might range between 6.3 and 17.5\npercent, depending on the topic.\n\nBoth papers looked for certain words that large language models (LLMs) use\nhabitually, such as \u201cintricate,\u201d \u201cpivotal,\u201d and \u201cmeticulously.\" By tracking\nthe use of those words across scientific literature, and comparing this to\nwords that aren't particularly favored by AI, the two studies say they can\ndetect an increasing reliance on machine learning within the scientific\npublishing community.\n\nIn Gray's paper, the use of control words like \"red,\" \"conclusion,\" and\n\"after\" changed by a few percent from 2019 to 2023. The same was true of other\ncertain adjectives and adverbs until 2023 (termed the post-LLM year by Gray).\n\nIn that year use of the words \"meticulous,\" \"commendable,\" and \"intricate,\"\nrose by 59, 83, and 117 percent respectively, while their prevalence in\nscientific literature hardly changed between 2019 and 2022. The word with the\nsingle biggest increase in prevalence post-2022 was \u201cmeticulously\u201d, up 137\npercent.\n\nThe Stanford paper found similar phenomena, demonstrating a sudden increase\nfor the words \"realm,\" \"showcasing,\" \"intricate,\" and \"pivotal.\" The former\ntwo were used about 80 percent more often than in 2021 and 2022, while the\nlatter two were used around 120 and almost 160 percent more frequently\nrespectively.\n\n  * Beyond the hype, AI promises leg up for scientific research\n  * AI researchers have started reviewing their peers using AI assistance\n  * Boffins deem Google DeepMind's material discoveries rather shallow\n  * Turns out AI chatbots are way more persuasive than humans\n\nThe researchers also considered word usage statistics in various scientific\ndisciplines. Computer science and electrical engineering were ahead of the\npack when it came to using AI-preferred language, while mathematics, physics,\nand papers published by the journal Nature, only saw increases of between five\nand 7.5 percent.\n\nThe Stanford bods also noted that authors posting more preprints, working in\nmore crowded fields, and writing shorter papers seem to use AI more\nfrequently. Their paper suggests that a general lack of time and a need to\nwrite as much as possible encourages the use of LLMs, which can help increase\noutput.\n\n### Potentially the next big controversy in the scientific community\n\nUsing AI to help in the research process isn't anything new, and lots of\nboffins are open about utilizing AI to tweak experiments to achieve better\nresults. However, using AI to actually write abstracts and other chunks of\npapers is very different, because the general expectation is that scientific\narticles are written by actual humans, not robots, and at least a couple of\npublishers consider using LLMs to write papers to be scientific misconduct.\n\nUsing AI models can be very risky as they often produce inaccurate text, the\nvery thing scientific literature is not supposed to do. AI models can even\nfabricate quotations and citations, an occurrence that infamously got two New\nYork attorneys in trouble for citing cases ChatGPT had dreamed up.\n\n\"Authors who are using LLM-generated text must be pressured to disclose this\nor to think twice about whether doing so is appropriate in the first place, as\na matter of basic research integrity,\" University College London\u2019s Gray\nopined.\n\nThe Stanford researchers also raised similar concerns, writing that use of\ngenerative AI in scientific literature could create \"risks to the security and\nindependence of scientific practice.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n11 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### With Run:ai acquisition, Nvidia aims to manage your AI kubes\n\nNow Jensen has a control plane to play with his army of NIMs\n\nAI + ML9 days |\n\n#### Intel's neuromorphic 'owl brain' swoops into Sandia labs\n\nHala Point system crams more than a thousand neurochips into a 6U chassis to\ntackle real-time AI\n\nAI + ML16 days | 1\n\n#### Google Search results polluted by buggy AI-written code frustrate coders\n\nAnalysis Pulumi claims it has culled bad infrastructure-as-code samples\n\nAI + ML2 days | 38\n\n#### The next step up for high-impact identity authorization\n\nHow SSH Communications Security cuts through the hype around Zero Trust to\nsecure the connections that matter\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### US, Japan announce joint AI research projects funded by Nvidia,\nMicrosoft, others\n\nNot that $110M will go very far, mind\n\nAI + ML22 days |\n\n#### Forget the AI doom and hype, let's make computers useful\n\nSystems Approach Machine learning has its place, just not in ways that suits\ntoday's hypesters\n\nSoftware8 days | 59\n\n#### Don't rent out that container ship yet: CIOs and biz buyers view AI PCs\nwith some caution\n\nRisky bet?
