I always tell myself the reason is that I\njust want a change, that iOS has become too samey for me, or I\u2019m lured in by\njust how weird and cool hardware has gotten outside of Apple\u2019s purview. If I\u2019m\nbeing honest though, folding phones, better assistants, and more customization\noptions all pale in comparison to Google allowing emulators on the Play Store.\nEvery time I switch to Android my first move is to download Game Boy Advance\nand PSP emulators, followed by the apps I actually need. After a few months \u2014\nor weeks, given my recent foray into the Pixel Fold \u2014 I switch back to iOS and\nabandon whatever Pok\u00e9mon game I was in the middle of.\n\nGiven my penchant for tinkering and my love of retro handhelds, it only makes\nsense that I\u2019ve tried the many weird ways of getting emulators running on my\niPhone. The easiest way for most people has always been more complicated than\nit should have been: AltStore. Created by Riley Tetsut, AltStore allows iOS\nusers to sideload any app they want onto their device. The setup process is a\nbit strange \u2014 especially if you\u2019re on a Windows machine \u2014 and a requirement to\n\u201crefresh\u201d your apps every few days felt arcane and was easy to forget, but\nthat\u2019s always been the cost of finding a gap in Apple\u2019s garden wall.\n\nAltStore for me (and many) was just a way to get access to Delta, which is the\nbest emulator on iOS by a pretty shocking margin. While there are admittedly\nmore feature-rich apps like RetroArch out there, no other app feels made for\niPhone in the way Delta does. With a slick iOS-friendly user interface, custom\nthemes and designs to reskin your experience, and the ability to grab game\nfiles from iCloud, Delta always represented what a talented app developer\ncould do if the App Store was even slightly more open. It\u2019s in this\npossibility space where I likely never switch to Android again.\n\nIt was only about two weeks ago that Apple modified its App Store rules to\nallow emulators, though people justifiably had questions about what exactly\nthose rules entailed. Various takes popped up around how the wording was vague\nenough to allow Apple the ability to reject any emulation app for the\nslightest perceived infraction \u2014 as they do with most apps anyway \u2014 and that\nthis was essentially a swerve to avoid more hits from the regulatory bodies at\nthe EU or DOJ. This might be true on a high level, but it didn\u2019t stop\ndevelopers from releasing multiple emulation apps over the past week or so,\nwith almost every single one eventually getting taken down or removed within\ndays if not hours. What we were able to determine via the apps that made it\nthrough the App Store screening process was that something like Delta could\nvery likely find its way onto our phones before the month was out.\n\nHere we are today, and Delta is out on the App Store in the US and available\nvia AltStore\u2019s official listing in the EU. You should download it. I think\nwhen you do, you\u2019ll see this as a bit of an inflection point that creates a\nnew future for gaming on Apple devices, and the iPhone in particular.\n\nDevelopers have always created wonderfully bespoke experiences for the iPhone,\nutilizing touch controls, the accelerometer, and GPS through games like\nPok\u00e9mon Go. However, there's a higher level desire to transform the phone into\na powerful mobile gaming device. You can see that desire play out through\ntitles like Call of Duty Mobile and Genshin Impact which are providing\nconsole-level experiences and boasting unbelievably high player counts who are\nadapting quite well to a buttonless interface.\n\nPersonally though: I really just want to play Pok\u00e9mon on my phone. The reason\nI switch to Android is the prospect of playing Pok\u00e9mon Silver again while I\u2019m\non the subway or in the back of a Lyft or while waiting in line. Ultimately\nNintendo is unlikely to allow this in a way that lets me pay them directly for\nthe experience. They justifiably prefer having their Nintendo Online\nsubscription service and providing limited access to their valuable back\ncatalog on devices they control entirely. The idea of launching a Pok\u00e9mon game\nas an app on the App Store is a non-starter. But with emulation apps present\non both Android and iOS and many people already enjoying these experiences,\none wonders why not make a change? I would gladly pay Nintendo to play back-\ncatalog Pok\u00e9mon games on my iPhone and I would be over the moon if they\nrecognized this as a valuable audience segment worth catering to. In a lot of\nways, it\u2019s about to be extremely difficult to ignore this user-behavior.\n\nThe perfect example here is Animal Crossing1. Animal Crossing: Wild World is\none of my favorite games of all time. It significantly impacted my life and\nserved as my entry-point into the franchise. However, the official version on\nthe App Store and Google Play Store, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, while an\ninteresting take on the life-sim formula, is absolutely not the most\ncompelling way to experience Animal Crossing on a phone now that Wild World is\nalways in my pocket. Why settle for anything less than the real thing?\n\nI would always prefer this over the microtransaction-laden Pocket Camp.\n\nAt the moment, mobile games largely fall into two different categories: The\nfirst category includes games thoughtfully designed from scratch for\nsmartphones and for real people. They find ways to explore how we interact\nwith our devices on a daily basis, and tailor their gameplay mechanics to\nengage with those interactions accordingly. Florence, a game about a\nrelationship and its eventual breakdown, is told primarily through swiping and\ngesturing, allowing players to advance a story devoid of dialogue that is\nstill emotionally resonant because of our physical input. Knotwords, a halfway\npoint between crosswords and sudoku, is built in a way that encourages playing\non a daily basis \u2014 and the game reacts accordingly in design and music to what\npoint in the day you decide to check in.\n\nThe second category comprises games like the aforementioned Genshin Impact or\nCall of Duty Mobile, which are absolutely riddled with microtransactions.\nThese games dominate the App Store, cynically designed to be predatory and\nextract as much money as possible from their players. This perspective might\nseem hardcore, but the introduction of Apple Arcade suggests even Apple\nrecognizes the issue and is attempting to address it. Play Star Trek Legends\nfor even a few minutes and you\u2019ll see it very clearly featured\nmicrotransactions at one point in its development, but had these elements\nremoved in its addition to Apple Arcade. When it comes to the two categories\nof games on the App Store, the more horrific one is winning out, leaving the\nother behind with increasingly sparse selections on a yearly basis.\n\nThe introduction of emulators offers an alternative within this ecosystem,\nproviding games with immersive stories and gameplay systems that are designed\nfor extended play sessions. These games, though designed for other hardware,\nstill offer complete experiences counter to the endless treadmills of most\napps found in the Games tab today which funnel users into shops loaded with\nin-game currencies. As the concept of emulation becomes more prevalent and\nubiquitous across all mobile devices, I feel as though it can introduce a\nmuch-needed shake-up to the MTX-laden landscape we live in today.\n\nTo be clear: I\u2019m not naive enough to think everyone is going to stop making\ngacha-filled apps and games now that we can play the original Advance Wars on\nour phones, but I do think the ability to do so changes the calculus for both\nconsumers and publishers about how we\u2019ll all be spending our time going\nforward. How does Nintendo react to the news that despite their desire to\nfight game preservation at all costs, people are nonetheless still enjoying\nthe very games that built their business in the first place? How do their\nshareholders react when they watch a behemoth miss a boat this large,\ncallously digging in their heels as it sails away into the sunset?\n\nProbably not well! Lmao!\n\n\u23c6\n\n1 You could very easily make this same argument about Fire Emblem Heroes in\ncomparison to the many mainline Fire Emblem games present on the devices Delta\nsupports.\n\nPublished April 17, 2024\n\nSubscribe via RSS\n\nBack to all blog posts\n\nPIKA\n\n", "frontpage": false}
