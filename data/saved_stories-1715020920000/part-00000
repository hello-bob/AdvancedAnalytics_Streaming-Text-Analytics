I\u2019ve been sharing this structure in many 1:1 chats with\nprospective founders, so I\u2019m putting it here for everyone.\n\nThree key things:\n\n  1. Flow: The emphasis on this structure is flow and storytelling: each section flows onto the other naturally. This makes the pitch memorable in an ocean of a million pitches.\n\n  2. Clarity: It makes the sections you must include clear: you would be surprised how many 25+ slide pitches I hear and still can\u2019t tell what the product is.\n\n  3. All Startup Advice is Bad: the Principles of Survivorship and Availability Bias apply to this advice\u2014 as to all startup advice.\n\n#\n\nThe Structure\n\n  1. Opening: \u201cHey everyone, my name is Naruto Uzumaki, and today I\u2019ll be pitching the Shinobi Network as a Service (SNAS)!\u201d\n\nKeep it simple, direct, and move on. If you're nervous (which you will be),\nthere's a tendency to keep talking and waste precious time on slide 1. Avoid\nthis by preparing a short, focused starter.\n\n  2. Intro/ Why you: \u201cI have served as a ninja in Konoha for over 15 years, mastered hundreds of jutsu, and led teams to complete 32 successful S-rank missions.\u201d\n\nThis slide should include 3-4 impressive facts relevant to you as an operator\n(who can get sh*t done) and as the founder of the specific idea you're\npitching. Avoid unrelated information.\n\n  3. The Problem: \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned over the years is that our ninja villages struggle to work together. Miscommunication leads to frequent conflicts, preventing us from achieving peace.\u201d\n\nIntroducing the problem with a personal anecdote makes the narrative flow\nsmoother and helps the audience visualize the issue you're addressing.\nDescribe the problem in vivid detail.\n\n  4. The Size of the Problem: \u201c...I thought this was just an issue for us in Konoha, but the Five Kages Report from 2024 showed that ninja villages across the continent lose $897M in collaborative opportunities due to mistrust.\u201d\n\nNow extrapolate from your anecdote to show this is a massive problem; quantify\nthe total addressable market (TAM) by putting a dollar value on it.\n\n  5. Your Solution (preferably Demo) & Unique Insight: \u201cTo improve relations between villages, last quarter we launched the Shinobi Network program. Here\u2019s a demo. This increased successful cross-village missions by 125%, leading to the Shinobi Network as a Service (SNAS), which we shared with other ninja villages.\u201d\n\nDescribe your solution. Live demos are King\ud83d\udc51 and speak louder than any nice\ngraphics. In addition to the demo, share some unique insights. If your insight\nis something an averagely smart Shinbobi consultant could\u2019ve thought of, it\u2019s\nnot unique. Teach your audience something new.\n\n  6. Execution & Early Traction: \u201c...our first village partners loved SNAS. They saw an immediate spike in successful missions involving other villages, averaging an 85% increase. This boosted collaboration by 239%, and 95% signed up for our annual subscription. Here\u2019s some social proof.\u201d\n\nExecution is evaluated in two parts: 1) does your team have the ability to\nbuild and ship product fast (quality of your CTO + technical team) and 2) does\nyour team have the ability to sell (quality of CEO + biz dev).\n\nMost other sections of the deck can be adorned with nice words, this part\ncan\u2019t: there either is a product or there isn\u2019t; there either is some revenue\nor there isn\u2019t. LOIs, waitlists, etc.\n\nIf a team can answer these two questions well, investors are willing to\noverlook an incomplete product idea in favor of a lean team that can iterate,\nbuild, and sell.\n\n  7. The Potential: \u201cIn the next 30 years, old grudges will persist. It\u2019s crucial for the $100B ninja industry to foster cross-village cooperation, which is why top shinobi are signing up for SNAS. We aim to expand to new demographics like civilians and students.\u201d\n\nWhy now? Describe how your solution will ride on market forces and trends. Be\nspecific. How will the world look in 5-10 years if your solution is adopted by\neveryone who fits your ideal customer profile (ICP)? In addition, how can your\nsolution evolve in the future?\n\n  8. Competitors: \u201cUnlike our competitors, SNAS is built on 15 years of experience and strong relationships that give us a distribution advantage.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest red flags in a pitch is a shallow explanation of why you\nare better than your competitors. Explaining your advantage (founder/ product\nfit; distribution; pricing) succinctly is confidence; saying things like\n\u201ctheir product sucks and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing\u201d is naivet\u00e9 and\narrogance.\n\nPersonally, before you tell me where your competitors are falling short, I\u2019d\nlike to hear what they\u2019re doing right and what you will emulate from their\nstrategy.\n\n  9. GTM/ Growth Strategy: \u201cWe will first target villages with structures similar to Konoha's, where we\u2019ll find our power users. Then, we\u2019ll expand to other hidden villages before approaching samurai regions.\u201d\n\nLike most other sections, this is a chance to prove that you\u2019ve thought deeper\nthan an average Shinobi consultant about your market and GTM strategy. In\nother words, you need to share some deep insights on how you will find your\nfirst power users.\n\n  10. Need & Use of Funds: \u201cWe\u2019re going to hire two ninja engineers and a marketing expert, aiming for $34M ARR in 12-16 months.\u201d\n\nAt pre-seed, VCs usually don't expect a full financial model, but you should\nhave a clear vision of your funding needs.\n\n  11. Appendix: Material for Q&A\n\nThe function of the appendix is to assist you in your Q&A. Think about what\nare some of the questions you will be asked, and prepare visual aids for your\nanswers.\n\n#\n\nMisc:\n\n  * Tools:\n\n    * www.canva.com\u2019s deck-making tool is pretty good!\n\n  * General advice:\n\n    * You should be very confident in everything you are saying; confidence comes from knowing as much as you can about your space, idea, and startup.\n\n    * It\u2019s ok to not have all the answers, but you should have a strong opinion/ thesis about the space. Investors want to make opinionated bets; they don\u2019t want to invest in your reflections. \u201cAction produces information.\u201d\n\n  * Fundraising playlist.\n\nHave questions, thoughts, feedback?
