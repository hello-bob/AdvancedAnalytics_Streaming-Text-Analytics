After decades on the cultural\nmargins, the question of life in the Universe beyond Earth is having its day\nin the sun. The next big multibillion-dollar space telescope (the successor to\nthe James Webb) will be tuned to search for signatures of alien life on alien\nplanets and NASA has a robust, well-funded programme in astrobiology.\nMeanwhile, from breathless newspaper articles about unexplained navy pilot\nsightings to United States congressional testimony with wild claims of\ngovernment programmes hiding crashed saucers, UFOs and UAPs (unidentified\nanomalous phenomena) seem to be making their own journey from the fringes.\n\nWhat are we to make of these twin movements, the scientific search for life on\none hand, and the endlessly murky waters of UFO/UAP claims on the other?\nLooking at history shows that these two very different approaches to the\nquestion of extraterrestrial life are, in fact, linked, but not in a good way.\nFor decades, scientists wanting to think seriously about life in the Universe\nfaced what\u2019s been called the \u2018giggle factor\u2019, which was directly related to\nUFOs and their culture. More than once, the giggle factor came close to\nkilling off the field known as SETI (the search for extraterrestrial\nintelligence). Now, with new discoveries and new technologies making\nastrobiology a mainstream frontier of astrophysics, understanding this history\nhas become important for anyone trying to understand what comes next. But for\nme, as a researcher in the field of technosignatures (signs of advanced alien\ntech) \u2013 the new face of SETI \u2013 getting past the giggle factor poses an\nexistential challenge.\n\nI am the principal investigator of NASA\u2019s first ever grant to study signatures\nof intelligent life from distant exoplanets. My colleagues and I are tasked\nwith developing a library of technosignatures or evidence of technology-\nwielding life forms on distant planets. Taking on that role has been the\nculmination of a lifetime fascination with the question of life and the\nUniverse, a fascination that formed when I was a kid in the 1970s, drinking\ndeep from the well of science fiction novels, UFO documentaries and Star Trek\nreruns. Early on, as a teenager reading both Carl Sagan and Erich von D\u00e4niken\n(the author of Chariots of the Gods), I had to figure out how to separate the\nwheat from the chaff. This served as a kind of training ground for dealing\nwith questions facing me and my colleagues about proper standards of evidence\nin astrobiology. It\u2019s also why, as a public-facing scientist, I must work to\nunderstand how people not trained in science come to questions surrounding\nUFOs as aliens. That is what drove me, writing a recent popular-level account\nof astrobiology\u2019s frontiers called The Little Book of Aliens (2023), to stare\nhard into the entangled history of UFOs, the scientific search for life beyond\nEarth, and the all-important question of standards of evidence.\n\nThe question of what constitutes evidence for an extraordinary claim made its\nappearance in the very first major UFO story. It was 24 June 1947, a good day\nfor flying in the Pacific Northwest. The skies were clear and bright over\nMineral, Washington. It was the middle of the day as the amateur pilot Kenneth\nArnold found himself navigating his small single-engine plane past the\ntowering peak of Mount Rainier toward an air show in Oregon. But he\u2019d heard\nthat a US Marine Corps transport plane had gone missing, and a reward was\nbeing offered for anyone who found its wreckage. Arnold decided to make a few\ncircuits and have a look. He didn\u2019t know it at the time, but he was flying\nstraight into UFO history.\n\nAs Arnold surveyed the terrain below him, he saw a flash of light with a blue\ntinge. A DC-4 was flying off in the distance, but there were no flashing\nlights coming from it. Then the flashes appeared again. This time he saw\nexactly where they were coming from: nine objects flying in a diagonal\nformation, \u2018like the tail of a Chinese kite\u2019. Arnold watched as the objects\nbanked and turned in ways that made him think he was watching some kind of\nadvanced military aircraft, until they finally disappeared. The entire\nincident didn\u2019t last long, but it left Arnold with \u2018an eerie feeling\u2019. After\nlanding to refuel, he shared his story with friends at the airfield. What\nhappened next would echo down history, shaping everything we think about UFOs\nand their connection to aliens from outer space.\n\nArnold\u2019s tale spread quickly, and reporters from the East Oregonian asked him\nto come in and give more details. To the newspapermen, Arnold seemed like a\ncredible witness and a careful observer. Laying out the timeline of what he\nsaw, Arnold described both the craft and their motions. Exactly what happened\nnext remains controversial, but when Arnold described the objects as moving\nlike \u2018a saucer if you skip it across the water\u2019 he triggered a chain of events\nleading to one of the most outrageous misquotes in the history of journalism.\n\nThe story in the East Oregonian, a small paper, ran with the words \u2018saucer-\nlike aircraft\u2019. But, when the Associated Press picked up the story, the\ndescription got even more garbled. What Arnold said he\u2019d seen were flying\ncraft shaped like a crescent with \u2018wings\u2019 that swept back in an arc. Somehow\nthe AP wire story misinterpreted Arnold\u2019s description, leading The Chicago Sun\nto run a story with a spectacular frontpage headline: \u2018Supersonic Flying\nSaucers Sighted By Idaho Pilot.\u2019\n\nThe Chicago Sun piece triggered an avalanche. Within six months, the flying\nsaucer story ran in more than 140 newspapers across the US. Even more\nremarkable, an epidemic of flying-saucer sightings began to sweep the nation.\nBy the end of summer in 1947, \u2018flying saucers\u2019 were officially a thing.\n\nWhat\u2019s important about the Roswell story is how loose even the idea of\nevidence becomes\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learned from the Arnold affair is the\npower of a story. Arnold saw the first flying saucer, and his sighting begins\na critical thread in the public\u2019s willingness to go along on evidence-free\nrides of thinking about aliens and UFOs. It was where the idea of\ntechnologically advanced, interstellar life here on Earth right now enters the\npublic consciousness as a major phenomenon. But almost as quickly as UFOs\nappear, so does a UFO culture that tilts towards the incredulous and the\nparanoid, marked by a willingness to take anything as evidence. Of course, one\ncould find many individuals taking an interest in UFOs while keeping their\nsceptical sensibilities, who just genuinely wanted to know what was going on.\nBut, as a cultural phenomenon, public discussion of UFOs would come to be\ndominated by questionable evidence, conspiracy theories and outright hoaxes.\n\nThe Roswell affair embodies the most questionable evidence axis of UFO\nculture. The actual Roswell case involves a rancher who, just a few weeks\nafter the Arnold sighting and its media craze, found some debris on his land\nmade of sticks, wire and foil. While a short, initial hubbub ensued when a\nstory in the local paper claimed the discovery of a flying saucer (what else),\nthat claim was walked back the next day.\n\nThe brief affair was then forgotten for 30 years. It was only after that\nprolonged period that the Roswell story was resurrected in a series of\nbestselling books and TV \u2018documentaries\u2019 claiming a crashed saucer had been\nfound on the ranch. But with each new book, the Roswell story became more\ncomplex and convoluted. Each new book added more so-called witnesses and more\ndetails, including the account of the mortician Glenn Dennis getting a chance\nto view the dead aliens. Some books said there were more saucers and more\naliens, some dead and some not. Some even said alien bodies were viewed by\nnone other than president Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nWhat\u2019s important about the Roswell story is how loose even the idea of\nevidence becomes. Anyone with a vague connection to the events and a story to\ntell gets added to the list of witnesses. New books pile on old books and\ntheories multiply until even those claiming to be serious UFO researchers\ncan\u2019t sort out which version with how many saucers and bodies is the one\nthey\u2019re supposed to investigate; garden-variety enthusiasts are beyond\nconfused.\n\nWhile this might have seemed amusing to those on the sidelines at the time, it\nestablished a pattern of \u2018anything goes\u2019 in the public\u2019s perception of UFOs\nand, by association, the question of alien life that continues to this day.\n\nThat loose relationship between extraordinary claims and the evidence for such\nclaims also had a profound effect on me as a teenager interested in astronomy\nand the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.\n\nAt the time, I was reading both hard-science books (Sagan) and speculative\nworks about UFO-related topics. For a time, I\u2019d become enamoured of von\nD\u00e4niken\u2019s book Chariots of the Gods (1968) and its claims that many\narchaeological mysteries could best be explained by ancient aliens who had\nonce come to visit Earth. That time ended when, one evening, I chanced upon a\nPBS documentary called The Case of the Ancient Astronauts (1977). It presented\ninterviews with scientists who had actually spent their lives studying the\nsubjects of von D\u00e4niken\u2019s ancient alien speculations. The simplicity with\nwhich hard-won archaeological evidence trumped von D\u00e4niken\u2019s claims left me\nboth angry (I felt duped by his book) and exhilarated. The establishment of\nproper standards for what counts as evidence is what set the archaeologists\napart from von D\u00e4niken\u2019s wishful fantasies. The experience of that stark\ndifference ended my own interest in UFOs and visiting aliens of any historical\nepoch.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t made me so angry, it might have made me laugh \u2013 and it\u2019s that\ngiggle factor that has been so harmful to the establishment of the true\nscientific study of astrobiology that I work in now. When it comes to SETI, at\nleast, UFOs made the nascent field an easy target for scorn. The first true\nSETI project occurred in 1960, when a young astronomer named Frank Drake used\na radio telescope to search for \u2018non-natural\u2019 signals from two Sun-like stars.\nWhile Drake was looking for an intelligent life that could build technologies\nlike radio transmitters, his project, in attempting to establish evidence for\nlife beyond Earth, was the first true astrobiological experiment ever\nattempted.\n\nRecognising Drake\u2019s effort as the starting point for modern astrobiology is a\nrarely discussed but critical point. It\u2019s also essential to understanding the\nremarkable moment the field stands in now because Drake\u2019s search took that\ncritical idea of standards of evidence seriously. In the design and\napplication of his experiment, Drake and his colleagues paid close attention\nto questions of signals, noise and, most of all, false positives. They\nunderstood that they could be fooled into thinking they\u2019d made a discovery by\nthe data they gathered, and they attempted to prepare and protect themselves\nfrom that possibility. Drake\u2019s SETI project and those that followed always\nattracted enormous popular attention. But building the field into a coherent,\nsustained scientific enterprise proved difficult, and it is here that UFOs got\nin the way.\n\nIn SETI\u2019s heady first decades, a number of government science agencies had a\nhealthy interest in the search for life, intelligent or otherwise. It was the\nUS National Academy of Sciences that hosted an Interstellar Communications\nmeeting where the Drake equation was born. And NASA was keen to go microbe\nhunting on the other planets in our solar system if they could be reached. As\nthe 1960s turned into the \u201970s, SETI scientists also worked with NASA in ways\nthat went beyond radio astronomy, helping plan new telescope technologies for\nhunting exoplanets. There was even consideration of Project Cyclops, a massive\narray of a thousand radio telescopes sensitive enough to find unprecedentedly\nfaint signals of intelligent life among the stars.\n\nIn all these projects, the scientists involved had to face the challenging\ntask of understanding how to gather and evaluate evidence while simultaneously\nfacing profound uncertainties concerning the target of that evidence.\nResearchers were well aware that, while we must begin with life as we know it\n(that is, Earth life), nature might have other ideas. Life, intelligent or\notherwise, originating on a different world could follow entirely different\ntrajectories. Though the field was nascent, astrobiology researchers made slow\nbut steady progress in mapping out how to rigorously gather and evaluate data\nthat would be relevant to the very open question of how life beyond our world\nmight make its appearance.\n\nThe public political flogging of SETI as wasteful kookiness, with an implicit\nlink to UFO kookiness, had begun\n\nThen the politics and the UFOs showed up.\n\nWilliam Proxmire was a senator from Wisconsin who liked to think of himself as\na fiscal hawk. He took it upon himself to bestow his Golden Fleece Award on\nanything he considered a waste of US tax dollars. Since the science projects\nhe targeted got only meagre amounts of funding, Proxmire\u2019s award was basically\nclever politics aimed at targets who couldn\u2019t fight back. In 1978, NASA\u2019s\nsmall portfolio of SETI funding fell into Proxmire\u2019s crosshairs. He gave SETI\nthe Golden Fleece Award and, being a powerful and influential senator, got his\ncolleagues to keep the agency from providing any new funding. Proxmire only\nrelented after Sagan, by then a well-respected public scientist, publicly\nintervened, meeting personally with the senator to discuss the issue. While\nthe ban on SETI funding was eventually lifted in 1983, the public political\nflogging of SETI as wasteful kookiness, with an implicit link to UFO\nkookiness, had begun.\n\nNASA\u2019s SETI funding remained minuscule in the post-Proxmire period, but it was\nstill a target. In 1990, NASA tried to ramp up its SETI funding, from $4\nmillion to $12 million, for a new search in the microwave region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. While this is less than chump change in the federal\nbudget, some politicians once again smelled blood. Making the link to UFOs\nexplicit, the congressman Silvio Conte of Massachusetts tried to kill the\nfunding, claiming \u2018we don\u2019t need to spend $6 million this year to find\nevidence of these rascally creatures. We only need 75 cents to buy a tabloid\nat the local supermarket.\u2019\n\nThe same game played out again a few years later. In 1993, those $12 million\nwere finally allocated for the new search. Not wanting to attract more\ncongressional attention, the project was stealthily called the High Resolution\nMicrowave Survey. Unfortunately, the senator Richard Bryan from Nevada caught\nwind of the effort and saw it as an easy chance to make some headlines. He\nsponsored an amendment killing the project, announcing that would be \u2018the end\nof Martian hunting season at the taxpayer\u2019s expense\u2019. Of course, Bryan knew\nNASA wasn\u2019t planning on turning their telescopes towards Mars, but who cared?\nHis quip made for great copy and linked SETI to the cultural fringes where UFO\nenthusiasm lived. What became known as the \u2018giggle factor\u2019 had killed the\nsearch for life in the Universe again.\n\nIn the wake of these very public whippings, NASA learned the lesson that SETI\nwas political poison. While SETI scientists such as Drake and the unstoppable\nJill Tarter did their best to show that the field lived within those necessary\nscientific standards of evidence, the damage was done. While the agency did\nwhat it could in the decades that followed, it became an accepted truth among\nresearchers that federal support was going to be hard to come by. SETI\nscientists soldiered on, raising private money where they could. But, for all\nintents and purposes, it was running on fumes. The giggle factor had won.\n\nChoking off SETI funding had important consequences for the search for life in\nthe Universe because, basically, it meant there was no search for life in the\nUniverse. Using big telescopes costs big money. If there was no funding for\nSETI, then no telescope time would be granted for SETI. The political\ntemperament that held sway for so long means our sky has effectively remained\nunexplored. We simply have not looked.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to deny the role UFOs had in the development of this history.\nAs the historian Stephen Garber put it in an article about SETI and NASA, the\nfield \u2018had always suffered from a \u201cgiggle factor\u201d that derived from its\nassociation in the popular press with searchers for \u201clittle green men\u201d and\nunidentified flying objects\u2019. Because of this association, astronomers never\ngot the chance to get a real search started.\n\nIn the early 1990s, it did seem that no one was very interested in the\nscientific possibilities for life beyond Earth. NASA\u2019s 1976 Viking landers\nconducted biology experiments on Mars that appeared to close the door on the\nRed Planet as a home for even microbial life. The trail for life of any kind\nseemed to have gone cold.\n\nThen, in the mid-1990s, everything changed.\n\nIn 1995, scientists announced that they had discovered the first planet\norbiting another star \u2013 an exoplanet. It was an epoch-making moment. After\n2,500 years of arguing about the existence of other worlds, we\u2019d finally\nproven that the planets in our solar system were not a rarity. Soon,\nexoplanets were being discovered across the sky. Now we know that pretty much\nevery star you see at night hosts a family of worlds. The next big change came\nwhen scientists found a chunk of Mars in Antarctica. The meteorite blown off\nthe red planet (from an ancient asteroid impact) appeared to have signs of\nfossil life. While that conclusion is no longer accepted, at the time it drove\npresident Bill Clinton to direct NASA to go back to Mars and look for life.\nBetween the discovery of exoplanets and the possibilities of ancient life on\nMars, NASA got into astrobiology in a big way. Funding for new research opened\nup, allowing new and exciting ideas to be proposed and pursued.\n\nRemarkably, when it comes to exoplanets, we are now also able to see exactly\nwhich planets are in their star\u2019s habitable zone, where liquid water (the key,\nwe believe, for life) can exist. That means we know exactly where to look in\nour search for life (something Drake could only dream of).\n\nEven more remarkably, astronomers have learned how to look for alien life on\nalien worlds using starlight that\u2019s traversed the world\u2019s atmosphere and is\nthen absorbed by a variety of chemicals on the surface. This means we can\nsearch for biosignatures \u2013 signatures of chemicals that could be in a planets\u2019\natmosphere only because life has put it there.\n\nAn open investigation of UAPs could offer a masterclass in how science goes\nabout its business of knowing\n\nSpectacular advances in the hunt for biosignatures have meant a profound\nrefinement in the all-important standards of evidence. The earliest version of\na biosignature was the presence of oxygen in an alien atmosphere. On Earth,\noxygen is a significant atmospheric constituent only because photosynthetic\norganisms keep it there. Over the past decade, however, astronomers have\ndiscovered key mechanisms through which planets without life might generate\noxygen-rich air. This was a crucial step in developing methods for evaluating\nfalse positives \u2013 the ways we think we\u2019ve gained evidence for life but are, in\nfact, being fooled. Sophisticated statistical methods for evaluating false\npositives, as well as other challenges astrobiological evidence will present,\nare now a robust part of biosignature science.\n\nAll these new discoveries and new methods are transforming what we think of as\nSETI too. A new research field is rising that scientists are calling\ntechnosignatures, which embraces the \u2018classic\u2019 efforts of SETI while taking\nthe search for intelligent life into new forms and new directions. (Some\nscientists still use SETI to refer to the field and that\u2019s OK. But for many,\nincluding myself, \u2018technosignatures\u2019 correctly captures all that is changing\nin the field.) Rather than planning for someone to set up a beacon announcing\ntheir presence (one premise of the first generation of SETI), we can now look\ndirectly at the planets where those civilisations might be just going about\ntheir business of \u2018civilisation-ing\u2019. By searching for signatures of an alien\nsociety\u2019s day-to-day activities (a technosignature), we\u2019re building entirely\nnew toolkits to find intelligent, civilisation-building life.\n\nIt was in 2019 that NASA awarded me and my colleagues the first grant to study\natmospheric technosignatures. While there are still only a handful of\ntechnosignature grants compared with biosignature studies, it was the first\nindication that the giggle factor was finally waning. Since then, our group\nhas worked hard to provide new examples of possible technosignatures including\nsome that might be searched for with the James Webb Space Telescope. We\u2019ve\nalso demonstrated that there is no reason to suppose that biosignatures will\nbe more common than technosignatures. Since the exact same techniques are\nrequired to search for both bio- and technosignatures, there\u2019s every reason to\ncarry out both kinds of search at the same time.\n\nAnd those standards of evidence developed for biosignature searches will be\njust as relevant for technosignature work. Our group, led by the\nastrophysicist Manasvi Lingam from the Florida Institute of Technology,\nrecently published the first work attempting to lay out a framework for\nevaluating false positives in technosignatures. While there is enormous work\nahead of us, it\u2019s projects like these that will allow us to fully understand\nthe confidence we can ascribe to any claim of an intelligent-life detection.\n\nWith the giggle factor receding for the scientific search for life, where does\nthat leave UFOs and UAPs? There, the waters remain muddied. It is a good thing\nthat pilots feel they can report sightings without fear of reprisal as a\nmatter of air safety and national defence. And an open, transparent and\nagnostic investigation of UAPs could offer a masterclass in how science goes\nabout its business of knowing rather than just believing. In The Little Book\nof Aliens, I even explained how such an investigation might be conducted (the\nrecent NASA UAP panel and the Galileo Project are exploring these kinds of\noptions). But if my colleagues and I claimed we\u2019d found life on another world,\nwe\u2019d be required to provide evidence that meets the highest scientific\nstandards. While we should let future studies lead us where they may, there is\nsimply no such evidence surrounding UFOs and UAPs that meets these standards\ntoday. In fact, at a recent hearing conducted by NASA\u2019s UAP panel, it was\nrevealed that government studies show only a small percentage of reported\nsightings failed to find a reasonable explanation. Many of the remaining cases\ndid not have enough data to even begin an attempt at identification. The sky\nis simply not awash in unexplained phenomena.\n\nIn the end, what matters is that, after thousands of years of arguing over\nopinions about life in the Universe, our collective scientific efforts have\ntaken us to the point where we can finally begin a true scientific study of\nthe question. The next big space telescope NASA is planning will be called the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory. The name tells you all you need to know. We\u2019re\ngoing all in on the search for life in the Universe because we finally have\nthe capabilities to search for life in the Universe. The giggle factor is\nfinally history.\n\nAstronomySpace explorationHistory of science\n\n30 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHistory of ideas\n\nReimagining balance\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a new sense of balance fundamentally altered our\nunderstanding of nature and society\n\nJoel Kaye\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHome\n\nReturn of the descendants\n\nI migrated to my ancestral homeland in a search for identity.
