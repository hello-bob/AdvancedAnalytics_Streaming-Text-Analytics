This release was\nput up on GitHub by Kevin Bentley, one of the original developers.\n\nIt has a bit of an interesting history as it was originally ported to Linux\nway back in 2000 from Loki Entertainment, which didn't age particularly well.\nThen much later in 2020 developer Ryan \"Icculus\" Gordon did a re-port with\nvarious upgrades.\n\nFrom the GitHub:\n\n> This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the\n> '1.5' patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley wrote several years ago. At\n> the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n>\n> Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped\n> out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make\n> a converter so the old cutscenes work. It'll take some effort to stub out\n> that code so it compiles.\n>\n> The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally\n> some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to\n> remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by\n> a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less\n> experienced back then.\n>\n> If you're interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message.\n> Otherwise, I'm happy to take pull requests.\n>\n> This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures\n> playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a\n> 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!\n>\n> Thanks to Jeff Slutter, who did most of the work modernizing the code from\n> the 90's. I'm looking forward to seeing what the community does with it!\n\nArticle taken from GamingOnLinux.com.\n\nTags: Native Linux, Action, FPS, Open Source, Retro | Apps: Descent 3\n\n11 Likes\n\nShare\n\nAbout the author - Liam Dawe\n\nI am the owner of GamingOnLinux.

No one is going to reuse the code for anything, at\nleast I don't think so, but It'll help the games come back alive.\n\nLast edited by NathanaelKStottlemyer on 16 April 2024 at 12:43 pm UTC\n\n1 Likes, Who?\n\nGamall 1 hour ago\n\n  * Link\n\nView PC info\n\n  * New User\n\n  * YouTube\n\n> Quoting: NathanaelKStottlemyerDon't mean to be rude, but only Decent3?
