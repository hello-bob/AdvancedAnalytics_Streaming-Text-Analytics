This is very true! At the same time, many of the problems seem to\nhave mutated into unbelievable chimeras as they made their way around the\ndiscourse. Today, for example, much of the literary internet was debating a\nclaim that 50% of books published sell fewer than 12 books.\n\nApril Henry @aprilhenrybooks\n\nOMG In the Penguin Random House/S&S antitrust trial it was revealed that out\nof 58,000 trade titles published per year, half of those titles sell fewer\nthan one dozen books. LESS THAN ONE DOZEN.\n\n1:04 AM \u2219 Sep 4, 2022\n\n23,929Likes3,541Retweets\n\nThis claim took off with the usual suspects\u2014conservative pundits claiming\npublishing is too \u201cwoke\u201d and self-publishing evangelicals saying every author\nwould make a fortune if they ditched traditional publishing\u2014but the publishing\nprofessionals I know said this claim is very fishy. (I\u2019m pretty sure\npublishers would go out of business if 50% of their books sold less than 12\ncopies!) So this statistic isn\u2019t true. Or at least it isn\u2019t true in the way\nyou might think.\n\nBut publishing statistics are often not what you think. This extreme 12 copies\nclaim joins a couple others that have gone around the internet recently: \u201c98\npercent of books sell fewer than 5,000 copies.\u201d \u201c90 percent sell fewer than\n2,000 copies\u201d \u201cMost books sell fewer than 99 copies.\u201d Etc.\n\nAre all of these true? None of them? Part of the problem with evaluating\nclaims of \u201cmost published books sell [X] copies\u201d is that it\u2014[apologies for the\nDerrida voice]\u2014it all depends on what you mean by \u201cbook,\u201d \u201cpublished,\u201d and\n\u201csell.\u201d No, I\u2019m not playing postmodern games here. It really is confusing.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201ca book\u201d?\n\nThe Platonic ideal of a book might be a collection of text printed on a few\nhundred paper pages. But the term encompasses much more than that, including\nbooks that have almost no text at all (for example the \u201cadult coloring book\u201d\ncraze of the 2010s). Publishers publish novels and memoirs as well as\ncookbooks, puzzle books, Mad Libs, etc. But it\u2019s even more confusing than this\nwhen it comes to those statistics.\n\nLast year, Orbit published my debut novel The Body Scout. I wrote one novel,\nso published one book. Right? Not exactly. From a sales tracking perspective,\nbooks are published in multiple formats, each with different ISBNs. I wrote\none novel, but from a title count POV I actually published 4 books: hardcover,\npaperback, ebook, and audiobook. Other books have even more formats (mass\nmarket version, movie tie-in editions, etc.) and because they all have\ndifferent ISBNs, they all have different sales figures.\n\nWhen it comes to classics that are in the public domain, like Pride and\nPrejudice or Shakespeare, there can be literally hundreds of editions in\nexistence (put out by various publishers) each of which could be counted\nseparately.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201cpublished\u201d?\n\nA published book can refer to a newly written and released book\u2014aka frontlist,\nor a novel published for the first time in 2022\u2014or it can refer to anything a\npublisher puts out in a given year, including a reissue of an existing book.\nBut sometimes \u201cpublished\u201d means any book that exists in any format available\nfor purchase. A hundred-year-old novel that no longer can be found bookstore\nshelves yet sits in cardboard box in the back of a warehouse somewhere is \u201ca\npublished book.\u201d Some books are never published in print at all and exist only\nas ebooks and/or audiobooks. And many books exist in \u201cprint on demand\u201d form in\nwhich a physical copy doesn\u2019t exist until someone purchases it. In the old\ndays, books would go out of print when people stopped buying them. But in the\nmodern digital age books can exist \u201cin print\u201d for forever.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out here that publishers range from tiny micropresses\nrun as a hobby in someone\u2019s garage to multi-billion dollar companies. If\nyou\u2019re counting books by ISBNs, this would also include many self-published\nbooks.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201ca sale\u201d?\n\nWhen people reference book sales, they\u2019re typically talking using NPD Group\u2019s\nBookScan numbers. Think of BookScan as the book industry version of Nielsen TV\nratings. Briefly, BookScan is a \u201cpoint of sale\u201d tracking system that counts\nthe number of print copies sold at participating retail locations. BookScan\nallegedly tracks about 75% of retail sales including lots of indie bookstores\nas well as Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nIt\u2019s a fine tool for what it is, but from a data perspective it\u2019s only\npartial. I already mentioned the issue with multiple formats above. BookScan\nalso only tracks print so doesn\u2019t include audiobooks or ebooks. (There is a\nNielsen ebook estimator, but it\u2019s rarely included in these statistics. And\nebook sales are tricky since prices fluctuate wildly.) Even restricting\nourselves to print books, BookScan misses plenty. Sales to libraries, for\nexample, can be a significant portion of a book\u2019s sales. Many small press and\nself-published authors might sell directly via an author\u2019s website or in-\nperson events. And so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are dramatic differences between 1) lifetime sales, 2)\nsales in the first 12 months after publication, and 3) sales in any random\ncalendar year. Most books sell most of their copies in the first year or two\nafter publication. Some books are perennial sellers and others might break out\nlater\u2014e.g., when there is a TV or film adaptation\u2014but most sell the bulk of\ntheir copies early. Any statistic based on 3) is going to give you a\ncompletely inaccurate impression of what a book has sold. Imagine a 1998 novel\nthat sold 6,000 its first year and 10,000 copies to date. It might sell only\n12 copies in 2022, decades later, but that hardly means it was a failure.\n\nOkay, so what does all the above mean? Mostly it means these statistics are\ncompletely meaningless unless we know what\u2019s being included. Are you counting\nlifetime sales or one year\u2019s sales? One year\u2019s sales for frontlist titles or\nbacklist titles? Only Big 5 books or anything with an ISBN?\n\nTake the statistic that most published books only sell 99 copies. This seems\nshocking on its face. But if you dig into it, you\u2019ll notice it was counting\none year\u2019s sales of all books that were in BookScan\u2019s system. That\u2019s quite\ndifferent statistic than saying most books don\u2019t sell 100 copies in total! A\nbook could easily be a bestseller in, say, 1960 and sell only a trickle of\ncopies today. In the same way, most old movies and albums aren\u2019t frequently\nwatched/listened to in 2022. It\u2019s only a small percentage of past works that\nremain popular. Most backlist books selling fewer than 99 copies doesn\u2019t tell\nyou anything about how much newly released books sell.\n\n(If you\u2019re wondering\u2014as people did on Twitter\u2014why publishers keep books in\nprint that don\u2019t sell, remember that a book being in print doesn\u2019t mean a\npublisher is actively spending lots of money on the title. It doesn\u2019t break\nthe bank to keep one box in the corner of a warehouse. And as I noted above a\nbook can be \u201cin print\u201d these days and exist only in a digital form or awaiting\n\u201cprint on demand.\u201d)\n\nIn terms of the dozen copies statistic, I can\u2019t evaluate it because it is\nunclear what it\u2019s referring to. Fifty-eight thousand books is more books than\nPRH publishes in a given year, but far less than their entire backlist. Is 58k\nall new books published with an ISBN, including self-published books? Is it\nsomething else? I really don\u2019t know and none of the publishing professionals I\nfollow seem to know either. (Editing to add: Jane Friedman, who posted this\nnumber originally on Instagram, noted there was no source given in testimony.\nFriedman gives her own guess in the comments.)\n\nIn my experience, and with the data I\u2019ve seen, most traditionally published\nnovels that you see on bookstore shelves or reviewed in newspapers sell\nseveral hundred to a few thousand copies across formats. Many sell much more\nof course. I\u2019ve seen some flops that sold only a couple hundred. And of course\nnot all traditionally published novels appear in bookstores or reviewed in\nnewspapers. Is it possible someone has published a Big 5 novel that sold only\n12 copies over its lifetime? I suppose. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 5% much less\n50%!\n\nThen again, I\u2019m talking about novels published by established presses that\nappear in bookstores. How many copies do self-published poetry chapbooks sell?\nPrint on demand public domain classics? Backlist sudoku puzzle books? I\ncouldn\u2019t begin to guess.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s true is publishing works on a blockbuster model. Most books\nsell relatively few copies and a handful sell millions. The statistics about\nthe vast majority of traditionally published books selling fewer than five\nthousand are likely true. It\u2019s the bestsellers that keep the industry afloat,\nfinancially. And it\u2019s true that publishers often have no idea what will sell.\nIt\u2019s a throw-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks industry. Are there are lot\nof problems with it? A lot of things that could be fixed? Ways that publishers\ncould better market the backlist or frontlist? Yes! But it\u2019s not quite as dire\nas some of these statistics suggest.\n\nUPDATE: Kristen McLean from BookScan very nicely provided data in the comments\nso please look below from some illuminating if depressing data!\n\nAs always, if you like this newsletter, please consider subscribing or\nchecking out my recently released science fiction novel The Body Scout, which\nThe New York Times called \u201cTimeless and original...a wild ride, sad and funny,\nsurreal and intelligent\u201d and Boing Boing declared \u201ca modern cyberpunk\nmasterpiece.\u201d\n\nNow in paperback!\n\nCounter Craft is a reader-supported publication.

I thought I\nwould chime in with some numbers here, since that statistic from the DOJ is\nsuper-misleading, and I'm not sure where it originally came from, since we did\nnot provide it directly.It is possible it came from our data, and was provided\nby one of the publisher parties, but based on the 58,000 figure, it's not\nobvious what exactly it includes in terms of \"publisher frontlist\". 58,000\ntitles is way too small a number for \"all frontlist books published in a year\nby every publisher\"--that's more like 487,000 frontlist titles--so it's clear\nit's a slice but I'm not sure HOW it was sliced.NPD BookScan (BookScan is\nowned by The NPD Group, not Nielsen, BTW), collects data on print book sales\nfrom 16,000 retail locations, including Amazon print book sales. Included in\nthose numbers are any print book sales from self-publishing platforms where\nthe author has opted for extended distribution and a print book was sold by\nAmazon or another retailer. So that 487K \"new book\" figure is all frontlist\nbooks in our data showing at least 1 unit sale over the last 52 weeks coming\nfrom publishers of all sizes, including individuals.Lots of press outlets have\nbeen calling about it today, so I did a little digging to see if I could\nreverse-engineer the citation, and am happy to share our numbers here for\nclarity.Because this is clearly a slice, and most likely provided by one of\nthe parties to the suit, I decided to limit my data to the frontlist sales for\nthe top 10 publishers by unit volume in the U.S. Trade market. My ISBN list is\na little smaller than the one quoted in the DOJ, but the principals will be\nthe same.The data below includes frontlist titles from Penguin Random House,\nSimon & Schuster, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Scholastic, Disney,\nMacmillan, Abrams, Sourcebooks, and John Wiley. The figures below only include\nbooks published by these publishers themselves, not pubishers they\ndistribute.Here is what I found. Collectively, 45,571 unique ISBNs appear for\nthese publishers in our frontlist sales data for the last 52 weeks (thru week\nending 8-24-2022).In this dataset:>>>0.4% or 163 books sold 100,000 copies or\nmore>>>0.7% or 320 books sold between 50,000-99,999 copies>>>2.2% or 1,015\nbooks sold between 20,000-49,999 copies>>>3.4% or 1,572 books sold between\n10,000-19,999 copies>>>5.5% or 2,518 books sold between 5,000-9,999\ncopies>>>21.6% or 9,863 books sold between 1,000-4,999 copies>>>51.4% or\n23,419 sold between 12-999 copies>>>14.7% or 6,701 books sold under 12\ncopiesSo, only about 15% of all of those publisher-produced frontlist books\nsold less than 12 copies. That's not nothing, but nowhere as janky as what has\nbeen reported.BUT, I think the real story is that roughly 66% of those books\nfrom the top 10 publishers sold less than 1,000 copies over 52 weeks. (Those\nlast two points combined)And less than 2% sold more than 50,000 copies. (The\ntop two points)Now data is a funny thing. It can be sliced and diced to create\ndifferent types of views. For instance we could run the same analysis on ALL\nof those 487K new books published in the last 52 weeks, which includes many\nsmall press and independetly published titles, and we would find that about\n98% of them sold less that 5,000 copies in the \"trade bookstore market\" that\nNPD BookScan covers. (I know this IS a true statistic because that data was\nproduced by us for The New York Times.)But that data does not include direct\nsales from publishers. It does not include sales by authors at events, or\nthrough their websites. It does not include eBook sales which we track in a\nseparate tool, and it doesn't include any of the amazing reading going on\nthrough platforms like Substack, Wattpad, Webtoons, Kindle Direct, or library\nlending platforms like OverDrive or Hoopla.BUT, it does represent the general\nreality of the ECONOMICS of the publishing market. In general, most of the\nrevenue that keeps publishers in business comes from the very narrow band of\npublishing successes in the top 8-10% of new books, along with the 70% of\noverall sales that come from BACKLIST books in the current market. (Backlist\nbooks have gained about 4% in share from frontlist books since the pandemic\nbegan, but that is a whole other story.)The long and short of it is publishing\nis very much a gambler's game, and I think that has been clear from the\ntestimony in the DOJ case. It is true that most people in publishing up to and\nincluding the CEOs cannot tell you for sure what books are going to make their\nyear. The big advantage that publisher consolidation has brought to the top of\nthe market is deeper pockets and more resources to roll those dice. More money\nto get a hot project. More money to influence outcomes through marketing, more\naccess to sales and distribution mechanisms, and easier access to the\ngatekeepers who decide what books make it onto retailers' shelves. And better\nability to distribute risk across a bigger list of gambles.It is largely a\nnumbers game and I'm not just saying that because I'm a numbers gal. It's a\ntough business.Hope this is helpful.If anyone has questions, they are welcome\nto reach out to me directly at kristen.mclean@npd.com.Expand full commentLike\n(119)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n25 replies by Lincoln Michel and others\n\nJane FriedmanSinister Malefactor of Pangloss...Sep 5, 2022Liked by Lincoln\nMichelMy reading of this statistic\u2014a version of which surfaces from time to\ntime, as you note in the opening\u2014is that it's counting (1) new titles\nrequiring an ISBN, which can include re-issues or new formats or POD editions,\nand (2) what those sales were during the year of release or first year of\nsales. It's also including many, many different types of publishers which may\nor may not sell in the bookstore market. That latter part, I think, is the\nbiggest factor in why a book may look like a poor seller when it isn't.On the\nother hand, traditionally published authors tend to highly value bookstore\nsales, as we saw recently with the B&N policy change. So in that regard, I\nthink it's a helpful reminder that print bookstore sales may not drive a\nbook's success and a lot depends on the publisher and category of book.Expand\nfull commentLike (15)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n51 more comments...\n\nYes, Metaphors Should Actually Make Sense\n\nA little rant against metaphors as mere vehicle for vibes\n\nMay 27, 2023 \u2022\n\nLincoln Michel\n\n118\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Yes, Metaphors Should Actually Make Sense\n\ncountercraft.substack.com\n\n25\n\nThe First and Best Writing Advice I Ever Received\n\nFinish things.
