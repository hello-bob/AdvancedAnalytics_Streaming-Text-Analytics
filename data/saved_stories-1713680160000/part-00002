But its amped-up AI agents are\nconfusing Facebook users\n\nAI-generated models could bring more diversity to the fashion industry \u2014 or\nleave it with less\n\nA congressman wanted to understand AI. So he went back to a college classroom\nto learn\n\nKaffa Roastery\u2019s managing director and founder Svante Hampf told The\nAssociated Press on Saturday that the two partners wanted to trial how AI and\nits different tools could be of help in coffee roasting, a traditional artisan\nprofession highly valued in Finland.\n\n\u201cWe basically gave descriptions of all our coffee types and their flavors to\nAI and instructed it to create a new exciting blend,\u201d said Hampf, while\nshowcasing \u201cAI-conic\u201d at the Helsinki Coffee Festival that annually brings\ntogether roasteries and coffee aficionados.\n\nIn addition to coming up with its chosen mixture of beans from Brazil,\nColombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala, AI created the coffee package label and a\ndetailed taste description saying \u201cAI-conic\u201d is \u201ca well balanced blend of\nsweetness and ripe fruit.\u201d\n\nHampf acknowledged he was surprised that AI \u201csomewhat weirdly\u201d chose to make\nthe blend out of four different type of coffee beans, rather than the usual\ntwo or three which allows distinction in taste between flavors from different\norigins.\n\nAfter the first test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa\u2019s coffee experts\nagreed, however, that the tech-assisted blend was perfect, and there was no\nneed for human adjustments.\n\nAccording to Elev\u2019s spokesman Antti Merilehto \u201cAI-conic is a tangible example\nof how AI can introduce new perspectives to seasoned professionals\u201d while\noffering coffee lovers new taste experiences.\n\nKaffa Roastery hopes the trial serves as an opener of dialogue between coffee\nprofessionals of things to come in the future in Finland, a nation that has\nboth a strong coffee culture and a passion for technology with a flourishing\nstartup scene.\n\n\u201cThis (trial) was the first step in seeing how AI could help us in the\nfuture,\u201d Hampf said, adding the project brought smoothly together \u201cthe artisan\nskills of a roastery\u201d and AI-provided data. \u201cI think AI has plenty to offer us\nin the long run. We are particularly impressed of the coffee taste\ndescriptions it created.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
