My brain can\u2019t tell the apps apart at a glance.\n\nOnce I noticed just how many app logos have white-on-black color schemes \u2014\nincluding Threads, the BBC, Uber, Apple TV, and, yup, The Washington Post \u2014 I\nhad to know what the heck was going on.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with, you know, colors?\n\nOther apps \u2014 including the New York Times, the RealReal shopping app and the\ndating app Hinge \u2014 take the opposite tack with black text on a white\nbackground.\n\n(Actually, the Times says its logo colors have slightly reduced contrast like\nnewsprint and are \u201c93 percent black and 95 percent white.\u201d)\n\nMy investigation into the black-and-white mystery has a serious side.\nSmartphones and apps are important cultural markers, and their evolving\ndesigns reflect our collective moment and mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nJudging by all the black-heavy logos, we live in the land of brooding goth\napps. Put on your eyeliner and Doc Martens boots \u2014 and get into it.\n\n###\n\nThe art and science of logo colors\n\nThere\u2019s a perhaps apocryphal theory that the color red makes people feel\nhungry and that\u2019s why some food companies such as McDonald\u2019s have red in their\nlogos.\n\nSnapchat created its app logo with a \u201cjoyful and happy\u201d yellow because no\npopular apps were using that color, a spokeswoman says.\n\nReddit says \u201cbold color usage,\u201d including its red-orange logo, is \u201cintegral\u201d\nto the online message board\u2019s brand.\n\nAs for why black-and-white seems to be the color scheme of the moment, I got\ndizzy from all the theories.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo some companies and design experts, black and white conveys luxury,\nsleekness, calm simplicity \u2014 or the complex spectrum of our lives, as the CEO\nof white-on-black social app BeReal told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Michael Ernst, a brand and product designer who was Yelp\u2019s founding\ndesigner, black-dominant apps reflect bro-ness.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### Shira Ovide\n\n(Patrick Dias for The Washington Post)\n\nTech Friend writer Shira Ovide gives you advice and context to make technology\nwork for you. Sign up for the free Tech Friend newsletter.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\n\u201cMany of the brand identities that incorporate black color schemes tend to\nfeel more masculine,\u201d Ernst said.\n\nBlack-and-white logos can be practical, too.\n\nBlack pairs well with other colors, Ernst said. And the Times said its black\nlogo on a white app background looks good even if your phone is in \u201cdark\u201d mode\nthat changes the screen\u2019s background to permanent black.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDaniel Hallac, chief product officer for Hearst Newspapers, said that as with\nfashion, app design trends can swing from one extreme to another.\n\nFor a while, he said, bright colors were the epitome of app cool, like\nSnapchat\u2019s yellow and Facebook\u2019s bright blue logo. It was perhaps inevitable\nthat the pendulum would swing to colorless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery time you go through a very bold period, the reaction is to\ncounterprogram,\u201d Hallac said. \u201cBright maybe feels 2018.\u201d\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s no single explanation for why so many app logos are black and\nwhite.\n\nThis could be the app version of convergent evolution, which led humans and\nkoalas to each have opposable thumbs. (Look it up!) A bunch of apps\nindependently arrived on black and white.\n\n###\n\nTrying to stand apart, but looking the same\n\nAt least quantitatively, black-and-white apps are not dominant.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOf the 100 most downloaded iPhone apps in the United States last week,\naccording to Sensor Tower, nine have black-and-white logos, including\ne-commerce company Shein, Meta\u2019s Threads and ChatGPT.\n\nThe most prevalent color combination among the top apps appeared to be blue\nand white \u2014 including for Max, Facebook, Venmo, Zoom, LinkedIn and Indeed.\n\nBut these apps are different shades of blue that make them look fairly\ndistinct even at a glance. With black-and-white apps, there\u2019s not much nuance\nto tell apps apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there may not be more black-and-white apps than those of other colors, but\nit might feel that way because they look similar.\n\nEvite\u2019s recently overhauled logo and app ditched a peppy green that the\ndigital stationery company featured for decades for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 black\nand white.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nEvite\u2019s head of creative, Eddie Rhyu, told me that black \u201chas a presence to\nit.\u201d The black-and-white logo also lets people\u2019s colorful digital invitations\nand cards stand out.\n\nRhyu said that unlike the multiple black-heavy exercise apps on my phone,\nthere aren\u2019t many apps with similar color schemes in Evite\u2019s category. \u201cIf I\nwere in the fitness industry, I would think twice\u201d about black and white, Rhyu\nsaid.\n\nAnd there\u2019s an irony if companies that want to stand out with black-and-white\nlogos instead make people confused about which app is which, said Marcie\nCooperman, a color theory expert at the New School\u2019s Parsons School of Design.\n\n\u201cWhen so many brands do it, it turns into a trend,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that, of\ncourse, defeats the purpose.\u201d\n\nRead more: Tatum Hunter spent weeks trying technologies to help find her color\n\u201cseason.\u201d It was a journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nVisual stories\n\nNews explained in charts, maps, photography and videos\n\nPalestinian paramedics said Israel gave them safe passage to save a 6-year-old\ngirl in Gaza.
