For other uses, see\nLarry the Lobster (disambiguation).\n\nLarry the Lobster, and the 900-numbers that could decide his fate\n\nLarry the Lobster was the subject of a comedy sketch by Eddie Murphy that was\naired live on Saturday Night Live on April 10, 1982.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nIn an early example of interactive television, Murphy held Larry, a live\nlobster, aloft and declared that the show's audience would determine whether\nhe lived or died.\n\nMurphy then read two \"900\" phone numbers, one for those who wanted to spare\nLarry, and another for those who wanted to see him cooked. Calls cost $0.50\neach.^[1] Murphy tended to read the number to save Larry very quickly, as\nopposed to his giving the number to cook Larry very slowly and clearly.^[1]\nUpdates on the voting were given by other cast members over the course of the\nepisode, and in the span of 30 minutes, viewers made nearly 500,000 calls,\nsending phone traffic soaring.^[2]\n\nThe heavy phone use stood as a record or near-record for many years.^[3] The\nspike in traffic perplexed AT&T employees, who eventually figured out that the\nprogram was responsible.^[2]\n\nThough the phone network survived the spike, it was sufficiently threatening\nto operations that AT&T established communication with the television networks\nso that they could be warned of potentially disruptive future events; this\nsystem remained in use until at least 2006.^[2]\n\nLarry was initially spared by about 12,000 votes. 239,096 callers voted to\nsave him and 227,452 voted for him to be boiled.^[2]\n\nOn the following week's episode during NewsBreak, however, Eddie Murphy raised\nthe subject of Larry the Lobster again, saying that he had received letters\nprotesting the crustacean's treatment the previous week, including one that\ncontained the racist barb \"that man is sick, and I thought those people didn't\nlike seafood.\"^[4] Murphy then displayed a boiled lobster on a plate,\nannounced that Larry's stay of execution had been revoked, and ate it while\ngiving some to NewsBreak anchors Brian Doyle-Murray and Christine Ebersole.\n\nThe following season, a similar sketch allowed viewers to call one of two\nnumbers to decide whether or not to allow Andy Kaufman to continue appearing\non the show. Several allusions to the Larry the Lobster sketch were made\u2014Mary\nGross at one point said it was \"time to boil the water\"^[5] when she saw that\n\"Dump Andy\" was in the lead.\n\nThis event is cited to this day in discussions of classic comedy routines,^[6]\ncruelty to animals,^[7] and in rosters of famous animals.^[8]^[9]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Sniffy the rat\n  * Marco Evaristti\n  * Cheeseface\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Transcript at TVAcres.com, \"Lobster, Shrimp & Crab\"\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d \"Ms. Gauweiler Guards U.S. Phone Network From 'Idol' Threat,\" Dionne Searcey, The Wall Street Journal, April 27, 2006; Page A1\n  3. ^ \"Thousands ring up 900 each day,\" Mark Lewyn, USA Today, August 29, 1988. p. 04.B\n  4. ^ Watch Saturday Night Live Highlight: Weekend Update: Eddie Murphy on Larry the Lobster's Fate, retrieved 2020-10-28\n  5. ^ Watch Saturday Night Live Highlight: Election III, retrieved 2020-10-28\n  6. ^ Interwebia, February 29, 2012\n  7. ^ \"Cutting Loose the Crustaceans; Whole Foods Stops Selling Live Lobsters\".
