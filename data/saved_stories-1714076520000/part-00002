That classification would open ISPs up to\ngreater oversight by the FCC. The vote is widely expected to go in favor of\nreinstating net neutrality since FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat,\ncontrols the agency\u2019s agenda. Rosenworcel moved forward with the measure after\na fifth commissioner was sworn in, restoring a Democratic majority on the\npanel. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent\ncompany.)\n\nNet neutrality proponents say that oversight can help ensure fair access to an\nopen internet by upholding principles like no blocking or throttling of\ninternet traffic. Opponents, including industry players, fear it could halt\ninnovation and subject ISPs to onerous price regulations.\n\nThe vote is widely expected to go in favor of reinstating net neutrality\n\nHere\u2019s how we got here: the last time the FCC imposed net neutrality rules was\nin 2015, after a long fight and a loud campaign of grassroots support. In\n2017, Trump-appointed FCC Chair Ajit Pai led the successful effort to repeal\nthe rules. President Joe Biden has made clear his intention to bring back net\nneutrality through his competition executive order, but that effort was\ndelayed by a protracted battle over his initial nominee for a commissioner,\nleaving the agency without the votes to bring back the rules until late last\nyear.\n\nThis time around, net neutrality is no longer the biggest tech policy issue on\nmany Americans\u2019 minds. The vote comes just a day after Biden signed a law to\nforce TikTok to separate from its China-based parent company or face a ban and\non the heels of a new comprehensive data privacy proposal backed by two\npowerful sponsors. But net neutrality has remained a goal for many\nprogressives who see it as table stakes for an open internet.\n\nThe rules aren\u2019t substantially different from 2015 \u2014 courts largely upheld the\nframework, so the FCC is sticking to what it\u2019s sure is legal. But the rhetoric\naround the rules has changed. Net neutrality opponents say the lack of fallout\nafter the repeal shows the rules were never needed; advocates argue that state\nlaws kept some of their greatest fears in check in the absence of federal\nrules. The pandemic and current political tensions about foreign adversaries\nhave also tinged how the FCC talks about net neutrality: the agency is\nfocusing on how the rules could give it insight into internet outages, as well\nas authority over national security issues with broadband equipment.\n\nNet neutrality opponents say the lack of fallout after the repeal shows the\nrules were never needed\n\nFor example, Rosenworcel has pointed to what she calls a \u201cloophole\u201d in the\nagency\u2019s authority to limit foreign-controlled broadband providers over\nnational security concerns, even though the agency is able to take action\nagainst other areas of their telecommunications infrastructure. Industry\nopponents see this as a new tactic to reinstate old rules. \u201cThe FCC, realizing\nthat it has lost the argument about blocking or throttling, no anticompetitive\npaid prioritization, has been grasping for new justifications, like saying it\nis now cybersecurity that drives our interest in imposing these ancient laws\nmonitoring the internet,\u201d said Jonathan Spalter, president and CEO of\nbroadband industry group USTelecom.\n\nOpponents fear that reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers will\neventually let the FCC control pricing, which they worry will disincentivize\ninnovation. But the FCC says it will forebear its rate regulation authority as\npart of the proposal. While a future FCC could undo that, according to Public\nKnowledge legal director John Bergmayer, it would take a new lengthy\nregulatory process to do so. \u201cIt puts a speed bump in the way of a future\nFCC,\u201d Bergmayer said. \u201cAnd it sort of signals the intent for what the scope of\nnet neutrality rules are supposed to be.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still not enough to assuage opponents. Spalter conceded that \u201cit\u2019s a\ngood step that the FCC is moving to forbear on rate regulation,\u201d but he also\nadded, \u201cwe need to trust but verify.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n  * The fight for net neutrality is forever\n  * President Joe Biden wanted Gigi Sohn to fix America\u2019s internet \u2014 what went wrong?\n\n\u201cRate regulation is susceptible to all kinds of mission creep and can take\nvarious forms,\u201d said Spalter. He\u2019d prefer Congress take up the underlying\nprinciples of net neutrality to ensure web traffic can\u2019t be blocked or\nthrottled unfairly. He also says that it\u2019s misguided to focus on broadband\ncompanies that made large investments throughout the pandemic to keep\nAmericans connected to the internet.\n\n\u201cIt was just two and a half years ago that we stood together \u2014 the White\nHouse, Congress, industry, consumers \u2014 to move forward toward progress in\nconnecting everyone everywhere,\u201d Spalter said. But there\u2019s \u201cnothing about\nTitle II that advances that shared objective. In fact, it undermines it. And\nfor what? Outside of Big Tech, which isn\u2019t even covered in this rulemaking,\nwhen was the last time you heard about a net neutrality violation?\u201d\n\nIndustry opponents often point to the relatively quiet years of the post-net\nneutrality era as evidence that the most extreme predictions about its repeal\nwere overblown. \u201cThere\u2019s no actual open internet problem,\u201d said Spalter. \u201cAnd\nregulating an industry which is on the cusp of working with our government and\nthe states to bring internet everywhere finally could really jeopardize that\ncritical and bipartisan goal by creating regulatory overhang, disincentivizing\ninvestment.\u201d\n\nBut those in favor of federal net neutrality rules say state laws \u2014 like\nCalifornia\u2019s net neutrality rules \u2014 helped keep the worst behaviors at bay.\n\u201cIf you think that nothing has happened since the FCC retreated from net\nneutrality and are asking yourself what is the big deal, think again. Then\nlook harder,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a speech at the National Press Club last\nyear. \u201cBecause when the FCC stepped back from having these policies in place,\nthe court said states could step in ... So in effect, we have open internet\npolicies that providers are abiding by right now \u2014 they are just coming from\nSacramento and places like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing now that just having free and open broadband networks\nisn\u2019t really the end of the game. There\u2019s lots of other gatekeepers on the\ninternet.\u201d\n\nBergmayer said the fact that there\u2019s less fanfare around this net neutrality\nvote reflects a recognition that net neutrality is just the start of the fight\nfor internet policies. \u201cPeople are realizing now that just having free and\nopen broadband networks isn\u2019t really the end of the game. There\u2019s lots of\nother gatekeepers on the internet,\u201d Bergmayer said. \u201cIt just means that net\nneutrality is not the only fight to have on behalf of consumers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s, of course, possible that a new administration will once again flip the\nswitch, and the political ping-pong could volley right back under a new\nadministration. But Bergmayer hopes for some stability. \u201cI think there\u2019s this\nmisapprehension that people like me, who\u2019ve been working on net neutrality my\nwhole career, that we just love the game. It\u2019s like, no, I love winning,\u201d\nBergmayer said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to winning net neutrality, having those\nrules in place, and then moving on to other stuff.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Biden signs TikTok \u2018ban\u2019 bill into law, starting the clock for ByteDance to divest it\n\n  2. ## What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  3. ## A morning with the Rabbit R1: a fun, funky, unfinished AI gadget\n\n  4. ## Steam will stop issuing refunds if you play two hours of a game before launch day\n\n  5. ## Framework won\u2019t be just a laptop company anymore\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream The fight for net neutrality is forever\n\n  * ### Democrats revive the fight for net neutrality\n\nJul 28, 2022, 7:08 PM UTC\n\n  * ### The court allowed the FCC to kill net neutrality because washing machines can\u2019t make phone calls\n\nOct 4, 2019, 4:45 PM UTC\n\n  * ### California is leading the state-by-state fight for net neutrality\n\nSep 1, 2018, 2:13 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Here\u2019s how companies have flouted net neutrality before and what made them stop\n\nJun 11, 2018, 4:18 PM UTC\n\nSee all 22 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
