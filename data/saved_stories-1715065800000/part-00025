The sad reality is\nthat although the story accurately describes the EU issue, the GDPR kerfuffle\namounts to barely a rounding error when it comes to generative AI (genAI) and\nhow it is obliterating all compliance rules \u2014 especially those involving\nprivacy.\n\nEnterprise IT leaders have never had an especially strong mastery of IT\nvisibility for apps, data and tools. But the instant a company welcomes genIA\ntools into its environment \u2014 an event that for most enterprises happened last\nyear \u2014 they can kiss any beliefs that they still control their assets good-\nbye. And without comprehensive data control and strong data visibility,\nregulatory compliance is impossible.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the GDPR situation. As CIO.com explained it: \u201cThe EU\u2019s strict\nprivacy rules require that companies allow individuals access to personal\ninformation held about them, as well as ensuring that such data is accurate.\nThis requires a long audit trail to every piece of information stored about\nEuropean citizens. When it comes to AI-generated content, such trails often go\ncold. With regard to information generated by ChatGPT, (the entity suing)\nalleges there is no legal redress for so-called hallucinations when it comes\nto personal information.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, but hallucinations are just the most obvious examples. The part\nof GDPR at issue here is the Right To Be Forgotten. If an EU citizen (5\nmillion of whom live in the US) officially asks for something personal about\nthem to be removed, companies are supposed to comply.\n\nLong before genAI, including the large language models that underpin it,\nbecame popularized, enterprise IT teams were already struggling to comply with\nsuch rules. The usual culprits for enterprise IT visibility issues are cloud,\nIoT, mobile, third-parties, remote sites including home offices and all manner\nof Shadow IT.\n\nThe Right To Be Forgotten is simply not compatible with how modern enterprises\nfunction, especially in the United States. Let\u2019s consider a typical scenario:\nyou\u2019re an analyst working for the marketing department and trying to make\nsense of some unusual customer patterns. It\u2019s getting late, so you decide to\nfinish number-crunching at home. So you back up the data to a personal cloud\naccount for easy access at home later when you resume working.\n\nThe next morning, on the train heading to the office, you remember something\nyou wanted to try with the data. You access that cloud folder on your phone,\ndo a little more analysis and then save the files.\n\nWhen you get back to your desk, you download that file to your work desktop\nmachine and continue working on the latest files.\n\nThink of the ways that data can go astray and be out of reach for IT. Your\nhome computer uses a consumer-grade backup service, and overnight, those files\nwere copied to that service. That consumer-grade backup service has its own\noffsite backup mechanisms, along with a separate disaster recovery service.\nThat file with sensitive PII about customers is now in all those locations.\n\nThat sensitive data was also on your phone. That data also gets automatically\nbacked up to that handset manufacturer, which also has its own backup and\ndisaster recover arrangements.\n\nTwo days later, an EU citizen (who happens to be one of your customers)\nsubmits a right to be forgotten request and your team eventually learns of it.\nThey delete the references they can locate on key enterprise systems,\nincluding a half-dozen corporate cloud environments they know about.\n\nBut what about all of those other locations?\n\nThat example involves just an employee trying to get work done. Let\u2019s try one\nwith a customer or a prospect. One of your senior sales representatives is\nworking with another company on $1 billion sales deal. They start discussing\nsensitive contract points in text threads between them and will likely also\nreview preliminary contract drafts.\n\nOnce the draft gets to a late stage, it goes to the legal department and\neverything is hopefully captured. But what about all of those text discussions\nbetween two personal smartphones? Compliance is not only about regulatory\nissues. What if the deal later goes bad and there is litigation? The opposing\ncounsel will seek discovery, including all discussions about contract terms.\nAre you even remotely able to fully comply? (I\u2019ll save you time: No, there is\nno way you can fully comply.)\n\nThat was all true back in 2019. In 2020, the pandemic hit and cloud and remote\nactivity soared. In 2023, genAI tools \u2014 which had been around in various forms\nsince the 1960s \u2014 grabbed headlines and was suddenly on the must-have list of\nevery enterprise board member. The less about AI decision-makers knew, the\nmore they wanted genAI.\n\nFull data visibility was difficult in 2019, virtually impossible in 2020, and\nnow, with genAI cropping up in just about every division and working group,\nit\u2019s crossed the line into fully impossible\n\nWhy does it so fully obliterate data control? There are five relevant\nelements, all distinct, :\n\n  1. What enterprise data can genAI access?\n  2. Who (among employees, contractors, customers and anyone with any level of privileged access) can access that data? Is there some attempt, any attempt, to limit who can access what segments of that data?\n  3. How was the genAI system trained? What information did it examine to answer queries? Did any of that training information include data about EU citizens? (Yes, EU data was almost certainly within the training set.)\n  4. Is the genAI training on new data you share? Will it try and learn from your queries and potentially share that information with competitors?\n  5. What about the massive databases behind genAI tools. Can enterprises that license that system review the database? Can they delete details from it? If not \u2014 and the answer will almost always be \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 how is GDPR compliance even possible? How is any compliance possible?\n\nWith arrival of genAI virtually everywhere, the compliance genie is already\nout of the bottle.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### A phish by any other name should still not be clicked\n\nBy Evan Schuman\n\nApr 05, 2024 6 mins\n\nTechnology Industry Communications Security Industry\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### McDonald's serves up a master class in how not to explain a system outage\n\nWhen McDonald's in March suffered a global outage preventing it from accepting\npayments, it issued a lengthy statement about the incident that was vague,\nmisleading and yet still allowed many of the technical details to be figured\nout.\n\nBy Evan Schuman\n\nApr 01, 2024 7 mins\n\nMobile Payment Data Center Industry\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### Why are CIOs who anticipate the future rarely allowed to do anything\nabout it?\n\nWall Street\u2019s obsession with quarterly earnings has made it extraordinarily\ndifficult for most enterprises to spend on long-term investments, or even mid-\nterm investments.\n\nBy Evan Schuman\n\nMar 08, 2024 5 mins\n\nIT Director IT Strategy IT Leadership\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### The food delivery driver identification dilemma\n\nEver use one of those mobile food delivery apps \u2014 only to realize your\ndelivery person isn't who you expected?
