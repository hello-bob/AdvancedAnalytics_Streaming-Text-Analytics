She swiftly weighed her options: it was past closing time in\nAmsterdam\u2019s lively Leidseplein area, meaning she could not duck into a bar to\nuse their facilities, while the nearest public toilet was 2km away.\n\nShe resorted to squatting in an alleyway, coaxing her friends to cover her as\nshe did so. Police soon turned up, handing her a \u20ac140 (\u00a3118) fine for public\nurination.\n\nFew could have predicted what would come next. After a nine-year battle for\n\u201curination equality\u201d in which thousands took to the streets of the\nNetherlands, this month Amsterdam said it would open more public toilets in\nOctober.\n\nA Dutch judge\u2019s claim that women can use urinals prompted ridicule.\nPhotograph: David Gee 2/Alamy\n\nThe day after Piening was fined, she woke up furious about the injustice of\nit. \u201cThere were a lot of urinals for men nearby but I couldn\u2019t go anywhere to\npee,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, OK, this is an issue.\u201d\n\nPiening, then 21 years old, penned a letter challenging her fine, pointing out\nthat Amsterdam was home to 35 public urinals for men and only three public\ntoilets for women. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t only affect women, but also people in\nwheelchairs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that there are places for\neveryone.\u201d\n\nAfter two years went by without any formal response, Piening found herself\nsuddenly summoned to court to address the outstanding fine. \u201cI thought: \u2018What?\nI have to go to court? OK, weird, but yeah, let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe began spreading the word, sharing her incredulity over being hauled into\ncourt over the issue of potty parity. About 20 media representatives showed up\nto document her court appearance, as the judge rejected her appeal but cut her\nfine to \u20ac90 due to the length of time the case had taken to reach the courts.\n\nThe judge also offered his own view on the issue, telling Piening that despite\nthe lack of female facilities she should have made use of a men\u2019s urinal. \u201cIt\nmay not be pleasant but it is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nOver coffee later with her loved ones, Piening pondered the judge\u2019s\nsuggestion. \u201cWe were all laughing about it because it was so ridiculous,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cI think that is definitely not possible.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, the response was much sharper. Protests began to pop up in\ncities across the country, calling on women to challenge the judge\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cWomen from across the country are invited to demonstrate the\n(im)possibilities of urinating in a public urinal built for men,\u201d said the\norganisers of one protest coined \u201cPower to the Peepee\u201d.\n\nOthers posted photos online showing themselves twisted in knots and attempting\nambitious gymnastic poses in order to comply with the judge\u2019s orders, with\nsome signed on to a petition calling on the country\u2019s minister of education,\nculture and science to tackle \u201curination equality\u201d.\n\nAmong those who joined the movement to combat sanitary sexism was Ilana\nRooderkerk, who at the time was an Amsterdam city councillor.\n\n\u201cThere are things that once you see them, you can\u2019t unsee them,\u201d said\nRooderkerk, who is now a member of the Dutch parliament. \u201cAnd this is a\nperfect example of it \u2013 it\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not convenient.\u201d\n\nShe and Piening worked together to put forward municipal legislation calling\non Amsterdam to expand the number of accessible public toilets. The reaction\nwas initially mixed. \u201cAt first people were thinking, what\u2019s the big deal, or\nthey found it a bit weird to talk about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I always made the\npoint that when it\u2019s something so basic, why don\u2019t we just have this figured\nout? Especially when it\u2019s figured out for half of the city\u2019s population but\nnot the other half.\u201d\n\nBanding together with other female councillors, she began rallying public\nsupport for the issue. Slowly the city started to make changes, placing mobile\ntoilets in major parks and green areas during the summer and informing the\npublic that they could use facilities in sites such as police stations and\nfire halls.\n\nBut it took years to secure the ultimate victory; this month Amsterdam said\nnew wheelchair-accessible public toilets would be available starting in\nOctober. The exact number was not confirmed though the city said its total\ninvestment would be \u20ac4m.\n\nAmong those celebrating the news was Piening. \u201cHow do I feel about it? Really\ngood,\u201d she said. The past nine years had been a test of patience, one that had\nat times been overwhelming, she said.\n\nBut it had also been a crash course in how the design of cities \u2013 often\nharking back to a time when women were expected to remain in the home \u2013 can\nactively exclude segments of the population if left unchallenged.\n\n\u201cI think the city is mostly built by and for men,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if I look at\nit from that angle, it isn\u2019t surprising that there are only urinals for men.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Netherlands\n  * Women\n  * Europe\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
