It can answer general questions about Kubernetes,\nexplain output of provided kubectl commands, and suggested commands for you to\nthen easily execute. Given an issue, it can also use kubectl commands to\nunderstand the issue and suggest a fix.\n\nk8sAI has a few tools at its disposal that it can call to answer your\nquestions and fix issues:\n\n  * Execute_Kubectl_CMD_Tool - k8sAI can use this to execute kubectl read commands to gather more information about your cluster\n  * Suggest_Kubectl_CMD_Tool - k8sAI uses this to suggest a kubectl command to you that you can then edit and execute\n  * k8s_search - This tool is used by k8sAI to search k8s documentation to provide informed solutions\n\n### Note:\n\nThis tool sends data to OpenAI's servers. Please review the OpenAI API terms\nof use before using this tool. This tool also executes kubectl commands. While\nthey should be read-only commands, unintended consequences are possible. Use\nthe --disable-execution command if you want to be extra-safe.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager pip to install k8sAI.\n\n    \n    \n    pip install k8sAI\n\n### Configuration\n\nBefore using k8sAI, ensure your OpenAI API key is set as an environment\nvariable (OPENAI_API_KEY).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Chat\n\nTo start a conversation with k8sAI:\n\n    \n    \n    k8sAI chat [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n\n  * -p, --prompt Provide an initial prompt to start the conversation (optional)\n  * -t, --terminal Conversation will end after one response (optional)\n  * \\--disable-execution Disable execution of kubectl commands (optional)\n\n### Explain\n\nTo have k8sAI explain the output of a Kubernetes command:\n\n    \n    \n    k8sAI explain --cmd='kubectl [command]' [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n\n  * -p, --prompt Provide an additional prompt to go along with the command output (optional)\n  * -t, --terminal Conversation will end after one response (optional)\n  * \\--disable-execution Disable execution of kubectl commands (optional)\n\nNote: Only kubectl commands are valid for explanation.\n\n### Fix\n\nTo request k8sAI to suggest a fix based on a provided description of the\nproblem:\n\n    \n    \n    k8sAI fix [OPTIONS]\n\nIf no prompt is provided, k8sAI will attempt to discover the problem itself\n(under development)\n\nOptions:\n\n  * -p, --prompt A prompt describing the problem to analyze (optional)\n  * -t, --terminal Conversation will end after one response (optional)\n  * \\--disable-execution Disable execution of kubectl commands (optional)\n\nNote: --disable-execution with signficantly reduce k8sAI's ability to discover\na problem.\n\n### Common Commands\n\n    \n    \n    # Start a chat session with k8sAI k8sAI chat # Explain the output a specific kubectl command, end chat after first response k8sAI explain --cmd='kubectl get pods' -t # Suggest a fix for a described problem k8sAI fix --prompt='Pods in `default` namespace are crashing frequently'\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.
