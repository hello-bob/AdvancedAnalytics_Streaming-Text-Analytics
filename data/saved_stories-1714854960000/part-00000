The QR\ncode for the tool is displayed on each table in the canteen, in every meeting\nand training room, in every hallway, and every toilet, as well as shown every\nfive minutes of the working day in screens at the centre of the warehouse.\n\nIf a worker scans the QR code and clicks the link, Amazon\u2019s software\nautomatically generates a letter from the worker and then emails it to the\ntrade union, ending their membership.\n\nUnder trade union law, an employer cannot make an offer to an employee for the\nsole or main purpose of inducing workers not to be members of an independent\ntrade union, take part in its activities, or make use of its services. We\nthink building this new tool \u2013 which makes cancelling union membership much,\nmuch, easier than cancelling Amazon Prime \u2013 is a breach of this law.\n\nAs well as the new tool, Amazon is also stepping up its more traditional\nunion-busting tactics. It is attempting to bully workers in Coventry into\nending their union membership, using the power managers hold over ordinary\nworkers to intimidate them.\n\nWorkers are being directly confronted in the warehouse by managers and told to\nleave the union. They are told union membership is a waste of money, that they\nwill no longer be able to change their shifts if they remain union members and\nwill lose their Amazon \u201cbenefits\u201d.\n\nWorkers are also required to attend anti-union seminars being held in the\nwarehouse, where misinformation and anti-union propaganda is displayed on\nscreens \u2013 spreading falsehoods about the nature and powers of trade unions.\nThis includes being told \u201cGMB is a business just like Amazon\u201d. Workers are\ntaken directly from their workstation to these sessions, meaning they are\neffectively mandatory.\n\nNone of this should come as a surprise. We need to fight back against these\ndirty tactics \u2013 but we can also take some inspiration because they show how\nmuch this fight matters.\n\nAmazon is one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Its boss is one of\nthe world\u2019s richest men. Their power and wealth has been built on the back of\nbusting unions and exploiting works. If the Coventry union vote is successful,\nit will send ripples around the world \u2013 of course Amazon is going to fight us\ntooth and nail.\n\n+44 7518 115 223 info@foxglove.org.uk press@foxglove.org.uk\n\nRegistered address: International House, 36-38 Cornhill, London EC3V 3NG\n\nFoxglove Legal (Foxglove) is a UK registered non-profit community interest\ncompany.
