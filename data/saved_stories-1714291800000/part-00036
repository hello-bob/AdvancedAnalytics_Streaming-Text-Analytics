Once it\nsucceeded, she said Cyber-Partisans was able to download personal files of\nmore than 8,600 KGB employees. \u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\n\nBased on that data, Cyber-Partisans launched a chat bot on Telegram that would\nallow Belarusians to identify KGB operatives by uploading their photos.\n\n\"We want to show that in the digital world it is impossible to hide\ninformation, and the truth about political repressions will surface, and those\nwho carried them out will be punished,\" Shametavets said.\n\nLast week, Cyber-Partisans claimed infiltrating computers at the country\u2019s\nlargest fertilizer plant to pressure the government to release political\nprisoners. The state-run Grodno Azot plant has made no comment on the claim\nbut its website has been unavailable since April 17.\n\nGrodno Azot, with about 7,500 employees, is a key producer in the country,\nwhich relies heavily on chemical industries.\n\nBelarus, a close ally of Russia, was rocked by mass protests after an election\nin 2020 that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko his sixth term\nin office \u2014 a vote that was denounced by the West and the opposition as\nfraudulent. Authorities responded by arresting more than 35,000 people and\nbrutally beating thousands of them. Many top opposition figures were arrested\nand given long prison terms, while others fled abroad.\n\nThe country's oldest and most prominent rights group Viasna says nearly 1,400\npeople are political prisoners in Belarus, including its founder and 2022\nNobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski.\n\nCyber-Partisans have carried out several large-scale attacks on Belarusian\nstate media in the last four years, and in 2022 hacked Belarusian Railways\nthree times, hijacking control over its traffic lights and control system and\nparalyzing transit of the Russian military equipment into Ukraine via Belarus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We're telling the Belarusian authorities that if they don't stop political\nrepressions, it will get worse,\" Shametavets said. \"We will continue the\nattacks in order to inflict that maximum harm of the Lukashenko regime.\"\n\nFox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising\nanti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.\n\nArrives Weekly\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Youtube\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Slack\n  * RSS\n  * Newsletters\n  * Spotify\n  * iHeartRadio\n\nFox News\n\n  * Updated Terms of Use\n  * New Privacy Policy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Closed Caption Policy\n  * Help\n  * Contact Us\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.
