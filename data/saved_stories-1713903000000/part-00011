My goal is to\nhelp you understand AI and equip you with enough conceptual (but not\ntechnical) fluency to fight off the snake oil merchants. I reserve the right\nto change my mind at any time.\n\ncontact -at- beabytes -dot- com\n\n  * Blog\n  * About\n  * Talks\n\n\u00a9 2013-2024 B\u00e9atrice Moissinac, all rights reserved. Any opinions, findings,\nand conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the\nauthor(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or sponsors.\n\n# Can AI do Good?\n\nAt its root, the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can benefit\nHumanity through its ability to automate decision-making in complex contexts,\nat scale. The quick rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has\nbrought to the forefront questions about positive and negative externalities.\nBeyond the glamour and glitters of ChatGPT and beyond the hype and marketing\nploy of \u201cAI everything\u201d, in this article, I want talk about the tangible\npositive Good that is produced by AI systems in the world today. \ud83d\ude00\n\n# AI can\u2019t fold my laundry, but it can fold proteins\n\nThe application of AI in healthcare is not new. In Radiology and pathology,\nimage recognition has been used to detect anomalies on mammograms and help\nsupport oncologists, and for example, help detect breast cancer earlier.\n\nAs technology advanced, so did many\u2019s ambition. In 2012, IBM and Memorial\nSloan Kettering (MSK) initiated a partnership to build a treatment\nrecommendation system using MSK\u2019s data. Ultimately, IBM Watson Health failed\nand was sold for parts, in part due to high maintenance cost.\n\nOne of the most exciting scientific advancement using algorithms is protein\nfolding. Very simply put, protein folding is the process by which the\ndifferent parts of the protein molecule will position themselves (fold, like\nan origami) to take on a structure that is biologically functional. From an\nalgorithmic perspective, not all positions (folds) are pertinent, and we would\nhave to \u201ctry them all\u201d to figure out which one would work. Thus, protein\nfolding is an expensive problem to solve. Using simulations, AI helps\nefficiently search and test the possibilities without having to make the\nmolecule in real-life. In turns, this helps making faster and better new drug\ndiscoveries. This technology is vastly used with projects such as AlphaFold,\nEquiBind, or ATOM. You can even donate your idling computing devices to help\nopen source projects!\n\nI am usually very conservative in my assessment of LLM\u2019s performance due to\naccuracy and ethical concerns, but I am genuinely excited to see what they can\ndo with new molecule generation. If you want to learn way more about AI-\nassited drug discovery, there is this great talk from the Alan Turing\nInstitute. \ud83e\udd13 \ud83e\uddec\n\n# Prof. AI will be teaching you.\n\nThroughout the years, algorithms and data have been used to construct\nIntelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). ITS cannot (yet?) replace teachers, but\nthey can provide support and assistance, by aiming to create an adaptive\nteaching/practicing experience. Mathematically, an AI tutor is trying to find\nyour zone of proximal development, that is, to find an exercise, an\nexplanation, etc, that is not too hard, and not too easy, to push your\nlearning forward.\n\nSome have been vastly successful, such as Duolingo and Khan Academy. They even\npublish their research openly. What does AI research look like at Duolingo?\nTake a look!\n\nAnd some, like Knewton Alta (previously Knewton), have been riddled with the\nclassic problem of over-promising and under-delivering. Moreover, a lot of\napplications of AI in Education are hidden within the service offering of\nlarge for-profit publishers, such as ETS AI Labs, Wiley, or Pearson.\n\nBut the advent and democratization of LLMs has push the capability of AI\ntutors even further. Start-ups like Merlyn Mind are developing a classroom AI\nassistant, which can reduce stress and save time. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udfeb \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udf93\n\n# AI against pollution & climate change\n\nThe negative environmental cost of LLMs is being documented with every new GPT\nmodel, and rightly criticized given the frivolity of the results.\n\nNevertheless, some class of algorithms can provide serious help to fight\npollution. The Ocean Cleanup Project uses image recognition to detection\nplastic in the ocean. The Grey Parrot project also use image recognition to\nincrease the amount of resources being recycled.\n\nMost notably, the United Nation is actively sponsoring multiple research\nefforts to develop algorithms related to development goals. For example,\nweather prediction has been using numerical models that are very slow and\nexpensive to run. AI algorithms have been shown to have the potential to\nreduce the computational time and resources needed to make weather\nforecasting.\n\nThey don\u2019t always make the news, but risk management agencies and emergency\nservices are already using AI research and algorithms to optimize resource\nmanagement and improve detection, as extreme events are more and more likely\nto happen. For instance, wild fire detection in Washington state, as well as\nwild fire management. It has also been used to calculate whether Emergency\nresponse resources are properly allocated for optimal response time.\n\n# What\u2019s next?\n\nThere are a lot of valid and legitimate concerns regarding the economic,\nsocietal, and environmental (to only cite a few) risks caused by the use or\nmisuse of AI systems. Progress for better or for worse seem ineluctable. So\nevery time I feel overwhelmed by the bombardment of bad news, I fight the\nmedia\u2019s bias toward negativity by searching for \u201cAI For Good\u201d projects. I have\npointed at some examples in this blog, but there are many more!\n\n  * Microsoft AI For Earth\n  * IBM AI XPrize\n  * AI 4 Good\n  * Google AI for Global Goals\n\nAI has terrific promises for the future and betterment of all of Humanity. It\nis our responsibility to make sure it delivers a cost-effective, fair, and\nequitable future for all.\n\nNB: This was a feel-good post to balance next\u2019s week post: A Quick Guide to\nthe AIpocalypse. \ud83d\ude07\n\n", "frontpage": false}
