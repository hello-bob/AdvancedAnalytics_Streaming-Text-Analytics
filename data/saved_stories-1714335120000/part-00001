And that disease\u2014I\u2019ve seen other\npeople get it too\u2014is the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90%\nof the work.\u201d But that\u2019s never the case. As Steve explains, a product idea\nnever turns out as originally conceived because you learn a lot from the\ndetails of building it, and there are always tradeoffs you have to make.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great\nproduct... and it\u2019s that process that is the magic.\u201d He compares a team\nworking hard on something they\u2019re passionate about to a rock tumbler: \u201cIt's\nthrough the team--through a group of incredibly talented people--bumping up\nagainst each other, having arguments, having fights sometimes, making some\nnoise, and working together... they polish each other and polish the ideas.\nAnd what comes out are these really beautiful stones.\u201d --- We curate the top\n1% of startup advice from the world\u2019s best founders and investors.
