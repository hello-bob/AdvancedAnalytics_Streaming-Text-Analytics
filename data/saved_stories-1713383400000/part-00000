It grew to\n33 customers specifically through word of mouth with Average Customer Value at\n$15 or \u20b5200.\n\nThe most interesting part of this experience is that I didn\u2019t plan to start a\nnew business, I found myself in a unique situation where a problem that I had\nsolved for myself was worth something to my friends, colleagues, the person\nnext to them and so on. However before I go into the details on how I created\nUblock, I think it makes sense to go through the origins of the problem that\ncreated this opportunity in the first place.\n\n## Despair\n\nOn the fateful evening of March 14th, I found myself on a quest, one powered\nby the to uncover the intriguing world of Frames on Farcaster \u2014 a sufficiently\ndecentralized social network similar to Twitter which has recently became\npopular within the blockchain space.\n\nAs I spent the night furiously consuming every bit of information I could\nfind, the unexpected happened \u2014 at precisely 12:14 AM GMT, my internet\nconnection went down. Initially, I waved it off as a routine network restart\nor an update from my internet service provider (ISP), and decided it was time\nto call it a night.\n\nHowever, the situation quickly escalated when I realized that not only was my\nhome broadband connection down, but my mobile internet had also ceased to\nfunction. It was then that the gravity of the situation dawned on me; we were\nexperiencing a widespread internet blackout, and I had no way to verify the\nextent of the outage or what was causing it, as I could not access Twitter,\nthe go-to source for real-time information on such events.\n\nI reached out to my network of developers and colleagues from various co-\nworking spaces, and the consensus was clear: the internet was down for most,\nif not all, users in the country. Surprisingly, only one essential internet\nmessaging app \u2014 WhatsApp \u2013 seemed to be functioning through the outage.\n\nTurns out, this was an Africa-wide blackout, and the situation was really bad.\nIt was now the morning of 15th March, and around 10 AM, I had a critical\nthird-stage interview with the Investment Committee (I.C) for a venture I was\nworking on. I also needed to present a deck during that call, and one of the\nI.C partners was supposed to join. Calling contacts in Nigeria, I learned they\nwere experiencing the same issues. I was beginning to panic \u2013 there was no way\nI could attend the call or present the deck as planned. I had to resort to\nusing that expensive dial-up number option in Google Meets, even with my best\nefforts, the call did not go as well as I had hoped without the ability to\nproperly present or share screen.\n\n## Hope\n\nAfter dealing with my initial frustration and pain, I knew I had to find a way\nout of this predicament. You see, I had no life outside of the internet \u2013 I\nnever realized just how integral this little piece of technology was to my\ndaily livelihood. But now, with the outage in full force, the realization hit\nme hard. No AI assistant, no streaming, no virtual meetings \u2013 the impact was\nstaggering.\n\nWhat made it even worse was the fact that I was in the middle of a crucial\nresearch phase, not deep into an established project where I had already\ndownloaded and gathered all the necessary resources. This was a learning\nsprint, so the timing of the blackout couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nJust when I was about to give in to despair, a glimmer of hope emerged. Some\nof my contacts mentioned that by changing their DNS provider to 8.8.8.8, they\nwere able to access Google services, despite the broader internet outage. This\nrevelation sparked an idea in my mind \u2014 if I could access Google services, I\ncould potentially tap into the Google Cloud platform and set up a remote\ndesktop protocol (RDP) session, essentially creating a computer in the cloud\nthat would be unaffected by the local internet disruption.\n\nThis was it for me!! If I could access Google services, it meant I could also\naccess the Play Store and Google Cloud Console, and set up an RDP to create a\nvirtual machine in the cloud. Without wasting time, I immediately checked the\nCloud Marketplace and setup a ~$160/month Windows RDP server on Google Cloud.\nAnd just like that, I was back online with a computer that lived in the cloud\n\u2014 I now had access to Microsoft Edge which meant I could browse any website I\nwanted.\n\n\u2014 Guess the first website I visited ??????\n\nThe bird app X(Formerly Twitter)!! I needed to know WTF was happening with our\ninternet, and how people were dealing with it.\n\nAs I scrolled through the frantic updates, I encountered heartbreaking stories\nof the devastating impact this internet blackout was having on young\nprofessionals across Africa. Frida, a marketing consultant in Lagos, had\nmissed a critical interview for a senior role she was in the second stage of\ndue to the outage. Eddie, a remote software engineer on probation with a\nstartup in Germany, had lost a $3,500 per month role because of his unreliable\ninternet connection. Daniel, a UI/UX designer in Lagos, couldn\u2019t even open\nFigma, his preferred design tool for work, causing him to miss a crucial\ndeadline for a client project.\n\nAnd then there was Janni, who had asked for a 2-week leave from work, hoping\nthat the situation would clear up within that time, although she had\noriginally planned to use that time to travel across East Africa.\n\n> ICYMI\ud83d\udedc: The impact of the internet blackout + dumsor on Ghanaian remote\n> workers; a Ghanaian remote worker has just lost his \u20ac3K+/month job.\n>\n> : Facebook/Jay Kwachie \u2013 pic.twitter.com/sPbjLxDsLb\n>\n> \u2014 \u00d6lele | DTS (@OleleSalvador) March 15, 2024\n\nThese were just a few of the many stories that had emerged among the young,\ndigitally-dependent workforce who relied on a stable power and internet\nconnection to do their jobs. The gravity of the situation hit me hard as I\nread through the pleas and frustrations flooding the space.\n\n## Tunnels\n\nBeing part of a distributed remote organization, with our team spread across\nthe continent, I knew we were facing a serious blocker that required a\nsolution to enable our teammates to continue getting their work done.\n\nWhile I had managed to set up an RDP on Google Cloud to handle my own critical\ntasks, I knew I needed to find a more affordable solution that I could share\nwith my friends and colleagues to help them weather this crisis. It was at\nthis time that I began exploring internet tunnels.\n\nAn internet tunnel is a secure, encrypted connection that allows data to be\ntransmitted directly between endpoints, bypassing the public internet\ninfrastructure. It creates a private, virtual pathway for communication, which\nis most cases enables a more private connection to the internet compared to\nstandard internet traffic.\n\nAfter countless trial-and-error attempts, I found myself grappling with a\nvexing catch-22, The problem \u2014 downloading the necessary client software\nbinaries onto my personal computer. You see, if I didn\u2019t already have those\ncritical files on my hard drive, I had no way to download them, because as\nlong as the files weren\u2019t hosted on Google\u2019s servers, I couldn\u2019t access them\nwithout a functioning internet connection. It was a maddening predicament:\n\n> You need a certain file to configure internet access, but you need to\n> download it first. However, in order to download it, you need the internet.\n\nHowever, I figured out two options that worked out just fine. using the scp\nprotocol, I was able to exchange the required config zips and binaries from\nserver to my local computer and after much experimentation with several\ntunneling software including OpenVPN \u2014 which I now officially detest, I\nfinally figured out a working configuration with WireGuard \u2014 an opensource\ntunnel software.\n\nFor most people, these types of tunnels are often referred to as VPNs, as they\noperate in a similar fashion. In our case, WireGuard proved to be the most\nuser-friendly option, with minimal complications once I got a client up and\nrunning.\n\nWith the WireGuard tunnel providing internet access through the available\n8.8.8.8 DNS, our teammates were now able to reconnect to the internet. This\nwas a good news, as it allowed us to overcome the debilitating effects of the\nblackout and ensure our distributed team could continue collaborating and\ngetting work done.\n\nI had created a resource download link to make on-boarding easier. I\u2019d like to\ncall this the Version one of our implementation as this was a simple resource\ncenter for friends and family.\n\n## Business\n\nSo how did I end up charging $15 per user?\n\nI was minding my own business at the local coffee shop when Janni approached\nme with an unusual request. There was a customer outside, she explained, who\nwas desperately in need of internet access and was essentially stranded due to\nher inability to access her accounts. Prior to this, I had only shared my\ninternet connection with close friends, but this felt like one of those\nmiraculous moments \u2013\u2013 a chance to turn water into wine, as it were.\n\nI walked up to the lady and jokingly told her that internet access would cost\nher. To my surprise, she said \u201cno problem\u201d without hesitation, that the only\ncash she had left was \u20ac10 (10 euros), would I accept that? I told her that I\nwould accept her offering as a souvenir \u201c\u201d. The rest as you know is history, I\nperformed an internet miracle, and instantly she was overjoyed, the first\nthing she did was call her friends, excitedly telling them to come get\ninternet access. Playfully, I suggested she tell them it would cost 15 euros,\nsince she had received a special discount.\n\nSoon, those who had gained access to the internet tunnel began sharing the\nnews with their own friends, the news begun spreading like wild fire. I found\nmyself configuring internet access for an ever-growing circle of people,\nfriends of friends of friends. \u201cThat thing they said about Word of mouth yeah\u201d\nSuch an amazing experience!\n\nSo instead of doing actual work, I spent the weekend streamlining\nconfigurations for each client I\u2019d setup WireGuard on to enable internet\naccess; it was also a pseudo-networking opportunity, as the individuals who\ninternet was critical to their work were also people I needed to know and meet\nfor possible future opportunities. And with the complexity of managing several\nclient configurations, I knew that there had to be a better way.\n\nWhew! This screams ADVENTURE!!\n\n## Adventure\n\nTo safeguard my personal information(phone number, whatsapp line etc), I knew\nI needed to streamline operations and prevent people from indiscriminately\nsharing my phone number on their social media status, touting me as the go-to\nguy for solving internet troubles. Before I knew it, a bustling \u201cBig Business\u201d\nventure was in the making.\n\nNow, I must confess, this was all Janni\u2019s idea since she took her leave\nprematurely she was bustling with energy about this \u201cbig business\u201d, so I was\nlike ... why not??!!!! \u2014 regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge. As I\nset about creating a dedicated web presence for \u201cublock,\u201d one of my top\npriorities was conversion. I needed people to commit the $15 fee upfront,\nbefore granting them access to my personal line. This meant the level of\nprofessionalism in executing the website was critical to my success.\n\nI remember that while I was setting this up for my friends, I had told myself\nthat the moment I had more than 10 configurations in bare text on my notes, I\nwas going to streamline account management for every individual that was using\na WireGuard client I\u2019d configured.\n\nSo in no little than 48 hours, I had purchased a domain, bootstrapped up a\nwebsite, and written a simple automation on top of a single database table.\nHere, I could add user accounts that were accessible via a web app, allowing\neach user, identified by their phone number, to easily access their\npersonalized tunnel configuration file.\n\nI even implemented an optional script for generating public/private key pairs,\nsetting up firewalls and issuing static IPs for each client device, automating\nthe process programmatically for each new user. Now, anyone without internet\ncould simply visit the GCP-hosted site, download the necessary apps, and\ngenerate a tunnel configuration file to get their client up and running, with\nunrestricted internet access.\n\ntecmie.com/internetublock mobileublock desktopExample definition for a new\nclient Tunnel config\n\nI was so hyped by the progress that I even designed a sleek logo for the\nventure. According to the news reports, this internet blackout could last up\nto 3 weeks, and while many couldn\u2019t afford the luxury to purchase a Starlink\ndevice, they could certainly spare $15 to get reconnected to the digital\nworld.\n\nI knew fully well that this was a temporary problem, and the fix I had\nprovided was only meant to be a stopgap solution. However, working on Ublock\nopened my eyes to the true state of problems plaguing the African continent.\nAs much as I had always been skeptical of fintech apps, it became clear to me\nwhy we have sooo many of them.\n\nThis experience made me realize that some of the most successful startups on\nthe continent are solving problems that simply don\u2019t make sense outside of\nAfrica. This is precisely why it\u2019s so challenging for these homegrown ventures\nto raise funds from foreign direct investors or similar sources \u2014 until they\ncan demonstrate tangible traction, revenue growth, or point to an already\nsuccessful competitor who has secured a Series A round, they often struggle to\nbe taken seriously.\n\nDesigning the Unblock platform was just the icing on the cake during this\nwhirlwind journey. But more importantly, working on this project opened my\neyes to the unique challenges and opportunities that exist for entrepreneurs\nbuilding solutions tailored to the African market. It was a humbling reminder\nthat some of the most impactful innovations can stem from addressing the most\npressing local needs.\n\n## Embracing the Challenges\n\nWe truly have a dysfunctional system, which is precisely why we have so many\nenterprising entrepreneurs stepping up to the plate. The craziest part was\nthat here I was, building internet solutions for people who I could barely\neven assure had stable connectivity in the first place. For the first time, I\nfeel like I\u2019ve truly walked a mile in their shoes. The reality in this climate\nis vastly different, and I\u2019ve always tended to operate on the more sensible\nend of the spectrum.\n\nBut the epiphany that a very rudimentary hack/fix I had bundled together in\njust three days to solve a personal problem could serve as a lifeline for so\nmany people who gained access to it, that epiphany sparked my problem-solving\nwandering brain cells.\n\nLiterally, the fact that simply providing Ublock, setting up the website to be\nhosted on Google Cloud so anyone could access it, download files, create an\naccount, and set up a tunnel \u2013 meant that I was essentially saving lives.\nAssisting people like the individuals who rely on Jiji to sell their goods,\nthe food vendors on Glovo, or even a stranded lady trying to extricate herself\nfrom a corporate scandal \u2013 that to me was easy-peasy. I was utterly motivated.\n\nBut there was so much to learn along the way, and for once, I had the chance\nto truly connect with people. We cried and laughed together, sharing in each\nother\u2019s struggles. The most amazing part was seeing the look of sheer relief\nand joy on their faces when I would finally complete the Ublock configuration,\nand suddenly \u2013 boom! \u2013 they had internet access once more. Mission\naccomplished!\n\nThe overflow of heartfelt gratitude that hit me from all sides was almost\noverwhelming. My blushing, round cheeks did their best to hide the swelling\nsense of pride and satisfaction. Their infectious joy was palpable \u2014 if you\ncan relate to this, then you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nIt was literal life saving joy and it might seem little and straightforward to\nme, but it wasn\u2019t. This made me realize the power that we wield, being able to\nleverage technology in this manner means we truly get to make the world a\nbetter place. And it really has nothing to do with ground-breaking Zero\nKnowledge Decentralized distributed Micro services on a multi-cloud\nenvironment. No, it was the simple things that made people\u2019s lives easier,\nthat made them feel good, that ensured they could access food when hungry, and\nnot have to worry about how they would move from point A to B without feeling\ncompletely stranded or secure an interview after applying to several jobs.\n\n## Lessons learned\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m immensely grateful for being able to provide a solution that\ntruly made a difference in people\u2019s lives. However, as time progressed,\nmanaging the servers became difficult and I began dealing with issues\nsurrounding DNS/IP resolutions. Few of the GCP machines relied on Ephemeral IP\nthat changed when restarted. I also explore other alternative options around\nHardware routers pre-configured with a WireGuard Tunnel. I also realized that\niPhone users could not load apps without the App Store, and the E.U policy on\nnew Apple devices finally made sense. Bummer! This opened my eyes to a reality\nabout iOS devices I never considered, to realize that your iPhone is just a\ndud the moment you cannot access the internet is actually terrifying,\nregardless there were some lessons I learned along this journey, a few of\nwhich I would like to share with you.\n\n### Move fast! Like really fast!!\n\nRun if possible, 10x your sprint capacity, especially if your product is in\nthe Hair on Fire PMF category, essentially you solve a problem your customers\nare actively wrestling with, and likely comparing existing products to solve\nit. To succeed in such a dynamic, you must rise above the noise. The image\nbelow explains the Hair on Fire PMF category quite well.\n\nArc PMF Frameworks www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework\n\n### Local problems aren\u2019t quite complex\n\nSolving local problems doesn\u2019t require massive tech. If anything, I\u2019ve come to\nlearn that they rather require massive infrastructure. The twist is, these\ninfrastructure challenges have already been solved in more advanced regions. I\ncould also be speaking from a place of high expertise when I call these\nproblems simple. This is because, to create internet access is similar to how\nI engineer technology operations for Micro-services / Kubernetes cluster when\nI\u2019m responsible for the DevOps within an engineering team.\n\nI\u2019ve had a profound realization through this journey \u2013 I\u2019m no longer\ninterested in building just \u201ccool\u201d products.\n\nAlong the way, I\u2019ve had the privilege of crossing paths with remarkable\nindividuals like Susan, the UX designer at Amazon; Fred, the journalist and\nreporter at a popular TV station; Danny, the airdrop hunter; and Lumi, the\nresearch director at a Pan-African organization. Each of these people has\ninspired me with their dedication to using technology to improve the world\naround them.\n\nWhat\u2019s most remarkable is that all of the growth I\u2019ve experienced has been\norganic, driven by word of mouth. I\u2019ve connected with friends of friends who\nwork in PR, marketing, fintech, and a variety of other industries \u2013 all united\nin the pursuit of leveraging technology to create positive change.\n\nInstead of super cool tech product, I\u2019m committed to focusing my efforts on\nthe boring, yet essential, technological challenges that have the power to\ntruly make a difference in people\u2019s lives. This is the path I\u2019m now determined\nto walk.\n\n#### Future States\n\nIf this internet blackout had continued for yet another week, there were a\ncouple future states I was already exploring.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to implement them, I\u2019d prefer to make a\nmental note of them here as reference for future sakes in-case we ever find\nourselves in the same situation again.\n\n#### DNS Resolvers\n\nThe first scaling issue I faced was with Ephemeral IP Addresses, where\nrestarted GCP instances changed their assigned IP address, which meant that\nclient configurations that were IP Address specific stopped working\nimmediately. And the only way to fix these issues were sending messages and\nscreenshots over Whatsapp or calling them and trying to get them change the\naddress field in their Tunnel configuration. For future references, a note to\nself would be to reference these servers via DNS in place of Bare IP pointers,\nso that a change in a server\u2019s IP can be effected at the DNS level without\nhaving to tamper with any client configurations\n\n#### Custom Routers\n\nThe only reason I considered the router option was because the cafe I frequent\nasked me if there was a way they could also have the internet but across their\ndevices so that their teams could process online orders through their systems\nand customers who usually come here for internet won\u2019t be disappointed. The\ninternet blackout had already lasted for almost a week at this point. Had the\noutage persisted for much longer, I might have executed on the Router\nStrategy, although installing custom DD-WRT firmware would essentially void\nthe device\u2019s warranty. The general idea behind ublock was to provide a\ntemporary, backup internet solution \u2013 something disposable that people can get\nrid of until stability returned, so I wasn\u2019t overly concerned about the long-\nterm implications.\n\n#### Cheaper implementations\n\nTo be fair, I started from a $160 RDP setup to a $13 a month Server setup and\neventually found a solution that cut this cost by more than half. Although I\ndidn\u2019t get to explore it, I think it\u2019s a worthy mention that Outline is a\nreally great VPN Client software. plus their Developer SDK means you can build\non top of their advanced networking layers to create applications for whatever\npurpose you require\n\n#### Resource reference and links\n\n  * Digitalocean Wireguard on Ubuntu 20\n  * Wireguard Tools for Nodejs\n  * OpenWRT list of supported Hardware\n  * DD-WRT Router Database\n  * Outline Developer SDK\n  * Outline Manager apps\n  * Free Dynamic DNS recommendation from Perez\n\nShare\n\nentrepreneurship featured i-am-no-longer-launching-cool-products startup\nublock\n\n#### Similar Thoughts\n\n### As an entrepreneur you need to owe people\n\nAndrew 2024-01-24T14:29:46+00:00\n\n### Entrepreneurship 101 \u2014 \u201cDont loose your shit\u201d\n\nAndrew 2024-01-23T14:30:38+00:00\n\n### Your Team is a Band, and Your Culture is the Vibe\n\nAndrew 2023-11-10T16:42:07+00:00\n\nAndrew 2024-04-14T02:36:22+00:00\n\n  * Now\n  * Travel\n  * Tweetlight\n  * Moodboard\n\n## Andrew\u2019s Inner Circle\n\nGet exclusive access to my latest thought pieces on entrepreneurship, tech &\nstartups when I write them.\n\nInvalid or expired token.\n\n###### From Twitter\n\nNULL\n\n###### Quick Links\n\n  * Garden\n  * About\n  * Work\n  * Connect\n\n###### Recent Essays\n\n  * 1\n\n###### I launched a new startup and shut it down in two weeks\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\n  * 2\n\n###### Intract or Galxe \u2014 don\u2019t ask me\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nAndrew Miracle \u00a9 2022 \u2014 Built with Bedrock\n\n#### Share This\n\n#### Copy Link to Clipboard\n\n", "frontpage": false}
