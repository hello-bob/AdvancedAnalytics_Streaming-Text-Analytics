Republished here with minor revision.)\n\nIn the fall of 2022, the Unicode Technical Committee announced that the 2023\nrelease of the Unicode Standard would be a \u201cdot\u201d release with limited\ncharacter additions, with the next major release in 2024. This wasn\u2019t without\nprecedent \u2014 COVID slowed down the release of Unicode 14.0 in 2020 and the\nworld seemed to survive \ud83d\ude09. Subcommittees were well prepared and adjusted\naccordingly, discussing what this meant for their respective areas of\nexpertise.\n\nFor the Emoji Subcommittee (ESC) \u2014 the group responsible for defining the\nrules, algorithms, and properties necessary to achieve interoperability\nbetween different platforms for those smiley faces that appear on your\nkeyboard (Shout out \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udee1\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udcab!) \u2014 this delay presented an opportunity. Sure, we\nwere so close to exhaling a sigh of relief (the intake period for Emoji 16.0\nproposals had just completed). But upon learning we couldn\u2019t ship any new\ncodepoints until 2024 we turned our energy towards recommending new emoji\nbased on existing ones. (These are called emoji ZWJ sequences. That's when a\ncombination of multiple emoji display as a single emoji ... like \ud83d\udc69 \ud83c\udffd +\ud83c\udfed =\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfed).\n\n### When Less is More\n\nAn incredibly powerful aspect of written language is that it consists of a\nfinite number of characters that can \"do it all\". And yet, as the emoji\necosystem has matured over time our keyboards have ballooned and emoji\ncategories are about to hit or have hit a level of saturation. Upon reflecting\non how emoji are used, the ESC has entered a new era where the primary way for\nemoji to move forward is not merely to add more of them to the Unicode\nStandard. Instead, the ESC approves fewer and fewer emoji proposals every\nyear.\n\nBut our work is not done. Not by a longshot. Language is fluid and doesn\u2019t\nstand still. There is more to do! This \u201coff-cycle\u201d gives us a chance to\naddress some long-standing major pain points using emoji. The first one that\ncame to mind: skin-tone.\n\n### What is a family?\n\nThe encoding of multi-person multi-tone support has matured over the years;\nHowever, the implementation can seem random to the average person: While it\u2019s\ntrue, all people emoji have toned options (with the exception of characters\nwhere you can\u2019t see skin like \ud83e\udd3a) there are ... misfits. Some two people emoji\noffer tone support ( \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udfff) others do not ( \ud83d\udc6f). A few non RGI emoji render\nwith tone but with no affordance to change one of the two characters (For\nexample, \ud83e\udd3c\ud83c\udffe\u2642 renders with skintone on Android but as gold on iOS. WHY. This is\nwhy we standardize these things, people).\n\nAnd then ... There is the suite of family emoji (\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc6a). These characters\ninclude two people, three people, sometimes four and none of them have any\ntone support (!). We seem to have a lot of family emoji and yet simultaneously\nnot enough.\n\nThe 26 \u201cfamily\u201d emoji can be broken down into four groups:\n\nDespite the Unicode Standard containing 26 \u201cfamily\u201d emoji, each one of these\nglyphs is overly prescriptive with regard to delivering on a visual\nrepresentation of a family. The inclusion of many permutations of families was\nwell intentioned. But we can\u2019t list them all, and by listing some of the\ncombinations, it calls attention to the ones that are excluded.\n\nWhat even is a family? For some, family is the people you were raised with.\nOthers have embraced friends as their chosen family. Some families have\nchildren, other families have pets. There are multi-generational families,\nmutliracial families and of course many families are any combination of all of\nthese characteristics and more.\n\nFortunately, we don\u2019t need to add 7000 variants to your keyboards (even this\nwould fall short of capturing the breadth of \"family\" as a concept). Instead\nwe can juxtapose individual emoji together to capture a concept with some\nreasonable level of specificity \u2014 not too unlike arranging letters together to\ncreate words to convey concepts \ud83d\ude09\n\nFor emoji keyboards to advance in creating more intuitive and personalized\nexperiences the Emoji Subcommittee is recommending a visual deprecation of the\nfamily emoji. This small set of emoji will be redesigned as part of a multi-\nphase effort to \u201ccomplete the set\u201d of toned variants for the remaining multi-\nperson emoji. This of course begs the question: when there are as many\nfamilies as there are people in the world, is there an effective way at\nconveying the concept of \u201cfamily\u201d without being overly prescriptive in\ndefining what is and is not a family? Well, thankfully icons can do a lot of\nheavy lifting without requiring very much detail.\n\n### When is an emoji running for the police or getting chased by them?\n\nAnother area the ESC is actively exploring is how the semantics of emoji\nsequences can differ when writing directionality changes. Some emoji\ncharacters have semantics that encode implicit directionality but when the\nstring is mirrored and their meaning may be unintentionally lost or changed.\n\nLeft to Right Emoji Sequence: Quickly running towards an \u201cexciting\u201d police\nchase\n\nRight to Left Emoji Sequence: Running away from the coppers\n\nWhat, if anything, can we do to aid in ensuring that messages are meaningfully\ntranslated be them tiny pictures or tiny letters? As part of 15.1 we\u2019re\nproposing a small set of emoji with strong directionality \u2014 with an initial\nfocus on people \u2014 to face the opposite direction. Soon you too can run towards\nor away from ... excitement.\n\n### Emoji 15.1\n\nGiven that the intake cycle of emoji proposals for Unicode 16.0 ended last\nJuly, the Emoji Subcommittee has also decided to temporarily delay the intake\nof Unicode Version 17.0 proposals until April 2024. Fortunately, you won\u2019t\nhave to wait until then to get new emoji. (Note: I know it sounds like I\u2019m\ntalking about the past and future simultaneously ... the emoji lifecycle is\nlooooong and as a result overlaps with multiple releases. Expect a future blog\npost about the Emoji 15.0 candidates landing early this year (Shout out goose,\npink heart, and pushing hands). I\u2019ve been holding off writing about this set\nuntil you can actually see them on your phones but given that we\u2019re already\ntalking about 2024 maybe it\u2019s time I dust that blog post off).\n\nAnyways, among the list of Emoji 15.1 recommendations for 2024 includes 578\ncharacters (most of them the candidates described above to support\ndirectionality). The list also includes a few humble additions including a\nbroken chain, a lime, a non-poisonous mushroom, a nodding and shaking face,\nand a phoenix bird. Each one of these leverages a unique valid ZWJ sequence of\nemoji so while they look like atomic characters made of a single codepoint\nthey are composed of two or more codepoints.\n\nBroken chain is the result of a \ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca5 ZWJ and contains a variety of meanings,\nsuch as freedom, breaking a cycle, or perhaps a broken url ;-). Nodding face\nand shaking face are composed of arrows to imply movement in a still image\n(\ud83d\ude42\u2194\ufe0f) and (\ud83d\ude42\u2195\ufe0f). Oh, and of course there is a phoenix rising from the ashes\n(\ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udd25), an ancient metaphor that captures the zeitgeist of today.\n\nThe Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) will review the required documents at\nits first meeting of 2023 in January \u2013 and if these candidates move forward,\nyou can expect an update from the UTC later this Spring and Summer.\n\n#### Adopt a Character and Support Unicode\u2019s Mission\n\nLooking to give that special someone a special something? Or maybe something\nto treat yourself? \ud83d\udd49\ufe0f\ud83d\udc97\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udc28\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\u7231\u20bf\u265c\ud83c\udf40\n\nAdopt a character or emoji to give it the attention it deserves, while also\nsupporting Unicode\u2019s mission to ensure everyone can communicate in their own\nlanguages across all devices.\n\nEach adoption includes a digital badge and certificate that you can proudly\ndisplay!\n\nHave fun and support a good cause\n\nYou can also donate funds or gift stock\n\nPosted by\n\nUnicode, Inc. at\n\n7:28 AM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to
