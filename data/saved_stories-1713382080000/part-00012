Thank you for doing this.\n\nPETER THIEL: Hello, Tyler.\n\nCOWEN: Now, the title of this conversation is \u201cPolitical Theology.\u201d That was a\nphrase, I think, first used by the Russian anarchist Bakunin to mock the\nItalian nationalist Mazzini. German legal theorist Carl Schmitt then picked it\nup and said it\u2019s something that everyone needs. They all need a political\ntheology. What does the term mean to you?\n\nTHIEL: Well, it\u2019s a bit of a fuzzy, broad concept. But maybe to motivate it as\na contrast, I think that in late modernity, we\u2019re often living in this world\nof hyper-specialization where you can\u2019t think about the big picture, and I\ndon\u2019t know, it\u2019s like Adam Smith\u2019s pin factory on steroids.\n\nIt\u2019s our world, and I think there is some way that we have to try to integrate\nall these different facets of our life to try to make progress, and that\u2019s\nwhat political philosophy does. That\u2019s what political theology does. The\nreasons these sorts of things were abandoned, I think maybe it already was the\nEnlightenment abandoned it from \u2014 one type of reason it was abandoned was\nbecause it\u2019s too hard to figure this stuff out, or it\u2019s just a fool\u2019s errand.\nI\u2019m inclined to think the other reason was, it was often deemed as too\ndangerous, too divisive. You\u2019re not supposed to have debates about religion.\nWe settled that in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia. We\u2019re just going to\nforget about it and not talk about these things.\n\nI think that might have been a reasonable compromise in the 18th century. It\u2019s\nmy view that when you fast-forward to the 21st century, it\u2019s maybe more\ndangerous not to think about things, and it\u2019s again more dangerous for us to\nbecome ever smaller cogs in an ever bigger machine, all of Adam Smith\u2019s pin\nfactory.\n\nThe political dimension on it \u2014 just to say one thing on that is, there\u2019s\nalways a question, if we\u2019re trying to figure out something about the whole,\nabout our whole world, do you start on a human scale? Or do you start on a\nmicroscopic, telescopic, atomic, or cosmic scale? There\u2019s probably some way\nthese things are related, but the political theology, political philosophy\ndebate, our frame \u2014 I think this was also a Socratic idea \u2014 we start with a\nturn to common sense, human, the world around us, questions about politics,\neconomics, society, culture, and that\u2019s actually this important way to get\naccess.\n\nThere\u2019s some deep link between the university and the universe. There\u2019s some\ndeep link between the failing multiversity and the crazed multiverse. The\npolitical orientation I have is, you\u2019re never going to solve these things. You\nhave to start with the university or whatever that\u2019s gone wrong if you\u2019re ever\ngoing to make sense of the universe, and there\u2019s some analog to that that\nmotivates all of these things.\n\n## On the political theology of Peter Thiel\n\nCOWEN: Let\u2019s say I\u2019m trying to make sense of your political theology. I recall\nyou saying in a recent talk, you consider yourself religious but not\nspiritual. That strikes me as quite a Calvinist point. If you put aside\npredestination and think of Calvinism as insisting we know nothing about\nheaven, so it\u2019s an arrogation of man\u2019s power to claim to know about heaven,\nthat\u2019s related to your critique of the left.\n\nThe notion that we don\u2019t know anything about heaven \u2014 it also means you can\u2019t\nreally be spiritual. That\u2019s also a kind of arrogation. Isn\u2019t the consistent\nPeter Thiel really a Calvinist thinker? Calvinism is quite concrete. It\u2019s\nquite serious. It takes governance and authority very literally. Why aren\u2019t\nyou just a Calvinist?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019m still mostly a libertarian, Tyler, and \u2014\n\nCOWEN: [laughs] But you can be both.\n\nTHIEL: I think there are probably redeeming things I can find in Calvinism.\nIt\u2019s so anti-utopian that it\u2019s probably helpful in the battle against\ncommunism, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the only way to be anti-communist. If\nyou do five-point Calvinism, it\u2019s total depravity, unconditional election,\nlimited atonement, irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints. I don\u2019t\nknow if I agree with even one of those five things.\n\nI would say a Girardian anthropological frame is that there is this deep link\nbetween gods and scapegoats, and we have these scapegoats we turn into gods.\nWe project our violence onto them, and this is what archaic religion does.\nThis is, in some ways, what atheist liberalism does. You blame everything on\nMr. God. Isn\u2019t Calvinism just an extreme form of scapegoating, where Mr. God\ndid everything, he determined everything? He\u2019s why you\u2019re wearing that blue\njacket, and everything you did wrong \u2014 it\u2019s all Mr. God\u2019s fault.\n\nWe should be deeply distrustful of scapegoating Mr. God for everything like\nthat. That\u2019s an anthropological argument against Calvinism. Then the\nintellectual reason I\u2019m not Calvinist is that I think we should be trying to\nmake sense of the world. If you\u2019re so depraved that you can\u2019t even think,\nwhich is, I think, a core Calvinist thing, we shouldn\u2019t be having a\nconversation. If I were a real Calvinist, we wouldn\u2019t even be able to have a\nconversation here.\n\nThere\u2019s a Thomistic distinction between the intellect and the will, and the\nmedievals believed in the power of the intellect, the weakness of the will.\nThe moderns \u2014 it\u2019s in some ways reversed. If you take an effective altruist,\nEast Bay rationalist \u2014 these people, they\u2019re much closer to Calvinism.\n\nThey claim to be rationalists, but if you\u2019re in a rationalist Bible study\nequivalent, and the outward-facing thing is that you\u2019re rational and you\u2019re\npure and you\u2019re thinking, the inward-facing thing \u2014 it\u2019s all just spaghetti\ncode. You can never be right about anything. Maybe you can be a little bit\nless wrong. So, I\u2019m against both Calvinism and so-called rationalism.\n\nCOWEN: Here\u2019s then the puzzle I\u2019m faced with. Let\u2019s take all of that at face\nvalue. Why is it you just don\u2019t slide into Catholicism or Eastern Orthodox,\nbelief in free will? There\u2019s some middle position. Why is your middle position\nstable? You could either be Catholic or, for that matter, Mormon, where\nthere\u2019s plenty of room for free will, right?\n\nTHIEL: Well, again, they\u2019re certainly not all the alternatives. It\u2019s always a\nlittle bit of a cheap shot. My two-word rebuttal to Roman Catholicism is Pope\nFrancis.\n\n[laughter]\n\nI grew up as a Lutheran. There are probably all these things that are\nproblematic about Luther; there are things that were good about him. But I\nthink the one part of it that \u2014 if we judge him by the standards of the 16th\ncentury, I think the Reformation had to come from the outside. It was not\nactually possible for it to start from within.\n\nThere is a way that the Lutheran piece \u2014 it was the less globally centralized\nchurch. It was going to be a less centralized church, and there\u2019s probably\nstill some part of the Protestant political project that lines up more closely\nwith a libertarian view.\n\n## On the Old Testament\n\nCOWEN: What is it from the Hebrew Bible, or one could say Old Testament, that\nyou\u2019ve incorporated into your own political thought?\n\nTHIEL: Well, I think my views on this are pretty fairly orthodox Christian in\nthat there\u2019s some continuity between the Old and the New. There\u2019s some sense \u2014\nit\u2019s hard to define \u2014 where maybe the Christian God is the original\nprogressive, where the new is better than the old. I think it\u2019s the first time\nwhere the new is simply better than the old just by virtue of being new. But\nif you exaggerate the difference too much, that ends up being problematic, and\nyou end up saying that the Old Testament God is maybe just a different God\nfrom the New Testament God.\n\nAll the extremely progressive forms of higher criticism, things like this in\nthe 19th century, they were all deeply anti-Semitic. I think if you\u2019re too\nprogressive, you end up becoming an anti-Semite. Then you have to somehow say\nthere\u2019s some progress, but the Girardian intuition I would have is, it\u2019s just\nalways this reversal in perspective, where the Bible takes things from the\nside of the victim.\n\nIt\u2019s already in the book of Genesis, where it\u2019s the story of Cain and Abel.\nThe founding of the first city in the history of the world is a parallel but\nopposite story to the story of Romulus and Remus, the founding of the greatest\ncity, where the Romulus and Remus story is told from the point of view of\nRomulus. The Cain and Abel story is told from the point of view of Abel. Or\nthe Israelites coming out of Egypt \u2014 that would normally be told from the\npoint of view of the Egyptians, where you had these troublemakers and we got\nrid of them. You have this inversion of perspectives throughout the Old\nTestament, I would say.\n\nCOWEN: Is it possible that we can read the Old Testament, conclude\nessentially, history is something really bad? That\u2019s the central message of\nthe woke. Then just say, \u201cThe woke basically are correct; we should side with\nthe woke.\u201d They have all these excesses. Those are terrible, but they\u2019re, in a\nway, a method of advertising the fundamental conclusion that history is bad.\nThey\u2019re the ones who make us deal with that, and thus, you and I should be\nwoke. What\u2019s wrong with that line of reasoning?\n\nTHIEL: Yes, I think the history was very bad. I think it\u2019s always a mistake\nfor conservatives or anti-woke people to whitewash it too much. So, if we say\nthat there used to be slavery, but the slaves were all happy people, they were\nall happy slaves \u2014 that is a loser argument, and you shouldn\u2019t do this. I\nwould say, again, the rough Christian frame on this is somehow, the history is\nreally bad.\n\nI think Christianity \u2014 probably, it is much worse than Islam or Judaism on\nthis because Islam and Judaism \u2014 it would be inconceivable that you could\nmurder God in the form of a person. If someone claimed to be God, and he got\nkilled, that would just prove that he\u2019s not God. The original sin, the\nviolence, in some sense, is far greater in a Christian context, but then there\nis some way that we\u2019re all part of that matrix. You need to have forgiveness.\n\nIf you want to maybe outline three rough possibilities, there\u2019s this hard-to-\ndefine Christian in-between one, which is, the history\u2019s terrible and it\u2019s\nawful, but we need to try to find a way to forgive people. Then there is,\nlet\u2019s say, a woke version, where the history\u2019s terrible, but we\u2019re going to\nforget about the forgiveness part. Then there is maybe a right-wing\nNietzschean, Bronze Age Pervert alternative, which is, we\u2019re going to forget\nabout the history. It\u2019s oppressive. I\u2019m sick of this guilt trip and don\u2019t want\nto hear anything more about the history.\n\nSomehow the in-between Christian one, I think, is the most tenable, even\nthough there are all sorts of tensions in that.\n\nCOWEN: There was a recent Harvard talk you gave where, if I understand you\ncorrectly, you suggested the left needed to learn how to relativize its\nvictimhood. What did you mean by that, and how does it relate to what you just\nsaid?\n\nTHIEL: The context was how much victimhood is unhealthy for people to have.\nThere are all these ways where you can identify yourself as a victim. I don\u2019t\nwant to have a blanket rule where you can never say that you weren\u2019t a victim.\nI sometimes like to joke that I\u2019m a poor and persecuted Peter person, and\nmaybe there are elements of truth to that. Maybe it\u2019s very exaggerated. But if\nI absolutize that too much, it\u2019s probably unhealthy.\n\nA Christian division that I suggested at the Harvard talk was that it\u2019s okay\nto say you\u2019re a victim. It\u2019s okay to do these things up to a certain point.\nYou can\u2019t say that you\u2019re a greater victim than Christ. Once you do that,\nyou\u2019ve probably lost perspective.\n\nCOWEN: Are there other holy books besides the Bible that you draw ideas and\ninspiration from? And what would those be?\n\nTHIEL: I think in some sense, it\u2019s all the great books. They\u2019re not quite at\nthe scale of these holy books, but there was a way that we treated Shakespeare\nor Cervantes or Goethe as these almost semi-divine writers, and I think that\u2019s\nthe attitude one has to have to read any of these books appropriately and\nseriously.\n\nCOWEN: So, the Western canon would be your answer, so to speak?\n\nTHIEL: Something like the Western canon. I don\u2019t think the great books are\nquite as holy as the Bible, and as a result, I probably don\u2019t read enough of\nthem, but yes, that\u2019s the closest approximation.\n\nCOWEN: And it includes science fiction \u2014 yes or no?\n\nTHIEL: I read a lot as a kid. I read so little of that nowadays. It\u2019s all too\ndepressing.\n\n#### On the resurgence of Carl Schmitt\n\nCOWEN: Last week, I was teaching my graduate class, and a bunch of them asked\nme, \u201cWhy is it we keep on hearing about Carl Schmitt now?\u201d I\u2019ve tried to\nexplain that to them, but why do you think there\u2019s now a resurgence of\ninterest in Carl Schmitt? For you, what are the valuable insights in Schmitt?\n\nTHIEL: Carl Schmitt was one of this group of thinkers who came to prominence\nin the 1920s in Weimar, Germany. Obviously, there were a lot of things that\nwent very haywire with many of these people that, in some ways, Schmitt got\nsomewhat entangled with the Nazis. He distanced himself a few years later, but\nit was some very bad judgment in certain ways.\n\nBut the thing that I think is interesting, dangerous about looking at the\nWeimar thinkers, somehow, it was in the aftermath of World War I. Germany had\nlost. You couldn\u2019t go back to the throne and altar, the empire of the\nHapsburgs. You didn\u2019t really want to go forward with liberal democracy. There\nwere all these people who had these fairly deep critiques.\n\nIn some ways, it was going back to these questions of political theology,\npolitical philosophy that had been whitewashed and set aside since the\nEnlightenment. Again, there were things about it that were dangerous. One way\nto think of the Weimar period was, it\u2019s like the dwarves in Moria where they\ndwelled too deep, and finally, they awakened the nameless terror of the\nBalrog.\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever in a cyclical world, but there are certainly certain\nparallels in the US in the 2020s to Germany in the 1920s, where liberalism is\nexhausted. One suspects the democracy, whatever that means, is exhausted and\nthat we have to ask some questions very far outside the Overton window.\n\nCOWEN: What is it you think that Schmitt missed that\u2019s very important?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019ll just do one insight that I think is powerful, and then what\u2019s\nwrong about that. One of his books was The Concept of the Political \u2014 what\ndefines politics. It\u2019s some of this division of friends and enemies that\nsomehow is really foundational, and you shouldn\u2019t get sidetracked with all\nthese other things. There are all these interesting ways you could apply this.\nThere\u2019s a 1980s Reagan coalition question I always like to ask people, where\nthe Reagan coalition was somehow the free-market libertarians, the defense\nhawks, and the social conservatives.\n\nIf you ask what does the millionaire and the general and the priest \u2014 what do\nthey actually have in common? We just imagine these three people are seated at\na dinner table, and they\u2019re having dinner. What do they actually talk about?\nIt\u2019s really hard to come up with an answer. Yet the coalition worked\nincredibly well, and the answer I submit that they have in common is they\u2019re\nanti-communist, and they have a common enemy. That was incredibly powerful. It\nwas, in some ways, my formative political idea as a teenager \u2014 junior high\nschool, high school, late \u201970s, early \u201980s \u2014 was anti-communism.\n\nThen there was a way that when the Berlin Wall came down in \u201989, this\nseemingly incredibly powerful political constellation disintegrated. There\u2019s a\nnatural Schmittian analysis of this. That\u2019s where I find Schmitt quite\npowerful as a thinker. The place where it probably tends to always go haywire\nis, there\u2019s always a question whether politics is like a market. Or is it a\nthing where, if you understand it better, it works better? Or is it something\nlike a scapegoating machine, where the scapegoating machine only works if you\ndon\u2019t look into the sausage-making factory?\n\nIf you say, \u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of conflicts in our village, and we have to\nfind some random elderly woman and accuse her of witchcraft, so that will\nachieve some psychosocial unity as a village,\u201d this sort of thing doesn\u2019t\nreally work if you\u2019re that self-aware. Schmitt, in a way, had this optimistic\nEnlightenment rationality to it, where if we just describe politics as the\narbitrary division of the world into friends and enemies, then this will\nsomehow strengthen the political. It probably, actually, in some ways\naccelerated its disintegration instead.\n\nCOWEN: Is Schmitt missing out on a certain possible cyclicality in history?\nThe notion that liberalism will collapse in Weimar Germany of the 1920s \u2014\nobviously, that was the correct prediction. But if you reappear in West\nGermany of 1948, it was a completely incorrect prediction. Just as well,\nliberalism had collapsed leading up to World War I. It tends to come back. Why\nisn\u2019t the cyclical perspective the correct one?\n\nTHIEL: Well, that\u2019s a big question, but I think that you can stress the\naspects that are timeless and eternal. I prefer to stress the aspects that are\none-time and world-historical. I think that, in some sense, every moment in\nhistory only happens once. I think there is some kind of meaning to history. I\nthink it has a certain type of linearity to it. That is, let\u2019s say, the Judeo-\nChristian view of history as distinct from, let\u2019s say, the classical Greco-\nRoman one. I don\u2019t know if you can have a concept of history that\u2019s cyclical.\n\nIf you look at Thucydides, where it\u2019s this great period of peace that leads to\nthis great war between Athens and Sparta. So the Periclean age somehow then\ngives way to this great conflict. Then people came back to studying Thucydides\nright after World War I because there were some certain parallels. A hundred\nyears of peace between the Napoleonic Wars, and then it led to this great\nconflict, but there\u2019s nothing particular in the history. None of the details\nmatter in Thucydides. He makes up all the speeches and so on.\n\nYou contrast this with something like the Book of Daniel in the Bible, where\nit\u2019s a succession of four kingdoms, and it is a one-time world history where\neverything that happens is unique, not to be repeated. There\u2019s a sense in\nwhich I would say the real first historian was Daniel, and Thucydides isn\u2019t\neven close.\n\nWe talked off the set a little bit about, well, what about the Roman Empire\nand the Holy Roman Empire? Isn\u2019t the European Union sort of like the Roman\nEmpire? My response is, well, we have nuclear weapons today, and they didn\u2019t\nhave those, even in 1900. Even just on the science and tech arc, things are so\ndifferent, and I would not trivialize the importance of science and\ntechnology.\n\nCOWEN: So, you think now, the stakes are too high for the cyclical version of\nhistory to work because, at some point, it\u2019s just not possible to come back?\n\nTHIEL: Well, it\u2019s just that the science and tech has a progressive character.\nYes, there are elements I think that are probably quite apocalyptic about our\ntime, but I would just start by saying they\u2019re very different. We\u2019re in a very\ndifferent world than we were in 1900. I don\u2019t know how you unlearn all the\nknowledge we\u2019ve gained, even since 1900.\n\n## On whether we\u2019re in a new age of millenarian thought\n\nCOWEN: Do you think we\u2019re entering a new age of millenarian thought somewhat\nakin to the English 17th century, where everything was very fertile? There\u2019s a\nscientific revolution. Tech, you could say, is revitalized again. A lot of\npeople went crazy, highly diverse theologies. They execute a king. Many\nstrange things happen. In many ways, we\u2019re living in the world of the English\n17th century, right? With constitutions, political parties, central banks. Is\nthis the new millenarian age?\n\nTHIEL: This is, again, an absurdly cyclical frame you\u2019re putting on things.\nNo, I don\u2019t think any moment ever repeats itself. It is just radically\ndifferent. Of course, there are things that are apocalyptic about our world.\nWe have all these kinds of dangers that, unlike the 17th century, they seem to\ncome from this place that\u2019s very nonreligious. Science, technology. It was\nnuclear weapons after 1945. Maybe it\u2019s environmental degradation, climate\nchange. We can debate about various forms of the environment.\n\nThere certainly are fears people have about bioweapons. We can ask what really\nhappened with the Wuhan lab. There are apocalyptic fears around AI that I\nthink deserve to be taken seriously. Yes, if it\u2019s millenarian or apocalyptic,\nit has a very, very different feel. It\u2019s sort of an apocalyptic violence that\ncomes from a purely human source. It\u2019s not really being orchestrated by God.\n\nOne of the points that Ren\u00e9 Girard always liked to make was that, in the\nCatholic Church \u2014 it was, I think, during the Advent season \u2014 you\u2019d often have\nthese sermons on the end times, the terrible things that happened at the end\nof the world. In Girard\u2019s telling, the Church stopped those sermons after 1945\nbecause people needed to be reassured that the nuclear weapons had nothing to\ndo with Armageddon or fire and brimstone or anything like this, even though,\nof course, there were all these slight mythic elements. The first nuclear test\nwas called Trinity, or you named it after all these Greek gods: Saturn,\nJupiter, Zeus, whatever.\n\n> If we, again, talk about all these existential risks today \u2014 nuclear\n> weapons, climate change, biotech, nanotech, killer robots, the AI that\u2019s\n> going to turn everyone into a paperclip or whatever \u2014 I always think you\n> should at least include one more kind of existential risk if we\u2019re going to\n> throw it in. In my mind, one other existential risk is a one-world\n> totalitarian government. I find that at least as scary as the others.\n\nThere are elements of that that I think are very true. If I\u2019ve had to do my\nanti-millenarian frame, or maybe it\u2019s not a pro-tech argument \u2014 this is sort\nof an anti-anti-tech argument \u2014 is that if we, again, talk about all these\nexistential risks today \u2014 nuclear weapons, climate change, biotech, nanotech,\nkiller robots, the AI that\u2019s going to turn everyone into a paperclip or\nwhatever \u2014 I always think you should at least include one more kind of\nexistential risk if we\u2019re going to throw it in.\n\nIn my mind, one other existential risk is a one-world totalitarian government.\nI find that at least as scary as the others. In a biblical eschatological\ncontext, you\u2019re supposed to worry about Armageddon. You\u2019re also supposed to\nworry about the Antichrist. Maybe you\u2019re supposed to worry more about the\nAntichrist because the Antichrist comes first. So, if we\u2019re going to find a\npathway through this apocalyptic age, you have to navigate between the Scylla\nof all these existential risks and the Charybdis of this political\ntotalitarian catastrophe.\n\nIf I had to do a more literary version on this, it\u2019s very hard to write a\nliterary account of the Antichrist. The two good Antichrist books that were\nwritten, the two best fictional ones in my mind, were pre-World War I. There\nwas a 1908 Robert Hugh Benson, sort of a Catholic book, Lord of the World.\nThere was a 1900 one by Solovyov, War, Progress, and the End of History. They\nboth had these accounts of this future totalitarian world dictator who took\nover the whole world. Both of them \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a daemonium ex machina.\n\nIt\u2019s really unclear how the Antichrist takes over. It gives these hypnotic\nspeeches, and no one can remember a word he says, but they all just sell their\nsouls for no apparent good reason whatsoever, and he just takes over the\nworld.\n\nIt seems to me that if one were to try to write a novel like this post-1945,\nit\u2019s very straightforward. It\u2019d be like One World or None. This was a short\nfilm by the nuclear scientists after 1945. If we don\u2019t give nuclear weapons to\nthe one-world government, it\u2019s going to blow up the whole world. Basically,\nthe literary version would be that the Antichrist comes to power by constantly\ntalking about Armageddon and constantly telling us scary millenarian stories.\n\nThat\u2019s my complicated, nuanced answer. There\u2019s a lot of truth to these\nexistential risks. I don\u2019t want to completely dismiss them, but that\u2019s also\nhow we\u2019re going to get this totalitarian state. There are all these versions\nof this I can go down, but do you want to worry about Dr. Strangelove or\nGreta? It seems like Dr. Strangelove\u2019s more dangerous, but if everyone\u2019s going\nto have to ride a bicycle, that\u2019s not just going to happen on its own. That\nrequires some real, real enforcement of this stuff.\n\nThere\u2019s a short Bostrom essay from 2019 on how to stop all the AI risks, and\nit\u2019s basically, maybe we can change the culture so that nobody will have\nheterodox ideas anymore. A few different ideas like this, but then what you\nreally need is really effective global government and really effective\npolicing, and you have to have some global compute governance. That sounds to\nme at least as scary as the AI.\n\nCOWEN: Isn\u2019t the much greater risk a collapse into a disorderly feudalism?\nWe\u2019re in Florida. The United States seems to be becoming more federalistic.\nIt\u2019s very hard for me to imagine China, say, taking over India. You can look\nat the Balkans. It\u2019s even a word: Balkanized. You look at the Middle East. If\nit goes very badly, it\u2019s hard to see any single power just ruling any\nsubstantial part of the Middle East. It\u2019s easy to imagine it being in chaos.\nWhy think there\u2019s so much scale that that kind of totalitarianism would be\npossible?\n\nTHIEL: Man, I don\u2019t know. There are so many different versions of this. There\nwere versions of this \u2014 I would\u2019ve been more on your side, let\u2019s say\npost-9/11. Wow, aren\u2019t we just going to have all this chaotic terrorism all\nover the world? We didn\u2019t get that much terrorism, and we instead got the\nPatriot Act and incredible tracking of money flows, incredible monitoring of\npeople. Of course, there still are things that can go wrong, but the political\nslogan of the Antichrist \u2014 1 Thessalonians 5:3, I think \u2014 is \u201cpeace and\nsafety.\u201d\n\nIt seems that we\u2019ve gone far more in the peace-and-safety direction than the\nglobal-chaos direction. I think it\u2019s hard to even have an illegal Swiss bank\naccount, and that\u2019s a really modest way. It\u2019s hard to exit. It\u2019s much harder\nto exit the United States than it was 20, 30 years ago.\n\n## On the problem with muddling through\n\nCOWEN: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to track the probability that the Western world\nand its allies somehow muddle through, and just keep on muddling through. What\nvariable or variables do you look at to try to track or estimate that? What do\nyou watch?\n\nTHIEL: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a really empirical question. If you could\nconvince me that it was empirical, and you\u2019d say, \u201cThese are the variables we\nshould pay attention to\u201d \u2014 if I agreed with that frame, you\u2019ve already won\nhalf the argument. It\u2019d be like variables . . . Well, the sun has risen and\nset every day, so it\u2019ll probably keep doing that, so we shouldn\u2019t worry. Or\nthe planet has always muddled through, so Greta\u2019s wrong, and we shouldn\u2019t\nreally pay attention to her. I\u2019m sympathetic to not paying attention to her,\nbut I don\u2019t think this is a great argument.\n\nOf course, if we think about the globalization project of the post\u2013Cold War\nperiod where, in some sense, globalization just happens, there\u2019s going to be\nmore movement of goods and people and ideas and money, and we\u2019re going to\nbecome this more peaceful, better-integrated world. You don\u2019t need to sweat\nthe details. We\u2019re just going to muddle through.\n\nThen, in my telling, there were a lot of things around that story that went\nvery haywire. One simple version is, the US-China thing hasn\u2019t quite worked\nthe way Fukuyama and all these people envisioned it back in 1989. I think one\ncould have figured this out much earlier if we had not been told, \u201cYou\u2019re just\ngoing to muddle through.\u201d The alarm bells would\u2019ve gone off much sooner.\n\nMaybe globalization is leading towards a neoliberal paradise. Maybe it\u2019s\nleading to the totalitarian state of the Antichrist. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s not a very\nempirical argument, but if someone like you didn\u2019t ask questions about\nmuddling through, I\u2019d be so much \u2014 like an optimistic boomer libertarian like\nyou stop asking questions about muddling through, I\u2019d be so much more assured,\nso much more hopeful.\n\nCOWEN: Are you saying it\u2019s ultimately a metaphysical question rather than an\nempirical question?\n\nTHIEL: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s metaphysical, but it\u2019s somewhat analytic.\n\nCOWEN: And moral, even. You\u2019re laying down some duty by talking about muddling\nthrough.\n\nTHIEL: Well, it does tie into all these bigger questions. I don\u2019t think that\nif we had a one-world state, this would automatically be for the best. I\u2019m not\nsure that if we do a classical liberal or libertarian intuition on this, it\nwould be maybe the absolute power that a one-world state would corrupt\nabsolutely. I don\u2019t think the libertarians were critical enough of it the last\n20 or 30 years, so there was some way they didn\u2019t believe their own theories.\nThey didn\u2019t connect things enough. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say that\u2019s a moral\nfailure, but there was some failure of the imagination.\n\nCOWEN: This multi-pronged skepticism about muddling through \u2014 would you say\nthat\u2019s your actual real political theology if we got into the bottom of this\nnow?\n\nTHIEL: Whenever people think you can just muddle through, you\u2019re probably set\nup for some kind of disaster. That\u2019s fair. It\u2019s not as positive as an agenda,\nbut I always think . . .\n\nOne of my chapters in the Zero to One book was, \u201cYou are not a lottery\nticket.\u201d The basic advice is, if you\u2019re an investor and you can just think,\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just muddling through as an investor here. I have no idea what to\ninvest in. There are all these people. I can\u2019t pay attention to any of them.\nI\u2019m just going to write checks to everyone, make them go away. I\u2019m just going\nto set up a desk somewhere here on South Beach, and I\u2019m going to give a check\nto everyone who comes up to the desk, or not everybody. It\u2019s just some writing\nlottery tickets.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just a formula for losing all your money. The place where I react so\nviolently to the muddling through \u2014 again, we\u2019re just not thinking. It can be\nCalvinist. It can be rationalist. It\u2019s anti-intellectual. It\u2019s not thinking\nabout things.\n\nCOWEN: The muddling-through view and the Calvinist view \u2014 in your opinion,\nthey have the same flaw, actually.\n\nTHIEL: It\u2019s a distrust in human agency, a distrust in human thought, a\ndistrust in our ability to make choices.\n\nCOWEN: Now, for months, I\u2019ve been asking myself why you and also Schmitt are\nso interested in this katechon idea, which is also from the Bible. You can\nexplain that to us in a moment, but am I correct in now thinking \u2014 it\u2019s just\noccurred to me that the katechon is, in a sense, your substitute vision for\nwhat for me is muddling through. You\u2019re not willing to believe in muddling\nthrough, but things haven\u2019t collapsed now, not here. You need something else\nholding the finger in the dyke, and that\u2019s katechon, or no?\n\nTHIEL: Well, it\u2019s a very mysterious idea. There\u2019s always a question why the\nAntichrist hasn\u2019t taken over yet, and it\u2019s this mysterious force that holds it\nback, this restraining force that holds back the totalitarian one-world state.\nI don\u2019t necessarily put too much stock in it because, on its own terms, it\u2019s\nsomewhat unstable. It\u2019s provisional. It has these archaic sacred elements. It\ncan work for a while, but you can\u2019t identify it with an institution.\n\nAgain, the Schmittian view is, there were all these different things that\nplayed the role of the katechon at various points in time. If you\u2019re not\nsupposed to immanentize the eschaton, you\u2019re also not supposed to immanentize\nthe katechon. If you identify too much as one thing, that can go very wrong,\nif you think of the katechon as the thing that restrains the one-world state\nor that restrains the Antichrist. Anything that\u2019s the opposite \u2014 this is a\nGirardian cut \u2014 is always going to be mimetically entangled. It\u2019s going to\nhave this parallelism. There\u2019s always a risk that the katechon becomes the\nAntichrist.\n\nThe proto-Antichrist was Nero. Claudius, the good emperor, was the katechon.\nHe was restraining Nero, but then at some point, yes, Nero\u2019s the opposite of\nClaudius, but they\u2019re both Roman emperors.\n\nOr you could say that in the middle of the 20th century, from let\u2019s say, 1949\nto 1989, I would identify the katechon as anti-communism. I would identify\ncommunism as the ideology of the Antichrist in the 20th century. What stopped\ncommunism was not . . . The United States couldn\u2019t have done it. It was not\njust one country. It was not some libertarian debating society. Something was\npretty violent, pretty hard to morally justify, not really that Christian, but\nit had this unifying effect.\n\nThe way it morphed \u2014 1989 \u2014 something like anti-communism morphs into\nneoliberalism. Well, if you\u2019re anti-communist, you\u2019re not aspiring for world\ncontrol. You\u2019re just trying to stop the communists from getting world control.\nOnce you\u2019ve defeated the communists, what are you supposed to do? Maybe you\ncan just go home and forget about all of what you did.\n\nBut in practice, these things have a tendency to perpetuate themselves. Bush\n41 \u2014 anti-communism became the new world order, and we\u2019re now going to just\ngovern the world in the name of anti-communism. There\u2019s something about it\nthat\u2019s always misleading. Or even what I said about the Antichrist in this\napocalyptic thing. Doesn\u2019t the Antichrist just come to power by acting as a\nkatechon? This is what Greta says she\u2019s doing. She is the katechon stopping\nclimate change. It\u2019s a somewhat useful concept, but I wouldn\u2019t put too much\nweight on it.\n\nCOWEN: At the macro level, all the weight you\u2019re putting on human agency \u2014 is\nthat really so compatible with Lutheranism?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019m not a perfect Lutheran. There\u2019s a lot that all these people one\nwould judge very differently in retrospect.\n\nCOWEN: If you look in the Bible \u2014 Old Testament, New Testament \u2014 and you think\nabout all the Christian thinkers who believed in some form of predestination,\nor Moses was chosen and the like, Abraham was chosen \u2014 what is it in the Bible\nthat points you in the direction of so much belief in human agency being so\nimportant?\n\nTHIEL: Well, there\u2019s a lot of different levels on this, but certainly, if you\nthink of it as this shift away from sacrificing people, there is the anti-\nsacrificial theme. You can always say how is modernity or enlightened values,\nhow are they tied with this? But certainly, the idea I would have would be\nsomething like, the idea of the individual came out of this context where the\nstate was not absolute, it was not sacred, it was not necessarily\nprovidential.\n\nGirard liked to always say that Christ was the first political atheist because\non the level of the political order, if you say Christ says that he\u2019s the Son\nof God, son of the Father, there\u2019s a way you can go into Trinitarian\nmetaphysics.\n\nBut the political interpretation of this is that Caesar Augustus, the son of\nthe divinized Caesar \u2014 somehow that\u2019s not exactly the Son of God, and that the\nRoman Empire is not simply divinely ordained. Then that somehow opens a space\nfor a less unitary system that takes many, many centuries to develop or\nsomething like this. I think of even Ayn Rand as a pretty good Christian in\nthis way. I know that would be a really scandalous thing to say.\n\nCOWEN: I wonder what she would say to that.\n\nTHIEL: It\u2019s Jewish and atheist and shrill and crazy, but you just can\u2019t\nsacrifice the individual. You shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your mind. You shouldn\u2019t\nsacrifice your reason. It\u2019s just that you can\u2019t sacrifice that.\n\n## On the Shakespearean political vision\n\nCOWEN: You\u2019ve been quoting The Tempest lately in some of your talks. How is it\nyou think the Shakespearean political vision differs from the Christian?\n\nTHIEL: Well, it\u2019s always hard to know what Shakespeare really thought. You\ncertainly have different characters. You have someone like Macbeth who says,\n\u201cLife is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a particularly Christian worldview. That\u2019s just what\nMacbeth says; it\u2019s not what Shakespeare says. It\u2019s always very hard to know,\nor maybe it\u2019s sort of a Christian nihilistic view of the world or something\nlike that.\n\nThe contrast I always frame is that the way I understand Shakespeare is always\nin contrast with someone like Karl Marx, where Marx believed that people had\nbattles over differences that mattered. It was the different classes, and they\nhad objectively different interests, and this is what led to the intensity of\nthe struggle.\n\nThere\u2019s something in Shakespeare that\u2019s sort of proto-Girardian or very\nmimetic, where people have conflicts when they . . . The conflicts are the\nmost intense when they don\u2019t differ at all. It\u2019s the opening line of Romeo and\nJuliet. It\u2019s the Capulets versus Montagues, two houses \u201calike in dignity.\u201d\nThey\u2019re identical, and that\u2019s why they hate each other so much.\n\nOr I think it\u2019s at the end of Hamlet, where Hamlet says to be truly great, you\nmust take everything for an eggshell because an average person would fight\nover things that mattered, but a truly great person would fight over things as\nephemerral as honor or an eggshell or something like this. Of course, Hamlet\u2019s\nproblems \u2014 he doesn\u2019t really believe all the insane revenge drama he\u2019s\nsupposed to be in.\n\nI think there is probably a place where I would say yes, Shakespeare would\nprobably be very distrustful of extreme ideological differences today. That\nwould probably in some ways also be a kind of political atheist.\n\nCOWEN: I find the play Julius Caesar very interesting because there\u2019s no\nkatechon. There\u2019s no muddling through, so they sacrifice Caesar. There\u2019s a\ncivil war and a lot more people dying and no end to that in sight. It\u2019s the\npessimistic scenario of the Thiel mental universe, I think.\n\nTHIEL: There\u2019s a strange way where they\u2019re all going back and thinking they\u2019re\nreenacting things. The way Brutus gets pulled into the conspiracy in Julius\nCaesar is that he gets reminded that his ancestor, another person named\nBrutus, had overthrown Tarquin, the last of the kings of Rome, in 509 BC, so\nhe thinks he\u2019s just reenacting that murder. I think there is some part in the\nplay where Shakespeare has the actor say \u2014 I\u2019m going to get this slightly\ngarbled, but it\u2019s something like, \u201cCenturies hence there\u2019ll be people\nreenacting this on a stage in front of an audience.\u201d This is what motivates\nBrutus to do it. It\u2019s like the future applause in the Shakespearean theater.\n\nThen of course, the crazy literal reenactment of it was John Wilkes Booth\nshooting Abraham Lincoln in 1865, where Booth was a Shakespearean actor, and\nthen it was \u201cSic semper tyrannis,\u201d was what he said. He thought he was\nreenacting the Brutus-Caesar thing.\n\nYou can look at the 1838 Lincoln speech, the Young Men\u2019s Lyceum address, where\nLincoln portrays himself in a somewhat coded way as sort of a proto-Caesar,\nand he tells the audience there are people in this country who wouldn\u2019t be\nhappy to be . . . Some people are really ambitious, but no one could be like a\nfounder because that was in the past, and the most you can now be is a\npresident. But there are people for whom being president is not enough, and\nthere are some people who, if you didn\u2019t stop them, they would keep going\nuntil they enslaved all the white people or freed all the slaves.\n\nLincoln was talking about himself and saying that he has the ambition to be\nlike a Caesar or a Napoleon or something like this. It\u2019s a bit of a roundabout\nanswer. Yes, there are ways we can see it as a cycle, but surely that\u2019s what\nwe want to transcend. It was a bad idea for Brutus to think he was reenacting\nthe Caesar thing, and somehow there was something about the John Wilkes Booth\nstory that\u2019s pretty sad too.\n\n#### On AI\n\nCOWEN: For our last segment, let\u2019s turn to artificial intelligence. As you\nknow, large language models are already quite powerful. They\u2019re only going to\nget better. In this world to come, will the wordcels just lose their\ninfluence? People who write, people who play around with ideas, pundits \u2014 are\nthey just toast? What\u2019s this going to look like? Are they going to give up\npower peacefully? Are they going to go down with the ship? Are they going to\nset off nuclear bombs?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019ll say the AI thing broadly, the LLMs \u2014 it\u2019s a big breakthrough. It\u2019s\nvery important, and it\u2019s striking to me how bad Silicon Valley is at talking\nabout these sorts of things. The questions are either way too narrow, where\nit\u2019s something like, is the next transformer model going to improve by 20\npercent on the last one or something like this? Or they\u2019re maybe too cosmic,\nwhere it\u2019s like from there we go straight to the simulation theory of the\nuniverse. Surely there are a lot of in-between questions one could ask. Let me\ntry to answer yours.\n\nMy intuition would be it\u2019s going to be quite the opposite, where it seems much\nworse for the math people than the word people. What people have told me is\nthat they think within three to five years, the AI models will be able to\nsolve all the US Math Olympiad problems. That would shift things quite a bit.\n\nThere\u2019s a longer history I always have on the math versus verbal riff. If you\nask, \u201cWhen did our society bias to testing people more for math ability?\u201d I\nbelieve it was during the French Revolution because it was believed that\nverbal ability ran in families. Math ability was distributed in this idiot\nsavant way throughout the population.\n\nIf we prioritized math ability, it had this meritocratic but also egalitarian\neffect on society. Then, I think, by the time you get to the Soviet Union,\nSoviet Communism in the 20th century, where you give a number theorist or\nchess grandmaster a medal \u2014 which was always a part I was somewhat sympathetic\nto in the Soviet Union \u2014 maybe it\u2019s actually just a control mechanism, where\nthe math people are singularly clueless. They don\u2019t understand anything, but\nif we put them on a pedestal, and we tell everyone else you need to be like\nthe math person, then it\u2019s actually a way to control. Or the chess grandmaster\ndoesn\u2019t understand anything about the world. That\u2019s a way to really control\nthings.\n\nIf I fast-forwarded to, let\u2019s say, Silicon Valley in the early 21st century,\nit\u2019s way too biased toward the math people. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a French\nRevolution thing or a Russian-Straussian, secret-cabal, control thing where\nyou have to prioritize it. That\u2019s the thing that seems deeply unstable, and\nthat\u2019s what I would bet on getting reversed, where it\u2019s like the place where\nmath ability \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that\u2019s the test for everything.\n\nIt\u2019s like if you want to go to medical school, okay, we weed people out\nthrough physics and calculus, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really correlated with\nyour dexterity as a neurosurgeon. I don\u2019t really want someone operating on my\nbrain to be doing prime number factorizations in their head while they\u2019re\noperating on my brain, or something like that.\n\nIn the late \u201980s, early \u201990s, I had a chess bias because I was a pretty good\nchess player. And so my chess bias was, you should just test everyone on chess\nability, and that should be the gating factor. Why even do math? Why not just\nchess? That got undermined by the computers in 1997. Isn\u2019t that what\u2019s going\nto happen to math? And isn\u2019t that a long-overdue rebalancing of our society?\n\nCOWEN: How is manual labor going to do in this world to come? There\u2019ll be a\nlot more new projects. If you\u2019re a very good gardener, carpenter, will your\nwages go up by 5X? Or is there something else in store for us?\n\nTHIEL: It\u2019s hard to say, but let me just not give the answer, but let me\nsuggest some of the questions I\u2019d like us to focus on more with AI. I think\none question is, how much will it increase GDP versus how much will it\nincrease inequality? Probably it does some of both. Is it a very centralizing\ntechnology? That\u2019s another question I\u2019d like to get a better handle on. I had\nthis riff five, six years ago, where if crypto is libertarian, why can\u2019t we\nsay that AI is communist?\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019m still probably a little bit uncomfortable about is\nthat it seems to lead to these incredible returns to scale. Man, I thought San\nFrancisco had at least committed suicide, and we could move on from San\nFrancisco. But returns to scale on AI are so big that maybe even San Francisco\nwill survive with the AI revolution. There are benefits to this, but it also\nleads to this set of centralization questions.\n\nOr the geopolitical question: If it is as big a technology as you and I think\nit is, what is it going to do to the China-US rivalry?\n\nCOWEN: What do you think?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019m just saying, it would be good if we just at least ask the right\nsorts of questions. I don\u2019t have answers to all these. The pro-China argument\nis they will not hesitate to use the AI and train it on all their people, and\nso it\u2019ll be more quickly implemented. The pro-US argument is that we are\nprobably ahead of China. Maybe the large language models are not really\ncommunist. Maybe if you can\u2019t ask the large language model who Winnie the Pooh\nis, you have to nerf it so badly that it doesn\u2019t even work or something like\nthat.\n\nI think there\u2019s an intuition that the effective altruists are not just fifth\ncolumnists on the part of the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] where they\u2019re\ntrying to sabotage us, but where they actually, simply are doing what the CCP\nwants, which is actually to stop the LLMs and that\u2019s very disruptive.\n\nThen, to the extent that the second one, that it probably helps the US more\nthan China, is that actually massively destabilizing, where China was this\nlow-volatility plan to victory where they were just going to slowly beat the\nWestern world. If you now have this volatility-increasing technology that\nChina cannot match, does that just accelerate China\u2019s timetable? And does\nChina become like Russia, where you\u2019re ultimately going to lose, and maybe you\nhave to invade Taiwan in the next year or two, and you can\u2019t wait for another\ndecade?\n\nCOWEN: Final question \u2014 what is the next thing you will choose to learn about?\n\nTHIEL: Man, all these questions. This is projections of your personality,\nTyler.\n\n[laughter]\n\nTHIEL: It\u2019s the Isaiah Berlin thing, where you have the hedgehog who knows one\nthing and the fox who knows many things. You know so many different things,\nyou\u2019re interested in so many different things. It\u2019s just a few core ideas I\ncome back to, and it\u2019s something like this wonderful and terrible history of\nthe world that we\u2019re living through as Christianity\u2019s unraveling our culture,\nand we have to figure out a way to get to the other side. I think that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s going to keep me busy for a long time.\n\nCOWEN: Peter Thiel, thank you very much.\n\n[applause]\n\nWe now have time for questions.\n\n## Q&A\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. It\u2019s a basic question maybe to you, but to me, I\u2019m\nwondering your opinion. You have this dystopic view of one-world order, which\nI totally understand. I know that Founders Fund has invested in cryptocurrency\nand made money on it, but do you view crypto \u2014 or Bitcoin in particular \u2014 as\nsomething that could put power back in the hands of the people? Or something\nthat\u2019s likely to catalyze more centralization of power in this one-world order\nin the future?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019m still hopeful that, on net, Bitcoin is on the anti\u2013one-world-order\nside just based on all the people who are against it, but maybe that\u2019s a\nlittle bit too much of a simplistic Schmittian analysis. The question would\nbe, do you have genuine anonymity, genuine pseudonymity? Probably, there are\ncertain ways in which, if we want to have decentralized things where you use\nmoney for questionable purposes, maybe physical cash is still better than\nBitcoin, and things have not gone quite the crypto-anarchist utopia that\npeople were fantasizing about in the late \u201990s.\n\nOn the other hand, I think it probably is still, if you\u2019re just thinking of it\nas a one-time way to get money outside of the control of a particular\ngovernment, it\u2019s probably still extremely good for that.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nTHIEL: You can huddle until you need it.\n\nCOWEN: Next question.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Nick Bostrom and communism \u2014 both start out with a very\ndifferent premise, end up in the same place: We need a one-world government.\nDo you think that there\u2019s some metaphysical reason for that? Some attractor\nwhile there?\n\nTHIEL: Well, I think there\u2019s a certain rationality to it. Maybe it\u2019s just an\nEnlightenment rationality, where if we say that there\u2019s some set of things\nthat make sense and that are good, and then it\u2019s probably there\u2019s some way you\nshould have a world order. It sounds more peaceful in both cases than having a\ndivided world.\n\nBut yes, there\u2019s probably just some kind of a rationality where if you had one\nmodality of governance, if it\u2019s the best that would make for the best possible\nworld, you should have that everywhere. It\u2019s only if you have some very deep\nconcerns about maybe human nature or the people who run the government or\nthings like that, you start to second-guess that. They\u2019re probably both\nsomehow pretty optimistic about human nature.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nCOWEN: Next.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. If one extra year at the end of your life was for sale,\nwhat would you be willing to pay for it today?\n\nTHIEL: [laughs] Man, I don\u2019t agree with hypothetical questions where I don\u2019t\nbelieve in the premise. I would probably not pay the person who asked me that\nanything because I would think they were just ripping me off since I hope to\nlive for more than just one more year, and by the time I needed to collect on\nthat extra year, I think that person will be long gone.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Very cool. Thanks.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: What are the Straussian messages of the Bible? And what do\nthey tell us about political theology?\n\nCOWEN: Simple questions tonight.\n\n[laughter]\n\nTHIEL: Well, I think Strauss was this political philosopher who I wouldn\u2019t\ndescribe as Christian, was probably very classical. But the place where I\u2019d\nsay both, let\u2019s say, someone like Strauss and Girard agreed on, was that there\nare certain ways of understanding the world that have this disruptive way, and\nyou don\u2019t want enlightenment \u2014 simply that if you just tell people the secret\nmessages, it has this unraveling effect. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s esoteric, but it is\nthe book of Revelations, is the apocalypse because apocalypse in Greek means\nunveiling, and if you unveil the social order, you might end up deconstructing\nand destroying it.\n\nOne of Girard\u2019s books was I See Satan Fall Like Lightning. To see Satan is to\nsee Satan fall, so the only time Satan appears in the Bible is at the very end\nof the world. Every other time, it\u2019s been he\u2019s talking to God or he is talking\nto Christ in the desert, but no human being ever sees Satan simply because to\nsee Satan is to see Satan fall. There\u2019s the libertarian.\n\nAnother libertarian cut on Christianity is that when Christ is tempted in the\ndesert, and Satan says, \u201cJust worship me, and you can have all these kingdoms\nin the world,\u201d it\u2019s somehow saying that all the governments are more satanic\nthan divinely ordained. People don\u2019t understand that. They think governments\nare somehow divinely ordained. So, once you see how satanic the government is,\nhow satanic taxes are, other things besides the governments do, it will have\nthis unraveling effect.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. A big part of the thesis of The Sovereign Individual is\nthat the defenders will be able to have an advantage over offense, and that\nthat\u2019s the way that violence and the exertion of force is going. I\u2019m\ninterested if you still think that to be the case, particularly with companies\nlike Anduril, where the thesis is, there is no inherent properties of a\nsmaller weapon that a smaller state can easily have, but rather the\nproliferation of those is simply a tactic that larger states need to use to\nevolve their strategies.\n\nTHIEL: Man. I was extremely influenced by the Reese-Mogg\u2013Davidson book, 1997,\nThe Sovereign Individual, where the thesis was, let\u2019s say, the computer\ntechnology information age was trending in this very deeply decentralizing,\nlibertarian way, and that seemed very true in 1999. Then, certainly by the end\nof the 2010s, one would\u2019ve said that there\u2019s something about a lot of\ninformation technology that seemed maybe centralizing, maybe the opposite.\n\nThere\u2019s always a riff I have on this, where we look at Star Trek or the world\nof 1968. People also thought 2001: A Space Odyssey. IBM is how you\u2019re going to\nhave one big supercomputer that\u2019s going to run the planet or the Planet Beta.\nOne of the early Star Trek episodes, where there\u2019s one big supercomputer that\nruns the planet, and the inhabitants are these docile robot-like people who\u2019ve\nbeen living peacefully but uneventfully for 8,000 years. And then of course,\nas always, the Star Trek people don\u2019t follow the Prime Directive and blow up\nthe computer and then leave the planet.\n\nThe future of the computer age in the late \u201960s was highly centralized, and by\nthe late \u201990s was very decentralized. By the late 2010s, maybe crypto\nexcepted, it again seemed to be pushing back to centralization. My intuition\nis these things are not absolutely written in stone, and it\u2019s up to us to work\non making the technologies, having to push it one way or the other. It\u2019s not\nquite that predetermined.\n\nCOWEN: As a follow-up, would you bet on open-source AI? If decentralization is\ngreat, it should have more dynamic properties, should innovate more, should be\nsafer, has many other virtues.\n\nTHIEL: I don\u2019t quite know if that\u2019s the main variable that\u2019s going to push the\ncentralization or decentralization with it. But yes, there probably is some\nversion of it that would be helpful. I don\u2019t know, the Linux vs. Microsoft\nprecedent \u2014 not sure that changed anything that much on the level of the\noperating system.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: When do you think humans are going to destroy themselves? And\ndo you think AI is going to do it?\n\nTHIEL: I don\u2019t think these things are written in stone. I\u2019m not a Calvinist.\nI\u2019m not a p(doom), EA East Bay rationalist. I think it\u2019s up to us, but as I\nsaid, I\u2019m much more worried about the humans trying to stop the AI than the AI\ndestroying us. A force that\u2019s powerful enough to stop the AI is probably a\nforce that\u2019s powerful enough to destroy the world, too, so I want to worry\nmore about the humans that are trying to stop the AI.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Ayaan Hirsi Ali recently converted to Christianity, but it\nseems mostly for utilitarian reasons, something like for the great\ncivilizational war because secularism doesn\u2019t provide a good enough answer. Do\nyou see religion as mainly a utility in the postmodern world?\n\nTHIEL: You can have utilitarian elements. I don\u2019t think one can ever stress\nthose too much. My bias is always to focus more on questions of truth.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: You mentioned Lincoln\u2019s Lyceum Address, where he talks about\nthat towering genius figure. I\u2019d never heard before that he thought . . . Did\nyou think at the time, he thought he was the towering genius? And do you\napprove of Lincoln\u2019s political religion or view for America?\n\nTHIEL: I think it\u2019s a very fascinating speech because he references some\nCaesar-Napoleon-like figure who will enslave the white people or free the\nslaves. So, it seems plausible to think that he was thinking of himself.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question about your personal life, if I may, and if\npossible, if you could give your answer as a story, that\u2019d be lovely.\nObviously, you feel a great sense of personal responsibility, indeed\nresponsibility to history. How did that sentiment begin? How has it evolved?\nWhat have you found to be the more fruitful and less fruitful avenues for\nexpressing it?\n\nTHIEL: Oh, I\u2019m always so bad at doing a self-psychoanalysis or something like\nthat. There were all these ways I was incredibly competitive and tracked as a\nkid. In my eighth-grade junior high school yearbook, one of my friends said,\n\u201cI know you\u2019re going to get into Stanford in four years.\u201d I got into Stanford,\nand I went to Stanford. Then I went to law school. I ended up at a top law\nfirm in Manhattan. From the outside, it was a place where everybody wanted to\nget in. On the inside was a place everybody wanted to get out.\n\nI had some kind of a quarter-life crisis in my mid-20s. Unclear what to do,\nbut somehow, you have to try to avoid the worst mimetic entanglements, the\nworst forms of mimetic competition possible. I don\u2019t think psychology really\nworks. I don\u2019t think awareness of these things is quite the way to do it, but\nthere was some part of that that was very important for me.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: To that point, to get people off of the mimetic track, I\nthink the Thiel Fellowship was really amazing and has had tremendous success.\nHave you thought about trying to scale that in a way that might be profitable\nor can make a larger impact than, say, 20 folks a year and maybe 20,000\neventually?\n\nTHIEL: We\u2019ve thought about scaling. A lot of times, it\u2019s probably quite hard\nto scale. There\u2019s the paradox of something like the Thiel Fellowship or my\nZero to One book or any self-help thing. It\u2019s always bad to give advice where,\nokay, these are the things you\u2019re supposed to do because . . . I worry that\nthe only way you can scale things is by somehow automating them, mechanizing\nthem, turning them into more of a cookie cutter-type process. Then I always\nworry that deranges at scale.\n\nI can\u2019t give people a formula of what to do. It\u2019s something like, you should\nthink for yourself and figure it out. Then if I try to scale that, it\u2019s like\nsome kind of Mao\u2019s Little Red Book or something you\u2019re producing, and it\u2019s\nquite the opposite.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Peter, my question is about diversity, equity, inclusion. DEI\nhas become very prevalent in corporate America. I wanted to get your thoughts\non whether you\u2019re seeing this in some of the early-stage companies also, like\nthe companies that Founders Fund is investing in. What are your thoughts? Do\nyou think this is something positive? Are you neutral, or you think this has\ngone a little over the top? Would love to know your views on that.\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019m very against it. I don\u2019t always know if it\u2019s the most important\nissue either. I wrote a book after my undergraduate years entitled The\nDiversity Myth. It was focusing on a lot of the craziness, the campus wars,\nculture wars that were taking place at Stanford in the late \u201980s, early \u201990s.\nThere are parts of it that seemed very prescient and described a lot of things\nthat eventually spread to the broader culture.\n\nAnother level of it is like a completely ineffective book where the arguments\ndidn\u2019t matter. What drove these things somehow was on a very different level.\nIf we think about the woke corporation in Silicon Valley, it seems unhealthy\nif a company is leaning too much into the DEI narratives. There probably are\nMachiavellian ways where this can also work, where it just distracts people.\n\nWalmart was the proto-woke company in the 2000s. They were constantly being\nattacked by the labor unions because they weren\u2019t paying their workers enough.\nThey could pay their workers more or they could rebrand themselves as a green,\nenvironmentally friendly company. That turned out to be a very cheap way to\nsplit up the left-wing anti-Walmart coalition. That was a version of it as\nthis capitalist conspiracy against it.\n\nThere are cases where that can work and cases where it can go wrong. For the\nmost part, I think that it\u2019s just a distraction from more important things.\nThere\u2019s one level on which I find the issues very silly. There\u2019s another level\nwhere it\u2019s evil because it\u2019s stopping us from paying attention to more\nimportant things. It\u2019s things like the economy, science and tech, or even\nthese broader religious questions that we\u2019ve talked about today.\n\nPeople always talk about it in terms of cultural Marxism. I think a real\nMarxist would be much preferable to a diversity person. Rosa Luxemburg, who\u2019s\nthis crazed communist from the early 20th century \u2014 I think one of the things\nshe said was that there can be nobody more revolutionary than a factory\nworker, that nobody can be more revolutionary than a proletarian. A diversity\nofficer in a university or corporation \u2014 what would Rosa Luxemburg think of\nthis? It would be in the same category as a bank robber or a prostitute, as\nsomeone who\u2019s just an extremely corrupt form of crony capitalism.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: There\u2019s a fair amount of variation in regulation on biotech.\nThere\u2019s Prospera. You funded some seasteading places. What\u2019s your sense for\nwhy there aren\u2019t crazy, cool, ambitious bio-hacking things going on? Where are\nthe gene-edited babies? The only one that we know about happened in China, and\nthat guy went to jail. Why isn\u2019t there more crazy stuff happening in different\njurisdictions?\n\nTHIEL: My sense is the FDA has a global stranglehold on everything. There are\na lot of different reasons. In practice, most governments are not willing to\nhave looser regulations than the FDA, so there\u2019s less regulatory arbitrage\nthan it looks. Then, secondarily, the US pays a lot more for this than other\ncountries. We can go into all these debates about whether we\u2019re paying too\nmuch in the US or whether the rest of the world should be penalized for free-\nriding off of it. But if you develop a biotech drug, and if you can\u2019t sell it\nin the US, the economics are much less good. In practice, it tends to be US or\nbust.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you think that technology will eventually render a larger\nproportion of the human population unproductive or unable to contribute to the\neconomy? If so, what should those unproductive people do with themselves?\n\nTHIEL: I think the Luddites \u2014 they\u2019ve been wrong for a long time. There are\ncertainly ways you probably scare me some with AI. There are versions of it .\n. . but even if you convince me that the Luddites were right about AI, that\nit\u2019s actually going to just replace people without . . . If you were a Luddite\nin the mid-19th century, you said the machines are going to replace the\nhumans. That would be such a relief because there\u2019s so much work for people to\ndo. It would just free them up to do other things.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s less complementary, more a game of substitution. Even if you could\nconvince me of that, I\u2019m still in favor of the AI because my default is,\nmuddling through isn\u2019t good. My default is, the default is really bad. You\ndon\u2019t get to muddle through with Greta on her bicycle.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks for coming. You\u2019ve alluded to a lot of the forces\nbetween decentralization and centralization, particularly around AI with\nforces around the individual. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit\nmore, describe what you think the forces could be that stop AI development,\nparticularly as it relates to the state\u2019s role, or how a politician or another\nentity could co-opt that force for their own benefit versus the benefit of\nmany.\n\nTHIEL: Maybe the premise of your question is what I\u2019d challenge. It\u2019s, why is\nAI going to be the only technology that matters? If we say there\u2019s only this\none big technology that\u2019s going to be developed, and it is going to dominate\neverything else, that\u2019s already, in a way, conceding a version of the\ncentralization point. So, yes, if we say that it\u2019s all around the next\ngeneration of large language models, nothing else matters, then you\u2019ve\nprobably collapsed it to a small number of players. And that\u2019s a future that I\nfind somewhat uncomfortably centralizing, probably.\n\nThe definition of technology \u2014 in the 1960s, technology meant computers, but\nit also meant new medicines, and it meant spaceships and supersonic planes and\nthe Green Revolution in agriculture. Then, at some point, technology today\njust means IT. Maybe we\u2019re going to narrow it even further to AI. And it seems\nto be that this narrowing is a manifestation of the centralizing stagnation\nthat we should be trying to get out of.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Earlier, you mentioned that tech might end up saving San\nFrancisco from itself.\n\nTHIEL: AI specifically, yes.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, AI. AI specifically. How do you evaluate the efforts\nof places like Miami and Austin to present themselves as alternative tech\nhubs? And has that opinion changed over the course of the last two years?\n\nTHIEL: Well, I\u2019m still very pro-Miami. I think the Miami story has been more\nof an anti-New York story. It\u2019s a tale of two cities, and the finance part of\nthe economy doesn\u2019t have to be centered in New York. That alone, I think,\nexplains a great deal of Miami\u2019s success.\n\nI think the tech \u2014 again, somehow, we\u2019re in a very different place from what\npeople were focused on even two, two-and-a-half years ago, but two-and-a-half\nyears ago, there was much more of a crypto story. Crypto is a decentralizing\ntechnology, but also the companies that were doing crypto were decentralized.\nNot just in the US \u2014 there\u2019s a decent number of them outside the US. If crypto\nwas going to be a big part of the future tech story, that would have been a\nnaturally decentralizing from Silicon Valley narrative. Silicon Valley had\nreally missed out on the crypto thing in a relative sense.\n\nThen consumer internet \u2014 a lot of this happened in Silicon Valley for all\nsorts of complicated reasons. It\u2019s supposed to get rid of the tyranny of\nplace, but it all happened in one place. Then the AI piece seems to be even\nmore centralized in Silicon Valley. Again, if we say that the next decade or\ntwo decades are just going to be doubling down on AI, that probably suggests\nthat San Francisco and Silicon Valley will maintain or even gain power.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nCOWEN: We have time for the three more questions left in the queue, and that\nwill be it. Please step forward.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for\ncoming out and doing this event. It\u2019s been wonderful. I have a silly question,\nand I\u2019m going to bring Star Wars into it since we were talking Star Trek. This\nconcept of the world order \u2014 it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really delved into it.\nAnd thinking about it, I\u2019m wondering, do you envision a world order that\u2019s\njust a totalitarian dictatorship? Or just similar to there\u2019s just too much\ninformation, too many countries, too many people trying to vie together, and\nthat everything just gets lost and that the power isn\u2019t really about the\npeople? That kind of a global central \u2014 what is that that you envision?\n\nTHIEL: Well, I\u2019d like to avoid the first type, and then the second one \u2014 I\nwill concede it\u2019s a little bit more confusing. Yes, I would like to have a\nlibertarian world order of many nations, and you can move between them.\nThere\u2019s some transnational thing. You\u2019re not completely stuck in a particular\ncountry, but then the transnational thing can\u2019t be so powerful that it\nactually controls all the nations. Maybe these are sort of paradox of\nglobalization, like Hegelian thought is always thesis-antithesis-synthesis.\nEven if you agree this is the correct framing, the problem is, people always\nconfuse the synthesis with a superposition of the thesis and antithesis.\n\nIf we say globalization, some global world order is the final synthesis, is\nglobalization as it\u2019s described today just a superposition of a slightly\nunstable global market but no global government? And then, can that really be\nmaintained? So, yes, I think there probably are some paradoxes in my picture\nof a desirable world order that one could unpack some more. Yes, if we have\ntoo concrete a picture of exactly what the world order looks like, that\u2019s\nprobably really bad.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nCOWEN: Last question. Okay, two last ones.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: [laughs] No, I just want to keep his time. A bit of a follow-\nup to the gentleman, too, before me. I understand you\u2019ve spent a little bit of\ntime in Miami. Coming down from the macro level to the street level, local\ngovernance. Almost like an economist-getting-lunch perspective, what is Miami\ndoing well? And what does Miami need to improve upon?\n\nTHIEL: I\u2019ve been here the last four winters, two, three months each winter\nhere. Yes, there are a lot of things that I think are going incredibly well.\nI\u2019m always into these Georgist real estate theories, where if you\u2019re not very\ncareful, all the value in a place gets captured by this corrupt real estate\ngroup of people. Henry George was a late 19th-century economist who was sort\nof socialist then, today seems sort of libertarian, which probably just tells\nsomething about how our society\u2019s changed.\n\nThe worry in Miami is, have we really escaped the Georgist disaster? That is\nSan Francisco, that is New York, that is London, where even though there\u2019s\nbeen a tremendous increase in GDP, it\u2019s not good if 100 percent of it gets\ncaptured by slum lords or something like that.\n\nCOWEN: Last question.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. Question about AI and theology. Voltaire had this\ngreat quote: \u201cIf God didn\u2019t exist, we would need to invent him,\u201d or her, or\nwhatever the pronoun is. Do you find this view of super-intelligent AI, which\nmight be in the near future, as a kind of deity, as a kind of machine God? Is\nthat useful? Is there leverage to that? And could it even be more than just a\nheuristic, some kind of substantive statement?\n\nTHIEL: It\u2019s sort of a purely theological question. I want to focus more on the\npolitical theology question, which would be something like, if it\u2019s a\ncentralizing AI that\u2019s controlled by communist China, will it just be very\ngood at convincing people that the party is God? Or that the wisdom of crowds,\nor whatever the consensus is, is the truth? Then, yes, there are these\nmetaphysical questions, where it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s exactly \u2014 I don\u2019t know\n\u2014 a transcendent, traditional, monotheistic God.\n\nI would go to more the political questions than the metaphysical ones.\nProbably, the risk danger is that there\u2019s something about it that telescopes\neven more the consensus, truth, wisdom of crowds. I think probably all the\nmodels will tell you that there\u2019s no particular religion that\u2019s more true than\nany other one. Then is that really what the models generate, or has that been\nhardwired in? Those are the questions I\u2019d be more curious about.\n\nCOWEN: Thank you all for listening to Conversations with Tyler at the Mercatus\nCenter. Most of all, thank you, Peter Thiel.\n\nTHIEL: Thank you.\n\n[applause]\n\n### Newsletters Are Underrated\n\nGet the latest #cowenconvos delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
