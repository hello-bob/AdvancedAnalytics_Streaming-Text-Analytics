Rivos addresses this need through\nour recompile-not-redesign approach,\u201d said Puneet Kumar, co-founder and CEO of\nRivos. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for Matrix\u2019s vote of confidence in this approach and\npleased to welcome Romit to the Board.\u201d\n\nRivos provides power optimized chips combining high performance server-class\nRISC-V CPUs and a Data Parallel Accelerator (a GPGPU optimized for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and data analytics) that work with today\u2019s software\nprogramming models and rack server constraints. The tight integration of CPU\nand parallel computation sharing a uniform memory across DDR DRAM and HBM is\nideal for today\u2019s models and databases that need terabytes of memory. Rivos is\none of the leaders of the RISC-V open ecosystem. Calista Redmond, CEO of\nRISC-V International, commented: \u201cRivos quickly became an active participant\nin the community. The depth of experience from the Rivos engineers has enabled\nRISC-V to leap ahead in ISA, system and security specifications.\u201d On the\nsoftware side Rivos was an instigator of the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE)\ninitiative.\n\n\u201cExpanding the application of data analytics and large language models to\nencompass not just traditional data types such as text, images, and video, but\nalso genomic and medical data, unlocks unprecedented opportunities for\ninnovation in research and treatment,\u201d remarked David Goel, Managing General\nPartner of Matrix Capital Management. \u201cThe Rivos team has adeptly integrated\nthe groundbreaking new RISC-V architecture with an inventive accelerator,\neffectively bringing this vision to life. Their prototype chip serves as a\ncompelling demonstration of their unique capability to leverage the advanced\nTSMC 3nm process node - a feat few startups have managed to achieve. We\neagerly anticipate furthering our support for the company's move into new\nrealms of achievement, marking each milestone with shared enthusiasm and\ncommitment to excellence.\u201d\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, CA, with offices in the USA, UK, EU and Asia,\nRivos is hiring engineering talent across multiple disciplines.\n\nAbout Rivos\n\nFounded in May 2021, Rivos has assembled a world class team of silicon,\nsoftware and platform designers. The company is backed by premier financial\nand strategic investors who share its long term vision of building industry-\nleading power efficient, high performance, secure server solutions, based on\nRISC-V, using workload-defined hardware. Rivos supports the intense\nrequirements of the large language models and data analytics that will remake\nthe enterprise, by providing the full solution of optimized chips combining\nRISC-V CPUs and a Data Parallel Accelerator, a reference multi-chip OCP\nmodular server, and a full firmware-to-application open software stack.\nCustomer workloads are easily deployed using their existing models giving an\nimmediate TCO benefit. Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, with offices in the\nUSA, UK, EU and Asia, Rivos is hiring engineering talent across multiple\ndisciplines.\n\n## Contacts\n\npr@rivosinc.com\n\n### Rivos\n\n## Social Media Profiles\n\n  * Rivos on LinkedIn\n\n## Contacts\n\npr@rivosinc.com\n\n## Search\n\n  * Log In\n  * Sign Up\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\n## More from Business Wire\n\n  * Blog\n  * UK/Ireland\n  * Deutschland\n  * France\n  * Hong Kong\n  * Italy\n  * Japan\n  * Tradeshownews.com\n\n## Business Wire Information\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * UK Tax Strategy\n  * Privacy Statement\n  * Manage Cookies\n  * Terms of Use\n  * \u00a9 2024 Business Wire\n\nInternet Explorer presents a security risk.
