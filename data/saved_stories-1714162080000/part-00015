in\ncapital spending\n\nPublished Thu, Apr 25 20248:18 PM EDT\n\nJordan Novet@jordannovet\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Microsoft\u2019s demand for consumption-based artificial intelligence services in the cloud is outstripping supply, CFO Amy Hood said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n  * The company will again materially bump up capital expenditures in the current quarter, she said.\n  * Capital expenditures jumped 79% from a year earlier to $14 billion in the latest quarter.\n\nAmy Hood, chief financial officer at Microsoft, speaks during a presentation\non affordable housing in Bellevue, Washington, on Jan. 17, 2019.\n\nChona Kasinger | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft is increasing spending at a rate not seen since at least 2016. It\nstill might not be enough.\n\nIn its earnings report on Thursday, Microsoft said capital expenditures jumped\n79% from a year earlier to $14 billion. The company is spending much faster\nthan it\u2019s increasing revenue \u2014 sales climbed 17% in the period.\n\nEven with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center\ninfrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models.\n\n\u201cWe do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit,\u201d Microsoft CFO Amy Hood\ntold analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nCompanies need an ever-increasing amount of compute to run hefty workloads,\nadding human-like generative AI features into their products. It\u2019s a boom that\nwas kicked off by OpenAI and its ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft has followed\nsuit, adding assistants to the Teams communication app, Bing search engine,\nand other services. The technology can summarize meeting transcripts, compose\nemails and explain information from the web.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only AI hardware vendor with a supply challenge.\n\nNvidia, the biggest developer of processors for training and deploying\ngenerative AI models, has been supply constrained, with revenue more than\ntripling in consecutive quarters. Now Microsoft, one of Nvidia\u2019s major\ncustomers, is feeling the stress.\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, revenue in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud rose 31%,\nwith 7 percentage points from AI. Hood said that the capacity issue might have\naffected AI results and will have an impact in the fiscal fourth quarter. A\nsupply limitation means Microsoft has less available capacity to rent out to\nclients for deploying AI models at the inference stage, she said.\n\nAzure is key to Microsoft\u2019s future, contributing tens of billions of dollars\nin revenue every quarter and growing faster than most other parts of the\ncompany. Within Azure, AI services stand out as a highlight, attracting new\nclients as Microsoft goes up against Amazon Web Services.\n\nHood said that capital expenditures will increase \u201cmaterially\u201d in the current\nquarter, mainly for cloud infrastructure. And she called for higher capital\nexpenditures in the new fiscal year, beginning July 1.\n\nMicrosoft intends \u201cto scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud\nand AI products,\u201d she said.\n\nWATCH: Microsoft\u2019s capex increase for AI infrastructure is not a surprise,\nsays Deepwater\u2019s Gene Munster\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:1104:11\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s capex increase for AI infrastructure is not a surprise, says\nDeepwater\u2019s Gene Munster\n\nFast Money\n\nTV\n\nSquawk BoxWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Squawk on the Street 09:00 am ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
