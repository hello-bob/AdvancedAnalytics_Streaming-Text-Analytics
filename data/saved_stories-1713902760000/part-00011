We believe, that\nfoundational technologies, like many computer algorithms, programming\nlanguages, and increasingly AI models, should be free for everyone and\navailable in source code form. The computational geometry kernel that lies at\nthe basis of Computational Engineering, is such a technology.\n\nPicoGK (\u201cpeacock\u201d) is a compact geometry kernel tailor-made for Computational\nEngineering. All of LEAP 71\u2019s Computational Engineering Models and the\nresulting objects are based on PicoGK. PicoGK incorporates other Free and\nOpen-Source projects, notably OpenVDB. The PicoGK viewer is based on GLFW, an\nopen-source 3D user interface toolkit.\n\nPicoGK stands for Pico (tiny) Geometry Kernel and provides an intentionally\nreduced but robust instruction set that can be used by Computational\nEngineering Models. LEAP 71 is committed to providing more open-source code in\nthe future, to enable wide-spread adoption of this new paradigm, which, we\nthink, is going to change the profession of engineering forever.\n\nThe first module that we are releasing in addition to PicoGK, is the LEAP 71\nShapeKernel, an abstraction layer for computational geometry, that makes it\neasier to build sophisticated parts.\n\nThe fundamental PicoGK Runtime module is written in C++. The higher level\nPicoGK code and the LEAP 71 ShapeKernel are written in C#, an elegant, high-\nperformance, strongly-typed language, which gives us the power and confidence\nto create sophisticated algorithms that generate advanced technical objects.\n\nPicoGK is actively developed and maintained by LEAP 71, and available for free\nunder the permissive Apache 2.0 open-source license, which allows both\ncommercial and non-commercial use.\n\nBy making PicoGK and other parts of our technology stack widely available, we\nhope to contribute to the adoption of this new paradigm and start building an\nactive community of Computational Engineers.\n\nTo explore the PicoGK source code and get started, please head over to the\nLEAP 71 GitHub.\n\nContact us\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\nExplore\n\n  * Follow\n\nGetting ready to move rocket thruster development to a new level, using our\n#ComputationalEngineering Model for space propulsion RP/CEM.\n\nLet\u2019s build some #turbomachinery\n\nThat satisfying feeling when the parts emerge from the #3dprinter - thanks\n@mimotechnik for another great print of a large #heatexchanger created through\nour #ComputationalEngineering Model.\n\nWith the #cherryblossoms in full bloom while we are visiting Japan, we\ncouldn\u2019t resist posting a #quasicrystal #sakura edition.\n\nIndustrial #3dprinting enables us to build electric motors that are\nsignificantly more capable than conventional ones.
