The first was the \u201cTaught Me Science\nFallacy,\u201d which goes something like this: Isaac Asimov writes about science\nand particle physics, so if I read the Foundation trilogy, I might learn what\na neutrino is. (Kingsley Amis argued in his influential New Maps of Hell in\n1960 that, at the very least, the \u201caim\u201d of sci-fi was to do \u201cjustice to the\nlaws of nature.\u201d) But while it is theoretically possible for someone to learn\nscience from a science fiction novel, it would probably be foolish to read the\nentire Foundation trilogy\u2014concerning a secret tribe of \u201cpsycho-historians\u201d who\ndesign millions of years of future history before it happens\u2014to learn\nsomething. In fact, if you read the Foundation trilogy and put it down\nthinking, \u201cAh, a neutrino!\u201d then you very likely missed the point of that\nridiculous and absorbing set of novels.\n\nAMERICAN SCIENCE FICTION: EIGHT CLASSIC NOVELS OF THE 1960s by Poul Anderson,\nClifford D. Simak, Daniel Keyes, Roger Zelazny, R.A. Lafferty, Joanna Russ,\nSamuel R. Delany and Jack Vance, edited by Gary K. Wolfe\n\nLibrary of America, 1,500 pp., $75.00\n\nSecond, and more annoying, is the \u201cPredictive Fallacy.\u201d This suggests that\nscience fiction might accurately describe what the world will be like 100\nyears after we\u2019re dead. This argument usually runs along the line of: \u201cArthur\nC. Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey, and guess what? A few years later we\nwent to the moon!\u201d Or it cites the various occasions when some story described\ntelevision sets, microwaves, escalators, and two-way video phone calls and\nthen, voil\u00e0, they happened. But of course, sci-fi novels\u2014both good and bad\u2014are\nlittered with gadgets that happened and didn\u2019t happen; what they never foresaw\nwas how (and usually how poorly) those inventions would be implemented. Show\nme one novel that predicted something like Fox and Friends, or The View. You\ncan\u2019t do it. (Oh, well, maybe C.M. Kornbluth\u2019s \u201cThe Marching Morons.\u201d But\nlet\u2019s move on.)\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the \u201cCautionary Fallacy,\u201d which suggests that science fiction\nprovides urgent warnings about our collective need to prepare for world-\nhammering comets, nuclear war, climate catastrophe, totalitarian mind-control,\nand so forth. In support of this fallacy, people say things like: \u201cGeorge\nOrwell warned us about the Thought Police, and now we\u2019ve got Nancy Pelosi!\u201d\n(\u201cI don\u2019t want to predict the future\u2014I want to prevent it\u201d was a line often\nattributed to Ray Bradbury.) The idea that human beings require explicit\nfictional warnings about their increasingly world-destroying stupidities seems\nlike an exercise in futility, doesn\u2019t it? And by the way, science fiction has\nlong warned readers about things like climate catastrophe\u2014but nothing was done\nabout it. And the imminence of totalitarianism. (Check.) And even the suicidal\nridiculousness of mutually assured nuclear destruction\u2014and guess what? We have\nmore bombs than ever.\n\nThe science fiction novels of the 1960s\u2014as this two-volume collection of eight\nvery different sci-fi novels testifies\u2014remain enjoyable because they got\neverything wrong. They didn\u2019t accurately predict the future of space travel,\nor what a postnuclear landscape would look like, or how to end intergalactic\nfascism. They didn\u2019t warn us against the roads we shouldn\u2019t travel, since they\nprobably suspected we were going to take those roads anyway. And they\ndefinitely didn\u2019t teach us what a neutrino is. But what \u201960s science fiction\ndid do was establish one of the wildest, widest, most stylistically and\nconceptually various commercial spaces for writing (and reading) fiction in\nthe history of fictional genres. Each book is unpredictable in so many ways as\nto almost constitute its own genre.\n\nTake, for example, Samuel R. Delany\u2019s influential space opera, Nova (presented\nhere in a newly corrected, author-approved text), which takes the concept of\nthe \u201ccybernetic\u201d fusion of human and machine and runs with it. Nova envisions\na universe boiling over with star-hopping spaceships, spine-socketed crew\nmembers, weirdly mutated sexual and familial relationships, synesthetic video-\nart instruments, and at least one character raised on another planet who\nspeaks in a verb-delaying syntax several years before Yoda was a gleam in\nGeorge Lucas\u2019s eye. (\u201cNot too good going to be is. Out of practice am.\u201d)\nDelany\u2019s prose was stylistically bright, fizzing with ambitious energy (he\nbegan publishing novels in his late teens and won several major awards early)\nand relentlessly inventive, with flashy new visions of the future in one\nparagraph after another.\n\nThen there\u2019s Jack Vance, who also wrote about incomprehensibly far-off futures\nthat weren\u2019t driven by the splashy intergalactic military conflicts of his\nGolden Age predecessors, such as E.E. Doc Smith or Robert A. Heinlein.\nInstead, Vance\u2019s futures are marked by rich, panoramic socioeconomic systems.\nOne of his best is Emphyrio, which charts the coming of age of a young\neconomic adventurer named Ghyl Tarvoke in a galaxy ruled by \u201clords\u201d and\n\u201cladies\u201d who flit from star to star in their luxury space-liners while planet-\nbound artisans must produce beautiful objects for them to buy and enjoy.\nPeople rarely blast each other with laser pistols in a Vance novel; they are\nmore likely to buy one another out or break their distribution chains. (In\nthat way, he is similar to his friend and contemporary, Frank Herbert.) Yet,\nlike Delany, Vance can suggest vast, unimaginable strangenesses in a few\nsentences, such as when he describes a far-future County Pavilion where\nhighborn elites come down from their \u201ceyries\u201d to mix with the lower orders:\n\n> Back and forth along the floor stepped the dancers, graceful-grotesque,\n> grotesque-graceful. There were simulations of a hundred sorts: clowns,\n> demons, heroes; folk from far stars and ancient times; creatures of fantasy,\n> nightmare, faery. The pavilion was rich. There was glitter of metal, the\n> soft sheen of silk; gauze in every color; black leather, black wood, black\n> velvet.\n\nJust as it\u2019s impossible to read early William Gibson without seeing the\ninfluence of Delany, it\u2019s equally impossible to read Gene Wolfe\u2019s far-future\nscience fantasies without seeing the influence of Vance.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Poul Anderson who, even in what might be considered his more\n\u201ctraditional\u201d version of space opera, wrote continually surprising books. The\nHigh Crusade was originally published in Astounding by the influential and\nexasperating John W. Campbell, who also published the best early work of\nAsimov and Heinlein, as well as L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s early Dianetics essays. Like\nmany Campbell-inspired writers, Anderson was a \u201clibertarian,\u201d and he once\nwrote a science fiction novel in which the world is oppressed by an evil\nsocialist empire. In The High Crusade, a band of medieval British holy\ncrusaders gets diverted from France by an invasion of alien tyrants, but the\njoke, of course, is on the alien tyrants. The knights quickly demolish the\ninvaders, ride their horses onto the captured spaceship, and fiddle a few\nknobs until they figure out how to traverse space and fire futuristic\nweaponry. Then\u2014the stars! Anderson\u2019s work is often held up as an example of\n\u201chard S.F.,\u201d which relies on scientific accuracy. (Yeah, knights in steel\narmor prancing around spaceships on horses. Science.)\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to encapsulate the wide variety of styles and stories\ncontained by these Library of America volumes, but many of the best never even\nleave Earth. There\u2019s the classic Flowers for Algernon, told through the diary\nof a mentally limited young man as he is subjected to an intelligence-\nenhancing drug. Or Way Station, a perfect example of Clifford D. Simak\u2019s often\npoetic and moving \u201crural S.F.,\u201d in which a Civil War soldier, enlisted by a\ngalactic federation, maintains a secret travel stop for star-hopping aliens in\nthe Wisconsin woods. (Simak was another of Campbell\u2019s regulars who advocated\n\u201cplausible\u201d science fiction.) Or Roger Zelazny\u2019s Hugo Award\u2013winning This\nImmortal (here published under Zelazny\u2019s preferred title, And Call Me Conrad)\ndescribing a post\u2013nuclear holocaust Earth populated by both prewar cultures\nand new, mutant ones. (In the event of an actual nuclear holocaust, we should\nbe so lucky.)\n\nFinally, two more novels that are as unlike one another as they are unlike any\nof the other novels in these volumes. In Joanna Russ\u2019s Picnic on Paradise,\nfar-future tourists are guided across an alien war zone by a young, lithe\nbarbarian woman, time traveled in from the past; Past Master, by R.A.\nLafferty, concerns a future war between Mankind and armies of \u201cmechanical\nkillers,\u201d to which Saint Thomas More is summoned from the past, the logic\nbeing: What Mankind requires is someone who is capable of doing the \u201cright\u201d\nthing, and More did the right thing once\u2014so might as well give him another\ntry. And that\u2019s easily the most plausible bit in the entire book, which is\notherwise packed with Lafferty\u2019s typically irascible comic genius. If the\nmanically inventive Flann O\u2019Brien had been transported to Oklahoma as a young\nboy and taken a correspondence degree in engineering, he might well have\nturned into R.A. Lafferty.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the unwinnable games of both assembling and reviewing such a\nmonolithic-looking collection to ask\u2014what shouldn\u2019t have been left out? The\nonly thing I miss from this generally optimistic set of novels\u2014in which\nhumanity successfully expands throughout the universe, overcomes its worst\ninventions, and always survives to fight another day\u2014is one of those really\nblack, bleak, and hilarious novels by either Thomas M. Disch (in The\nGenocides, his proud God-worshipping humans stand tall against alien invaders\nand are abruptly slaughtered\u2014after which things get much worse) or John Sladek\n(in Mechasm, the military-industrial complex invents a machine with one sole\npurpose\u2014to devour everything it finds and use its materials to endlessly\nmanufacture iterations of itself). Now those are two predictions about our\ncollective future that possess, for me, credibility.\n\nScott Bradfield\n\nScott Bradfield\u2019s most recent book is Reading Great Books in the Bathtub:\nEssays & Reviews 2005\u20132021.\n\nRead More:\n\nBooks, Culture, Critical Mass, Science Fiction, Poul Anderson, R.
