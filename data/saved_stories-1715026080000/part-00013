Some Britons believe that\nany such arrangement would be capitulating to \u201cwoke ideology.\u201dIllustration by\n\u00c1lvaro Bernis\n\nCharles Townley, one of Britain\u2019s first great collectors of antiquities, was\nborn in Lancashire in 1737. A distaff descendant of the aristocratic Howard\nfamily, he was educated mostly in France\u2014a common path for a well-born\nCatholic Englishman. Elegant and intelligent, Townley was, according to an\nearly biographical sketch, eagerly welcomed into Continental society, \u201cfrom\nthe dissipations of which it would be incorrect to say that he wholly\nescaped.\u201d As a young adult, he returned to England and installed himself at\nthe family estate, having come into a lavish inheritance. But before long he\nset off for Italy, in what would be the first of three visits. In a dozen\nyears, he amassed more than two hundred ancient sculptures, along with other\nobjects.\n\nIt was a good moment for a man of means to build such a collection. Many\nItalian nobles were seeing their fortunes dwindle, and could be persuaded to\npart with inherited objects for the right price. In Naples, Townley bought\nfrom the Principe di Laurenzano a Roman bust of a young woman with downcast\neyes, identified as the nymph Clytie. (Later, Townley humorously referred to\nClytie as his wife, though he was not the marrying kind.) Excavations were\nthen under way at Hadrian\u2019s Villa, the retreat that the Emperor had built\noutside Rome, and collectors raced to buy art works as soon as they were\nremoved from the ground. An \u00e9lite dealer named Thomas Jenkins, who kept a\nplace on the Via del Corso for displaying ancient wares, sold Townley, among\nother objects, a statue of a naked, muscled discus thrower. From the\nseventeen-eighties onward, Townley showed off his collection in his London\ntown house, near St. James\u2019s Park. A painting by Johan Zoffany, first\nexhibited under the title \u201cA Nobleman\u2019s Collection,\u201d depicts Townley and\nseveral friends in a library crammed with dozens of marbles, including a\nseven-foot Venus on a pedestal\u2014her arm raised and her draperies lowered. In\nthe background are wooden cabinets in which Townley presumably housed smaller\ntreasures, including countless cameos and intaglios.\n\nTownley\u2019s museum was said to rank below only a handful of other private\ncollections in Europe in breadth and quality. According to Max Bryant, the\nauthor of a 2017 monograph on Townley and his house, the collection also\nreflected \u201can eighteenth-century attitude to art that itself has become lost\nto modernity.\u201d At the time, ancient sculptures were typically restored right\nafter being excavated\u2014often boldly. Scholars have concluded that Clytie\u2019s\nbosom was enhanced to accentuate the bust\u2019s erotic charge; Townley\u2019s\ndiscobolus, unearthed in a state of decapitation, was fitted with a head from\na different sculpture.\n\nIn 1791, Townley was made a trustee of the British Museum. The first national\npublic museum, it was established by an act of Parliament, in 1753, and was\ninitially formed around the collection of Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish\nphysician and businessman. When Townley died, in 1805, the museum acquired his\nsculptures for the then considerable sum of twenty thousand pounds, and a\ngallery showcasing them opened three years later.\n\nBut Townley\u2019s collection was soon decisively eclipsed. By 1810, aficionados of\nancient sculpture had begun clamoring to see a different cache of ancient\nmarbles, which was being housed in a shed in Mayfair. One young artist,\nBenjamin Robert Haydon, wrote, of seeing the works, \u201cI felt as if a divine\ntruth had blazed inwardly upon my mind, and I knew that they would at last\nrouse the art of Europe from its slumber in the darkness.\u201d These sculptures\ncame not from Italy but from Ottoman-occupied Athens, where they had been\npried from, or otherwise collected around, the ruins of the Parthenon, at the\ninstruction of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin.\n\nIn 1799, Lord Elgin, a Scottish nobleman thirty-odd years Townley\u2019s junior,\narrived in Constantinople as Britain\u2019s Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. The\nproject of removing the marbles from the Parthenon, the fifth-century temple\non the Acropolis, and shipping them to Britain took more than a decade\u2014about\nhalf of the original five-hundred-and-twenty-four-foot frieze was removed, as\nwere a number of life-size statues from the pediments. Elgin originally\nintended to install all of it at Broomhall, his ancestral home, northwest of\nEdinburgh. But he ran into financial difficulties, and in 1816 the Parthenon\nmarbles, plus dozens of other sculptures from the Acropolis, were acquired\nfrom Elgin by Parliament for the British Museum. The price, thirty-five\nthousand pounds, was set by comparison with the Townley collection, but the\nesteemed sculptor Joseph Nollekens declared, \u201cI reckon them very much higher\nthan the Townley marbles for beauty.\u201d\n\nThe arrival in Britain of what became known as the Elgin Marbles encouraged an\nappreciation of the aesthetics and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks over\ntheir later Roman copyists. The display of the marbles\u2014eventually, in a\ncustom-built gallery considerably larger than the one featuring Townley\u2019s\ncollection\u2014also helped establish the practice of leaving fragmentary statues\nunrestored. Although the acquisition of the Elgin Marbles was controversial\nfrom the start (Lord Byron decried their removal from the Acropolis as\nvandalism), the sculptures\u2019 significance was immediately acknowledged. They\nwere so prized, in fact, that soon after Greece became an independent state,\nin 1830, it demanded the statues back\u2014a request that British diplomats have\nconsistently rejected.\n\nOver time, the reputation of Townley\u2019s marbles steadily declined. The gallery\ndedicated to his collection was demolished in 1841, during an expansion of the\nmuseum, and many sculptures that he\u2019d acquired migrated to storerooms. Already\nhidden away were the cameos, intaglios, and other small items from his\ncollection, which had been acquired from his heir in 1814. Many of these\nobjects had not been thoroughly documented, and this meant that when some of\nthem started disappearing nobody even noticed that they were gone.\n\nIn the past year or so, the British Museum has been wrestling\u2014often in public,\nand often to its considerable embarrassment\u2014with what might be characterized\nas the twin legacies of Townley and Elgin. In late 2022, reports emerged that\nthe chair of the museum\u2019s trustees, George Osborne, was in negotiations with\nthe Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and that a deal might be struck\nto allow the Parthenon Sculptures, as they are now commonly called, to be\nsent, in some fashion, to Greece. Many Britons have long favored resolving the\ndiplomatic stalemate; others branded the notion outrageous. Soon after Osborne\nbecame chair, a headline in the Daily Express warned, \u201cdon\u2019t let british\nmuseum or elgin marbles be caught by woke ideology.\u201d Not long afterward, the\nmuseum was jolted by scandal when it was revealed that hundreds of\nobjects\u2014including cameos and intaglios once owned by Townley\u2014had been stolen,\nand some of them sold off, over a period of many years, apparently by a member\nof the museum\u2019s own curatorial staff. The Daily Mail contributed a typically\nlurid summation: \u201chunt for priceless gems stolen in netflix-style heist.\u201d\n\nThe sensational headlines were somewhat misleading: in the context of ancient\narcheology, the term \u201cgem\u201d typically refers not to diamonds or rubies but to\nengraved semiprecious stones or objects cast from glass. Enlightenment-era\nconnoisseurs such as Townley sometimes bought the less valuable of these\nobjects by the handful. (Cameos are carved in raised relief, intaglios in\nnegative relief.) Their ancient owners prized them as miniature works of art.\nAccording to Martin Henig, a senior academic visitor at the University of\nOxford\u2019s School of Archaeology, Roman emperors appear to have given cameos,\nwhich were conveniently portable, as tributes or gifts to secure political\nalliances. Even quite ordinary people might aspire to own a glass gem, set in\na signet ring, depicting a god or a mythological figure of personal\nsignificance. A glass gem discovered at a Roman fortress near the city of\nOxford features a horse and a cornet, suggesting that its owner was a horn-\nplaying member of the cavalry. Henig told me, \u201cThe best of the cameos, and the\nbest of the intaglios, were probably much more highly valued than sculptures,\u201d\nwhich were often mass-produced in workshops. The designs of such artists as\nDioskourides, a gem engraver who worked for Emperor Augustus, were extremely\ncoveted. Today, the most prized gems can sell for hundreds of thousands of\ndollars. For scholars, the importance of the gems lies not just in their\nbeauty but also in the light their iconography sheds on ancient concerns and\npreoccupations.\n\nThe uproar over the Townley thefts and the controversy over the Elgin\ndiscussions mean that the British Museum has been in the headlines to an\nunusual extent for a cultural institution, even one that was last year\u2019s most\nvisited tourist attraction in London. But it was inevitable that the British\nMuseum would become the focus of scrutiny. The museum, a repository of more\nthan eight million artifacts from around the world, most of them acquired\nduring Britain\u2019s reign as an imperial overlord, holds not just classical\nsculptures but also Anglo-Saxon weapons, Chinese ceramics, Assyrian wall\npanels, and the Rosetta Stone. Along with similar institutions, such as the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, the British Museum has increasingly\nfaced ethical questions about how it amassed its collection. In addition to\nbeing petitioned by the Greeks, the British Museum is being challenged for its\nholding of bronzes looted in the late nineteenth century by British forces\nfrom the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in what is now southern\nNigeria. Restitution claims have also been made regarding sacred objects from\nEthiopia.\n\nThe Townley thefts were facilitated by the fact that curators had never fully\nrecorded many of the objects in internal catalogues or databases. Indeed, it\nwas reported that individual records for some 2.4 million items at the British\nMuseum were lacking, calling into question its long-standing, and sometimes\narrogantly expressed, claim to be an unimpeachable custodian for vulnerable\nartifacts. For some observers, it was an irresistible irony that actual thefts\nhad occurred at an institution long accused of cultural theft. When a British\nTV channel asked viewers to contribute ideas for end-of-year jokes, the museum\nwas the butt of the winning entry: \u201cDid you hear about the Christmas cake on\ndisplay in the British Museum? It was Stollen.\u201d\n\nThe British Museum has never been merely a trove of exquisite art works. It\nwas also intended, through the depths of its holdings, to be an archive of the\nworld\u2014a library of things. It was established by eighteenth-century polymaths\nas an expression of the Enlightenment conviction that universal truths might\nbe arrived at through intellectual inquiry and scientific reason. The museum\u2019s\nwildly disparate collections could never be compiled today, which is both the\ninstitution\u2019s strength and its point of weakness. Why should the sarcophagi of\nEgyptian kings or the fragments of ancient Greek architecture be housed in\nLondon, and claimed in some sense as British? Townley, Elgin, and the other\nmen whose acquisitions filled the institution\u2019s galleries would not have\nthought of such questions; today they are, rightly, unavoidable. At a certain\npoint in a museum\u2019s history, it becomes more than just a repository of the\ncultural and artistic past, telling a story about the history of a nation, or\na people, or the world. It also becomes a museum of itself\u2014of its formation,\nits collecting history, its priorities, and its failings.\n\nThe British Museum\u2019s painful self-examination might never have occurred had it\nnot been for the persistence of Ittai Gradel, a Danish dealer and collector of\nantiquities. Gradel does not hunt for discoveries in the excavated ruins of\npalaces and temples, as his eighteenth-century predecessors did. Instead, he\nhas often sifted through that twenty-first-century site of buried\ntreasure\u2014eBay. He has worked at universities in Denmark and in the U.K., and\nhas a special interest in ancient cameos and intaglios. But he was not suited\nto academic life, seeing himself more in the lineage of gentleman collectors\nwho combined scholarship and connoisseurship with the thrill of discovery.\n\nA few years ago, Gradel paid two thousand euros to a German auction house for\nwhat was described online as a group of nineteenth- and twentieth-century\ncameos. He later confirmed what he had suspected immediately on examining a\nphotograph of one of the pieces: it was an ancient Roman cameo of Germanicus\nCaesar which Johann Winckelmann\u2014the German scholar who is considered the\nfather of Western art history\u2014had described as one of the finest examples he\u2019d\never seen. The cameo\u2019s whereabouts had been unknown for more than two hundred\nyears. Gradel told me recently, \u201cWhat I am looking out for is the mistakes,\nand the stupidity, of other dealers and auction houses. That is where the\nbargains are.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen years ago, Gradel was offered a reserve of glass and stone\ngems from another dealer. The objects purportedly came from an estate sale\nconducted in the North of England in the early twentieth century. Between 2010\nand 2013, Gradel bought almost three hundred of them. He sold a few and kept\nthe rest. The gems were of such quality and quantity that he assumed they were\npart of an old aristocratic collection gathered on a Grand Tour; he had a\nhunch that they might have once belonged to the Howard family, whose estate,\nin North Yorkshire, is now known for its prominent appearance in the 1981\nadaptation of \u201cBrideshead Revisited.\u201d The family had sold some precious-stone\ngems to the British Museum in the Victorian era, and Gradel theorized that\nthese less valuable glass gems may have been sold off around the same time.\nLooking for information about a possible Howard connection, he sent inquiries\nto curators in the British Museum\u2019s Department of Greece and Rome, but\nreceived no response. Meanwhile, Gradel told me, \u201cmore and more of these gems\nkept turning up\u2014the vender would say these were the last, and then he would\nopen another drawer, and there were some more gems. I concluded, frankly, that\nhe was elderly and a bit dotty.\u201d After 2011, the supply began to dwindle, and\nGradel was informed that the seller, whose name was Paul Higgins, had died.\n\nNot long afterward, similar gems started appearing on eBay. Gradel made\ninquiries about the origins of these items, and the seller said that he\u2019d\ninherited them from his grandfather Frank Nicholls, an antique-shop owner in\nYork, who had died in 1953. Gradel checked the grandfather\u2019s name against\nrecords available online; the details aligned, except that Nicholls\u2019s year of\ndeath was actually 1952. It was the kind of mistake, Gradel figured, that\ncould easily happen when information was passed down through a family. But he\nnoticed something peculiar: this seller\u2019s name was also Paul Higgins. \u201cI\neventually asked him specifically if he was related to this first Paul\nHiggins, who was now deceased, from whom I had bought a lot of similar gems\nsome years before,\u201d Gradel recalled. \u201cHe replied, \u2018He\u2019s no relation of mine.\nBut I agree it\u2019s an odd coincidence.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis Higgins seemed ignorant of the value of what he had, sometimes asking\nonly forty or fifty pounds for objects that Gradel could tell were worth far\nmore, possibly as much as several thousand pounds. Sometimes he felt moved to\nenlighten the seller about the true value of his wares. Gradel spent a hundred\nand fifty pounds on a ring that he felt, based on the seller\u2019s photograph, was\nso well preserved it had to be a fake\u2014in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, imitations of ancient gems had proliferated among collectors. But\nwhen the ring arrived he was amazed to discover that it was original, dating\nfrom the third century B.C. \u201cSo I wrote to him and said, \u2018I made a mistake.\nNow I have it in hand, I realize it is the real deal,\u2019 \u201d Gradel told me. He\noffered to return it, or to pay an additional five hundred pounds. The seller\naccepted the cash. \u201cYou can say that was jolly decent of me,\u201d Gradel\nexplained. \u201cBut it was also, of course, because I wanted to be in his good\nbooks. If he had more items in his drawers, I would like for him to come to me\nfirst.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other weaknesses?\u201d\n\nCartoon by Kaamran Hafeez and Helene Parsons\n\nLink copied\n\nAfter Gradel bought a cast-glass gem from the seller, he was delighted to\ndiscover that, according to an eighteenth-century catalogue, it had once\nbelonged to none other than Charles Townley. Gradel was a bit surprised,\nhaving believed that all of Townley\u2019s gems had gone to the British Museum. He\nconcluded that this one must have been disposed of in some other fashion, and\nthought no more about it.\n\nGradel\u2019s interactions with the eBay seller, though, grew more and more\nperplexing. At one point, the seller listed a group of items very similar to\nthe ones he\u2019d said had come from his grandfather\u2019s shop, but asserted that\nhe\u2019d bought this cache in a junk shop. Gradel explained to me, \u201cThese types of\nancient glass objects are not that common, so it would be a bit strange that\nhe himself happened to stumble across a batch of exactly the same type. It was\nnot impossible, but it was an uncanny coincidence.\u201d It was also weird, he\nthought, that the seller had bought the items in a junk shop in the first\nplace, given his apparent ignorance of their value and provenance. But Gradel\nreassured himself that the seller was simply \u201cclueless,\u201d because many of the\nobjects \u201cwere totally misdescribed.\u201d\n\nExcept when they weren\u2019t. \u201cSome of the objects were absolutely correctly\ndescribed online as ancient,\u201d Gradel said. \u201cThat was also odd.\u201d Gradel began\nto think that the seller was hiding something: \u201cEvery bit of evidence could be\ninnocently explained, but the sum total began to appear rather strange.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2016, something even stranger happened: the seller posted on eBay a\nfragment of an onyx cameo featuring a young woman in profile alongside\nPriapus, the god of fertility. Gradel recognized the fragment as one that had\nbeen described in a 1926 British Museum catalogue of engraved gems and cameos.\nThe cameo, Gradel said, was not listed on the museum\u2019s Web site, however, and\nhe still believed that the seller was acting in good faith: \u201cEven though it\nwas clearly a case of theft from the museum, it apparently in all probability\nhad taken place many, many years ago\u2014before his grandfather had died, in\n1952.\u201d He made inquiries about buying the fragment, only to be told by the\nseller that he\u2019d posted it in error: it actually belonged to his sister, who\ndid not want to let go of it. Gradel continued to buy from the seller until\n2018.\n\nIn May, 2020, Gradel was checking the British Museum\u2019s Web site when he made\nan alarming discovery: a photograph of the cameo fragment depicting the girl\nand Priapus. So it did belong to the museum. On eBay, however, the cameo\u2019s\ngold mount had been removed. \u201cClearly, the museum\u2019s photo could not possibly\npredate 1952\u2014that told me the provenance story was a lie,\u201d Gradel said. \u201cAnd\nif the seller had been lying to me about that, I could trust absolutely\nnothing he had told me.\u201d He went back through his records and discovered that\nthe name on his final PayPal receipt, from 2018\u2014the only one recent enough to\nremain accessible on his online account\u2014was not Paul Higgins but Peter Higgs.\nIn a phone conversation with a colleague in the U.K., Gradel described his\nconfusion. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t understand it, his real name is Peter Higgs, and\nhe\u2019s been lying, and there\u2019s some trickery going on.\u2019 And my colleague said,\n\u2018You do realize, don\u2019t you, that that\u2019s the name of a curator at the British\nMuseum?\u2019 And then all my hair stood on end.\u201d If the thief was a professional\ncurator, then Gradel had been tricked in more ways than one: the improper\nvaluations of some items hadn\u2019t been a sign of ignorance but, rather, a crafty\nway for Higgs to disguise his identity.\n\nA colorful array of glass gems allegedly stolen by Peter Higgs. Left to right:\nan intaglio of Jupiter; a cameo of a dog; a cameo of a bearded man.\n\nAbout a year earlier, Gradel had been offered, via a middleman, a fragment of\na stone gem being sold by a retired dealer and collector, Malcolm Hay; after\nexamining it, he had decided against buying it. Later, he had found this gem,\ntoo, listed on the British Museum\u2019s Web site, and passed word on to Hay.\nGradel then learned that the gem had come from the same eBay seller with whom\nGradel had done business. In the summer of 2020, Hay alerted the museum that\none of its catalogued objects had been offered on the open market. He was told\nthat the matter would be investigated. At the time, the pandemic had closed\nthe museum to visitors, and curators were working from home. \u201cI should have\nthought it was a fairly simple task of going into the strong room and checking\nwhether the object was there,\u201d Gradel said. \u201cBut there was no urgency, because\nthere was lockdown, and museum employees couldn\u2019t get into the museum anyway.\nSo the thief couldn\u2019t steal anything else.\u201d\n\nLeft to right: an intaglio of Bacchus; an intaglio of Minerva; an intaglio of\na Roman youth.Photographs courtesy Trustees of the British Museum\n\nThe museum reopened in August, 2020, allowing only a limited number of\nvisitors and staff. By early 2021, as far as Gradel knew, an inquiry into\nHay\u2019s claim had not been completed, so he wrote an e-mail to the museum\u2019s\ndeputy director, Jonathan Williams, outlining in detail the compromising\ninformation he had gleaned about three items that appeared to have been stolen\nfrom the museum: the Townley gem, the onyx cameo, and the Hay fragment. He\nshared what he knew about the identity of the seller, and named Peter Higgs,\nthe British Museum curator, as the likely culprit. In the e-mail, Gradel noted\nwith dismay that the museum had apparently left \u201cTownley gems lying around for\nover 200 years without ever doing even the most cursory registration,\u201d adding,\n\u201cThe lack of registration would have been an open invitation to a thief, since\nno one would then miss them . . . and their presence in the collections could\nnever be proven once they had left\u201d the British Museum. There was, he\ndeclared, \u201cno decent explanation of what I have here discovered.\u201d\n\nSeveral months after Gradel wrote his letter, the British Museum announced a\nnew chairman of its board of trustees: George Osborne, the former Conservative\nParty politician and the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016.\nOsborne was born to inherited wealth and social rank\u2014he is the heir apparent\nto the baronetcy of Ballentaylor and Ballylemon, an Irish title\u2014and was best\nknown as the architect of austerity, a policy of radical public-spending cuts\ninitiated when the Tories took power in 2010. Austerity rendered Osborne\ndeeply unpopular\u2014thousands booed him when he appeared at a sporting event\u2014and\nhis political career was cut short in 2016, when he and Prime Minister David\nCameron found themselves on the losing, pro-E.U. side of the Brexit\nreferendum.\n\nMany cultural observers were dismayed that a man who had inflicted harsh cuts\non British cultural institutions would now help lead the country\u2019s most famous\nmuseum. But none could dispute that he was peerlessly connected in the realms\nof politics and finance. It was also easy to imagine that Osborne might wish\nto burnish a new legacy for himself.\n\nBy the time Osborne took over as chair, a major refurbishment of the museum\nhad long been scheduled. The museum\u2019s director, Hartwig Fischer, who\npreviously oversaw the state collections in Dresden, had been appointed, in\n2016, with the forbidding mandate of creating a master plan to renovate the\nmuseum and improve its displays, allowing them to be modernized so as to show\ncollections more coherently. Plans had also been laid for a new archeological-\nresearch facility in Reading, forty miles outside London. (It opens later this\nyear.) The museum\u2019s trustees likely hoped that Osborne, with his ties to\ninternational finance, would be instrumental in raising the billion pounds of\nprivate money reportedly required to finance these projects.\n\nOsborne, for his part, was eager to resolve the seemingly intractable problem\nof the museum\u2019s possession of the Parthenon Sculptures. Not long after being\nappointed to the board, he reportedly met privately in London with Prime\nMinister Mitsotakis. In subsequent months, the men continued their unofficial\nconversation, eventually arriving at the idea that some of the sculptures\ncurrently in London might be brought to Athens; reciprocally, the Greeks would\nlend for temporary exhibition some treasures from their museums which had\nrarely, if ever, left the country. (The Mask of Agamemnon, a gold funerary\nmask from Mycenae, now on display at the National Archaeological Museum in\nAthens, was mentioned in media reports as one possibility.) The proposal fell\nfar short of the full restitution that has long been Greece\u2019s stated aim, but\ninterested observers expressed confidence that language could be found to\navoid the inflammatory term \u201cloan,\u201d the use of which would imply an\nacknowledgment\u2014unacceptable to the Greeks\u2014that the Parthenon Sculptures are\nlegitimately owned by the British Museum. (One euphemism that has been\nconsidered, they said, is \u201cdeposit.\u201d)\n\nAlthough the Parthenon is now considered the ultimate representation of Greek\nnational identity, when Lord Elgin arrived in Constantinople, in 1799, Athens\nhad been under Ottoman rule for more than three hundred years. The Acropolis\nwas then home to a jumble of buildings, including not just the ancient\ntemple\u2014which, for a time, had been turned into a Christian church\u2014but also a\nFrankish tower and various seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Turkish\nstructures.\n\nCartoon by Christopher Weyant\n\nLink copied\n\nLord Elgin became interested in the Parthenon Sculptures before he saw them.\nHe commissioned several artists, including an Italian painter, Giovanni\nBattista Lusieri, to go to Athens to draw the marbles, hoping that such images\nmight inspire new developments in the arts and crafts of Britain. (Elgin had\nconsidered hiring a promising young British artist for the task, but was put\noff by the fee demanded; as a result, J. M. W. Turner was not sent to Greece\nto render the ruins.) In 1801, the governing Turkish authority apparently\ninformed an emissary of Elgin\u2019s in Athens that fallen pieces of the temple\ncould be excavated and removed. Once work began at the site, this permission\nwas very liberally interpreted both by Elgin\u2019s representatives, who started\ncutting sculptures off the building, and by the Turkish authorities, who\nappear to have been bribed to ignore such actions.\n\nAccording to William St. Clair\u2019s book \u201cLord Elgin and the Marbles,\u201d by the\ntime Elgin first visited Athens, in 1802, many of the Parthenon Sculptures\nwere already in packing cases, ready to be sent by sea to England. The journey\nwas perilous. One of the ships carrying the heavy cargo sank off the\nPeloponnesian coast, requiring an expensive salvage job. Elgin\u2019s own return to\nEngland, in 1803, had a major disruption: he arrived in Paris just before war\nwas declared between Britain and France, and was detained as a prisoner of war\n(albeit partly in a Pyrenean spa town). Some three years passed before he\nreturned to Britain. When he did, he found himself ensnarled in a costly\ndivorce that, together with the vast expenses he had incurred to obtain the\nParthenon Sculptures, ultimately led him to sell the marbles to Britain.\n\nThe museum\u2019s accession of the marbles was always controversial, not least\nbecause any original documentation of Elgin\u2019s agreements with the Turkish\nauthorities was lost. (Only a copy, in Italian translation, remains.) The\nscholar and British Museum trustee Mary Beard, in her book \u201cThe Parthenon\u201d\n(2002), writes that after Greece gained independence from Ottoman rule it made\na priority of highlighting its national ancestry. Part of this project was to\nturn the Acropolis into a monument to the fifth century B.C. by removing\neverything that wasn\u2019t classical from the site. Buildings erected in later\neras were demolished, and shattered columns were resurrected. Beard writes\nthat the director of excavations hailed the site as \u201ccleansed of all barbaric\nadditions, a noble monument to the Greek genius.\u201d For the newly established\nnation, the temple\u2019s symbolic potency was made all the greater by its earlier\noccupation and ravaging. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the Greek\nminister in London unsuccessfully requested that the frieze fragments be\nreturned. In 2009, Greece made another argument, this one in bricks and\nmortar, by opening the Acropolis Museum at the foot of the hill; it includes a\ntop-floor gallery showcasing the sculptures that Elgin left behind, with\nplaster casts pointedly filling in the gaps.\n\nThe British Museum has consistently defended its ownership of the marbles,\nwhich in any case it is not permitted to just give away: according to the\nBritish Museum Act of 1963, it cannot deaccession any objects that have\n\u201cbecome vested in the Trustees by virtue of a gift or bequest,\u201d except under\nlimited circumstances. Elgin\u2019s initial contention to Parliament\u2014that he had\nprevented the Turks from turning the sculptures into mortar\u2014gave way, over\ntime, to an institutional claim: that the marbles were less vulnerable in a\nLondon museum than they would have been if left exposed to the elements in\nAthens. (As early as the eighteen-fifties, however, concerns were raised about\nthe effect of London\u2019s grime on the marbles.) In recent decades, people within\nthe museum have stopped making this point so loudly, but a wall text in the\nmuseum next to a caryatid from the Erechtheion\u2014a column from another temple on\nthe Acropolis, sculpted in the form of a woman, that was also brought to\nBritain by Elgin\u2014notes that the five caryatids that remained in situ, and are\nnow in the Acropolis Museum, are \u201cmuch corroded after nearly two more\ncenturies of weathering.\u201d\n\nUnder the leadership of Neil MacGregor, the charismatic director of the\nBritish Museum from 2002 to 2015, the principal argument made for the\nsculptures\u2019 retention was that they were part of a global narrative: \u201cthe\nprivate collection of every citizen of the world,\u201d as MacGregor put it. In\n2014, the museum loaned out one of its Parthenon Sculptures, a figure of the\nriver god Ilissos, for the first time\u2014but to the State Hermitage Museum, in\nRussia, not to an institution in Greece.\n\nOthers have suggested that the sculptures, having been in England for two\nhundred years, are now part of British history, in addition to Greek history.\nAfter Hartwig Fischer became director, he mounted the argument that moving\ncultural heritage from its place of origin into any museum\u2014in London, Athens,\nor elsewhere\u2014was itself a \u201ccreative act,\u201d offering a revelatory change of\ncontext. At a cosmopolitan museum, a Greek sculpture can be juxtaposed with a\nPersian one; the religious iconography of one culture can be readily compared\nwith that of others. The history of the Parthenon, Fischer told a Greek\nnewspaper, had actually been \u201cenriched\u201d by the fact that some parts of it \u201care\nlocated in Athens and some are in London, where six million people see them\nevery year.\u201d (George Vardas, a journalist who supports the marbles\u2019\nrepatriation, scoffed, \u201cThe imperialist patronage of the British Museum has no\nlimits.\u201d)\n\nAny arrangement that would have the effect of restoring the sculptures to\nGreece seemed to be in conflict with the British Museum\u2019s official position. A\nstatement by the institution\u2019s board of trustees maintains that \u201cthere\u2019s a\ngreat public benefit to seeing the sculptures within the context of the world\ncollection of the British Museum.\u201d To advocates of retaining the sculptures,\nOsborne\u2019s attempted deal with Mitsotakis had the hallmark of a politician\u2019s\nstrategy: a short-term solution that overlooks inevitable consequences. Would\na Parthenon agreement cause the museum to be deluged with demands for the\nrepatriation of other foreign treasures? And how could the institution\nguarantee that a sovereign nation would not violate a loan agreement? Some\nobservers of Greek domestic politics acknowledge that there is little chance\nof any government there acquiescing to the marbles being shipped back to\nBritain.\n\nFor those who feel that the proper place of the sculptures is in Greece,\nthough, framing a return as a \u201cdeposit\u201d might help ease the British public\ninto accepting the concession. Lord Vaizey, a former Conservative culture\nminister, is now the chair of the Parthenon Project\u2014a group, funded by a Greek\nbusinessman named John Lefas, that has been advocating for an agreement that\nwould result in a de-facto repatriation without explicitly calling it a Greek\nvictory. Vaizey told me, \u201cThere\u2019s a big part of me that feels, if and when the\nsculptures were reunited in that setting, it would be one of those moments\nwhen people would say, almost immediately, \u2018Why did we wait so long?\u2019 \u201d By\nearly 2023, with Osborne working behind the scenes, the British Museum seemed\ncloser than it had ever been to resolving its Elgin problem. But it was about\nto be overwhelmed by the consequences of Townley\u2019s neglected legacy.\n\nAfter Gradel submitted his letter to Jonathan Williams, the deputy director of\nthe British Museum, in February, 2021, he received an acknowledgment of\nreceipt. A few months later, he prodded again, and eventually got a short\nmessage from Williams. The museum, Williams said, had conducted a thorough\ninvestigation, \u201cwhich found that the objects concerned are all accounted for .\n. . with no suggestion of any wrong-doing on behalf of any member of Museum\nstaff.\u201d\n\nGradel was incensed\u2014if Williams was correct, how had a piece demonstrably from\nthe museum\u2019s collection ended up on eBay? But his requests for further\nelucidation were rebuffed in a subsequent e-mail, in which Williams told him\nthat his allegations were \u201cwholly unfounded.\u201d At this point, Gradel made sure\nto put in writing his consequent position regarding his purchases. \u201cAs these\nmy suspicions are, then, wholly unfounded, I have no reason whatsoever to\nsuspect anything I bought from that Ebay seller,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am glad to\nfinally leave this behind me.\u201d\n\nBut Gradel could not actually let the matter go. \u201cI knew this was baloney,\nobviously,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd, also, it implied that I had made a frivolous\naccusation against them. I don\u2019t like having a reputation as someone who goes\naround bandying frivolous accusations against all and sundry.\u201d He did not feel\nthat he could go immediately to the board of trustees, since he had so\nrecently been shut down by the museum\u2019s administration. Nor could he approach\nthe police with his suspicions. \u201cI asked friends of mine, and they advised me,\n\u2018You can\u2019t do anything, because the victim of the crime you claim is the\nBritish Museum, and the injured party denies that a crime has even taken\nplace.\u2019 \u201d Gradel was in contact with other scholars, including Martin Henig,\nat Oxford. Henig told me that Gradel \u201cwas clearly upset, because the British\nMuseum just didn\u2019t believe him.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Gradel contacted a museum trustee, Paul Ruddock, informing him of his\nsuspicions and of his fears that a scandal was being covered up. In fact, the\nmuseum was already concerned that its earlier assurances to Gradel had been\nmisplaced. In August, 2021, after Gradel wrote to Williams, a spot check of\nthe Department of Greece and Rome had been conducted, revealing \u201can item not\nin its proper location within the Greece and Rome strongroom,\u201d according to a\nlater statement by the museum. In April, 2022, staffers launched a more\nextensive audit of the department\u2019s holdings and discovered that approximately\ntwo thousand objects were missing or damaged\u2014in particular, cameos and\nintaglios. It appeared that the thief had tried to cover his tracks by\naltering digital databases; a recent civil filing alleges that Higgs made more\nthan eighty edits \u201crelated to stolen, partially stolen or damaged items,\u201d and\nthat there was \u201cno legitimate reason\u201d for this activity. He is also suspected\nof having inserted into a museum catalogue a forged handwritten note falsely\nsuggesting that in 1963 the museum lost the stone fragment that was acquired\ndecades later by Malcolm Hay. (Higgs seems to have sold it in 2015.) Around\nthe end of 2022, the police were discreetly called in.\n\nItems going missing within museums, or being stolen from them, is hardly\nunheard of, and the British Museum had experienced high-profile thefts before.\nIn 1993, robbers broke into the museum through the roof and made off with a\nquarter of a million dollars\u2019 worth of Roman coins and jewelry. In 2002, a\nvisitor lifted a twenty-five-hundred-year-old Greek head from a closed\ngallery. Two years later, fifteen items of medieval Chinese jewelry were\nstolen. Museums are vulnerable to theft from insiders, too. In a notorious\ncase from the nineteen-fifties, John Nevin, an assistant at London\u2019s Victoria\n& Albert Museum, was prosecuted for stealing some two thousand items,\nincluding a table that he was thought to have smuggled out by hiding its legs\ndown his pants. He had furnished his modest home with the loot, and was later\nsentenced to three years in prison. \u201cTaking the things became an obsession as\nI was attracted by the beauty of them,\u201d he reportedly confessed. In 2002, the\nLondon Sunday Times sent an undercover journalist to the British Museum\u2019s\nDepartment of Greece and Rome to pose as a work trainee; the security was so\nlax that the reporter was able to smuggle an ancient Greek statue of a foot\nout of the gallery and past guards without being caught.\n\nWhat was especially shocking about the gem thefts, when they were eventually\nmade public, in August, 2023, was the seniority of the apparent culprit:\nHiggs, who was fired that month, had worked at the museum for three decades.\nCurators at the British Museum are highly qualified but not especially well\npaid: a salary of around fifty thousand dollars for an experienced curator is\nnot unusual. The rewards of the job are not entirely monetary; many curators\nhave dedicated their lives to a narrow specialization and have a profound\ncommitment to the objects in their care. The idea that a curator may have not\njust stolen objects but actively damaged them by removing gold\nsettings\u2014presumably to sell the parts separately\u2014appalled former colleagues.\n\nIronically, Higgs had been liberally quoted in the Sunday Times expos\u00e9 about\nthe museum\u2019s weak security. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos down here,\u201d he told the newspaper. In\n2021, he was made acting keeper for the Greek and Roman collections, though he\ndid not end up getting the permanent job; other recent duties included\ncurating one of the museum\u2019s touring exhibitions, \u201cAncient Greeks: Athletes,\nWarriors and Heroes,\u201d which travelled to Australia in 2021 and later to the\nSuzhou Museum, in China.\n\nAccording to the recent civil filing, Higgs has \u201cindicated that he intends to\ndispute the Claim but his Defence provides no particulars of that denial.\u201d No\nformal charges have yet been brought against him. He did not answer my\nrequests to talk to him. The filing indicates that he has been unable to\nrespond effectively to the proceedings because of \u201csevere mental strain.\u201d\n\nBut in December, 2021, to promote the \u201cAncient Greeks\u201d exhibition, he gave a\nlively interview to the Sydney Morning Herald, in which he recounted that his\nformative exposure to the arts of antiquity had been through a great-uncle who\nran a fish-and-chips shop in the North of England, and whose garden featured a\nmarble copy of the Laoco\u00f6n. Now in the Vatican Museums, the Laoco\u00f6n is the\nmost famous sculpture of antiquity, showing the priest of Apollo and his two\nsons struggling with a pair of flesh-eating snakes. Higgs said of the copy, \u201cI\nclimbed all over it, and I absolutely loved it. And it must have gotten into\nmy head.\u201d One of his favorite items in the \u201cAncient Greeks\u201d show, Higgs\nrevealed, was an exquisitely engraved chalcedony gem, barely the size of a\npostage stamp. It depicted Nike, the goddess of war, her draperies falling off\nher body as she piles up arms and armor seized in battle. Higgs told the paper\nthat the gem, which was acquired by the British Museum in 1865, is \u201cone of the\nfinest examples that I\u2019ve seen in the world.\u201d It is also the kind of thing\nthat Charles Townley would have delighted in.\n\nLate last year, the annual dinner of the trustees of the British Museum was\nheld, for the first time in anyone\u2019s memory, in the Duveen Gallery, where the\nParthenon sculptures are displayed. Tables were laid out for wealthy donors\nand eminent guests from the worlds of politics and culture. In a speech,\nOsborne made forthright reference to his negotiations with the Greek Prime\nMinister, and to his hope for an \u201cagreement that enables these great\nsculptures to be seen in Athens as well as London.\u201d Osborne also spoke of the\nthefts. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen, or it doesn\u2019t matter, or that some\nyears ago we weren\u2019t warned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was our duty to look after these\nobjects, and we failed in that duty.\u201d\n\nIn late July, shortly before the public revelation of the thefts, the museum\nhad announced that Hartwig Fischer would be ending his term as director in\n2024, but would stay in the job while the search for a successor was under\nway. A month later, in the wake of revelations of the museum\u2019s failure to heed\nGradel\u2019s warning, Fischer tendered his immediate resignation. \u201cThe\nresponsibility for that failure must ultimately rest with the director,\u201d\nFischer said. He recently sent me this comment: \u201cThe functioning of a museum\nrequires the probity of its staff. That any member of staff would breach this\nrule, steal, and damage a public good, is shocking.\u201d The museum, he noted, \u201cis\nan organisation with a deep sense of responsibility for the artefacts in its\ncustody. Clearly, it was upsetting for all to see this abused by an individual\nwhom we trusted.\u201d\n\nIn mid-December the museum published an account of the findings of an internal\nreview, which announced the forthcoming documentation and digitization of the\nentire collection, in order to \u201celiminate any pockets of unregistered\nobjects.\u201d (About half of the collection has been fully digitized to date.) The\nreport also provided a few sketchy details about the ongoing quest to find\nwhat had been lost, revealing that, of the two thousand or so missing or\ndamaged objects, only about three hundred and fifty had so far been\nrecovered\u2014the majority of them with the assistance of Gradel. Jonathan\nWilliams, the deputy director who had brushed Gradel off when he first raised\nalarms, resigned at the end of the year. In March, Nicholas Cullinan, the head\nof the National Portrait Gallery, who has been much praised for the renovation\nof that institution, was named as Fischer\u2019s replacement. He will take up the\npost this summer.\n\nFor some people associated with the British Museum, the recent tumult made the\nlarger questions of purpose that hallowed museums are facing only more\npressing. Mary Beard, speaking in her personal capacity, rather than as a\ntrustee of the museum, told me, \u201cYou have to think, How do we share, and do we\nwant to share, the heritage of world culture? And how do we share it outside\nof the conventional hubs of cultural ownership: Western European capitals and\nthe places where objects came from?\u201d Museums should be thinking about what\nthey will look like fifty years or a hundred years from now, Beard went on.\n\u201cWith something like the Parthenon marbles\u2014this is Beard fantasy, but I like\nthe idea of them going to Mumbai or Auckland,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do we mean when\nwe talk of our \u2018shared heritage of Hellenism\u2019? It goes far beyond London,\nParis, New York, and Athens.\u201d\n\nNo new developments in the Parthenon-marbles discussions have been reported in\nrecent months. Lord Vaizey told me, \u201cUnfortunately, standing on top of a\nstepladder to change a light bulb and still being a foot away from the\nsocket\u2014to change the light bulb is impossible.\u201d Nevertheless, the prospect of\nthe marbles making a return of some sort to Athens seems likelier than it has\nfor two hundred years. Recently, the Metropolitan Museum has put on display,\nfor at least the next decade, an exhibit of Cycladic objects privately\ncollected by the American businessman Leonard Stern. An international deal was\nstruck to avoid possible legal challenges to the collection\u2019s provenance. The\nwall text of the installation, which was arranged in agreement with the Museum\nof Cycladic Art, in Athens, and with the Greek government, notes that\neverything on display is now considered the property of Greece. Prime Minister\nMitsotakis heralded the negotiations, which took place over two years, as a\nparadigm for dealing with contentious issues of patrimony. \u201cGiven that the\nevidentiary procedures for any judicial claim around cultural property is in\nmost cases very difficult, expensive, and cumbersome, a more pragmatic\napproach is often the more practical approach,\u201d he said. In November, the\nbeleaguered British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak huffily cancelled a meeting\nwith Mitsotakis after his Greek counterpart told an interviewer that dividing\nthe Parthenon Sculptures was like cutting the Mona Lisa in half. In spite of\nthis, Mitsotakis later said, \u201cI believe both parties have the vision to see\nbeyond past division to embrace a new win-win era of partnership.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, a visitor to the British Museum can still behold the\nParthenon Sculptures\u2014perhaps after weaving through the Greek and Roman\ngalleries, where some years ago a clumsy waiter at a function accidentally\nknocked a thumb off the hand of Charles Townley\u2019s scantily clad Venus. Or one\ncan make a detour through the thematic Enlightenment Gallery, where Townley\u2019s\ndiscobolus is displayed not far from the seductive Clytie, who stands on a\npedestal a few feet from a bust of Townley himself, looking dashing in an\nopen-necked ruffled shirt. Until June, a visitor can even dip into a room near\nthe museum\u2019s entrance to visit a small exhibition titled \u201cRediscovering Gems,\u201d\nwhich showcases a handful of the glass gems that Higgs allegedly stole from\nthe Townley collection, along with other cameos and intaglios that illustrate\nwhy these long-overlooked objects exerted such a fascination during the era of\nthe museum\u2019s founding.\n\nI stopped by the exhibition recently, and saw that one of Townley\u2019s desktop\ncabinets was on display. Several of its drawers were open to reveal rows of\nlozenge-shaped glass gems in shades of blue and purple, alternating with casts\nin shades of pink and red, all ringed with gold-colored bands. They looked\ninviting and almost edible, like the wares of a high-end confectionery shop.\nIn a backlit case, ten of the recovered gems were displayed, none bigger than\na fingernail. I squinted at them through a magnifying glass. There was a glass\ncameo of a fat-cheeked Cupid, from which part of a wing had broken off, and a\nglass intaglio that showed Jupiter in the form of an eagle abducting Ganymede;\ndescribed in a label as a \u201cwaster,\u201d it was slightly miscast, and had been\ndiscarded as trash by its antique maker. These were hardly the finest products\nof antiquity, and under ordinary circumstances would never have been in a\nBritish Museum display cabinet. A placard explained their unusual path to\nprominence. It was striking to think about how much trouble had been caused by\nsuch tiny objects, and about how deceptively inconsequential they might once\nhave seemed, lying hidden away in the museum\u2019s strong rooms in their\nmultitudinous quantity.\n\nA different case showed some of Townley\u2019s more distinguished gems\u2014examples\nthat had never gone missing. One was a fragment of what had in antiquity been\na much larger cameo of a female figure in profile. The fragment was carved\nfrom onyx marked with bands that its creator had cunningly incorporated into\nthe rendering of the subject\u2019s hair. It was beautiful and mysterious, and the\nfact that it had been set in gold indicated that its eighteenth-century owner\nhad thought so, too. I remembered something Gradel had told me the last time\nwe spoke: that among the objects he had bought, or considered buying, which he\nnow suspected came from the Townley collection were two very fine gem\nfragments that, on examination, he had determined to be eighteenth-century\nfakes. Gradel then noted that Townley, unlike most aristocratic collectors\u2014who\ncraved the biggest and best and most intact gems\u2014had a taste for fragments.\n\u201cThese two fragments were clearly intended to deceive,\u201d Gradel went on. \u201cIn\nnormal commercial terms, it didn\u2019t make sense to make them. It only makes\nsense if you imagine that they were made for one particular client who was\nknown to appreciate and love fragments\u2014namely, Charles Townley.\u201d\n\nGradel respected this facet of Townley\u2019s connoisseurship, he went on, because\nhe shared it. \u201cI actually prefer a fragment to a complete gem,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cWith complete pieces you are told everything, and it\u2019s too easy. Whereas if\nyou only have a tiny fragment, it\u2019s like doing a crossword puzzle. You have to\nargue, to research, and to reconstruct the entire object.\u201d To have only a tiny\nsliver of evidence from which to figure out the whole story, Gradel concluded,\nwas \u201ca gorgeous intellectual challenge.\u201d \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the May 13, 2024, issue, with the headline\n\u201cStones of Contention.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * The day the dinosaurs died.\n\n  * What if you started itching\u2014and couldn\u2019t stop?\n\n  * How a notorious gangster was exposed by his own sister.\n\n  * Woodstock was overrated.\n\n  * Diana Nyad\u2019s hundred-and-eleven-mile swim.\n\n  * Photo Booth: Deana Lawson\u2019s hyper-staged portraits of Black love.\n\n  * Fiction by Roald Dahl: \u201cThe Landlady\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nRebecca Mead is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
