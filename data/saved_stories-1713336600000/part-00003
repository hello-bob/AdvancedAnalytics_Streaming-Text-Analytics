It breeds in interior North\nAmerica, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Costa Rica, in winter.\nAlong with the trumpeter swan, it is one of the longest birds native to North\nAmerica, with an overall length of about 50 to 70 inches (130 to 180 cm). The\nbeak measures 11.3 to 15.2 inches (290 to 390 mm) in males and 10.3 to 14.2\ninches (260 to 360 mm) in females, while its wingspan is around 95 to 120\ninches (240 to 300 cm). The American white pelican does not dive for its food\nas some other pelican species do, instead catching its prey while swimming.\nEach bird eats more than 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of food a day, predominantly fish,\nwhich ranges from the size of minnows to 3.5-pound (1.6 kg) pickerels. This\nadult American white pelican in non-breeding plumage was photographed at Las\nGallinas Wildlife Ponds in San Rafael, California.Photograph credit: Frank\nSchulenburgRecently featured:\n\n  * Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard\n  * Notre-Dame fire\n  * Nassarius arcularia\n\n  * Archive\n  * More featured pictures\n\n  \n---  \n  \n## Other areas of Wikipedia\n\n  * Community portal \u2013 The central hub for editors, with resources, links, tasks, and announcements.\n  * Village pump \u2013 Forum for discussions about Wikipedia itself, including policies and technical issues.\n  * Site news \u2013 Sources of news about Wikipedia and the broader Wikimedia movement.\n  * Teahouse \u2013 Ask basic questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\n  * Help desk \u2013 Ask questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\n  * Reference desk \u2013 Ask research questions about encyclopedic topics.\n  * Content portals \u2013 A unique way to navigate the encyclopedia.\n\n## Wikipedia's sister projects\n\nWikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the Wikimedia\nFoundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other\nvolunteer projects:\n\n  * Commons Free media repository\n\n  * MediaWiki Wiki software development\n\n  * Meta-Wiki Wikimedia project coordination\n\n  * Wikibooks Free textbooks and manuals\n\n  * Wikidata Free knowledge base\n\n  * Wikinews Free-content news\n\n  * Wikiquote Collection of quotations\n\n  * Wikisource Free-content library\n\n  * Wikispecies Directory of species\n\n  * Wikiversity Free learning tools\n\n  * Wikivoyage Free travel guide\n\n  * Wiktionary Dictionary and thesaurus\n\n## Wikipedia languages\n\nThis Wikipedia is written in English.
