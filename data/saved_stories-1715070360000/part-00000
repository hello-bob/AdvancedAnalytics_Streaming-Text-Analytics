But trouble with a valve in the\nrocket's upper stage forced mission managers to order a scrub just two hours\nbefore takeoff.\n\nIt was a frustrating disappointment for commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and\nco-pilot Sunita Williams, who were in the process of strapping in for launch\nwhen the scrub was announced. The moment brought to mind one of Wilmore's\nfavorite sayings, \"you'd rather be on the ground wishing you were in space\nthan in space and wishing you were on the ground.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear when Boeing and rocket-builder United Launch\nAlliance might be able to make another attempt, but engineers will first have\nto figure out what caused an oxygen relief valve in the rocket's Centaur upper\nstage to \"chatter\" during the late stages of fueling and what might be\nrequired to fix it.\n\nA view of the Atlas 5 rocket and Starliner crew capsule moments after the\ncountdown to launch was called off due to problems with an upper stage oxygen\nrelief valve. Launch is now on hold pending resolution of the valve issue.\nNASA TV\n\nRunning years behind schedule and more than a billion dollars over budget, the\nStarliner is Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational\nspacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit\nin 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station.\n\nNASA funded development of both spacecraft to ensure the agency would be able\nto launch crews to the outpost even if one company's ferry ship was grounded\nfor any reason. While it's taken Boeing longer than expected to ready their\nship for crew flights, all systems appeared go for launch from pad 41 at the\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:34 p.m. EDT.\n\nEngineers were in the process of completing propellant loading when the valve\nproblem was detected. After assessing its performance, engineers could not get\n\"comfortable\" with its behavior and the launching was called off.\n\nDecked out in Boeing's dark blue pressure suits, Wilmore and Williams, both\nveteran Navy test pilots and active-duty astronauts with four earlier\nspaceflights to their credit, began unstrapping to exit the Starliner and\nawait word on when they'll get another chance to launch.\n\nSunita Williams, left, and commander Butch Wilmore climbed out of the\nStarliner capsule shortly after launch was scrubbed and were driven back to\ncrew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center to relax and await word on when they\nmight be cleared to make another launch try. NASA TV\n\nThe Atlas 5, making its 100th flight, is an extremely reliable rocket with a\nperfect launch record. The rocket is equipped with a sophisticated emergency\nfault detection system and the Starliner, like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, features\na \"full-envelope\" abort system capable of quickly propelling the capsule away\nfrom its booster in the event of a major malfunction at any point from the\nlaunch pad to orbit.\n\nWhenever it takes off, the Atlas 5 will only need 15 minutes to boost the\nStarliner into a preliminary orbit. Once in space, the astronauts then will\nmonitor two quick thruster firings to fine-tune the ship's orbit before taking\nturns testing the spacecraft's computer-assisted manual control system.\n\nAs with any other space station rendezvous, the Starliner will approach the\nlab from behind and below, looping up to a point directly ahead of the outpost\nand then moving in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port\n\nDuring final approach, Wilmore and Williams will again test the capsule's\nmanual controls, making sure future crews can tweak the trajectory or the\nspacecraft's orientation at their own discretion if needed.\n\nThe Starliner also is equipped with a fully manual backup system that allows\nthe crew to directly command the ship's thrusters using a joystick-like hand\ncontroller, bypassing the spacecraft's flight computers. Wilmore and Williams\nwill test that system after departing the station around May 15 to begin the\ntrip back to Earth.\n\nStarliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, both\nveteran Navy test pilots and NASA astronauts with four spaceflights between\nthem. NASA\n\nOnce docked, Wilmore and Williams will spend a little more than a week with\nthe station's seven long-duration crew members: cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko,\nNikolai Chub and Alexander Grebenkin, along with NASA's Matthew Dominick,\nMichael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers expect to certify it for\nroutine crew rotation flights, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner\neach year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month\ntours of duty.\n\n## \"An absolutely critical milestone\"\n\nJim Free, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, called the\nStarliner Crew Flight test, or CFT, \"an absolutely critical milestone.\"\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again, this is a new spacecraft,\" he told\nreporters last week. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, we may\nencounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and\nkeep looking for issues.\"\n\nWhile he said he was confident the Starliner was up to the task, Free said he\ndid not want to \"get too far ahead\" since the crew has yet to complete a\nsuccessful mission. But \"when we do,\" he added, \"and when we certify\nStarliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportations\nthat provide critical redundancy for the ISS access.\"\n\nBut it hasn't been easy.\n\nIn the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded two\nCommercial Crew Program contracts in 2014, one to SpaceX valued at $2.6\nbillion and the other to Boeing for $4.2 billion, to spur development of\nindependent spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the\nInternational Space Station.\n\nThe target date for initial piloted CCP flights was 2017. Funding shortfalls\nin Congress and technical snags delayed development, including an explosion\nduring a ground test that destroyed a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nBut the California rocket builder finally kicked off piloted flights in May\n2020, successfully launching two NASA astronauts on a Crew Dragon test flight\nto the space station.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has launched eight operational crew rotation flights to the\nstation, three research missions to the lab funded by Houston-based Axiom\nSpace and a purely commercial, two-man, two-woman trip to low-Earth orbit paid\nfor by billionaire pilot and businessman Jared Isaacman. In all, 50 people\nhave flown to orbit aboard Crew Dragons.\n\nIt's been a different story for Boeing's Starliner.\n\nDuring an initial unpiloted test flight in December 2019, a software error\nprevented the ship's flight computer from loading the correct launch time from\nits counterpart aboard the Atlas 5.\n\nThe Starliner capsule and its service module are attached to the Atlas 5\nbooster's thinner Centaur upper stage for launch. The drum-shaped extension at\nthe bottom of the service module is an \"aeroskirt\" designed to improve\naerodynamics during the climb out of the thick lower atmosphere. United Launch\nAlliance\n\nAs a result, a required orbit insertion burn did not happen on time and\nbecause of unrelated communications issues, flight controllers were unable to\nregain control in time to press ahead with a space station rendezvous.\n\nThe software problems were addressed after the Starliner's landing, along with\na variety of other issues that came to light in a post-flight review. Boeing\nopted to carry out a second test flight, at its own expense, but the company\nran into into stuck propulsion system valves in the Starliner's service\nmodule. Engineers were unable to resolve the problem and the capsule was taken\noff its Atlas 5 and hauled back to its processing facility for\ntroubleshooting.\n\nEngineers eventually traced the problem to moisture, presumably from high\nhumidity and torrential rain after rollout to the pad, that chemically reacted\nwith thruster propellant to form corrosion. The corrosion prevented the valves\nfrom opening on command.\n\nTo clear the way for launch the following May, the valves in a new service\nmodule were replaced and the system was modified to prevent water intrusion on\nthe launch pad. The second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success,\ndocking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint\nlanding.\n\nBut in the wake of the flight, engineers discovered fresh problems: trouble\nwith parachute harness connectors and concern about protective tape wrapped\naround wiring that could catch fire in a short circuit.\n\nWork to correct those issues pushed the first crewed flight from 2023 to 2024.\nWhen all was said and done, Boeing spent more than $1 billion of its own money\nto pay for the additional test flight and corrective actions.\n\n### Space & Astronomy\n\nMore\n\nPlanned crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft scrubbed\n\nBoeing preps Starliner crew ferry ship for first piloted test flight\n\nIn a first, China launches probe to get samples from far side of moon\n\nNew NASA images show iconic Horsehead Nebula in unprecedented detail\n\nAstronauts confident Boeing's Starliner is finally ready for crew flights\n\nMore\n\nIn:\n\n  * Spacewalk\n  * International Space Station\n  * Space\n  * NASA\n\nWilliam Harwood\n\nBill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984,\nfirst as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as\na consultant for CBS News.\n\nTwitter\n\nFirst published on May 6, 2024 / 1:11 PM EDT\n\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.
