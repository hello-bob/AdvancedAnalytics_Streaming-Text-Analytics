Basically nobody has read Knausgaard\u2019s My Struggle all the way through. My evidence: (i) it\u2019s really long; (ii) there\u2019s about 1000 pages in the middle that most people, including the author, think is substantially weaker than the rest; (iii) most commentary, even from people who talk as if they\u2019ve read the whole thing, focuses on the first book or two; (iv) there is some absolutely mind-blowing, wonderful, hair-raising stuff in the sixth book. More concretely: I\u2019ve heard a bunch of people describe My Struggle as provocative, but the evidence they give tends to come from the first 100-500 pages of the series, even though book VI gives, e.g., an argument that the ethos of modern Western day cares comes, psychoculturally, right out of Nazi values. And people claim that the series is structurally innovative, but again, the evidence for this usually comes from the beginning of the series. I\u2019ve never heard someone mention that there\u2019s a c. 100-page analysis of a Paul Celan poem right in the middle of Book VI. The best explanation of all this is that people simply never got to (or even near) Book VI.\n  2. Basically nobody has read The Mathematics of Poker all the way through. My evidence: (i) it\u2019s long; (ii) much of it is difficult; (iii) most commentary, even from people who talk as if they\u2019ve read the whole thing, focuses on the overall approach or the beginning. So, for example, the poker world is full enough of people who like to poke fun at and/or find amusing details in poker books, but I\u2019ve never heard anyone other than me mention that near the end of Mathematics of Poker there\u2019s a page or two where every lowercase s is italicized (so that you read things like \u201cthis issue\u201d). And here\u2019s a blog post from 2014 in which a respectable person claims that the whole risk of ruin analysis is completely flawed. Whether or not the claim is right or wrong, the issue is (I think!) pretty serious, at least as a matter of clear communication. Again, the best explanation of why all this happens only in a few comment threads from 8 years after the book\u2019s publication date is that basically nobody ever made it to, much less seriously worked through, that part of the book.\n\nThis all reminds me of:\n\nFirst, Warren Buffett\u2019s famous claim that you should simply read a lot of\nrelevant material because \u201cknowledge builds up, like compound interest.\u201d\n\nSecond, a claim from this wonderful tweetstorm about gaps in results from\nnumber theory:\n\n> Apparently it\u2019s frequently the most famous people who discover these gaps.\n> Roommate said it was surprising the degree to which a lot of what famous\n> people do is actually what everyone is \u201csupposed to do,\u201d e.g. deeply\n> understanding techniques, checking things for yourself...\n\nAnd third, Byrne Hobart noting that that claim \u201cgeneralizes across other\nfields.\u201d I can affirm it\u2019s true in philosophy, poker, and software. People\noften ask what they can do to generate original contributions or comparative\nadvantages. Usually they vastly overestimate how common it is to have gone\nthrough the basic intellectual background in a field. If you\u2019ve actually read\nthe book (actually checked the proof, actually implemented the algorithm),\nyou\u2019re probably way ahead of the field. Much expertise is simply doing this\nover and over.\n\nAddendum 2022-10-05: This note from Donald Knuth suggests that he thinks that,\nfor many problems in The Art of Computer Programming, \u201cnobody has been\nsufficiently motivated to check the finer points out carefully as yet.\u201d In\ncontext, \u201ccheck out the finer points\u201d seems clearly to mean something like\n\u201cactually work through properly.\u201d\n\nAddendum 2023-08-12: ChatGPT is, in my experience, very bad at summarizing the\nplot of, retrieving factual information about, and even knowing how many books\nare in War and Peace. I\u2019m sure my prompt engineering is lacking, but there\u2019s\nalso a lesson here about how much training data was generated by people who\nhad actually read War and Peace.\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Nate Meyvis\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
