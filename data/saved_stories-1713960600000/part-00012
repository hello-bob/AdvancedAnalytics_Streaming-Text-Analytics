Is automation the\nanswer?\n\nApril 22, 2024April 22, 2024 - by Emily Baron CadloffEmily Baron Cadloff Illustration by Glenn Harvey, Updated 8:15, Apr. 22, 2024 | Published 6:30, Apr. 22, 2024\n\nThe MacLellans can pinpoint the moment their farm in Kensington, Prince Edward\nIsland, underwent a significant change: spring 2009. That\u2019s when the family\ntractors were outfitted with GPS. \u201cYou can take someone with less experience,\nthrow them in the tractor, and the tractor drives itself,\u201d says Bevin\nMacLellan.\n\nAt twenty-four, Bevin is the youngest son of the family and works on the\nproperty with his older brother, Rylan. Together, the men will eventually\ninherit the farm, the ninth generation of the MacLellans to do so. They farm\npotatoes, barley, and wheat on a three-year crop rotation and have a crew of\nabout eleven employees outside of the family. The MacLellans can trace their\nfarming history back to roughly 1790, when their forebears broke ground on\nsixty acres. Each generation has since brought something new to the operation,\na different set of ideas to boost productivity, starting with the first\nMacLellan to hitch his plow to a horse. Bevin, who studied plant sciences in\nuniversity, is the agronomics guy, looking at new fertilizer formulations and\nseed mixes; Rylan, with a diploma in agriculture business, deals with the\nmachinery. Alongside their father and grandfather, they plan the planting,\ncultivating, and harvesting. But while farming is still a physical job, the\nmen know they live in an era where more and more of it can be done on\nsmartphones, using apps that run extensive irrigation networks or receive\nreal-time analysis of soil health and nutrient levels.\n\nBevin and Rylan get excited about the possibilities of tech to make their\nfarming smarter, more strategic, but given the costs, the brothers have to be\nselective. No shots in the dark; additions to the farm have to be proven.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always someone coming in your driveway, trying to sell you\nsomething,\u201d Rylan says. Everything comes back to efficiency. How many tasks\ncan you squeeze out of a day? How much faster can you move? GPS in the\ntractors doesn\u2019t just mean that a specialized crew member might be freed up to\nwork more demanding jobs. It means that, by moving perfectly up and down the\nrows, the tractor shaves off precious seconds every time it traverses the\nfield. The family can thus get more done with a single machine. As the farm\ngrows, they rely increasingly on these kinds of hacks, wringing more out of\neach day than the previous one.\n\n  * AI Is Coming for Voice Actors. Artists Everywhere Should Take Note\n  * Will AI Actually Mean We\u2019ll Be Able to Work Less?\n  * Robots Are Writing Poetry, and Many People Can\u2019t Tell the Difference\n\nAt 1,800 acres, their farm has tripled in size from the time their\ngrandfather, Kenny, seventy-four, took charge in the 1970s. He brought his\nson, Billy, on board in the early 1990s, and the operation has since expanded\nthe way many farming families have\u2014by buying up parcels of adjoining land\nafter those neighbours aged out of the field. With costs being so high, one of\nthe ways independent farmers can reliably make a profit is through sheer\nvolume. \u201cUnless you\u2019re into something that\u2019s a really specialized thing, and\nyou found a market for it, you will not make a living off of that farm,\u201d Kenny\nexplains, Bevin nodding in agreement. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford not to grow with the\nrest of them,\u201d says Bevin. \u201cThey\u2019ll out-compete you.\u201d\n\nOne day, the young men hope to sit in their grandfather\u2019s and father\u2019s chairs,\nwatching future generations of MacLellan farmers. Their ultimate goal for the\nfarm, and the family\u2019s legacy, is to maintain their success. For that, they\nhave to keep growing. \u201cPeople think you\u2019re still putting the same kind of seed\nin the ground,\u201d says Rylan, \u201cyou\u2019re still growing the same crop at the same\ntime of the year with the same type of equipment.\u201d But the moment you stop\nevolving with the industry is the moment you fall behind. They\u2019ll have to\nbring on more tech to survive.\n\nAn image of farmers persists. Mom and Pop, likely white, smile in well-worn\noveralls and plaid shirts, big red barn behind them. Horses or cows are\nnearby. They get up with the sun, tend animals and the crops by hand. It\u2019s\nromantic, unsophisticated, a haven for Luddites.\n\nIt\u2019s also completely false. (Except the race part. Only 3.7 percent of\nCanadian farmers, according to the 2021 census, belong to a racialized group.)\nFarmers are among the earliest of early adopters, always ready to experiment\nin the name of efficiency. The first steam-powered combine harvesters arrived\nin North America in the 1880s, and the first tractors were widely introduced\nin the early 1900s. Wind energy may be used to power homes now, but American\nhomesteads relied on windmills to mill grain and pump water from wells.\nSatellite imagery became available to farmers as early as 1972, long before\nGoogle Earth.\n\nOver the past few decades, tech on farms has become less \u201cnice to have\u201d and\nmore hard reality. According to market research firm MarketsandMarkets, the\nsmart agriculture industry is expected to reach $20.8 billion (US) globally by\n2026. The tools currently available span from the discrete\u2014individual gate\nlatches can be pre-programed to open and close animal enclosures at specific\ntimes\u2014to devices that seem straight out of a cyberpunk novel. There\u2019s a drone\nthat can disperse fertilizers and seeds. Then there\u2019s a drone that can spy\nchanges in vegetation patterns and help catch disease and pests before they\ncause significant damage. And then there\u2019s a pesticide-spraying robot that,\nusing on-board solar panels, can cover up to 100 acres a day; it scans the\nground for weeds and targets just the area that needs the pesticide.\n\nAutomation especially has been a boon to farming. By the time Teslas were on\nthe roads, self-steering systems were already lugging produce to storage\nfacilities. When you\u2019re constantly looking to save time and energy, it\u2019s hard\nnot to see the upside of devices that work around the clock. John Deere, one\nof North America\u2019s largest agricultural equipment manufacturers, is developing\na fully autonomous tractor with the horsepower and capacity to handle vast\namounts of land. More than just vehicles outfitted with GPS, these will be\nmachines that don\u2019t need anyone in the driver\u2019s seat. You program the\ntractor\u2014or several at a time\u2014and send it off in the field, where it will send\nalerts and updates back to you wirelessly. The device is not yet on the\nmarket, and there is no indication yet of what it will cost, but given that\nthe company\u2019s top-line non-autonomous models are marketed at $500,000 (US),\neven the used ones, it\u2019s likely such robotic fleets will be the domain of\nlarge, commercial farms.\n\nBut that gap is closing. California-based company Monarch offers an all-\nelectric, \u201cdriver optional\u201d model, starting at about $89,000 (US). At that\nprice, the tractor could prove attractive to smaller farms that might see it\nas a piece of equipment that will pay itself off within a couple of years. The\nMonarch tractors keep costs down in part by not needing specialized\ntechnicians for every repair, leaving some fixes to the farmers, not unlike\nlooking up a recipe on YouTube and following along.\n\nData collection and analysis have already transformed agriculture. And here\nthe bigger players are intensifying their efforts. McCain Foods, Canada\u2019s\nlargest producer of frozen potato products, acquired a \u201cpredictive crop\nintelligence portfolio\u201d from Resson, a Fredericton-based analytics and tech\nfirm, in 2022. Ingesting data from satellite imagery and sensors, the\ntechnology uses algorithms to report on the condition of the potato\nfields\u2014everything from the state of the moisture to levels of fertilizer,\naccording to one report. The digital approach not only gives McCain farmers an\nunprecedented overall view of how crops are growing but also helps the company\nanticipate how many tonnes of potatoes are likely to arrive at facilities. The\nfood giant hints at scaling Resson\u2019s tech even further, extending its prowess\nto other crops.\n\nAnd that\u2019s partly why small farms are grabbing onto tech. Global operations\nalready have an edge because of their size; independents need any advantage\nthey can get.\n\nColin de Moissac looks forward to the day he can bring tech like autonomous\ntractors to his farm outside Biggar, Saskatchewan. \u201cI can spend more time\ndoing actual work versus driving.\u201d De Moissac farms the same patch of land\nthat his great-grandparents lived on and homesteaded in 1906. He took over the\nbusiness in 2018, from his father, Rene. Since then, de Moissac has more than\ntripled the acreage and now oversees 9,400 acres of canola, wheat, peas,\nlentils, and mustard. He has a dozen employees, working at several nearby\nsites.\n\nThe de Moissacs are one of the lucky families. With only 12 percent of\nCanadian farms, as of the 2021 census, possessing a written succession plan,\nthe days of small or even medium-sized family farms are coming to an end. In\n1941, there were over 700,000 farms. By 1971, fewer than 400,000. In 2001,\nthat number dropped again to just under 250,000. The farms, however, aren\u2019t\nshrinking. Instead, the average amount of land under them has increased\ndramatically.\n\nToday, consolidation has led to the smallest number of farms on record in\ndecades. The 2021 census registered just under 190,000 of them, with\nindividual farms producing more than ever. It\u2019s a recipe for burnout.\nResearchers have found an increase in stress, anxiety, and depression among\nfarmers, with one in four having experienced suicidal ideation. There is even\na twenty-four-hour Farm Stress Line for Saskatchewan farmers. Sixty-one\npercent of farmers in Canada today are over the age of fifty-five. Farms are\ngetting larger, but the people operating them are racing toward retirement,\nwith no clear plan for who will take over.\n\nThis shift in farming sets off a cascade of consequences. As medium-scale\nfamily farms disappear, the fabric of rural communities changes. Of course,\nfarm consolidation is far from the only cause of rural decline (higher wages,\nbetter infrastructure, and education are also driving populations to urban\nareas), but fewer people living on larger and larger parcels of land means\nless tax revenue is being pumped into the towns and villages surrounding that\nfarmland. That\u2019s fewer options at the local farmers\u2019 market, fewer sponsors of\nthe local charity half marathons and bake sales, fewer people around in\ngeneral. Those lands are often sold to industrialized outfits, which rely on\nmonocropping, or farming the same crop on the same plot of land, year after\nyear. Monocropping leaches nutrients from the soil, leaving the farm at a\nhigher risk of disease or infection. Because all the plants fall prey to the\nsame pathogen, one wayward insect and half a field can be wiped out.\n\nThriving rural communities downshifting from farming hubs to near ghost towns\nisn\u2019t high on any politician\u2019s list of things to fix, but it\u2019s a reality for\nmany Canadians. As medium-sized farms start disappearing, de Moissac is ready\nto embrace innovation to sustain our food supply, even with the risks. \u201cThe\nstakes have never been higher to bring in new tech or purchase machinery for\nthe farm,\u201d he says. \u201cWith inflation and the high price of equipment, a small\nerror could result in great financial consequences. We only get one chance to\nget it right every year.\u201d\n\nDe Moissac is happy to take that weight off his parents\u2019 shoulders but isn\u2019t\nimmune to the stress. He easily works eighteen hours a day in the high season.\nFrom the moment he wakes, he\u2019s confirming that the machines are in the right\nfield, that the employees have the chemicals and the water they need, that\nservice is on track. But before all of that, de Moissac monitors the markets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the back of my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cCheck the margins, see where it\u2019s at,\ntry and read world news and see\u2014Is Algeria buying wheat? Did the wheat tender\ngo through? Did they reject it? All those things add up, because we sell on a\nglobal level now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been even more stressful in recent years as fertilizer prices shot\nthrough the roof\u2014and mostly stayed there\u2014following sanctions against Russia, a\nlarge exporter, for its invasion of Ukraine. De Moissac never anticipated\nhaving to factor geopolitical instability into his daily life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot\nof times I shake my head and just think: Why am I doing this?\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to entering farming is simply the funds needed.\nOver 87 percent of farm capital in Canada is land and buildings, and many\nfarmers don\u2019t own anything\u2014they rent. And in many cases, who they rent from\naren\u2019t farmers. The US\u2019s largest private owner of farmland\u2014worth an estimated\n$690 million (US)\u2014is tech billionaire Bill Gates, according to The Land\nReport.\n\nWhen Bronwyn Green, a thirty-three-year-old from Winnipeg, wrote up a business\nplan for a small homestead, she quickly learned how costly it would be. She\nwanted to grow her own vegetables and have a chicken coop and maybe a few\ngoats. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying how much money it takes to start.\u201d In Manitoba, Green\nwould be looking at a minimum cost of about $2,400 per acre of land, and\nthat\u2019s without anything else attached. No home, no barn, no fencing, no shed.\nShe could sink half a million dollars into the project before she\u2019s even\nthought about springing for seeds, much less a tractor.\n\nGreen doesn\u2019t come from a farming family, so she found the next best option:\nthe Young Agrarians Apprenticeship Program, which pairs young farmers with\nexperienced mentors. She spent five months working with a couple near Russell,\nManitoba. \u201cI was overwhelmed when I first arrived. What if I\u2019m not good at\nfarming? Or it\u2019s too much work?\u201d Luckily, she flourished. Over that time, she\nmet other farmers, building out her network of contacts. Green now has a\ncommon-law partner who will farm with her, so between their two incomes, they\ncan afford to buy land for her dream homestead. For now, she\u2019s working with a\nnon-profit company, Holistic Management Canada, helping other farmers\ntransition to more ecological approaches. It\u2019s a side door into the life she\nwants for herself someday.\n\nOf course, if Green were still single, she might go in with friends. That\u2019s\nwhat the founders of BeetBox did in 2017. The Ottawa-based friends were\nlooking for a way to get into farming and grow their own food, but they\nweren\u2019t impressed with the traditional top-down farming structure and\nhierarchy. Instead, they wanted a more equitable structure to the whole\nsystem, with collaboration and co-operation as core tenets. They were able to\nrent 120 acres of land in the National Capital Greenbelt, the largest publicly\nowned greenbelt in the world, very close to Ottawa\u2019s urban centre. \u201cNone of us\nhave any formal training. So we all want to be part of the decision-making\nprocess,\u201d says Scott Lessard, a farm manager at the time. \u201cIf you were to go\nwork at Joe\u2019s Farm, then Joe\u2019s the owner, and there\u2019s very little chance of\nfurthering your involvement in the short term.\u201d\n\nThey have a community-supported agriculture program, where community members\ncan sign up for farm shares and get a regular box of produce over certain\nsummer and fall months. They have a seedling sale in May and sell veggies,\nherbs, and preserves at their farm store. Since BeetBox started, it has\nalready shifted how it approaches production. Though they actively farm only\nfour acres, they still need shortcuts and technologies. Lessard says the group\nrecently purchased a new greenhouse system, which will automatically adjust\nthe temperature and humidity ranges. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many better uses of our\ntime than turning on and off valves or opening and closing greenhouses,\u201d\nLessard says. \u201cWith the paper-thin margins that small farming involves, any\nimprovements in efficiency are super valuable.\u201d\n\nEven such a hardworking and eager group doesn\u2019t make its full profit from\nfarming alone, though it is their top revenue generator. The co-operative also\nsubleases land to other enterprises: a school garden, a garlic farmer, a\nbeekeeper. Modern farming is adapting.\n\nPerhaps no one has adapted more over the course of their farming career than\nJoe Dorgan. Now sixty-eight, Dorgan has lived and farmed his land on the\nwestern edge of PEI his whole life. He keeps about 250 acres outside Tignish,\na community that used to be all farmers and fishermen but is now struggling.\nHe\u2019s raised beef and dairy cattle, along with pigs. He\u2019s grown hay and\npotatoes. In 2007, he pivoted to find the next sustainable business plan:\nfarming seaweed from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, roughly ten minutes from his\nfront door. He sells it as an organic cattle feed supplement that he says can\nactually limit the amount of methane cows produce, helping stifle greenhouse\ngas emissions in Canada.\n\nWhile Dorgan moves more slowly these days, he has no plans to retire. His sons\nfish lobster. If they don\u2019t take over, one of his grandchildren might, or his\ndaughter-in-law could be a good candidate for succession. She helped bring his\nseaweed business online, where he now gets orders from as far away as Denmark.\n\nDorgan grew up before telephones were common in that area of the island. He\u2019s\nseen changes throughout the area and remained loyal to his community through\nthe ups and downs. He\u2019s been a member of his local credit union since 1967. \u201cI\nwent in and borrowed $100 to buy a horse.\u201d He paid that $100 back; his\ntransactions are markedly bigger now. Ultimately, he tells me, if someone were\ninterested in buying the farm and business, they\u2019d have to offer at least $5\nmillion, and then he\u2019d sit down at the table to talk. That\u2019s the opening bid\njust for the seaweed processor, not the 250 acres.\n\nDorgan doesn\u2019t want to see small farms like his get swallowed up by huge\nenterprises. His operation used to be considered a decent size; now it\u2019s tiny\nby most farming standards. As for machinery, Dorgan says a farmer is only as\ngood as the people they have working with them. He\u2019d like to keep doing as\nmuch of his work by hand as possible, but it\u2019s getting harder. The youngest\nmember of his crew is in his mid-fifties, and he\u2019ll be leaving after this\nseason. Farm labour is tough to find in general across Canada, and it\u2019s even\nharder to entice people to rural PEI (that\u2019s one reason the industry has\nbecome reliant on migrant workers). According to the 2021 census, nearly one\nquarter of Canadian farmers now live in an urban area, up from 16 percent in\n2016. You can now house a whole farm in a repurposed shipping container in\nyour backyard\u2014gleaming trays of lettuce or strawberries or herbs\u2014with\ncontrolled water and light and every parameter for optimal growth customizable\nwith an app.\n\nAs Dorgan and others of his ilk see it, the innovations needed to keep\nCanadian farming alive are also what\u2019s making it harder to do so. There\u2019s\nstill an interest, however small, in farming as a career and a lifestyle, and\nthose entering the profession need hands-on experience, which could become\nmore difficult to get as more tasks become automated. But investing in new\ntechnology and advancing with the times is different from a slavish devotion\nto the latest gadget. \u201cA young fella just down the road here, he started up a\nnew dairy farm two years ago: robotic milkers, everything state of the art,\u201d\nDorgan says, shaking his head. \u201cI know his father, his grandfather, his great-\ngrandfather. Great farmers.\u201d He wants to be more efficient. But some things,\nDorgan says, just can\u2019t be done by a drone.\n\nEmily Baron Cadloff\n\nEmily Baron Cadloff (@EmilyBat) is a writer and reporter based in Halifax.
