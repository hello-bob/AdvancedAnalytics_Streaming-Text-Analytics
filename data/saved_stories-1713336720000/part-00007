There is hardly a single hospital left. And this was all accomplished,\nmuch of this accomplished, with US resources and weapons,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a US\nrepresentative from New York, said.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what an unfolding genocide looks like, open your eyes. It\nlooks like the forced famine of 1.1 million innocents. It looks like thousands\nof children eating grass as their bodies consume themselves, while trucks of\nfood are slowed and halted just miles away.\n\n\u201cIt looks like good and decent people who do nothing, or too little, too\nlate.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, one of the most recognised names in Congress and a rising star\nin President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic Party, had previously faced criticism from\nthe left for failing to join many of her fellow progressive in accusing Israel\nof genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe Biden administration rejects allegations that Israel is systematically\ncommitting human rights violations in Gaza. Earlier this year, it called South\nAfrica\u2019s petition to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel\nof genocide unfounded.\n\n### Sign up for Al Jazeera\n\n#### Americas Coverage Newsletter\n\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\n\nOcasio-Cortez said on Friday that the US cannot continue to \u201cfacilitate\u201d mass\nkillings in Gaza in the name of honouring its alliance with Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe time is now to force compliance with US law and the standards of\nhumanity, and fulfill our obligations to the American people to suspend the\ntransfer of US weapons to the Israeli government in order to stop and prevent\nfurther atrocity,\u201d the congresswoman said.\n\nThe US is Israel\u2019s top weapons supplier.\n\nWashington provides at least $3.8bn in aid to Israel annually, and Biden is\nworking with Congress to secure $14bn in additional aid to the US ally.\n\nPublic opinion polls, however, show that the Biden administration\u2019s steadfast\nsupport for Israel may cost the president votes as the election season gets\nunder way, and Biden and key Democrats have in recent weeks been more forceful\nin their criticism of the Israeli government siege of Gaza.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly warned Israel against invading Rafah in southern\nGaza, where more than one million displaced Palestinians have taken shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut White House national security spokesperson John Kirby suggested on Friday\nthat Washington will not halt its weapon transfers to Israel. US officials\nhave said that they share Israel\u2019s goals of eliminating Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAsked whether the US will use its \u201cleverage\u201d to dissuade Israel from launching\na major ground operation in Rafah, Kirby said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to\napproach this with Israel as we have in the past, which is to make sure that\nthey have the tools they need to defend themselves against a still-viable\nthreat.\u201d\n\nKirby added that, at the same time, the US will use its ties with Israel and\nthe relationship between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nto \u201curge them to minimise civilian casualties\u201d and allow more humanitarian\nassistance to Gaza.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the UN Security Council failed to adopt a US-authored\nproposal around a ceasefire in Gaza. The measure backed the \u201cimperative\u201d for\n\u201can immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians on all sides\u201d but\nfell short of explicitly demanding an end to the war.\n\nKirby said the draft resolution signals no change in the Biden\nadministration\u2019s position, which has been to push for a temporary cessation of\nhostilities as part of a deal that would see the release of Israeli captives\nin Gaza.\n\n\u201cIt is in line with our longstanding calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nover a period of at least six weeks as part of our hostage deal \u2013 nothing new\nthere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House spokesperson added that progress is being made in the talks to\nreach a truce agreement. \u201cNothing is negotiated until it\u2019s all negotiated. But\nwe do believe that the gaps are narrowing and we are getting closer,\u201d he told\nreporters.\n\n> There is no world in which the forced famine of 1.1 million people cannot be\n> considered genocide. And that is exactly what we are watching unfold in Gaza\n> now.\n>\n> We must enforce U.S. laws and halt weapons transfers to the Israeli\n> government to stop an atrocity in the making. pic.twitter.com/N40Jk3yKc7\n>\n> \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@RepAOC) March 22, 2024\n\nHowever, US progressives have long argued that a temporary halt in fighting is\nnot sufficient, calling on Washington to revise its unconditional support for\nIsrael.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about Israel or Gaza. This is about us. The world will never\nbe the same,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Friday of the mounting death toll and\nhunger in the Palestinian territory.\n\n\u201cOur story must be not that we were good men who did nothing, but that we were\na committed democracy that did something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\n  *     * About Us\n    * Code of Ethics\n    * Terms and Conditions\n    * EU/EEA Regulatory Notice\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookie Policy\n    * Cookie PreferencesManage preferences\n    * Sitemap\n    * Work for us\n    * HR Quality\n\n  *     * Contact Us\n    * User Accounts Help\n    * Advertise with us\n    * Apps\n    * Newsletters\n    * Channel Finder\n    * TV Schedule\n    * Podcasts\n    * Submit a Tip\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera English\n    * Al Jazeera Investigative Unit\n    * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n    * Al Jazeera Documentary\n    * Al Jazeera Balkans\n    * AJ+\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n    * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n    * Learn Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n    * Al Jazeera Forum\n    * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n## You rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparency\n\nWe and our 815 partners store and access information on your device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
