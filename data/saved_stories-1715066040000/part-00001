Rufo\n\n# Signal\u2019s Katherine Maher Problem\n\nIs the integrity of the encrypted-messaging application compromised by its\nchairman of the board?\n\n/ The Social Order, Technology and Innovation\n\nMay 06, 2024 / Share\n\n/ Eye on the News / The Social Order, Technology and Innovation\n\nMay 06 2024 / Share\n\nThe encrypted-messaging service Signal is the application of choice for\ndissenters around the world. The app has been downloaded by more than 100\nmillion users and boasts high-profile endorsements from NSA leaker Edward\nSnowden and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk. Signal has created the perception\nthat its users, including political dissidents, can communicate with one\nanother without fear of government interception or persecution.\n\nBut the insider history of Signal raises questions about the app\u2019s origins and\nits relationship with government\u2014in particular, with the American intelligence\napparatus. Such a relationship would be troubling, given how much we have\nlearned, in recent years, about extensive efforts to control and censor\ninformation undertaken by technology companies, sometimes in tandem with\nAmerican government officials.\n\nFirst, the origin story. The technology behind Signal, which operates as a\nnonprofit foundation, was initially funded, in part, through a $3 million\ngrant from the government-sponsored Open Technology Fund (OTF), which was spun\noff from Radio Free Asia, originally established as an anti-Communist\ninformation service during the Cold War. OTF funded Signal to provide\n\u201cencrypted mobile communication tools\u201d to \u201cInternet freedom defenders\nglobally.\u201d\n\nSome insiders have argued that the connection between OTF and U.S.\nintelligence is deeper than it appears. One person who has worked extensively\nwith OTF but asked to remain anonymous told me that, over time, it became\nincreasingly clear \u201cthat the project was actually a State Department-connected\ninitiative that planned to wield open source Internet projects made by hacker\ncommunities as tools for American foreign policy goals\u201d\u2014including by\nempowering \u201cactivists [and] parties opposed to governments that the USA\ndoesn\u2019t like.\u201d Whatever the merits of such efforts, the claim\u2014if true\u2014suggests\na government involvement with Signal that deserves more scrutiny.\n\nThe other potential problem is the Signal Foundation\u2019s current chairman of the\nboard, Katherine Maher, who started her career as a U.S.-backed agent of\nregime change. During the Arab Spring period, for instance, Maher ran digital-\ncommunications initiatives in the Middle East and North Africa for the\nNational Democratic Institute, a largely government-funded organization that\nworks in concert with American foreign policy campaigns. Maher cultivated\nrelationships with online dissidents and used American technologies to advance\nthe interests of U.S.-supported Color Revolutions abroad.\n\nMaher then became CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation in 2016, and, earlier this\nyear, was named CEO of National Public Radio. At Wikipedia, Maher became a\ncampaigner against \u201cdisinformation\u201d and admitted to coordinating online\ncensorship \u201cthrough conversations with government.\u201d She openly endorsed\nremoving alleged \u201cfascists,\u201d including President Trump, from digital\nplatforms, and described the First Amendment as \u201cthe number one challenge\u201d to\neliminating \u201cbad information.\u201d\n\nAccording to the insider, a woman named Meredith Whittaker, who became\npresident of the Signal Foundation in 2022, recruited Maher to become board\nchair because of their mutual connections to OTF, where Maher also serves as\nan advisor, and to nonprofits such as Access Now, which \u201cdefends and extends\nthe digital rights of users at risk around the world,\u201d including in the Middle\nEast and North Africa. Whittaker, like Maher, is highly ideological. She\npreviously worked in a high position at Google and organized left-wing\ncampaigns within the company, culminating in the 2018 \u201cGoogle Walkout,\u201d which\ndemanded MeToo-style sexual harassment policies and the hiring of a chief\ndiversity officer.\n\nSo what does all this mean for American users\u2014including conservative\ndissidents\u2014who believe that Signal is a secure application for communication?\nIt means that they should be cautious. \u201cMaher\u2019s presence on the board of\nSignal is alarming,\u201d says national security analyst J. Michael Waller. \u201cIt\nmakes sense that a Color Revolutionary like Maher would have interest in\nSignal as a secure means of communicating,\u201d he says, but her past support for\ncensorship and apparent intelligence connections raise doubts about Signal\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the popular Ruby on\nRails web-development framework, agrees, saying that it had \u201csuddenly become\nmaterially harder\u201d to trust the Signal Foundation under Maher\u2019s board\nleadership.\n\nFor those who believe in a free and open Internet, Maher\u2019s Signal role should\nbe a flashing warning sign. As she once explained, she abandoned the mission\nof a free and open Internet at Wikipedia, because those principles\nrecapitulated a \u201cwhite male Westernized construct\u201d and \u201cdid not end up living\ninto the intentionality of what openness can be.\u201d The better path, in her\nview, is managed opinion, using, alternately, censorship and promotion of\ndissent\u2014depending on context and goal\u2014as the essential methods.\n\nWe\u2019re entering a dangerous period in political technology, and Maher is in the\nthick of it. Under her ideology, \u201cInternet freedom\u201d is a tactic, not a\nprinciple, and \u201cfighting disinformation\u201d means speech suppression, including\nhere at home. When people tell you who they are, believe them.\n\nChristopher F.
