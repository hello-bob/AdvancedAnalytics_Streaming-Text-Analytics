(Updated 2024)\n\nMay 4, 2024 08:00 ET\n\nSimple steps to take before hitting the streets By Dan Phiffer, Tomas Apodaca,\nMiles Hilton, and Maddy Varner\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n### Share This Article\n\nCopy Link Copied! Republish\n\nThis article is an updated version of The Markup\u2019s original article on how to\nprepare your phone for a protest, published in 2020.\n\nGaza solidarity encampments have appeared on college campuses across the\nUnited States, joining a growing wave of protests against Israel\u2019s ongoing war\non Gaza.\n\nBefore going to a protest, demonstrators or observers should note that their\ncellphones may subject them to surveillance tactics by law enforcement. If\nyour cellphone is on and unsecured, your location can be tracked and your\nunencrypted communications, such as SMS, may be intercepted. Additionally,\npolice may retrieve your messages and the content of your phone if they take\ncustody of your phone, or later by warrant or subpoena.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Deciding How and If to Bring Your Phone\n\nYour proximity to organizers of a protest, your immigration status (there are\nhigher stakes for international students\u2014here\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re asked\nabout your immigration status at a protest), and other factors mean there is\nno one-size-fits-all privacy advice for whether to bring your mobile phone to\na protest.\n\n### Printable cheat sheet\n\nDownload\n\n\u201cAll protesting and all marches are a series of balancing acts of different\npriorities and acceptable risks,\u201d said Mason Donahue, a member of Lucy Parsons\nLabs, a Chicago-based group of technologists and activists that run digital\nsecurity training classes and have investigated the Chicago Police\nDepartment\u2019s use of surveillance technology. \u201cThere is a lot of communication\nability that goes away if you don\u2019t bring a phone period,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaving your phone behind means the data it holds and transmits will be the\nsafest it will ever be, but it also means giving up access to important\nresources. It becomes much more difficult to coordinate with others, or get\nupdates from social media. For many, phone cameras are also the only way they\ncan document what\u2019s happening.\n\nIf you have access to a separate phone, whether it\u2019s a \u201cburner\u201d phone, an old\nsmartphone that you can reset, or an old-fashioned camera, you could choose to\nbring these devices instead of your regularly-used phone. However, not\neveryone has access to these devices, or can afford to purchase a separate\nphone just for protesting.\n\nIf you take your cell phone with you, the rest of this guide runs through how\nto minimize risks to your privacy.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Use a Passcode, Not a Fingerprint\n\nFingerprint and face locks may be convenient ways to secure your phone, but\nthey don\u2019t always work in your favor if your phone is seized by law\nenforcement.\n\nIn the United States, the Fifth Amendment grants people the right not to be\n\u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\u201d themselves. When it\ncomes to whether you\u2019re obligated to unlock your smartphone, your Fifth\nAmendment protection varies depending on whether you\u2019re using a passcode or\nbiometrics like a fingerprint or face scans.\n\nGentle January\n\n### Unlock Your Phone Without Using Your Face or Fingerprint\n\nAuthenticating with a passcode or pattern protects your data legally as well\nas physically\n\nJanuary 26, 2024 08:00 ET\n\nCourts have made opposing rulings on whether the Fifth Amendment applies to\nboth passcodes and biometric locks, and most recently, a federal appeals court\nruled that law enforcement can compel a person to unlock their phone using\ntheir fingerprint. On the whole, if you are choosing to bring your phone,\nprivacy experts recommend that you use a passcode as your best option, but it\nisn\u2019t failsafe.\n\n\u201cPolice have these tools by Cellebrite, which essentially try to do tons and\ntons of guesses really fast on your phone to see what the passcode is. It\nworks pretty effectively for the police because most people use fairly\npredictable and simple numerical codes,\u201d explained David Huerta, a digital\nsecurity trainer at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\nHe recommends using an alphanumeric passcode, the longer the better. To add an\nalphanumeric passcode:\n\n> iPhone: Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Turn Passcode On or Change Passcode\n> > Passcode Options > Custom Alphanumeric Code\n>\n> Android: Settings > Security > Screen Lock > Password\n\nTo turn your biometric lock off:\n\n> iPhone: Settings > Face ID & Passcode >Tap Reset Face ID\n>\n> Android: Settings > Security & location > Pixel Imprint > Click Delete next\n> to each fingerprint\n\nJennifer Granick, Surveillance and Cybersecurity Counsel at the American Civil\nLiberties Union, told The Markup, \u201cIt is legal to refuse to unlock your phone\nor to disclose your passcode, citing your Fifth Amendment rights if possible.\nThere should be no negative ramifications.\u201d Granick noted however, that police\ndo not always act lawfully.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Subdue Your Signals (and Download Signal)\n\nProtesters should be prepared for surveillance of their cellphone\u2019s\ntransmissions\u2014even if they don\u2019t make any calls, Huerta said.\n\nIn some parts of the United States, law enforcement has tools that can\nintercept cellphone signals, called \u201cstingrays\u201d or \u201cIMSI catchers.\u201d Stingrays\ncollect the identifying details of phones in the area by \u201cimpersonating\u201d cell\ntowers, and newer models are believed to be able to intercept calls and\nmessages, according to TechCrunch.\n\nIn 2018, the American Civil Liberties Union identified 75 agencies in 27\nstates and the District of Columbia that owned stingrays.\n\nYou can configure your phone to avoid connecting to the subset of stingrays\nthat use 2G connections:\n\n> iPhone: Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode\n>\n> Android (v12 or newer): Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs > [Carrier] >\n> Allow 2G\n\nLevelUp\n\n### Without a Trace: How to Keep Your Phone Off the Grid\n\nWe answer the questions readers asked in response to our guide to anonymizing\nyour phone\n\nDecember 13, 2023 08:00 ET\n\nNote that activating \u201cLockdown Mode\u201d on iPhone will restrict your phone use,\nand enhance your security, in a number of other ways; see the link above for\nmore details. Similarly, you may experience less reliable cellular\nconnectivity on Android without the 2G option enabled.\n\nHuerta said that since some of these devices can scoop up text messages, you\nshould use an encrypted messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp instead of your\ndefault one. (For iPhone users, iMessage is encrypted, but be warned: If you\ntext with an Android phone user, it automatically switches to SMS, which is\nnot.)\n\nHuerta recommends Signal over other apps because it\u2019s battle-tested: In 2016,\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia served a subpoena\non Open Whisper Systems, the company that makes the app, seeking information\nabout two Signal users for a federal grand jury investigation. The only\ninformation the company was holding? The time the users\u2019 accounts were created\nand the date the users last connected to the app\u2019s servers.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Lockdown Location Tracking\n\nLaw enforcement can also request \u201ccell tower dumps\u201d from telecom providers. In\nits February 2020 transparency report, AT&T disclosed that it received 1,289\ndemands for cell tower searches during the second half of 2019. The company\nsaid that the demands \u201cask us to provide all telephone numbers registered on a\nparticular cell tower for a certain period of time.\u201d\n\nPrivacy\n\n### How Political Campaigns Use Your Phone\u2019s Location to Target You\n\nBefore you got in line on Election Day, the emerging and largely unregulated\npolitical tracking industry was able to trace your movements\n\nNovember 8, 2022 08:00 ET\n\nBecause of the risk of such surveillance, some experts suggest turning off\nyour cellphone altogether at a protest. For instance, the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation recommends turning your phone off or enabling airplane mode while\nyou\u2019re at the protest, because it ensures that your device won\u2019t be\ntransmitting signals.\n\nBut turning off your phone means you won\u2019t be able to communicate with others\nor use your camera to record. So if you have to keep your phone on, try to at\nleast manage what location information your apps may have. The Verge has a\nhandy guide for Android users, and Business Insider has a comparable one for\niPhone users.\n\nYou can even turn off all location services entirely:\n\n> iPhone: Settings > Privacy > Toggle Location Services off\n>\n> Android: Settings > Location > Toggle Use location off\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Harden Your Hardware\n\nAnother scenario that Huerta suggested that protesters consider is what to do\nif your phone is seized by law enforcement. If you can, back up your device\nbefore heading out to make the decision to wipe it if you find yourself in a\ntight situation a little bit easier. There are tutorials for both iPhone and\nAndroid users.\n\nEncrypting your phone also makes it more difficult to access information if\nit\u2019s been seized, because files can only be read if someone has the encryption\nkey. DuckDuckGo, the privacy-oriented search engine, has step-by-step\ninstructions for both iPhone and Android users.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Neutralize Notifications\n\nNotifications are normally a great way to quickly check messages, but if your\nphone is lost or seized, it may reveal information that you\u2019re not comfortable\nsharing with others.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\n\u201cMany times, if you don\u2019t have a chance to turn off your phone before a device\ngets seized, even if law enforcement can\u2019t unlock your phone,\u201d Huerta said, if\nyour notifications are on, \u201cthey don\u2019t even have to unlock your phone, they\ncan just scroll down and see everything that you\u2019re up to.\u201d\n\nReducing the amount of open information that sits on your locked screen can\nincrease the security of you and the people you\u2019re communicating with.\n\nOn Android, you can strip notifications of context by going to Settings > App\n& notifications > Notifications, going to the \u201cLock screen\u201d section and\nturning off Sensitive notifications.\n\nWith iPhones, you can change how detailed an app\u2019s notifications are by going\nSettings > Notifications, selecting that app and then scrolling down to the\nOptions section and setting \u201cShow Previews\u201d to \u201cNever\u201d and \u201cNotification\nGrouping\u201d to \u201cAutomatic.\u201d\n\nYou can also turn off notifications entirely:\n\n> iPhone: Settings > Notifications > Set Show Previews to Never\n>\n> Android: Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > Notifications on\n> lock screen or On lock screen > Don\u2019t show notifications\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Think Before You Share\n\nPhotos and videos can reveal more than you intend.\n\nPrivacy\n\n### Touring a Rental? A Face Scan May Be Required\n\nWith the rise of self-guided tours, many companies are requiring facial\nrecognition to see a property\n\nApril 17, 2024 08:00 ET\n\nImage files can contain metadata that includes the date the photo was taken,\nthe make and model of the device it was shot on, and even the GPS location of\nwhere it was taken. One of the easiest ways to strip a photo of its\naccompanying metadata is to take a screenshot of it and post that instead of\nthe original image, Huerta explains.\n\nAnd even if you use a screenshot, check the image for information you might\nnot want to make public, such as indications of location and the identity of\nother people.\n\nLaw enforcement has access to powerful facial recognition databases. Civilians\nalso have tools in reach that can reverse engineer the who, what, and where of\nyour social media posts. One way to mitigate these is to cover up identifying\ninformation using an emoji or by drawing over it with a solid color.\n\nSignal Messenger also allows users to blur the faces of people in its camera\nimage editor.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Physicalize Your Phonebook\n\nPhones can run out of battery, get lost, broken, or taken away. Don\u2019t make it\nyour only way to access important contact information.\n\nReporter Madeleine Davies suggested writing down the phone number of a lawyer\nor emergency contact on your arm with a Sharpie.\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild operates legal support hotlines across the United\nStates that are specifically for people who have been arrested at political\ndemonstrations.
