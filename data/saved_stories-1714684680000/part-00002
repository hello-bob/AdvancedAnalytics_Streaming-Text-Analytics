However, no equivalent understanding of\ndreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific theories often view dreams as\nepiphenomena, and many of the proposals for their biological function are\ncontradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual\nframework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably,\nall DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when\nperformance on one dataset increases but the network's performance fails to\ngeneralize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training versus\ntesting datasets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers\nvia \u201cnoise injections\u201d in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of\nthis paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting\nand that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting during its\ndaily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing\ngeneralizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic\nactivity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, specifically\ndream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but\nfails to generalize appropriately. Herein this \u201doverfitted brain hypothesis\u201d\nis explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing\ncontemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the\nhypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set\nof testable predictions is put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in\nsilico.\n\nKeywords: dreams, deep learning, neuroscience, learning\n\nGo to:\n\n## The bigger picture\n\nDreaming remains a mystery to neuroscience. While various hypotheses of why\nbrains evolved nightly dreaming have been put forward, many of these are\ncontradicted by the sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative nature of dreams, a\nnature that seems to lack any particular function. Recently, research on\nartificial neural networks has shown that during learning, such networks face\na ubiquitous problem: that of overfitting to a particular dataset, which leads\nto failures in generalization and therefore performance on novel datasets.\nNotably, the techniques that researchers employ to rescue overfitted\nartificial neural networks generally involve sampling from an out-of-\ndistribution or randomized dataset. The overfitted brain hypothesis is that\nthe brains of organisms similarly face the challenge of fitting too well to\ntheir daily distribution of stimuli, causing overfitting and poor\ngeneralization. By hallucinating out-of-distribution sensory stimulation every\nnight, the brain is able to rescue the generalizability of its perceptual and\ncognitive abilities and increase task performance.\n\nWhy do we dream? While it is known that dreams must be important for learning,\nit is unknown precisely how or why this is. This paper explores the many\nhypotheses around why organisms dream, eventually proposing that the evolved\npurpose of dreams can be identified from research on artificial neural\nnetworks. Specifically, the overfitted brain hypothesis claims that in our\ndaily lives the brain learns its tasks too well, and dreams are necessary to\nstop this \u201coverfitting.\u201d\n\nGo to:\n\n## Introduction\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, many of those in isolation reported an\nincrease in the vividness and frequency of their dreams,^1 even leading\n#pandemicdreams to trend on Twitter. Yet dreaming is so little understood\nthere can be only speculative answers to the why behind this widespread change\nin dream behavior. This is despite the fact that humans spend hours every\nnight dreaming and that dream deprivation is highly damaging to animals^2;\nindeed, dreaming is homeostatically regulated in that there even appears to be\na \u201ddream drive.\u201d^3 In addition, dreaming is conserved across many species,^4\nindicating an essential evolved purpose.^5 Yet finding a biological function\nfor dreams themselves has evaded resolution. The \u201dnull theory\u201d that dreams are\nbyproducts of other adaptions,^6 or biological \u201dspandrels,\u201d^7 or sleep and\ndreams are adaptive only in that they prevent organisms from moving during\nperiods that they are not adapted to, such as ensuring that diurnal animals\nare inactive during night,^8^,^9 are still taken seriously.\n\nIt is notable that approximately 50% to 70% of the time subjects report having\na dream upon a sudden waking during sleep, with more dreams being reported\nlater on in the night.^10^,^11 Reports from those who keep regular dream\njournals, or who spend time each morning recollecting dreams, indicate that\npreserving a memory of dreams increases significantly with practice.^12 All\nthis hints that individuals may regularly underestimate how much time they\nactually spending dreaming during sleep.\n\nThe phenomenology of dreams is different from that of waking experience.^13\nHowever, few contemporary theories appropriately account for the phenomenology\nof dreams, particularly their sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative contents.\nWhat is the purpose of this strange state? The fact that sleep overall has\nsome relationship to learning was known even by the Roman orator\nQuintilian.^14 Yet, as is discussed in detail in the next section,\ncontemporary neuroscientific theories which relate dreaming to memory storage,\nmemory replay, or emotional processing, still view dreams themselves as\nepiphenomena.\n\nThis lack of viable theories about why animals dream stands in contrast with\nhow much is known about sleep physiology and its stages.^15 As originally\ndiscovered by lesion studies and later supported by genetic knockout studies,\nthe sleep state is brought about by a far-reaching set of subcortical\nneuromodulatory systems, with no one system being necessary, indicating\nredundancy in how the waking state is sustained.^16 In general, this\nmultifaceted arousal system is excitatory during wake in that it has the\ngreatest firing, and becomes more quiescent to bring about sleep, although\nthis is not true for all such systems, especially those that establish rapid\neye movement (REM).\n\nA classic signature of sleep are slow waves, which are waves of activity that\ntraverse the cortex, which can be identified when the dominate frequency of\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) is less than 1 Hz. In this state, the cortex become\nbistable, oscillating between periods of intense firing and periods often\nreferred to as \u201cdown states\u201d wherein neurons are silent. In general, it should\nbe noted that there is a spectrum wherein sometimes a brain region is\nexperiencing slow wave sleep and this is not synchronized with other\nregions.^17 This is despite the fact that sleep itself is traditionally broken\ndown into non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, with REM sleep being more\nassociated with dreaming than NREM sleep. Yet there is evidence that dreaming\noccurs regularly throughout the night, across different sleep stages,^18\nalthough it is rarest in the \u201cdeepest\u201d stage of NREM, stage 3, wherein surface\nEEG reflects low-frequency cortical slow waves. Recent neuroimaging and\nsudden-waking experiments have demonstrated that all sleep stages can have\ndreams, which are the result of localized wake-like firing.^19 On average,\nhigh-frequency EEG signals in posterior areas of the brain were most\ncorrelated with reports on waking. Despite the ubiquity of dreams, it is still\nthe case that REM is most strongly associated with dreaming, more than 80% to\n90% of the time in some awakening studies, although it should be noted again\nthat sleep involves a spectrum wherein it is difficult to find any stage at\nany time of the night that does not contain any dreams at all.^20 Although\nearly on in the night dreams can present themselves as more \u201cthought-like\u201d and\nsimple, later on in the night, particularly during REM, dreams can become\nincredibly complex with a fully developed narrative structure.^21 Therefore,\nwhile the story of dreaming occurring solely during REM has been complicated,\nit is true they are still associated.\n\nAs far as is currently known, dreaming of is a brain-wide state where the\nbrain is experiencing a single narrative or event, which is supported by the\nactivation of the default-mode network during dreaming.^22 Consider, for\ninstance, the evidence from sudden-waking experiments that higher frequency\nactivity in the frontal lobe predicted emotional affect within the subject's\ndream.^23 Or consider the evidence that during lucid dreaming, activity is\nsimilar to waking movements in the sensorimotor cortex.^24\n\nDespite the nuances and redundancies of the cortical systems in play, it still\nmakes sense to view the change from dreamless sleep to dreaming as occurring\nvia a brain-wide neuromodulatory system that regulates level of consciousness,\nsuch as by the increase in firing of acetylcholine-containing neurons during\nREM. Neuromodulatory systems also create the conditions of muscle atonia\nduring dreaming, without which dreams can be acted out by the body during\nsleep, a dangerous parasomnia called REM sleep behavior disorder.^25\n\nWhat is the overall evolved purpose or function of sleep? The evidence of\ndistinct physiological states brought about by neuromodulation suggests\nanswering this requires identifying multiple functions, particularly for\ndreamless sleep versus dreaming. Across the Tree of Life, sleep as a whole is\nhighly conserved; most mammals spend somewhere between 4 and 20 h sleeping.^26\nThere is even evidence that Caenorhabditis elegans sleeps.^27 In the past 2\ndecades there has been significant progress when it comes to understanding the\nevolved function of sleep as a whole, although this has not been true for\ndreams themselves.\n\nFirst, a novel discovery has led to a clear purpose for at least one aspect of\nsleep. This was the discovery of the brain's glymphatic system, showing that\nsleep involves the brain-wide flushing of metabolites with cerebral spinal\nfluid.^28 This led to the theory that sleep, especially during slow wave\nactivity, had the goal of waste clearance and this is at least partly behind\nsleep's restorative aspect. Glymphatic activity in the form of this flushing\nis low in waking but high during both sleep and while under certain types of\nanesthesia. In sleep and also under anesthesia, the greatest amount of\nflushing occurs during slow wave sleep when low-frequency delta power\ndominates the EEG,^29 indicating that it may be anticorrelated with dreaming,\nalthough this has not been explicitly established. Dreams may still occur\nduring these flushing events; indeed, it is unknown if the function of dreams\nmight even change depending on sleep stages or background neurophysiological\nconditions.\n\nAnother important theory of the purpose of sleep is the Synaptic Homeostasis\nHypothesis (SHY).^30 According to SHY, daily learning leads to net synaptic\npotentiation across the brain, which, if left unchecked, would lead to a\nsaturation of synaptic weight and a cessation of learning.^31 SHY hypothesizes\nthat slow waves trigger a brain-wide down-scaling of synaptic weights. This\nindiscriminate down-scaling ensures that the relative weights of synapses are\nkept proportional while removing the risk of saturation. SHY has served as a\nmodel neuroscientific theory in that it has generated a number of new\nempirical findings.^32 At the same time, it has also triggered fecund debate\nand investigation.^33 Traditionally, SHY is more associated with slow wave\nsleep than with the high frequencies that indicate dreaming. It has also not\nbeen explored how SHY faces the problem that a global down-scaling of synapses\ncould easily fail to keep the pattern of synaptic weights the same, since\nneurons are nonlinear mechanisms. Even a net down-scaling of an artificial\nneural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions would\nlikely affect its function if the scaling dropped any weights below zero; in\nthe case of sigmoid activation functions, it would significantly impact\nfunction, and in an unknown way.\n\nThe overall evidence indicates that sleep can be broken into two parts: during\ndreamless sleep metabolic clearance and cellular it is likely that repair\noccurs, and some form of unknown contribution to improvements in performance\nand learning on tasks occurs during dreaming.^34 Ultimately, this purpose of\nthe dreaming phase or aspect of sleep lacks hypotheses as explicit and clear\nas those for slow wave sleep.^35\n\nIn order to offer forward a distinct theory of the purpose of dreams, this\npaper outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of\noverfitting, which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep\nneural network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,\nand that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the overfitted\nbrian hypothesis (OBH). The goal of this paper is to formally fill-out the OBH\nby investigating the evidence that the brain fits to a dataset composed of the\nstatistically similar daily experiences of the organism, while nightly dreams\nimprove the generality and robustness of an animal's representations,\ncognition, and perceptual systems, by generating data far outside the\norganism's daily \u201dtraining set\u201d in a warped or corrupted way.^36 This idea is\nsupported by the idea that stochasticity (such as corrupted or sparse inputs)\nis critical in machine learning.^37 As will be discussed, the OBH fits with\nknown biological understanding and data, matches better with dream\nphenomenology than most other theories, draws various antecedents and similar\napproaches under one specific roof, and additionally has roots in common\npractices in deep learning. It makes unique predictions that can be tested\nboth via computational modeling and also in vivo.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Contemporary theories of dreams\n\nA hypothesis for the evolved purpose of sleep must outline a clear and\ndistinct function from other aspects of sleep. It must also explain how dreams\npresent themselves, that is, the phenomenology of dream experience.\nSpecifically, it must explain why dream phenomenology is different from wake\nphenomenology. Consider three phenomenological properties unique to dreams.\nFirst, the sparseness of dreams in that they are generally less vivid than\nwaking life in that they contain less sensory and conceptual information\n(i.e., less detail). This lack of detail in dreams is universal, and examples\ninclude the blurring of text causing an impossibility of reading, using\nphones, or calculations.^38 Second, the hallucinatory quality of dreams in\nthat they are generally unusual in some way (i.e., not the simple repetition\nof daily events or specific memories). This includes the fact that in dreams,\nevents and concepts often exist outside of normally strict categories (a\nperson becomes another person, a house a spaceship, and so on). Third, the\nnarrative property of dreams, in that dreams in adult humans are generally\nsequences of events ordered such that they form a narrative, albeit a fabulist\none. As we will see, the OBH posits it is not in spite of these properties\nthat dreams serve their evolved purpose, but because of them.\n\nThis section explores existent theories of dreams, the supporting evidence (or\nlack thereof) and how they fail to integrate well with, or explain, dream\nphenomenology.\n\n### Dreams are for emotional regulation\n\nThe idea that dreams are important for emotional health is a descendant of\nFreudian theories of psycholanalysis.^39 While Freud's theories of dreams as\nexpressions of taboo frustration are discredited, there is still a historical\nassociation between dreams as expressions of, or important for, emotional\nprocessing.\n\nThe specific proposals for how dreams impact emotional regulation involve\nhypotheses like that dreams are somehow for fear extinction.^40 Such\nhypotheses reason that dreams might act somewhat like cognitive behavioral\ntherapy treatment for phobias, wherein they provide a safe space for\n\u201crehearsals\u201d toward fearful things in order to make them less frightful.^41\nYet there is no evidence that the fears of nightmares are the kind of\nirrational fears faced by those with phobias, nor that fears toward\nnightmarish events in general should be attenuated, as fear is evolutionarily\nquite useful.\n\nAnother kind of theory is that dreams act much like an \u201cemotional thermostat\u201d\nin order to regulate emotions.^42^,^43 From dream journals there is some\nevidence that more emotional dreams predict better recovery from disorders\nlike depression,^44 although sample size for this sort of research is\nprohibitively small throughout oneirology. From neuroimaging there is evidence\nthat emotional processing centers like the amygdala show greater activity\nduring REM even than during wake,^45 although the role of the amygdala ranges\nwidely from emotions to rewards to motivations.^46 There is some evidence that\nchanges in REM sleep indicate mood disorders.^47 However, this is not unique\nto only REM sleep, as NREM sleep is also changed or reduced in mood\ndisorders,^48 and many cognitive disorders show sleep problems in general.^49\nSleep deprivation does appear to lead to emotional issues such as a lack of\nemotional inhibition and also irritability.^50 But such failures of\nappropriate function holds true across many cognitive processes following\nsleep deprivation, including executive function, which would affect emotional\nregulation.^51\n\nOverall, the hypothesis that dreams are for resolving emotional conflicts\nspecifically does not have overwhelming empirical evidence. It is also not\nsupported by the phenomenology of dreams, which, at least in general, are not\nemphatically emotional. Indeed, emotionally neutral dreams are common. Overall\nthere appears to be a slight bias to dreams to have negative affect,^52\nalthough this may simply be that dreams that have high emotional valence are\nmemorable (and it is worth noting that in studying dream reports joy/elation\nwas the next most common to anxiety/fear). Given the evidence it seems likely\nthat whatever the evolved purpose of dreams is, its function can affect\nemotions, but there is no strong evidence that dreaming has evolved\nspecifically for emotional regulation.\n\n### Dreams are for memory consolidation\n\nPerhaps the leading contemporary theory is that dreams somehow involve memory\nconsolidation and storage,^53 often via a proposed form of memory replay.^54\nThe dominant metaphor for this theory of consolidation is that of the\ncomputer: memories need to be \u201cstored\u201d somewhere in the brain, like storing a\ncomputer file on a hard drive, and therefore there must be a storage process.\nThis viewpoint is held by much of traditional cognitive neuroscience, wherein\nthe goal of the brain is to \u201cstore\u201d memories as veridically as possible,^55\nalthough there is growing recognition that veridical \u201ccomputer-like\u201d storage\nis not desirable for complex learning and that forgetting is just as\nimportant.^56 According to the memory consolidation hypothesis, memory storage\noccurs during dreams, or alternatively dreams, by accessing previously stored\nmemories, strengthen them, or that somehow dreams are a byproduct of\nintegrating new memories with older ones.\n\nThere is a significant line of research that draws from this theory, including\nmany neuroimaging studies, and a full review of the literature would be beyond\nthe scope of this paper.^57 However, there is also debate. Specifically the\nconsolidation hypothesis is both very broad and rarely meant to specify just\ndreams rather than sleep in general.^58 For example, there is evidence that\nlearning a new task leads to a greater activation during both REM^59 and slow\nwave sleep^60 in the task-relevant cortical areas, which indicates there is no\npreferential consolidation during dreaming. This is true even when comparing a\nwake/sleep condition versus a control condition without sleep but over the\nsame time, which has found that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity\nincreased in associated brain regions with the task.^61 But these sorts of\nneuroimaging studies are not very specific, since increased activation in\nrelevant areas does not actually mean storage, nor replay, nor integration\nwith existing memories. Indeed, they could be interpreted just as easily for\nevidence of the OBH (see \u201cEvidence from neuroscience\u201d).\n\nA significant line of direct evidence for the consolidation theory comes in\nthe form of \u201creplay\u201d of memories during sleep, a specific hypothesis with a\nclear thesis and standards of evidence. Replay was originally discovered in\nthe hippocampus of rats,^62^,^63 although the original analysis was again for\nslow wave sleep, not correlating this process to dreaming specifically.\nIndeed, the same statistically increased firing in correlated neurons that\ncounts as \u201creplay\u201d occurs during quiet wakefulness, indicating it has nothing\nspecific to do with dreams.^64 In general, if two neurons potentiate at the\nsame time and from the same cause, they are more likely to be correlated in\nthe sense of increased firing in the future, regardless of whether they are\nreplaying anything specific, a view supported by the finding that \u201creplay\u201d\nevents are much faster in terms of their firing.^65\n\nThere are a number of significant issues with the specific hypotheses that\ndreams are replaying memories.^54 First, offline replay of episodic memories\nmay not actually assist memorization; since ground truth is absent offline,\nsuch replays might actually introduce errors. Indeed, neuroscience has shown\nthat re-accessing memories generally changes them, rather than enforces\nthem.^66^,^67 Due to the issues in assuming that specific memories are\nactually replayed, a number of authors have proposed more complex theories of\nconsolidation, such as that the idea there exists two complementary learning\nsystems and replay connects these two systems together.^68 Furthermore, the\nhypothesis must grapple with the fact that well-controlled neuroimaging\nexperiments show little evidence for exact sequence replication and strong\nevidence for mostly never-before-seen firing patterns.^69 In light of this\nsort of evidence, some have argued that sleep promotes gist extraction from\nspecific memories,^70^,^71 although these sorts of hypotheses have not\nspecifically been about dreaming.\n\nOverall, replay is unlikely to be the purpose of dreams, since, as previously\ndiscussed, based on the most detailed studies on dream reports after\nawakenings, dreams are not connected or, at most, only vaguely connected with\nthe day's events.^72 Overall, it appears that less than 1% to 2% of dream\nreports have anything to do with episodic memories.^73 Except in cases of\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dreams do not repeat specific memories,\nand those that do are considered pathological; for instance, closely after\nHurricane Andrew, the only hurricane-related dreams, even from a sample of the\npopulation from the hardest hit area, were from those already diagnosed with\nPTSD.^74 Close studies of dream journals have in general found that replays of\nspecific memories or a day's events are generally either rare or nonexistent,\nalthough they do in general involve actions and people the dreamer is familiar\nwith.^75 One study examining dreams after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 found\nthat \u201cnot a single one of the 880 dreams (440 of them after 9/11) involved\nplanes hitting tall buildings or similar scenarios, even though all the\nparticipants had seen these events many times on television (and it was\nclearly an emotionally important experience). No scenes were pictured that\nwere even close to the actual attacks.\u201d^76^,^77\n\nIndeed, there is significant evidence that episodic memory and dreams are\ndissociated.^78 While there is behavioral evidence that repetitive daily\ntasks, like having subjects play Tetris for significant periods of time, can\nlead to Tetris-inspired dreams, such inculcated images or sequences do not\nrepresent replay in that they are not veridical repeats of previous games,\nbeing more hallucinatory and sparse in content and only being loosely related\nto the played game, such as dreaming of playing some altered version of a maze\ngame after being exposed to it during the day.^79 Moreover, dreams triggered\nby such repetitive games appear even in patients completely lacking all\nmemory, those with clinically diagnosed amnesia.^80 It can take several days\nfor repetitive tasks to show up in dreams, a form of \u201cdream lag,\u201d and almost\nalways these tasks appear in partial forms that are, again, only loosely\nsimilar.^81 Overall, the behavioral evidence suggests that dreams are not\nreplays of memories or waking events.\n\nThere is a strong line of evidence from Tetris-studies to sudden wake-ups to\ndream-lag effects showing that partial or loosely similar dreams can be\ntriggered most reliably by recently learned tasks, and yet such inculcated\ndreams generally take the form of never-before-seen experiences or sequences\nwith the traditional dream-like properties of sparseness and hallucination,\nmatching no specific memory but rather a seeming exploration of the state-\nspace of the task itself.\n\nIt is worth noting that in most cases the sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative\nproperties of dreams are unaccounted for by the consolidation hypothesis. Most\ndreams do not involve specific memories at all, making the integration of new\nmemories a questionable purpose for dreaming. Indeed, it is openly admitted\nthat the consolidation hypothesis still views dreams themselves as\nepiphenomena.^54 As we will see, much of the supporting results for the\nintegration, replay, or storage of memories actually fits better with the OBH\n(\u201cEvidence from neuroscience\u201d).\n\n### Dreams are for selective forgetting\n\nNotably, Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchinson proposed an alternative purpose\nfor dreams in 1983, which they called \u201creverse learning.\u201d^82^,^83 In this\nhypothesis, the point of dreaming is somehow to remove \u201cundesirable\u201d\nconnections and help the brain \u201cunlearn.\u201d Yet this hypothesis has been largely\nignored in contemporary dreaming research. Instead, the alternative\nhypothesis, that dreams involve replay or consolidation of memory, became\nfavored by the community^84 due to the excitement around early replay\nresults.^62 Contemporary neuroscientific research often views there as being\nboth a consolidation phase as well as a forgetting phase for memories,\nalthough this is again predominately associated with slow wave sleep, rather\nthan dreaming specifically.^85 Within deep learning it is known that averaging\ntogether models and renormalizing can assist in learning^86 which could\nbroadly be thought to resemble some sort of selective forgetting in real\nneural networks. More specifically, it has been proposed that Boltzmann\nmachines may actually implement something very similar to the Crick and\nMitchinson notion of reverse learning wherein synaptic down-scaling could\neliminate the discrepancy between environmental inputs and a system's internal\nmodel of the environment,^87 which is an earlier version of the sorts of\npredictive processing theories discussed in the section \u201cDreams benefit\npredictive processing by refining generative models.\u201d Indeed, it has been\nargued that down-scaling of synapses might themselves prevent\noverfitting,^88^,^89 thus providing a possible link between SHY, the OBH, and\nthe original reverse learning hypothesis.\n\nRecently there has been explicit computational modeling in spiking neural\nnetworks showing that \u201creverse learning\u201d in the form of reverse learning rules\ncan indeed prove helpful. Specifically, the authors showed that an anti-\nlearning rule during a \u201csleep phase\u201d of the network, in the form of anti-\nHebbian learning, could break up attractor states that were detrimental to\nlearning.^90 It is worth noting that breaking up detrimental attractor states\ncould lead to similar outcomes as the OBH. However, in general any sort of\n\u201creverse learning\u201d is not necessary from the perspective of the OBH. This is\nbecause \u201creverse learning\u201d approaches differ significantly by focusing on how\nspecific memories are destroyed (via anti-learning mechanisms like a\nhypothetical \u201creverse Spike-timing-dependent plasticity\u201d) rather than how\ncorrupted inputs or top-down noise can improve generalization like in the OBH.\n\n### Dreams are preparations for real-world problems\n\nThe close correlation between creativity and dreams, as well as the similarity\nof dreams to simulations or virtual realities, has led to hypotheses that\ndreaming can be used to solve relevant real-world problems for the animal. For\nexample, perhaps dreams allow for creative experimentation where the dreamer\nkeeps the best ideas put forth,^91 although this is problematic given the\ngenerally amnesiac nature of dreams and their lack of real-world relevance. A\nmore direct hypothesis is that dreams act as rehearsals for stereotypical\nbehaviors for animals in a form of \u201cgenetic programming.\u201d^92 In more\ncontemporary studies, this has been referred to as the hypothesis that dreams\nact as proto-conscious states to prepare for activities during waking\nbehavior.^93\n\nSimilar examples of this hypothesis include an interpretation based off of\nrobots that used simulations to figure out self-models^94 or that an animal\nmight \u201cdream up strategies for success\u201d at night, like for how to best climb\nobstacles, like rocks, that it faced during the day.^95 Evidence for this sort\nof hypothesis is that there is a form of neural \u201cpre-play\u201d wherein the\nsequences of activity predict future behavior of the animal and indicate\nplanning or pre-processing,^96^,^97 although this effect may simply be because\nanimals are forced to use a limited set of preconfigured firing sequences to\nrepresent the world.^98^,^99 In a similar manner to the replay results, it is\nalso likely that most of the time pre-play is not the actual specific future\nsequences of activity, and that most sequences are never instantiated during\nwake. Perhaps the simplest and most direct hypothesis is that dreams allow for\navoidance practice of dangerous situations, such as running from a predator,\nthat would be impossible to practice in real life without immense risk.^100\nHowever, this is contradicted by the fact that only a small percentage of\ndreams contain this sort of behavior (even when defining threats incredibly\nbroadly), and in those that do realistic plans of actions in these scenarios\nare rarely actually implemented.^101^,^102 Yet despite the unrealistic nature\nof dreams, it may be that exploring unlikely or weak associations has\npsychological benefits.^103\n\nAnother hypothesis is the idea that dreams are actually for refining the\nability to create simulations themselves. This \u201dInSim\u201d hypothesis, which\nspecifically is a hypothesis about the dreams of young children, posits that\ndreams are chances to create simulations and then test their predictions\nagainst the real world upon waking.^104^,^105 However, this only applies to\nyoung children (with the assumption that the few studies are correct that\nchildren's dreams are more \u201cboring\u201d than adult dreams), since, as the authors\nthemselves point out, adult dreams would be consistently invalidated by daily\nevents. Indeed, the phenomenology of dreams as sparse and hallucinatory and\nfabulist make it unlikely that strategies or abilities or preparations that\noriginate in dreams work at all in the real world.\n\nHowever, these types of theories are likely right to view dreams as\nsimulations. Yet according to the OBH the purpose of these simulations is not\nto refine a particular ability or strategy or plan of action, which is what\nsimulations normally are for. Instead, the purpose is to provide \u201dout-of-\ndistribution\u201d simulations specifically to prevent overfitting and improve\ngeneralization, wherein overfitting is essentially an unavoidable issue\nbrought about by daily learning and therefore a constant threat to the brain's\nperformance on various tasks.\n\n### Dreams benefit predictive processing by refining generative models\n\nPredictive processing is the view that the brain continuously tries to predict\nits own future states in relation to extrinsic sensory input.^106^,^107 In a\npredictive processing framework, predictions traverse in a top-down fashion,\nwhile sensory input occurs in a bottom-up fashion. Predictions are then\ncompared with inputs, with the goal of minimizing prediction errors, which\ncorresponds to improving the brain's predictions about its own future states.\nPrediction error can be minimized by changes in action and behavior, a process\ncalled \u201cactive inference.\u201d^108\n\nPredictive processing has become a popular lens through which to view\ncognitive science,^109 and has origins in work on Helmholtz machines,\nstatistical inference, and the \u201cwake-sleep algorithm.\u201d^110 Note the proposal\nof the wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised learning goes back 25 years,^111\nwhich are effectively a precursor to the contemporary notion of an\nautoencoder.\n\nDespite its origins in the field of machine learning, the predictive\nprocessing approach is controversial due to its claims of universality: it is\nunclear that the cortex actually functions primarily to generate predictions\nabout its own future state.^112 Furthermore, there are fundamental criticisms\nabout whether minimizing prediction error via actions is actually a\ntheoretically coherent goal for a universal principle. For instance, why would\nan organism not go sit in a \u201cdark room\u201d in order to minimize its prediction\nerrors, since it would always know what to expect?^113\n\nMultiple views of dreams in the light of predictive processing has been put\nforward^114 arguing for specific neurophysiological correlates and mechanisms.\nIn general, in such theories the phenomenology of dreams is accounted for by\nthe breakdown of the perception-action loop during dreaming: essentially the\nbrain's activity is dominated by its \u201cpriors\u201d rather than bottom-up input.\nSome predictive processing proponents have put forward views that the role of\ndreams is not actually to test inferences about actions, but to improve a\nhypothesized generative model (in this context a model used by brain to make\npredictions), specifically by reducing this generative model's complexity by\npruning redundant synapses.^115 According to this hypothesis, the proposed\nevolved purpose of dreaming during REM sleep is to minimize the free energy of\nthe brain. Free energy is essentially the complexity of the brain's model\nminus the accuracy of the brain's predictions about its own states, and\ntherefore reducing model complexity is important for minimizing free energy.\nSpecifically, the hypothesis put forward in Hobson and Friston^115 is that\nsynaptic pruning (of the kind proposed in SHY during slow wave sleep)^31 can\nhelp minimize model complexity (and therefore help minimize the free energy)\nsince overall parameters of a model are reduced when synapses are pruned.\nHowever, SHY actually specifies that there is a net reduction of synaptic\nweight specifically so that waking activity is generally unaffected by this\nchange, and additionally it is also specifically associated with NREM and slow\nwave sleep rather than REM and dreaming. It is worth noting that down-scaling\nin general and its effects on model complexity and minimization of error, even\nthe possibility of this occurring during REM, had been previously\nproposed,^88^,^89 as discussed in the section \u201cDreams are for selective\nforgetting.\u201d\n\nIn Hobson and colleagues,^116 a further related hypothesis without reference\nto synaptic pruning or down-scaling was introduced based on the idea that,\naccording to the free energy principle, the brain is continuously trying to\nbetter predict its own future states. Therefore when the brain lacks bottom-up\nsensory input (i.e., during dreaming) the brain is still compelled to minimize\nfree energy, meaning that the model complexity must implicitly be reduced\nsince any prediction errors can stem only from internal consistency of the\nmodel rather than inconsistencies with the outside world. According to this\nview \u201c ... we propose that REM sleep is an occasion for reiterating and\noptimizing a generative model of the embodied self with reference to waking\nexperience.\u201d^116 However, in general, predictive processing and particularly\nactive inference approaches to dreaming face a problem: in the vast majority\nof dreams agency is actually minimized, not maximized (a view supported by the\ndecreased contribution of prefrontal areas during dreaming).^117^,^118 That\nis, dreams are not \u201ccausal playgrounds\u201d wherein the outcomes of actions are\ncontinuously tested against the perceptions they generate. This may be the\ncase of lucid dreaming, but lucid dreaming accounts for a small minority of\ndreams.^119\n\nOutside of relying on the assumption that the goal of the brain is always to\nminimize free energy and that actions are consequential in dreams in the same\nway they are in wake, another particular concern about the hypothesis is that\ndreams, given their phenomenology as fabulist and hallucinatory, do not seem\nvery good candidates for minimizing the surprise of predictions created by a\ngestalt generative model (let alone a model of the \u201cembodied self\u201d). For\ninstance, if dreams were about creating optimal prior beliefs or improving a\nmodel's self-consistency by minimizing input-less prediction errors (as in\nHobson and colleagues^116), the consequence would be that dreams should become\nless surprising throughout development as input-less prediction error is\nminimized. This process should lead to the generative model becoming more\ninternally consistent, more parsimonious, tame, and therefore more like the\nwaking world, both over development and over a given night's sleep. Yet this\nis precisely the opposite of what empirical data show, wherein dreams of\nchildren are self-reported as static and uninteresting and become more\ninteresting and surprising across development.^120 Indeed, there is no\nevidence that dreams become optimized for a lack of surprise or for internal\nconsistency over time. While the world may become more predictable over a\nlifetime, dreams do not. This same sort of criticism can be applied to the\nsuggestion that the purpose of sleep is actually to implement the wake-sleep\nalgorithm itself.^121 In addition, this idea faces a number of other problems,\nsuch as the fact the wake-sleep algorithm is only for a specific form of\nunsupervised learning that trains a generative model and the brain obviously\ndoes much more than that. Furthermore, implementing the wake-sleep algorithm\nrequires several assumptions that are not biologically realistic, like\ntraining solely feedforward or feedback connections at different times.\n\nHowever, it should be stressed that the background advantage posited by this\napproach to dreaming is its effect on model complexity, which is similar to\nthe focus of the OBH, since reductions in model complexity in machine learning\nare generally associated with a reduction in overfitting. It is also worth\nnoting that the free energy principle approach to dreaming is highly specific\nin how this is accomplished by the minimization of errors in a generative\nmodel's predictions of itself without inputs, rather than via how corrupted or\nstochastic inputs assist generalization as in the OBH. This provides evidence\nthat the concerns of the OBH, although not the OBH itself, can be motivated by\ndiverse takes on brain function (further discussed in \u201cDreams are for\nselective forgetting\u201d and the Discussion). Indeed, the OBH could possibly be\nthought of as a generalization of the issue model complexity plays in\npredictive processing to all of learning and performance instead of a just for\na specific self-model, and without relying on an assumed drive to minimization\nprediction errors as the mechanism of action (and therefore the OBH does not\nshare the consequences of this drive like dreams becoming unsurprising over\ntime). However, the OBH can be motivated entirely independently by common\npractices in deep learning, their resemblance to dream phenomenology, and the\nsimilar challenges the brain faces during its daily learning to those of\ntraining a neural network.\n\nGo to:\n\n## The overfitted brain hypothesis\n\nAs technology advances, science often appropriates new technologies for\nmetaphors that help understand complex systems.^122 This has been particularly\ntrue of neuroscience. In the past decade it has become apparent that there are\nmany lessons for neuroscience to be taken from brain-inspired deep neural nets\n(DNNs), which offer a different framework for thinking about learning than\nstandard computer architectures. DNNs are far and away the only successful\nanalog to human intelligence on complex tasks, and they tend to develop brain-\nlike connectivity and representational properties, like grid-cells, shape-\ntuning, and visual illusions.^123 One of the most significant differences\nbetween DNNs and the brain is that updating of synaptic weights in accordance\nwith the backpropagation of errors has traditionally been looked on as\nbiologically unrealistic. Yet new research reveals that the brain may\nimplement core features of backpropagation, with viable candidates like neural\ngradient representation by activity differences.^124\n\nTherefore, there is good reason for neuroscience to look to deep learning for\ninspiration, since both are systems that perform complex tasks via the\nupdating of weights within an astronomically large parameter space. It is\nclear that the challenges the brain and DNNs face during learning and\nperformance on complex tasks overlap significantly. Notably, one of the most\nubiquitous challenges DNNs face is a trade-off between generalization and\nmemorization, wherein as they learn to fit one particular dataset, they can\nbecome less generalizable to others. This overfitting is identifiable when\nperformance on the training set begins to differentiate from performance on\nthe testing set. An omnipresent problem within the deep learning community,\nsolutions to overfitting in DNNs most often comes in the form of a noise\ninjection, such as making input datasets corrupted and therefore less self-\nsimilar.^125 Perhaps the most common explicit technique to prevent overfitting\nis dropout, which is mathematically the injection of noise and the corruption\nof input during learning.^126 Notably the more self-similar or biased your\nsampling of training data is, the more overfitting will be an issue.\n\nThe brain faces these challenges as it learns, since what an organism\nexperiences every day can be highly self-similar and biased in its sampling of\nthe environment. The OBH states that dreams offer a biologically realistic\n\u201cnoise injection.\u201d Specifically, there is good evidence that dreams are based\non the stochastic percolation of signals through the hierarchical structure of\nthe cortex, activating the default-mode network.^127 Note that there is\ngrowing evidence that most of these signals originate in a top-down\nmanner,^128 meaning that the \u201ccorrupted inputs\u201d will bear statistical\nsimilarities to the models and representations of the brain. In other words,\nthey are derived from a stochastic exploration of the hierarchical structure\nof the brain. This leads to the kind of structured hallucinations that are\ncommon during dreams.\n\nThe hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means\nthey are extremely different from the \u201ctraining set\u201d of the animal (i.e.,\ntheir daily experiences). The diurnal cycle of fitting to tasks during the\nday, and avoiding overfitting at night via a semi-random walk of experiences,\nmay be viewed as a kind of \u201csimulated annealing\u201d^129 in the brain. That is, it\nis the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience\nthat gives them their biological function.\n\nTo sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted\ninput, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of\nthe brain, causing feedback to generate warped or \u201ccorrupted\u201d sensory input.\nThe overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent\noverfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a\nspecific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-\nof-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli. As will be discussed, the OBH fits\nwell with the disparate known data about dreams, such as their physiological\norigin in the form of noise that creates \u201ccorrupted features\u201d via\nneuromodulatory influences, their role in learning, and their importance for\nproblem solving and creativity. However, most importantly, it does not\nconsider dreams as epiphenomena generated by some background process, and it\nalso accounts for, and is motivated by, the actual phenomenology of dreams\nthemselves. The sparseness of dreams comes from the \u201cdropout\u201d of bottom-up\ninputs since they are driven solely by feedback activity, their hallucinatory\nnature comes from the higher-up stochastic origin which means they are\npurposeful corrupted or warped away from the daily \u201ctraining set\u201d the organism\nnormally experiences, and their narrative nature from the top-down genesis of\ndreams since the brain understands reality in the form of events and stories.\nThat is, according to the OBH, the distinct phenomenology of dreams exists to\nmaximize their effectiveness at improving generalization and combating mere\nmemorization of an organisms day. The evidence for the OBH, as well as more\ndetails about its distinguishing claims, are overviewed in the following\nsection.\n\n### Evidence from neuroscience\n\nWhat is the evidence for the OBH from traditional methods of neuroscience? It\nis worth focusing not on all the studies available, but those that distinguish\nthe OBH from the theory that dreams are correlated (in some unspecified way)\nwith learning.\n\nIn human behavioral experiments, there is good supporting evidence for the OBH\nspecifically. First, the most effective means of triggering dreams that\ncontain partial similarities to real-life events is through repetitive\novertraining on a task. Examples of this include extensive playing of games\nlike Tetris^80 or ski-simulators,^130 which led to dreams involving the\nlearned task, although not specific repetitions or replays of memories. Put\nanother way: the surest way to trigger dreams about a real-world event is to\nperform a task repetitively during the day, preferably one that is novel.\nUnder the OBH, the explanation for this effect, as well as the specifics of\nthe benefits of dreaming, is clearly outlined. Overtraining on a novel task\ncreates the condition of the brain being overfitted to the task, which then\ntriggers nightly dreams attempting to generalize performance on the task.\nEvidence of dreaming about tasks specifically improving daily performance on\nthose tasks can be found for things like mirror tracing^131 and reading with\ninverted goggles on.^132 Even driving cars seems correlated to dreams about\ndriving.^75 It is likely therefore there is a homeostatic component to the OBH\nwherein different modules, processes, or systems within the brain become\noverfitted from usage, which are then most likely to trigger dreams involving\nthose modules. If so, neurons involved in recent learning would be most\naffected by overfitting. In this way the OBH can account for many of the\nstatistical \u201creplay\u201d results since those neurons that saw synaptic changes in\nresponse learning are most affected by the regularization of dreaming, and\nsince exact sequence replication is rare and most \u201creplay\u201d is actually never-\nbefore-seen firing patterns.^69\n\nAnother line of evidence for the OBH is that in humans there is evidence of\ntask-dependency when it comes to whether sleep improves learning. For adult\nhumans, perceptual tasks showed little to no learning increase from sleep\nwherein cognitive tasks showed significant gains from learning.^133 Since it\nis likely that adult humans already have well-fitted perceptual models, we\nshould expect complex cognitive tasks to trigger more gain from an increase in\ngeneralizability. While dream reports are actually less common in young\nchildren, particularly below the age of 7, from what can be gleaned,\nchildren's dreams are much more static and perceptual, focusing on individual\nscenes rather than full narratives or events, indicating that perceptual\nsystems are likely still being reorganized during dreams.^120 Meanwhile\nnewborns exhibit \u201cactive sleep,\u201d their version of REM, for 50% of their 16 to\n18 h of daily sleep, perhaps indicating that early perceptual models are in\nconstant danger of overfitting.\n\nThe OBH is also supported by evidence that sleep does not simply improve\nmemory directly, but affects some aspects of memory more than others. For\ninstance, in a word association test, direct associations, the equivalent of\npure memorization, did not benefit that much from a night's sleep, while word\nassociations were better able to resist interfering associations.^134 This\nindicates again that memorization is least affected by sleep, but generalized\nperformance is most affected. This holds true even in infants, wherein sleep\nis correlated with increased generalization and abstraction\nabilities.^135^,^136\n\nIn addition, there is evidence from behavioral studies that overtraining on a\ntexture-discrimination task leads to decreased performance on it, and that\nsleep specifically, above and beyond the passage of time, rescues this\nperformance.^137 This fits with anecdotal reports of plateauing in terms of\nperformance on a task, like a video game, only to sleep and have increased\nperformance the next day.\n\nThere is also the long-standing traditional association between dreams and\ncreativity, a rich literature. Anecdotal reports about dreams and creativity\nare supported by careful studies of how sleep improves abstraction and\nreasoning on tasks.^138^,^139 This fits directly with the OBH, since an\nincrease in generalization would directly lead to more insights in complex\nproblems, or better performance on cognitive tasks that require creativity.\nIndeed, it explains the link between creativity and dreaming better than the\nhypotheses that dreaming is for the integration of new with old memories, the\nreplay of memories, or their storage.\n\nFinally, it might be argued that it is a problem for the OBH that dreams are\ngenerally amnesiac, with explicit memory a rarity during dreams. Would it not\nbe strange then that the content of dreams have any effect on the abilities of\na neural network? Here, an important distinction should be made between\naccessing explicit declarative memories and the general fact that learning\ninvolves changes to synapses. For instance, the amnesiac effect during sleep\nmay due to prefrontal inhibition. Just as prefrontal cortex inhibition means\nthat dreams are not recognizable as dreams when they are occurring, it may be\nthat the same inhibition makes it difficult to recall in the sense of\ncognitive access.^21 Anecdotal evidence from those with dream journals\nsuggests that paying attention to dreams makes them easier to remember,\nlending credence to this hypothesis.^12 In addition, sudden-waking experiments\nshow that dream content is common and recallable. Likely the effects of not\nbeing able to either form or access episodic memories of all dreams at the end\nof the night are due to the neuromodulatory milieu during sleep.\n\nSupporting the OBH is evidence indicating that dreams lead to synaptic changes\nin the connectivity of the brain, albeit likely this is not as strongly as\nwaking experience, with episodic memory storage significantly reduced. What is\nthe evidence that synapses change during sleep? Proponents of SHY have argued\nthat there is evidence that synapses change during sleep in the form of\nsynaptic homeostasis, regularization which occurs every night in the form of\nuniversal down-scaling of synaptic strength.^32 However, this has been\nchallenged by the observation of potentiation during sleep.^140 In general it\nappears that whether there is net potentiation or depression during waking\ndepends on the task,^141 indicating that learning involves synaptic plasticity\nin both directions in both wake and sleep.^142 If during dreams synapses are\nindeed still plastic, then dreams can leave a synaptic trace that can affect\nperformance. However, it should be noted that as of yet there is no strong\nempirical evidence that the content of dreams can lead to synaptic changes and\nlearning as the content of waking experience does, and this is difficult to\nexplore experimentally.\n\n### Evidence from deep learning\n\nOne of the most significant, and ubiquitous, challenges any deep neural\nnetwork faces is the ability to generalize beyond the dataset it has been\ntrained on, that is, to avoid simply memorizing the dataset. There has been\nsignificant effort in the past decade by the deep learning community to\ndevelop methods and techniques to avoid overfitting on particular datasets\nand, at the broadest level, to allow for extrapolation to never-before-seen\ndatasets. This section overviews three commonly used such techniques within\ndeep learning (and research into artificial neural networks generally).\nNotably, each of these three techniques embodies some phenomenological\nproperty of dreams and also fits with what is known about the neurophysiology\nof dreaming.\n\nThe first technique is the data augmentation method of dropout, perhaps the\nmost widely used technique for preventing overfitting in deep learning.^143\nDropout occurs during the training of a network, when inputs are made sparse\nby randomly \u201cdropping out\u201d some of them, a form of regularization during\nlearning which is mathematically similar to a noise injection.^126 It is\nimportant to note that dreams resemble dropout in their spareness, as they do\nnot contain as much perceptual information, or details in general, as waking\nexperiences. For example, phones are generally unusable in dreams because\nthere is not enough phenomenological detail to support such small icons and\ntext. This likely increases the salience of relevant features while minimizing\nirrelevant features, assisting in generalization by making representations\nmore robust and invariant, since one reason dropout is successful is that it\nacts like an averaging effect over different models the data could be drawn\nfrom. Dreams are a lesser or weakened state of conscious experience because of\nthis dropping out of bottom-up stimuli, lacking much of the detail of waking\nconscious experiences. This, according to the OBH, actually assists, rather\nthan hinders, their function.\n\nThe second technique that supports the OBH is the method of domain\nrandomization used in training DNNs. In domain randomization, the inputs\nduring learning are \u201crandomized\u201d in the sense of being warped or corrupted in\nparticular ways. This can drastically assist with learning and generalization.\nParadoxically, simulating hallucinatory inputs rather than learning off of\nreal inputs helps deep neural networks learn real-world tasks.^144 Domain\nrandomization has have been used in cutting-edge techniques in deep learning,\nsuch as being necessary for having a DNN solve a Rubik's Cube using a robot\nhand.^145 Domain randomization resembles the hallucinatory quality of dreams\nin that dreams depart significantly from normal experiences, as if they have\nbeen randomly drawn from a varied set of different domains.\n\nThe third common practice in deep learning that has ties to dreaming is the\nuse of some generative model to expand the training set of the neural network,\nwhich can assist in learning various tasks. Generative models lie behind the\nsuccess of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other techniques that\nallow for cutting-edge performance on complex tasks using sets of feedforward\nnetworks that anticipate the other's output.^146 It is worth noting that GANs\nand others often produce notoriously dream-like fabulist outputs.^147 Indeed,\nrecently an external generative model that created \u201cdream-like\u201d input helped\ntrain a DNN to produce the code behind a given mathematical mapping.^148 It\nhas been shown that input created from a generative model can indeed assist\nwith learning, such as preventing catastrophic forgetting.^149 It should be\nnoted that in most these cases the generative model exists outside the network\nitself, which is not biologically realistic in the case of the brain, although\nthere are some exceptions.^150 What of those cases where the network itself\nacts the generative model? This is much closer to the case of the dreaming\nbrain. In networks that are not purely feedforward or have external models\nthat can be manipulated by experimenters, the stimulation of higher layers\n(generally through the injection of noise) can lead to patterns of activity in\nthe lower layers that recapitulate the statistical properties of inputs, as if\nthe network were being stimulated from the bottom-up from imaginary sources\n(this is similar to the wake-sleep algorithm discussed in \u201cDreams benefit\npredictive processing by refining generative models\u201d). This is likely the case\nin the brain, wherein stochastic activity high in the hierarchy of brain\nregions creates hallucinatory patterns of inputs via feedback connections.\n\nIndeed, it is likely the case that dreams are indeed a result of noise in the\nbrain's hierarchical structure that traverses its feedback connectivity, which\nfits with the evidence that dreams are \u201ctop-down.\u201d^151 This further fits with\nevidence that dreaming drawn from the brain's model of the world becomes more\nnarrative and complex over time, particularly during adolescence.^152 By\nadulthood, dreams take on the narrative structure of human cognition wherein\nstories and metaphors and events make up the core function of thought.^153\nSince narratives are the way by which human brains understand the world,^154\nstochastic stimulation of the hierarchical structure of the brain produces\nnarratives, which act as hallucinatory and sparse bottom-up input for\nlearning, thus combating overfitting and improving generalization. In this way\nthey are a direct expansion of the normal \u201ctraining set\u201d of an animal, since\nnarratives and events are how conscious perception itself proceeds and\nunderstands the world.^155\n\nThe OBH claims that dreams resemble a combination of these three techniques: a\nsparse, corrupted, or randomized set of sensory inputs, which are likely\ncreated by feedback exploiting the hierarchical nature of the brain as a\ngenerative model, and the purpose of these experiences is to expand and\nregularize the limited and biased \u201ctraining set\u201d of the organism to prevent\noverfitting. Of course, the precise implementation of these techniques (such\nas their combined nature) must be different for the brain than in deep\nlearning research. This is because the brain faces many challenges that\nartificial neural networks do not. Any organism that implemented dropout or\ndomain randomization during its daily learning would face serious survival\nissues. Therefore, in order to increase generality and avoid overfitting and\npure memorization of waking sensory input a dedicated offline period is\nneeded. Sleep, possibly having originally evolved for other housekeeping\nreasons, is the perfect time.\n\nOverall, the overlap between the phenomenology of dreams and common methods in\nthe field of deep learning for mitigating overfitting, avoiding pure\nmemorization, and assisting generalization lend credence to the idea that the\nevolved function of dreaming is for precisely these purposes.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Predictions\n\nThe OBH puts together several lines of investigation under one roof by being\nexplicit about asking how generalization during learning can benefit from\ndreams. This involves understanding how dreams can help overcome an organism's\nreliance on memorizing just a day's events, which is often highly\nstatistically biased. The theory makes a number of specific predictions which\ncan be pursued both experimentally as well as theoretically.\n\n### Experimental validation\n\nExperimental investigation of the OBH within neuroscience can consist of\nseveral components. Under the OBH, much of the benefit of dreaming is in the\nrealm of generalizability not memorization per se, and this can be\ndifferentiated with well-designed behavioral tests. For example, it may be\nthat direct measurement of overfitting is possible in humans. This may include\nthe training of subjects on overly repetitious tasks in order to ensure the\ncondition of overfitting. It may also include using similar techniques as\nthose within deep learning to test for generalization of performance.\n\nIn animal models there have not been explicit attempts to separate out the\ndifference between pure memorization and generalization, and the effect of\nsleep deprivation on each. According to the OBH, memorization should be less\naffected by sleep deprivation than generalization. Therefore, using mouse\nmodels of things like context fear generalization^156 could be examined under\nconditions of sleep deprivation or, if possible, dream deprivation. Beyond\nbehavioral predictions and subsequent studies, there is also the possibility\nof attempting to track synaptic plasticity in response to dreams. This may\ninclude things like tracking changes in dendritic spine morphology during REM,\nsuch have been used to track spine morphology changes during sleep to\ninvestigate SHY.^157\n\nNotably, the sort of cognitive flexibility and generalization the OBH claims\nis the purpose of dreams is highly important for workers and those in the\narmed forces who sometimes operate under sleep deprivation during critical\nperiods, which can lead to increased accident rates,^158 and has a significant\nmonetary annual impact.^159 If it is true that sleep-deprived brains are\noverfitted, they will be prone to make errors in stereotypical ways. Thus it\nmay be easier to know what types of mistakes will be made by individuals\noperating in sleep-deprived states and in response build more robust fail-\nsafes.\n\nFurthermore, the OBH predicts there may be the possibility of dream\nsubstitutions: dream-like stimuli that are artificially generated to have the\nproperties of dreams, and therefore have a similar ameliorative effect on\noverfitting. Such dream substitutions, delivered via virtual reality (VR) or\neven video, might provide a simple yet effective means for delaying some of\nsleep deprivation's cognitive defects. For example, it may be that a pilot who\nhas been flying for a long period of time is beginning to overfit to their\ntask, and a quick but intense exposure to an entirely different sort of visual\nstimulus (like a dream-like nature scene in VR) could stave off some of the\neffects of sleep deprivation. The impact of substitutions can be examined both\nbehaviorally but also at the neurophysiological level of REM rebound.^160\n\n### Theoretical validation\n\nThe OBH has consequences not just for neuroscience, but also for the field of\ndeep learning. This is particularly true of biologically realistic models,\nlike large-scale thalamocortical spiking-neuron models, which have previously\nbeen used to investigate the development of cortical connectivity and its\neffect on slow waves.^161 It is likely that biologically realistic spiking\nneurons that are still trainable in the manner of DNNs^162 can be used to\nexplore the benefits of dreams directly. In such a cortical model,\nneuromodulation can be used to be intersperse training with periods that mimic\nsleep stages, cycling first through the real input of its training set, and\nthen hallucinatory corrupted input generated from its top-down connections.\nThis should prevent or delay overfitting.\n\nWhat sort of stochastic biases allow for dreams to warp input data in a way\nthat is most efficient for avoiding overfitting? If the OBH is correct, then\nthe sparse and hallucinatory nature of dreams suggests that we should expect\nwarping of input distributions that successfully combats overfitting has these\nqualities. Such distributions should be sparse in that they have less entries\nthan normal inputs, and hallucinatory in that they should be clustered in a\ndifferent way compared to the standard \u201cdaily\u201d input. This can be directly\ntested in state-of-the-art DNNs as well as more biologically realistic\nartificial neural networks. That is, there may be a point of criticality where\ninputs have been altered to be as dream-like as possible and this is the most\neffective means of preventing overfitting in biologically realistic artificial\nneural networks, which can be tested by exploring how differently corrupted\ninputs assist in generalization. In addition, since learning is diurnal in the\nbrain, it may mean that adjusting to mimic realistic patterns of cyclical\ndream-like activity could have the most beneficial effect in machine learning\ngenerally. A final further potential hypothesis is that a reduction to the\nlearning rate (given the neuromodulatory milieu of dreams that likely blocks\nthe formation of strong memories) during dream-like input could be especially\nbeneficial for learning in DNNs.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe OBH posits the evolved purpose of dreams is to assist generalization by\nstochastic corruptions of normal sensory input, which combats the highly\nbiased nature of inputs during an animal's daily learning that can lead to\noverfitting, a ubiquitous problem in artificial neural networks and machine\nlearning in general. It is supported by both empirical evidence (\u201dEvidence\nfrom neuroscience\u201d) and theoretical evidence (\u201dEvidence from deep learning\u201d).\nIn many cases it can explain observed results better than other hypotheses\n(comparative hypotheses are discussed in \u201cContemporary theories of dreams\u201d).\nFor example, it seems the most effective way to trigger dreams about something\nis to have subjects perform on a novel task like Tetris\nrepetitiously,^73^,^130 likely because the visual system has become overfitted\nto the task. In addition, the OBH fits with the fact that \u201creplay\u201d results\nmore often contain never-before-seen patterns of activity than actual replays\nof waking sequences,^69 a fact that, as has been pointed out in the previous\nliterature, indicates that dreaming may play some sort of role in\ngeneralization or gist extraction.^79 In another example, the OBH also\nexplains the fact that synaptic potentiation occurs during sleep,^140\nindicating that learning during dreams themselves leaves behind a synaptic\ntrace.\n\nThe OBH does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses about sleep, for\ninstance, the idea that during certain periods of sleep there is ongoing\nmetabolic waste clearance.^28 In this sense then the OBH speculates that\ndreaming evolved as an exaptation, wherein sleep evolved for molecular\nhousekeeping purposes, and only when brains had to significantly learn during\nthe organism's lifetime did the goal of avoiding overfitting and increasing\ngeneralization become adaptive. The OBH does not even contradict some\nhypotheses about dreams, instead adding new dimensions. Examples of this\ninclude the hypothesis that dreams are a test-bed for strengthening the\nbrain's ability to generate mental imagery during wake, explaining the\ncomplexification of dreams from childhood to adulthood.^120 Another example of\na novel hypothesis that does not stand in opposition to the OBH is that dreams\nare for defending neural real estate^163 (although this may be contradicted by\nnon-wake activation profiles during dreaming). As a hypothesis, it shares\nsimilar background concerns with that of the free energy approach to\ndreaming,^116 although without assuming that dreams are for testing the\npredictions of a generative self-model's priors or that dreams should become\nless surprising over time as input-less prediction error is minimized. There\nalso appears to be possible room for overlap between SHY, the OBH, and the\nreverse learning hypothesis of dreaming (see \u201cDreams are for selective\nforgetting\u201d). Overall the OBH should be viewed as flexible and an umbrella\nhypothesis with many antecedents; after all, it is merely the formal proposal\nthat the corrupted, warped, and stochastic nature of sensory input in dreams\nserves to improve performance on the brain's daily tasks, motivated by the\nphenomenology of dreams and common practices in deep learning.\n\nIt is also worth noting that within the OBH dream's role in improving\ngeneralization may include related things like combating \u201ccatastrophic\nforgetting,\u201d which is a problem faced by DNNs that try to train on multiple\ntasks, and which can also be prevented or alleviated by methods like dropout\nor more complicated techniques like elastic weight consolidation.^164 Recent\nresearch shows that stimuli created from stimulation of a network's top-down\nconnections (which are, according to the OBH, similar to dreams), can indeed\nhelp avoid catastrophic forgetting.^165 So while issues like catastrophic\nforgetting (the complete unlearning of a task while learning another) is not\nwell documented in humans, it may be that individual brain modules or networks\nface some lesser form of it, and dreams can be conceptualized as a form of\nregularization that may ameliorate several aspects of common learning failures\nsimultaneously. For example, beyond the improvements in both in- and out-of-\ndistribution generalization, the stochasticity and spareness evinced in the\nphenomenology of dreams can also likely improve things like security in\nresponse to adversarial attacks and overall computational efficiency, as\nstochastic stimulation has these effects in DNNs.^37 Perhaps the most\ndistinguishing aspect of the OBH is that it takes the phenomenology of dreams\nseriously, in that they are sparse, hallucinogenic, and narrative in the sense\nof containing fabulist and unusual events (and while the relationship between\nphenomenology and neural activity remains unknown, contemporary theories exist\nthat attempt to map the relationship).^166 The OBH emphasizes that it is\nprecisely because of the departure from waking life that dreams evolved.\nAccording to this hypothesis, dreams are not epiphenomena, either in the sense\nof neutral evolution but also in the sense of not being an expression of some\nother background process, such as patterns of activity and associated\nexperiences merely brought about by some other processing integrating new\nmemories.^54 Rather, the point of dreams is the dreams themselves, because\nthey provide departures away from the statistically biased input of an\nanimal's daily life, which can assist and therefore increase performance. It\nmay seem paradoxical, but a dream of flying may actually help you keep your\nbalance running. The evidence for this possibility comes from common methods\nin deep learning that improve generalization, such as dropout,^126 domain\nrandomization,^144 and the use of input data created by stochastic stimulation\nof generative models,^148 which together bear striking similarities to the\nproperties of dreams.\n\nThe OBH makes several predictions that are useful for both the field of\nneuroscience and the field of deep learning. These include predictions on the\nneurophysiological level, as well as behavioral, and even within the field of\ndeep learning. For instance, the prediction that inputs with dream-like\nproperties (i.e., adhering to dream phenomenology) will assist with\noverfitting in DNNs. Behaviorally, overfitting might be induced in subjects\nvia repetitive training on an undersampled task, and the benefit of dreaming\nmight be directly measured. There is also the possibility of dream\nsubstitutions, wherein artificial dream-like stimuli might help improve\ngeneralization and therefore performance in sleep-deprived individuals.\n\nFinally, it is worth taking the idea of dream substitutions seriously enough\nto consider whether fictions, like novels or films, act as artificial dreams,\naccomplishing at least some of the same function. Within evolutionary\npsychology, the attempt to ground aspects of human behavior in evolutionary\ntheory, there has been long-standing confusion with regard to human interest\nin fictions, since on their surface fictions have no utility. They are, after\nall, explicitly false information. Therefore it has been thought that fictions\nare either demonstrations of cognitive fitness in order to influence mate\nchoice,^167 or can simply be reduced to the equivalent of \u201ccheesecake\u201d \u2014\ngratifying to consume but without benefit. Proponents of this view have even\ngone so far as to describe the arts as a \u201cpleasure technology.\u201d^168 Some\nresearchers have proposed benefits to fiction consumption, like improving\ntheory of mind^169 or helping to abstract social norms.^170 The OBH suggests\nfictions, and perhaps the arts in general, may actually have a deeper\nunderlying cognitive utility in the form of improving generalization and\npreventing overfitting by acting as artificial dreams.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to Baran \u00c7imen, Santosh Manicka, and Hananel Hazan as well as to the\nanonymous reviewers, for their comments and feedback.\n\nGo to:\n\n## References\n\n1\\.
