Or, for $100,000, a corporation can participate\nin a research study, with \u201crobust\u201d reviewing powers and access to all\nresulting intellectual property.\n\nThose are the conditions outlined in a boilerplate document that Louisiana\nState University\u2019s fundraising arm circulated to oil majors and chemical\ncompanies affiliated with the Louisiana Chemical Association, an industry\nlobbying group, according to emails disclosed in response to a public records\nrequest by the Lens.\n\nHow to spot five of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s biggest disinformation tactics\n\nRead more\n\nRecords show that after Shell donated $25m in 2022 to LSU to create the\nInstitute for Energy Innovation, the university gave the fossil fuel\ncorporation license to influence research and coursework for the university\u2019s\nnew concentration in carbon capture, use and storage.\n\nAfterward, LSU\u2019s fundraising entity, the LSU Foundation, used this partnership\nas a model to shop around to members of the Louisiana Chemical Association,\nsuch as ExxonMobil, Air Products and CF Industries, which have proposed carbon\ncapture projects in Louisiana.\n\nFor $2m, Exxon became the institute\u2019s first \u201cstrategic partner-level donor\u201d, a\nposition that came with robust review of academic study output and with the\nability to focus research activities. Another eight companies have discussed\nsimilar deals with LSU, according to a partnership update that LSU sent to\nShell last summer.\n\nSome students, academics and experts said such relationships raise questions\nabout academic freedom and public trust.\n\nThe ExxonMobil oil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Photograph: Barry\nLewis/In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nAsked to comment, the Institute for Energy Innovation\u2019s director, Brad Ives,\ndefended the partnerships, as did the oil majors. Two more companies have\nsince entered into partnerships with the Institute for Energy Innovation, said\nIves. But Shell is the only company to have donated at the level that gave the\ncompany a seat on the advisory board that chooses the institute\u2019s research.\nThe head of the Louisiana Chemical Association and the Louisiana Mid-Continent\nOil and Gas Association also sit on the advisory board, which can vote to stop\na research project from moving forward.\n\nIves said being able to work with oil and gas companies is \u201creally a key to\nadvancing energy innovation\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for Shell said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with LSU to contribute\nto the growing compendium of peer-reviewed climate science and advance the\neffort to identify multiple pathways that can lead to more energy with fewer\nemissions.\u201d\n\nAn ExxonMobil spokesperson said: \u201cOur collaboration with LSU and the Institute\nfor Energy Innovation includes an allocation for research in carbon capture\nutilization and storage, as well as advanced recycling studies.\u201d\n\nLSU has long had a close-relationship with oil majors, the names of which hang\nfrom buildings and equipment at the university. Nearly 40% of LSU funding\ncomes from the state, which received a good chunk of its revenue from oil and\ngas activities until the 1980s. In recent years, oil and gas revenue has made\nup less than 10% of the state budget.\n\n> I have a hard time seeing a faculty member engaged in legitimate research\n> being eager for an oil company ... to vote on his or her research agenda\n\nRobert Mann, political commentator and former LSU journalism professor\n\nBut the new, highly visible partnership with Shell took the closeness a step\nfurther, promising corporations voting power over the Institute for Energy\nInnovation\u2019s research activities in return for their investment.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time seeing a faculty member engaged in legitimate research\nbeing eager for an oil company or representative of a chemical company to vote\non his or her research agenda,\u201d said Robert Mann, political commentator and\nformer LSU journalism professor. \u201cThat is an egregious violation of academic\nfreedom.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect to see it written down like that,\u201d Mann said, after the Lens\nasked him to review the boilerplate document that outlines what companies can\nexpect in return for their donations to LSU\u2019s Institute for Energy Innovation.\nIt is not appropriate, Mann said, for faculty research to be driven by the\ndecisions of the dean of a university, let alone an outside industry\nrepresentative. \u201cIf you\u2019re a faculty member in that unit you should know that\nthe university is fine with auctioning off your academic freedom,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nIves of LSU said its Institute for Energy Innovation is no different to\nsimilar institutes across the US, including the Texas Bureau of Economic\nGeology, which performs research supported by corporate donors. \u201cI think\nresearchers saying that somehow having corporate funding for research damages\nthe integrity of that research is a little far-fetched,\u201d Ives said.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest oil companies \u2018way off track\u2019 on emissions goals, report finds\n\nRead more\n\nResearch performed at the institute is subject to the faculty\u2019s individual\nethics training and subject to peer-review, he said. \u201cA donor that provided\nmoney that goes to the institute isn\u2019t going to be able to influence the\noutcome of that research in any way.\u201d\n\nAsked about the relationship with the institute and industry, Karsten\nThompson, the interim dean of the College of Engineering at LSU said: \u201cTo me,\nit\u2019s not a conflict at all. It\u2019s a partnership because they\u2019re the ones that\nare going to make the largest initial impacts on reducing CO_2 emissions.\u201d\n\nSome observers, noting that fossil fuel companies have previously shown a\nvested interest in obscuring scientific conclusions, question the reliability\nof academic studies sponsored by fossil fuel companies. Exxon, for example,\ndenied the risk of human-caused climate change for decades, noted Jane Patton,\nan LSU alumna and the US fossil economy campaign manager for the Center for\nInternational Environmental Law.\n\n> It\u2019s just disheartening to find that the state\u2019s flagship institution is\n> allowing industry to determine the research agenda\n\nJane Patton of the Center for International Environmental Law\n\nAfter the Lens asked her to review LSU communication on the matter, Patton\nsaid she suspected that fossil fuel companies have had a say in what does and\ndoesn\u2019t get studied in relation to risky endeavors, such as carbon capture,\nwhich involves chemically stripping carbon dioxide from industrial emissions\nand piping it underground. For her, the LSU documents basically proved her\nfear. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen actual evidence of it,\u201d Patton said.\n\u201cThis is a gross misuse of the public trust.\u201d\n\nTo Patton, the perceived blurring of academic objectivity could not come at a\nworse time in Louisiana, as the climate crisis makes the state less habitable\nand housing more expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s just disheartening,\u201d she said, \u201cto find that\nthe state\u2019s flagship institution is allowing industry to determine the\nresearch agenda. No wonder it\u2019s so hard to find peer-reviewed research about\nhow bad this is.\u201d\n\nThe Shell oil refinery in Norco, Louisiana.

The LSU alumnus Lee\nStockwell, Shell\u2019s general manager of CCUS, sat on the search committee for\nthe Energy Institute executive director, served on the petroleum engineering\nadvisory board, and was very involved in shaping the carbon capture\ncurriculum.\n\nStockwell directed questions about Shell\u2019s partnership with the university to\nLSU.\n\nStockwell was not the only oil representative to help design the curriculum.\nBP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil also had representatives on the ad\nhoc advisory committee that designed carbon capture coursework within the\npetroleum engineering department, according to a July 2022 email from\nThompson. At least one cohort of students took two elective courses at LSU\ndesigned by the oil majors and another 10 students were expected to take the\nfull concentration beginning in 2022.\n\nLSU is not alone in this practice, Thompson said. At most engineering\ndepartments in the country, an active Industrial Advisory Committee (IAC)\nweighs in on curricula, so that degrees evolve as technology changes, helping\nstudents land internships and jobs.\n\nLSU faculty has not been similarly engaged with renewable energy companies,\nbecause oil and gas companies have the resources to tackle the climate crisis\nnow \u2013 and are not reliant on future technology, Thompson said. \u201cRenewable\nenergy is much more abstract,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I think that\u2019s the difference.\nIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care as much.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Trojan horse of legitimacy\u2019: Shell launches a \u2018climate tech\u2019 startup\nadvertising jobs in oil and gas\n\nRead more\n\nFossil fuel companies have been finding their way into classrooms for decades,\nin part to help the industry retain a positive public image in the face of a\nheating planet.\n\nSome students do not approve of the university\u2019s partnerships with fossil fuel\ncompanies, or any financial ties with them.\n\nFor a decade now, students across the nation have filed complaints and\ndemanded divestment from fossil fuels and hundreds of institutions have\nagreed. Locally, the LSU Climate Pelicans, an interdisciplinary group of\nstudents, have called for the university to divest endowment funds from the\nfossil fuel industry.\n\nInspired by the Climate Pelicans\u2019 work toward divestment, the LSU graduate\nstudent Alicia Cerquone, who sits on the LSU\u2019s student senate, sponsored a\ndivestment resolution. The measure passed in a 37-2 vote last year, according\nto LSU\u2019s student newspaper. Though investment in fossil fuels amounts to only\n2 to 3% of the endowment, it\u2019s an important philosophical step, Cerquone said.\n\nCerquone is also troubled by the influence that industry has on the Institute\nfor Energy Innovation and fears other corporations could control other\ndepartments\u2019 curriculums. \u201cThese entities are going to have a say in what we\npay to learn here,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has made forays into academia beyond Louisiana.\nExxonMobil and Shell have both helped fund a similar Energy Initiative at\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where the highest-level donors\ncan have an office on MIT\u2019s campus, according to Inside Climate News. In 2021,\nExxon funded and co-wrote a research paper with MIT researchers with\nconclusions that supported the argument for federal subsidies for carbon\ncapture and use.\n\n  * This story is co published with the Lens, a non-profit newsroom in New Orleans and part of its Captured Audience series, which is supported by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Oil and gas companies\n  * Big oil uncovered\n  * Louisiana\n  * US universities\n  * US education\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Energy industry\n  * Oil\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
