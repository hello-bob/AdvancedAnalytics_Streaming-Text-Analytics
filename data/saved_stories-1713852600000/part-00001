Various platforms have allowed writers to follow, like and reply to\nposts from one another - making writing on the internet an altogether more\nsocial experience.\n\nThe problem, though, has always been that those networks have been closed,\nproprietary, and limited in their utility and longevity. We've all seen what\nhappens when networks either run out of money, or get commandeered by people\nwith... too much money.\n\nAt Ghost we've been interested in publishing networks for a long time, but as\nyou have come to expect from us after over a decade of releasing open,\ndecentralized technology that puts people first: We're doing things in our own\nway.\n\nBuilding ActivityPub\n\nGhost is federating over ActivityPub to become part of the world\u2019s largest\npublishing network.\n\nBuilding ActivityPub\n\nWe're excited to share that we've started work on bringing ActivityPub support\nto Ghost, making it possible for all Ghost publishers to distribute their work\nacross to the largest decentralized network in the world.\n\nIt's going to take some time for us to ramp up our efforts here, but we're\ngoing to be sharing our build diary and all the details with you as we go.\n\nWe've put together a full overview of what this means for you, and we're\nlooking forward to hearing what you think!\n\n### Get notified when we ship new features.\n\n### You might also like...\n\nMar\n\n20\n\n## TK reminders\n\nA small detail designed to save you from frustrating mistakes, so you can\npublish with confidence.
