Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nUpdated 5:30 a.m. Eastern with new launch date.\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 Controllers scrubbed the first attempt to launch\nBoeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner on a crewed test flight May 6 because of a valve\nproblem with the rocket, delaying the launch by at least four days.\n\nThe launch director for the Atlas 5 rocket called for the scrub a little more\nthan two hours before the scheduled 10:34 p.m. Eastern launch of the Crew\nFlight Test mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe issue was with an oxygen relief valve on the rocket\u2019s Centaur upper stage.\n\u201cThe team is just not comfortable with the signatures that they\u2019re seeing, the\nresponse out of that valve, so out of an abundance of caution, we are not\ngoing to continue with our launch operations today,\u201d said Dillon Rice, ULA\nlaunch commentator, on NASA TV.\n\nAt a press conference a couple hours after the scrub, ULA CEO Tory Bruno said\nthe valve was buzzing at a frequency of about 40 hertz, loud enough for teams\nat the launch pad to hear it. Forcing the valve to close stopped the buzzing,\nbut that process required scrubbing the launch to comply with flight rules to\nprohibit changes to the state of the Centaur while the crew was on board.\n\nThere are backup launch opportunities for the mission currently scheduled for\nMay 7, 10 and 11, but the next launch attempt will depend on whether the valve\nneeds to be replaced.\n\nBruno said that if the vibrations were full motions of the valve, the valve\nwould be approaching its rated life of 200,000 cycles and would need to be\nreplaced. That would require rolling the rocket back to its assembly building\nto replace the valve, a process that likely would push the launch to next\nweek.\n\nEngineers, though, are analyzing data to see if the valve\u2019s buzzing was less\nthan full motion, which would mean it is not yet approaching its rated life.\nThat could have allowed a launch attempt as soon as May 7.\n\n\u201cWe could be ready tomorrow if we find out we have plenty of life\u201d in the\nvalve, he said. A decision on a May 7 launch attempt would have to be made no\nlater than about eight hours before the scheduled 10:11 p.m. Eastern liftoff\ntime.\n\n\u201cIt is likely we would have that recommendation before then,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\ndon\u2019t know that we\u2019re confident with the valve by then, then we\u2019re not going.\u201d\n\nNASA, in a statement early May 7, said that the agency was now projecting a\nlaunch no earlier than May 10, ruling out a May 7 launch, to give teams more\ntime to analyze data about the valve.\n\nThere is flexibility in schedules for ISS operations should there be an\nextended launch delay. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a rush to fly from a station standpoint.\nWe did clear our summer schedule intentionally to give us plenty of runway for\nthis CFT mission,\u201d said Dana Weigel, NASA ISS program manager.\n\nThe scrub was announced shortly after NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni\nWilliams had boarded Starliner. They had reported no issues with the\nspacecraft leading up to the launch scrub. Officials said at the briefing that\npreparations were running well ahead of schedule when the scrub was called.\n\nCFT is the final test of the Starliner spacecraft before NASA certifies the\nspacecraft for International Space Station crew rotation missions. The flight\nwill be ther first to carry astronauts after two uncrewed flights in December\n2019 and May 2022.\n\nThe spacecraft is scheduled to dock with the station a little more than a day\nafter launch. It will remain at the station for about a week before undocking\nand landing at White Sands, New Mexico.\n\nBefore the flight, Wilmore and Williams said they were prepared to take a\nlaunch scrub in stride. When they arrived at the Kennedy Space Center April 25\nfor final preparations, Williams said she had gotten advice from Bob Behnken,\nwho flew on the first Crew Dragon spacecraft to carry astronauts, Demo-2 in\n2020, with Doug Hurley. That mission suffered a weather-related scrub before\nlaunching successfully.\n\n\u201cMay 6 isn\u2019t magical,\u201d Williams said of the scheduled CFT launch. \u201cHe said,\n\u2018If you get a scrub it is actually a little bit nice because it sort of takes\nthe pressure off a little bit.\u2019\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n#### Starliner mission to be first crewed Atlas 5 flight\n\nThe upcoming launch of Boeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner will mark not just the first\ntime the spacecraft has carried astronauts but also the first crewed launch of\nthe Atlas 5, a vehicle approaching its retirement.\n\n#### Starliner arrives at the pad for crewed test flight\n\nBoeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner is now installed on the Atlas 5 rocket that will\nlaunch the spacecraft on a crewed test flight to the International Space\nStation next month.\n\n#### Starliner crewed test flight passes key review\n\nThe first crewed flight of Boeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft is a step\ncloser to launch after completing a major pre-launch review April 25.\n\nTagged: Atlas 5, Commercial Crew, CST-100, NASA, ULA\n\n## Jeff Foust\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.
