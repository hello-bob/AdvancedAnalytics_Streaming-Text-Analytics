It is a key nesting area for\nseabirds and feeding area for marine mammals.\n\nThe Coast Guard will send its destroyer, the USS James, to work with Argentine\nvessels to curb these fishing practices.\n\nAccording to data from the NGO Global Fishing Watch, nearly 3,000 deepwater\nfishing boats operate under the Chinese flag globally, including about 400 in\nthe southwest Atlantic, often targeting Argentine squid and Patagonian\ntoothfish. The NGO says Chinese vessel activity in the southwest Atlantic\nincreased from 61,727 hours per 500 square kilometers in 2013 to 384,046 hours\nin 2023.\n\nSince 1986, Argentine authorities have seized 80 foreign-flagged boats fishing\nin their waters, including sinking Chinese and Taiwanese ships.\n\nThe upcoming joint U.S.-Argentina cruise to combat illegal, unreported and\nunregulated or IUU fishing, mainly by Chinese fishing vessels, is part of a\nglobal and ongoing effort to strengthen maritime security partnerships. In\n2020, the United States launched a new strategy to combat IUU fishing, and the\nCoast Guard is spearheading that effort. In South America, it has already\nstepped-up cooperation with Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.\n\nAnalysts say the Coast Guard\u2019s cooperation with Argentina \u2014 together with\nrecent visits from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Central Intelligence\nAgency Director William Burns \u2014 reflect a shift by Argentine President Javier\nMilei\u2019s new government, elected in November, away from China and toward the\nUnited States.\n\n\u201cThe producing provinces of Patagonia have warned about the serious situation\nof illegal fishing and President Milei has a very clear position in relation\nto China,\u201d Gabriela Ippolito O\u2019Donnell, a political science professor at the\nNational University of San Mart\u00edn in Argentina, told VOA Mandarin.\n\n\u201cPresident Milei is undoubtedly in tune with the USA, even more so if Donald\nTrump wins the elections. He has already shown signs of a 180-degree turn in\nforeign policy in all its aspects, including the military.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell said the decision to push back on Chinese illegal fishing practices\nwas more than a symbolic move.\n\n\u201cThere is an epochal change in Argentina's foreign relations,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\u201cOf course, the Argentine military and the political opposition will have a\nvoice in this process of military rapprochement with the U.S. But the\ninitiative today belongs to President Milei.\u201d\n\nIn January, Milei authorized the U.S. military to enter Argentine territory \u2014\na stark contrast from three years ago, when U.S. patrols in the South Atlantic\nled to conflict with Argentina\u2019s then-President Alberto Fernandez.\n\nAccording to Michael Paarlberg, an assistant professor of political science at\nVirginia Commonwealth University, the decision is a deliberate way for Milei\nto break from his rivals, his direct predecessor Fernandez and former\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who reached several military\ncooperation agreements with China.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a growing closer relationship between the U.S. and Argentina\nunder the new Milei government, closer than it was under the more\nU.S.-skeptical Fernandez government,\u201d Paarlberg told VOA Mandarin. \u201cMilitary\ncooperation with the U.S. is a way for Milei to fulfill his promise to undo\nall of the policies of his predecessors.\u201d\n\nAnalysts, however, say Milei\u2019s actions do not represent a complete break\nbetween China and Argentina, but rather an interest in diversifying\nArgentina\u2019s international relationships, with fishing in Argentina\u2019s\nterritorial waters providing the country with a bargaining chip. China remains\nArgentina\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\n\u201cIt is too soon to talk about a major overhaul of Argentina's foreign policy\nunder Javier Milei, particularly regarding its ties with the United States and\nChina,\u201d Fabricio Fonseca, an assistant professor of diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s\nNational Chengchi University, told VOA Mandarin. \u201cThere are other geoeconomic\ntrends and events that we need to take into consideration before forecasting a\npermanent change in Buenos Aires\u2019s relations with Beijing.\u201d\n\nEvie Steele contributed to this story.\n\n## Related\n\n  * #### Success and Setbacks: 100 Days of Argentina's Milei\n\n## More US Stories\n\n  * #### Biden calls on Putin to release journalists Gershkovich, Kurmasheva jailed in Russia\n\n  * #### US House, Senate agree on bill to boost safety of air travel\n\n  * #### Banker in key transaction testifying Tuesday at Trump trial\n\n  * #### Oklahoma towns hit by tornadoes begin cleanup after 4 killed in weekend storms\n\n  * #### Blinken: Hamas should accept \u2018extraordinarily generous\u2019 Israeli truce offer\n\n  * #### All About America\n\n## The Day in Photos\n\n  * #### April 29, 2024\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Follow Us\n\n  * United States\n\n    * US News\n    * Immigration\n    * All About America\n    * Silicon Valley & Technology\n\n  * World\n\n    * Africa\n    * The Americas\n    * East Asia Pacific\n    * Europe\n    * Middle East\n    * South & Central Asia\n\n  * Sections\n\n    * VOA Programs\n    * Special projects\n    * Day in Photos\n    * Press Freedom\n    * Refugees\n    * VOA News on Iran\n    * VOA News on China\n    * Arts & Culture\n    * Economy & Business\n    * Health\n    * Extremism Watch\n    * Student Union\n    * VOA Connect\n    * 52 Documentary\n    * Videos\n\n  * More From VOA\n\n    * VOAAfrica.com Programs\n    * VOA Learning English\n    * Polygraph.info\n    * Editorials\n    * Satellite schedule\n\n  * About this site\n\n    * Terms of Use & Privacy Notice\n    * About VOA\n    * Get VOA+\n    * VOA Around the World\n    * Contact VOA\n    * Media Relations\n    * Usage Requests\n    * VOA Pronunciation Guide\n\nXS\n\nSM\n\nMD\n\nLG\n\n", "frontpage": true}
