Photo:\nCSIRO/\n\nOne of the few pieces of MH370 to be discovered was from an engine cowling\nthat came ashore at Mossel Bay in South Africa, covered in barnacles. Photo:\nCSIRO/\n\nFor the first year and a half after it vanished on March 8, 2014, Malaysia\nAirlines Flight 370 represented an unprecedented kind of aviation mystery, one\nwhose only clues were a set of cryptic electronic signals suggesting the plane\nhad crashed in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. Sixteen months later, in\nJuly 2015, a piece of its right wing called a flaperon washed ashore on the\nFrench island of R\u00e9union, on the other side of the ocean. Here at last was\nphysical evidence that the plane and its 239 souls really had flown into the\nremote southern patch of ocean and crashed.\n\nBetter still, the flaperon carried with it evidence that may help locate the\nplane and solve the mystery once and for all: a population of gooseneck\nbarnacles called Lepas anatifera. Like the rings of a tree, their shells\ncontain a record of their life. Decode that information and it may be possible\nto trace their path on the flaperon backward to the impact site and the\nmystery would be solved. \u201cWe stumbled upon something that gave much more\ncertainty about the whereabouts of the plane than we anticipated,\u201d says David\nGriffin, who led a team of Australian government scientists tasked with\nsolving the case.\n\nThe flaperon and its Lepas spurred a decade of fruitful worldwide research\ninto a previously obscure organism and unlocked the creature\u2019s potential to\nserve as a natural data logger in all kinds of investigations, from tracking\n\u201cghost nets\u201d that endanger wildlife to finding missing boats and even\ninvestigating mysterious deaths. But as marine biologists applied their new\nknowledge to the case of the missing plane, they found that instead of\nresolving mysteries, the barnacles revealed new ones.\n\nAs someone who has been publicly obsessed with MH370 for a decade, I have\nspent a long time exploring the fine points of Lepas biology, most recently on\nmy podcast. These are fascinating creatures. In their larval stage, they swim\nfree as plankton throughout the world\u2019s oceans. Then once they\u2019re ready for\nadulthood, they start looking for a floating object to attach themselves to.\nHaving found one, they explore it, looking for an ideal spot \u2014 they prefer a\ndeep, shady location far from the waterline \u2014 and glue their heads in place,\nusing fine, sievelike appendages to sweep food particles from the water.\nBecause they evolved to settle on biodegradable material such as logs and\nclumps of seaweed, they grow quickly and can reach maturity in a matter of\nweeks. On man-made objects that don\u2019t decay, Lepas can grow for years, forming\ndense mats of long-stalked barnacles that look like medusa\u2019s writhing hairdo\nof snakes.\n\nSince Lepas tends to colonize any floating object, scientists say the oldest\nbarnacles on it will reflect the total amount of time that object has spent in\nthe ocean, often within the first weeks of its entering the water. \u201cAssuming\nthey have enough food and the temperature is good, barnacles will follow a\nsteady growth progression,\u201d says Cynthia Venn, a professor of environmental\nscience at Bloomsburg University who studied Lepas barnacles growing on buoys\nin the Pacific Ocean.\n\nScott Bryan, a researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Australia,\nhas studied how Lepas and other marine organisms settle on pieces of pumice\nthat have been ejected into the ocean by volcanic explosions. Because the\npumice starts out molten hot, and hence sterile, it offers a blank slate of\nsorts for biologists to study how the populations of organisms on floating\ndebris change over time. \u201cWe find biological recruitment to be very quick,\nbeginning within about two weeks,\u201d Bryan told me. \u201cGoose barnacles are one of\nthe first colonizers.\u201d\n\nWhen French authorities recovered the first piece of MH370 from the island of\nR\u00e9union, they found it covered with a lush population of gooseneck barnacles \u2014\nanimals whose shells would turn out to provide a rich source of information\nabout where the object had drifted from. Photo: Imago/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nOnce they settle, these populations are pretty robust. Although they do have\npredators on the open sea, such as sea turtles and nudibranchs, a kind of\nmarine invertebrate, researchers say the barnacles generally get completely\nwiped out only if their host is washed ashore, where they will dry out and be\npicked clean by scavengers. \u201cIf there is nothing older than two months growing\non it, we would interpret this to mean the pumice had not been floating in the\nocean for more than three months,\u201d Bryan says, allowing a margin of a few\nweeks for the organisms to become attached.\n\nScientists can tell the oldest and newest barnacles apart by measuring their\nsize, which correlates with the length of time the animal has been growing on\nan object. This can be combined with \u201cdrift modeling,\u201d which uses historical\ndata about the drift paths of research buoys to create probabilistic estimates\nof a floating object\u2019s origins. Martin Stelfox, founder of the Olive Ridley\nProject, a sea-turtle conservation program, has used Lepas barnacles to figure\nout where wildlife-ensnaring fishing gear has drifted from. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly\nreliable way to give you an idea of how long that gear has been drifting,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cWe can then use that age estimate to plug into things like drifting\ncurrent models and start to backtrack to where potentially this gear may have\ncome from.\u201d\n\nWhat researchers didn\u2019t know back in 2015 was what a six-, 12-, or 18-month-\nold barnacle in the subtropical Indian Ocean would look like. In the years\nfollowing the flaperon\u2019s discovery, researchers tried growing barnacles in the\nlab and on buoys at sea and found that Lepas grows at different rates and\nwinds up at different sizes depending on the temperature of the water and how\nmuch there is to eat. One team that looked at how Lepas grew in the cold\nwaters of the Humboldt Current off the coast of Chile found that, after three\nmonths, the Lepas had stopped growing, at about 20 millimeters in length.\nAnother studied a related species growing in the warmer waters of southeastern\nAustralia and found they had gotten as large as 48 millimeters in as little as\na month.\n\nConditions in the waters where the flaperon floated seem to lie somewhere in\nbetween. In 2020, Stelfox and his colleagues published the results of an\nexperiment in which they had grown Lepas on buoys in the Maldives. They found\nthat after 105 days of growth, or three and a half months, the largest of the\nshells was 35 millimeters \u2014 very close to the size of the biggest barnacle on\nthe flaperon. The waters the buoys floated in are similar to those the\nflaperon would have crossed in reaching R\u00e9union: the South Equatorial Current,\nthe dominant east-to-west current spanning the latitude between northern\nAustralia and Madagascar. So the growth patterns should be similar. Stelfox\nfeels that when he stopped his experiment, the barnacles were continuing to\ngrow and could have gotten as big as 50 millimeters if he had let them. \u201cOn\npersonal observations, some of the barnacles we\u2019ve seen in the Maldives were\nmuch bigger than the ones in our experiment,\u201d he says.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the size of the shell that tells a story but also its chemical\ncomposition, which varies depending on the temperature of the water the Lepas\nis floating in when it lays down a given layer. This technique has been\napplied to the flaperon\u2019s barnacles several times over the past decade. In the\nmost recent study, published last year, a team led by Kuwait University\nresearcher Nasser Al-Qattan analyzed a barnacle shell provided by the French\nauthorities. The shell was relatively small, about 25 millimeters, which meant\nit was \u201conly several months in age,\u201d according to the study. Its chemistry\nindicated the creature had started growing in relatively warm water of 80\ndegrees before drifting into cooler water of around 75 degrees. \u201cIts recorded\ndrift reveals that the MH370 flaperon likely spent its last several months\nwest of longitude 70\u00b0E and within 1,500 km of R\u00e9union Island,\u201d the researchers\nconcluded. That\u2019s over 1,000 miles from the MH370 search zone.\n\nIn other words, the specimen shared by the French was too young for Al-\nQattan\u2019s team to trace the flaperon\u2019s path all the way back to the plane\u2019s\npresumed impact site west of Perth, Australia. The French authorities had\nrecovered larger specimens from the flaperon, the largest being 36\nmillimeters, but they hadn\u2019t seen fit to share them with outside researchers.\n\u201cOnly partial drift reconstructions are possible until the largest, oldest\nbarnacles are released for study by the French government,\u201d Al-Qattan\u2019s team\nnoted.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to doubt that even a 36-millimeter barnacle would be old\nenough to track the flaperon back to the presumed impact site. Stelfox grew\n35-millimeter barnacles in a similar patch of ocean in just 105 days. If one\nassumes the flaperon\u2019s barnacles grew at an approximately similar rate, then\nthe size of the flaperon\u2019s barnacles suggest that it floated in the Indian\nOcean for no more than about four months, not the 16 months that elapsed\nbetween the crash and the flaperon\u2019s discovery.\n\nThat gap in the data \u2014 a yearlong interval between the plane crash and the\nstart of barnacle growth \u2014 might be merely puzzling were it observed on the\nflaperon alone. But the entirety of the MH370 debris recovered so far displays\nthis anomaly. Of the three dozen or so pieces of the plane that have been\ncollected, not a single one has marine life on it that matches what you would\nexpect to see if, as with the pumice Bryan studies, the debris had spent 16\nmonths steadily gathering marine life from the waters it had traveled through.\n\nOne piece, a fragment of a closet door from inside the cabin, was found\n\u201cheavily colonised by the Lepas anatifera barnacle,\u201d according to an official\nreport, but of the nearly 400 specimens recovered, the largest were just 20\nmillimeters long, implying an age of only \u201c45 to 50 days.\u201d\n\nAnother piece came ashore at Mossel Bay in South Africa and was photographed\nby a passerby who let the object wash back out to sea; it was rediscovered\nthree months later just a few hundred yards away, having been stripped clean\nin the meantime. Based on my own image analysis of the original photograph,\nthe largest barnacle appears to be about 25 millimeters, implying a time\nadrift of no more than several months.\n\nThere are other mysteries surrounding the debris as well. When French\nscientists took the flaperon from R\u00e9union to a test facility in Toulouse, they\nput it in a tank to see how it floated. They found the slab-shaped flaperon\nfloated at an angle, with one of its long edges sticking up high out of the\nwater, where it\u2019s physically impossible for Lepas to grow. Yet this edge was\nthickly settled with a healthy Lepas population. The apparent contradiction\nbaffled the first French scientist who studied it and remains unexplained to\nthis day. The edge had to be underwater, says Williams College invertebrate\nbiologist Jim Carlton, \u201cbecause it has Lepas on it. Lepas don\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nAnother problem was that Australian investigators couldn\u2019t get their drift\nmodeling to work. The piece that washed up in Mossel Bay was hundreds of miles\nfarther south than the models predicted it could have reached in its time\nafloat. That\u2019s \u201csomething that is simply too hard for any present-day model to\nconvincingly explain,\u201d David Griffin, the principal research scientist at the\nAustralian government\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganisation, told an interviewer in 2017 and confirmed to me this week.\n\nThe CSIRO worked hard to understand how the flaperon could have drifted to\nR\u00e9union, believing that if their drift model were precise enough, it would\nhelp them identify exactly where the plane had crashed. After multiple\nattempts to refine their data by studying how replicas floated in the ocean\nunder various wind and wave conditions, they could get it to match the\nflaperon\u2019s landfall on R\u00e9union after 16 months only if it had floated high\nenough in the water to be pushed by the wind. But this would have left the\nLepas on the trailing edge high and dry, which experts say is impossible.\n\nHoping to better understand how the flaperon might have drifted from the crash\nsite to La R\u00e9union, Australian investigators put replicas in the ocean to test\nhow they would be affected by wind and waves. What they could not explain was\nhow a piece with an edge that floated consistently high out of the water could\nhave underwater creatures like Lepas growing on it.

No one has yet come up with a reasonable explanation,\nfor instance, as to how or why the satellite communications system that\ngenerated the pings officials used to define the search area in the remote\nsouthern Indian Ocean turned off. Two companies spent four years searching\n93,000 square miles of seabed using towed sonar arrays and a fleet of\nunderwater drones. Australian search officials admit they can\u2019t explain why\nthey came up empty, having stated that upon completion of the yearslong seabed\nsearch, \u201cprospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all\nthe analysis to date, would be exhausted.\u201d\n\nTaken together, this swarm of paradoxes surrounding both the satellite data\nand the debris suggests that the authorities\u2019 understanding of the case is\nbadly flawed and that, if they have a sincere interest in solving it, they\nneed to revisit their assumptions about what could have happened on that night\nten years ago. \u201cAfter a failed search, you have to recalibrate,\u201d says Todd\nHumphreys, a professor of aeronautical engineering at the University of Texas\nat Austin. \u201cSometimes you preclude the possibility of even looking for\nevidence because you have very strong priors against it. I think by this\npoint, we\u2019ve been pushed into a corner where we do need to revisit those\npriors.\u201d\n\n### Sign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter\n\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to\nreceive email correspondence from us.\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * newsletter pick\n  * mh370\n  * unnatural disasters\n  * aviation\n  * audio article\n\nShow 30 Comments / 30 New Leave a Comment\n\nThe Sea Creatures That Opened a New Mystery About MH370\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n  1.
