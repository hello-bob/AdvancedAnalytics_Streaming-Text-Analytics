In the last few quarters, the rate of spending has begun accelerating\nagain, thanks in large part to the exorbitant costs of hosting AI training and\ninference workloads in the cloud.\n\nWhile the improved growth rates are welcomed by the cloud builders, John\nDinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, which keeps a close eye on\ncloud spending and hyperscale datacenter buildouts around the world, says that\nthe market will not return to the higher rates seen before 2022. The\ncoronavirus pandemic was driving cloud adoption like crazy between 2020 and\n2022, and not only that, the cloud market had not yet been affected by the\nlimit of large numbers that ultimately slows growth in all markets.\n\nAs we are fond of pointing out, the cloud market is going to outgrow global\ngross domestic product for as far out as we can see, and both cloud market\nrevenues and the capacity of hyperscale datacenters in the aggregate are\nexpected to double in the next four years. The annualized run rate for global\ncloud services \u2013 including IaaS, PaaS, and hosted private cloud capacity \u2013 was\nmore than $300 billion and growing at 21 percent in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nTo be more precise, in Q1 2024, Synergy Research estimates that cloud services\ngenerated $76.5 billion in revenues, with trailing twelve month revenues at\n$283 billion. That it can hit $600 billion in a mere four years seems\nfantastical, but that is the forecast that Dinsdale is making for 2028.\n\nInterestingly, AWS accounts for 31 percent market share of revenues \u2013 down a\nfew points from its historical average. Microsoft Azure is closing the gap\nwith AWS with a 25 percent share. Google is number three at 11 percent share.\nMicrosoft and Google are outgrowing AWS, as has been the case for some time\nnow. And with the GenAI boom well under way, it is not unreasonable to\ncontemplate when Microsoft will be as big of a cloud player as AWS \u2013 and as we\nhave already shown in our analysis, Microsoft is a bigger core platform\nprovider than AWS and likely will always be unless AWS buys IBM. (Which is a\nfunny thought.)\n\nSo that\u2019s the money. Let\u2019s talk about the datacenters for a minute before we\ndive into the financial results of AWS, Microsoft, and Google. (Yes, we know\nthe company is called Alphabet, but Google is the only part we really care\nabout here at The Next Platform.)\n\nAs 2023 was coming to a close, Dinsdale says that there were a total of 992\nhyperscale datacenters in the world, which is 4X the number that were in\nexistence four years ago. In Q1 2024, the number of these massive datacenters\n(which hold tens of thousands and sometimes 100,000 servers), passed through\n1,000 worldwide.\n\nGoing forward, Dinsdale expects for somewhere between 120 and 130 additional\nhyperscale datacenters to be built, and as you might be surmising, GenAI is\nthe core driver in this new capacity. And thus, in the next four years,\nbecause the power and compute density of machinery is rising faster than the\ndatacenter count, the aggregate gigawatts of power used by hyperscale\ndatacenters will double even though the datacenter count will only increase by\nabout 50 percent to 1,500 worldwide.\n\nAs you might imagine, Dinsdale can\u2019t give away too much data \u2013 this is how\nSynergy Research makes a living, after all \u2013 but he was helpful when we asked\nabout how the aggregate power load has changed in the past four years and how\nit will look four years from now.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that hyperscale datacenters typically range from around 6 MW\nat the bottom end up to around 70 MW at the top end in terms of critical IT\nload capacity,\u201d Dinsdale tells The Next Platform. \u201cThen, of course, a campus\nmay have multiple datacenters on it, so campus capacity can go way higher than\nthose numbers. If you were to assume that across those thousand datacenters\nthe average size was somewhere in the 20 MW to 30 MW range, then that might be\na reasonable guess on your part. While there are hundreds or really big\nhyperscale datacenters, there are also hundreds of smaller local facilities in\nthe mix that are still big enough to be considered hyperscale.\u201d\n\nSo 25 GW to 30 GW of total critical IT load capacity for the hyperscale\ndatacenters, and rising to maybe 50 GW to 60 GW four years from now and\nprobably only 10 GW to 12 GW four years ago. Thanks, John. Appreciate it.\n\nThis bit of data analysis from last July from Synergy Research puts the\nhyperscalers and clouds in perspective with the rest of the world:\n\nBack in 2017, the hyperscalers (which includes what we here at The Next\nPlatform call the big cloud builders in the way that Synergy Research uses the\nword) accounted for 20 percent of the critical IT load, expressed in MW, in\nall of the datacenters in the world. There was a pretty even split between\nhyperscale datacenters owned by their companies and those that are leased from\nthird parties. On premises enterprise datacenters comprised just under 60\npercent of the critical IT load. The remaining slightly more than 20 percent\nwas for co-location facilities in use by enterprises. So enterprises were 80\npercent of the critical IT load and hyperscalers and cloud builders were 20\npercent.\n\nBy 2022, the hyperscale datacenters were approaching 40 percent of the\naggregate datacenter power, with on premises enterprise datacenters having 40\npercent of the capacity and co-location facilities used by enterprises making\nup the remaining more than 20 percent.\n\nFast forward to the 2027 forecast from Synergy Research, and on premises\nenterprises will comprise a little more than a quarter of the overall power,\nco-location datacenters will have a little less than a quarter of the total,\nand hyperscalers will have slightly more than half of the total.\n\nThe datacenter world will have turned on its head \u2013 and not because companies\ndon\u2019t have datacenters, but because the hyperscalers are going to do the\nmassive GenAI buildout that will be too expensive and disruptive for most\nenterprises to tackle.\n\nThat is our interpretation of the data, not that of Dinsdale and his team, and\nwe are not so sure this is how it will play out. We see enterprises building a\nlot of smaller GenAI systems and using open source software and pretrained\nmodels that they augment with their own data and that they will want to have\nresiding next to their production systems so they can hook directly into their\napplications. Big companies are control freaks about their data, and it is\nalways wise to remember this. Small companies can rarely afford to be, and\nthis is how the world will split.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s take a look at the latest financials of the\nplatform businesses of AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We like to try to figure\nout how large the core systems businesses are at the big clouds as well as the\nmajor public OEMs of the world so we can reckon the size and shape of the\noverall systems. This is different from \u2013 and complimentary to \u2013 just counting\nrevenues at AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud or the big OEMs.\n\nIn the quarter ended in March, AWS revenues rose by 17.2 percent to just a tad\nover $25 billion, beating its own forecasts (which is not hard) as well as\nthose of Wall Street (which is always more ambitious than company forecasts\nbecause every company under-promises and over-delivers). More importantly, and\nthanks in large part to the GenAI boom, operating income at AWS rose by 83.9\npercent to $9.42 billion, setting a record high profit as share of revenue of\n37.6 percent.\n\nNow, we know what you are thinking. The rest of Amazon is still not very\nprofitable. Incorrect! Amazon proper is making money from its online store,\nits burgeoning advertising business, and its media empire. In the March\nquarter, the non-AWS parts of Amazon grew by 11.6 percent to $118.28 billion,\nup 11.6 percent, and it had an operating income of $5.89 billion, or 5 percent\nof revenue, compared to an operating loss of $349 million in the year ago\nperiod. The Amazon parts are getting more profitable as the quarters go by,\nand we think this is all due to the steady hand on the tiller by Andy Jassy,\nthe chief executive officer who used to run AWS and who replaced a distracted\nJeff Bezos in that CEO role.\n\nIf you peel the compute, storage, and networking parts of AWS away from\ndatabases and applications sold as a service, you can get a sense of the size\nof the \u201creal\u201d systems business at AWS. In our model, we reckon that this\nunderlying systems business at AWS brought in $12.77 billion in Q1 2024, up 15\npercent, and that its operating income hit $4.08 billion, up 80.4 percent and\ncomprising 32 percent of revenues. The AI tools like SageMaker and Bedrock\nare, in our thinking, applications, not middleware. Draw your lines where you\nwill.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Microsoft, which posted $61.86 billion in revenues, $27.58\nbillion in operating income, and $21.94 billion in operating income in the\nMarch quarter, which was the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 year.\n\nThe chart above shows the revenue streams from its three groups. The most\ninteresting one for us is the Intelligent Cloud group, which includes Windows\nServer, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and other middleware and tools sold into\nthe datacenter, including compute, storage, and networking capacity on the\nAzure cloud and related platforms and SaaS services Microsoft peddles into the\ndatacenter.\n\nIn fiscal Q3, Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud revenues were $26.71 billion, up\n21 percent, and its operating income was $12.51 billion, up 32 percent and\npresenting 46.9 percent of revenues. (We are allocating operating income\nproportional to revenue in our model because we have no better method at the\nmoment.) If we extract out development tools, databases, and other stuff that\nis not part of a base system, we can approximate Microsoft\u2019s \u201creal\u201d systems\nbusiness, which includes sales of the Windows Server stack for on-premises IT\nand as well as raw infrastructure \u2013 compute, storage, and networking \u2013 on the\nAzure cloud.\n\nOur best guess is that this \u201creal\u201d systems business at Microsoft drove $19.39\nbillion in sales in the March quarter, up 31.4 percent, and its operating\nincome was $9.08 billion, up 43.4 percent and representing 46.9 billion.\n\nThis profitability is remarkable given the investments that Microsoft is\nmaking for AI infrastructure, but it is also possible given the massive\ninstalled base of Windows Server licenses and support sold into enterprises\naround the world, who have not only been underwriting Microsoft\u2019s cloud\ninvestments for the past decade, but who are also its most natural customers\nfor cloud services.\n\nOne note: This systems revenue shown above is not to be confused with a\ncategory that Microsoft calls Microsoft Cloud, which is any and all services\nit sells from the cloud, for clients as well as servers. This category has a\nvery large SaaS component, obviously, including Office 365, Active Directory,\nand all kinds of enterprise applications sold as a service.\n\nThat leaves Google Cloud, which, like its larger AWS and Microsoft Azure\nrivals, has a mix of infrastructure, platform, and software services that it\nsells, but it is so small, relatively speaking, that we have not yet attempted\nto break its \u201creal\u201d systems revenues separate from higher level database and\napplication services.\n\nIn the first quarter, Google had sales of $80.54 billion, up 17.1 percent,\noperating income of $25.47 billion, representing 31.6 percent of revenues and\nup 46.3 percent. Net income was up 57.2 percent to $23.66 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud had sales of $9.57 billion, up 28.4 percent, representing 11.9\npercent of sales. The advertising and search business drove 87.4 percent of\nsales in the quarter and is generally somewhere around 89 percent of the total\nin recent years.\n\nThe interesting bit for Google cloud is that a shift in bookkeeping that\ndepreciates servers, storage, and switching over longer terms has made the\ncloud business profitable. Google may be the third largest cloud provider in\nthe world, but it is far from being the most profitable, and even when it is\nlarger, it is hard to see how it will be more profitable than Microsoft or\neven as profitable as AWS.\n\nBut only a fool counts Google out over the long run, and in the longest of\nruns, it may turn out that across North America and Europe, if not the whole\nworld, Microsoft, AWS, and Google all end up with around a quarter of the\ncloud market each and the remaining quarter comprised of sovereign and\nspecialist clouds (like those focused only on HPC and AI with accelerators).\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.

Carl Schumacher says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 7:41 pm\n\n\u201cSo 25 GW to 30 GW of total critical IT load capacity for the hyperscale\ndatacenters, and rising to maybe 50 GW to 60 GW four years from now and\nprobably only 10 GW to 12 GW four years ago. Thanks, John. Appreciate it.\u201d\n\nHmmm so if the US is ~50% of hyperscale/Cloud data centers (30 GM -> 60 GW in\n4 years / 2 = 15+ GW additional required just in the US (take that math with a\nlarge grain of salt))...Where is this extra datacenter power going to come\nfrom? Not that anyone is going build out any of this server capacity on the\nnew(ish)2me sandbar home sticking out into the Atlantic (Cape Cod). But I note\nthe ongoing modest pace of getting our 800 MW wind farm online (Vineyard Wind\nI), that as far as I know BestBuy doesn\u2019t sell SMRs yet, and West Virginia is\nslowing down the deco of fossil fuel plants to keep that power flowing to the\nDataCenter Capital of the world...\n\nOh and we want to covert ground transportation to all electric, convert\nheating to heat pumps and decarbon the grid...It would seem that a SpaceBalls-\nesq (\u201cThey went plaid!\u201d) increased speed datacenter build out would have some\ncompetition for that additional power needed over the next 4 years.\n\n...Just my 2 cents.\n\nReply\n\n     * Timothy Prickett Morgan says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 9:11 pm\n\nYeah, I guess we will have to all stick with internal combustion engines so we\ncan replace our functions with AI? I agree the numbers are large, and the grid\ncan\u2019t handle its job today much less this massive datacenter buildout and EVs\ntoo. Mr Fusion?
