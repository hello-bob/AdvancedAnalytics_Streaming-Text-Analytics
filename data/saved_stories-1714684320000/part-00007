If you\ncan pick only one, use forum software rather than synchronous chat software\nfor community building around a developer platform.\n\nWhile there are tradeoffs in terms of convenience and closeness, for most\ndeveloper communities a public, managed forum is better than a private,\nunsearchable Slack.\n\nThere are a few key differences between forum software (which includes\npackages like nodebb, forem, discourse, and others) and chat software (like\nSlack, Facebook groups, or Discord).\n\nFirst, though, it\u2019s important to know what you are trying to accomplish. If\nyou are trying to get immediate feedback from a small set of users, then\nsynchronous solutions are better. You can be super responsive, your users will\nfeel loved, and you\u2019ll get feedback quickly. However, synchronous solutions go\nbeyond chat and include phone and video calls. The general goal of validating\nuser feedback at an early stage is beyond the scope of this post.\n\nBut as you scale with a chat solution, major problems for the longevity and\nvalue of the community emerge.\n\nProblem #1: the memory hole\n\nThis occurs when there\u2019s a great answer to a common question, but it isn\u2019t\navailable or is hard to find. This matters more for community Slacks than\nother synchronous solutions, since Slack limits free plans to 10,000 messages.\n\nIt still exists for solutions such as discord because older messages scroll\nup. Search isn\u2019t great. As a participant it feels easier to just re-ask the\nquestion. If the community is vibrant and willing to help newcomers, such\nquestions get answered. If not, they languish or are ignored, frustrating the\nnew participants. Not good.\n\nYou can work around the memory hole as a community member by extracting and\nreifying interesting chat posts. I have done this by generalizing and\npublishing the messages as blog posts, to a newsletter, or even to a google\nsheet. But this is additional work that may not be done regularly, or at all.\n\nSide note: for some communities, discussing current events or just chatting\nwith friends, this is actually a feature, not a bug. Who needs to remember who\nsaid what six months ago when conversing with friends.\n\nBut for developer communities, friendly chat is important, but so is sharing\nknowledge; the memory hole actively thwarts the latter.\n\nForums, on the other hand, are optimized for reading. nodebb even suggests\nrelated posts as you begin a topic, actively directing people to older posts\nthat may solve their issue without them ever posting.\n\nAnd if published on the internet, forums are searched via Google.\n\nProblem #2: Google can\u2019t see inside chats\n\nGoogle is the primary user interface for knowledge gathering among developers.\n\nI hope this statement isn\u2019t controversial. It is based on personal experience\nand observation, but there\u2019s also some research.\n\nI have seen many many developers use Google as soon as they are confronted by\na problem. Youtube, books, going to a specific site and using that search:\nthese all are far less used alternatives when a developer has a question.\n\nGoogle has made it so easy to find so much good information that most\ndevelopers have been trained when they face a problem to open a new tab, type\nin the search term and trust the first page of results.\n\nChat systems don\u2019t work well with this common workflow, because all the\ncontent is hidden.\n\nThis means when you use a chat for a developer community, you don\u2019t get\ncompounding benefits when someone, either a team member or a community member,\nanswers a question well or has an insightful comment that would be worth\nreading. Very few folks ever benefit in the future.\n\nWith chat, people who aren\u2019t present at message posting or soon thereafter\nnever learn from that knowledge.\n\nProblem #3: synchronous communication is synchronous\n\nWhen you are in a chat system, the information is ephemeral. This means that\nvaluable comments can be lost if there is a flurry of other messages.\n\nPeople can feel ignored even though the reality is that they just posted at an\ninopportune moment. This feeling can be intimidating; I\u2019ve definitely felt\nmiffed as a question or comment I posted was ignored or unseen and other\npeople\u2019s questions were answered. \u201cWas it me? My topic? Are other people more\nwelcome here than I am?\u201d\n\nPeople who like to answer questions may feel the need to do so quickly. This\nmay interfere with time for deep work. The Pavlovian response is real; I\u2019ve\nfelt it myself. It feels \u201cbetter\u201d to write a response to help someone than it\ndoes to write a document that will help many, because the former is so\nconcrete and immediate.\n\nWhen you pick a chat solution, you are optimizing for this kind of response.\n\nProblem #4: less capable moderation tools\n\nForums have been around a long time. It\u2019s a well understood problem space.\nThere\u2019s a rich set of functionality in most of them for handling the more\nfrustrating aspects of online community management (see also \u201cA Group is its\nown worst enemy\u201d).\n\nChat applications have uneven support for this aspect of community management;\nI have heard Discord is pretty good, but Slack is not.\n\nRemember that when you are running a community, you will inevitably attract\ntrolls and spammers. Make sure you have the tools to protect the community\nfrom abuse.\n\nIn addition, make sure you have the time/energy. The community may be able to\npolice itself when it gets to a certain size, but initially and for a long\nwhile, with a chat solution you may need to be ready to jump in and moderate.\n\nForums still require attention, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the tooling and the\nseparation of topics means they aren\u2019t quite as vulnerable. They are a higher\nvalue target, because of Google, however.\n\nProblem #5: you\u2019re missing out on long tail content\n\nThis issue is related to problem #2, but slightly different. When you are\nbuilding developer tools, there is a wide surface area of support needed.\nQuestions from developers help define that space. When they go to a chat,\nsomeone needs to capture the questions and make them public to help future\ndevelopers. You can capture this knowledge in formal docs.\n\nWhen using a forum, the answers are made available to the long tail of\nsearchers without any effort at all. A company I worked for got about 5-6% of\ntheir traffic from their forum pages.\n\nThat traffic was essentially free because the time to answer the questions was\nrequired with either solution. (This assumes the question would have been\nasked in either a chat or a forum.)\n\nProblem #6: questions can be flippant\n\nWhen I am talking in person to someone and they ask a question, I don\u2019t expect\nthem to have done a ton of research or thinking about it. It\u2019s a conversation,\nafter all.\n\nThe same attitude occurs during real time chat.\n\nFor technical questions, this can be frustrating because you want to help\nimmediately (see problem #3) and yet you don\u2019t have all the information you\nneed. In async discussions, because they are async, more context is typically\nprovided by the questioner.\n\nThis makes it easier for people who want to help to do so.\n\nWhy do people use Slack/Discord/etc?\n\nWow, so many problems with chat and all these reasons are why forum software\nis better.\n\nSo why do so many folks building developer communities choose solutions like\nSlack or Discord?\n\nThere are two motivations that I can see.\n\nOne from the company perspective and one from that of the developer.\n\nFrom the company side: it helps build community between members.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I am much more likely to pitch in and help when I\nhave had a conversation with someone than if some rando drops by with a\nquestion and leaves.\n\nA Slack can begin to feel like a real community, where you know people. It\ndoesn\u2019t feel as transactional when I see a question in a Slack when I\u2019ve seen\nthe questioner post other messages or share a bit about themselves. This type\nof interaction can happen in a forum, but seems more common in a Slack. This\ntype of interaction makes the community more sticky and people more likely to\nhelp. A minor benefit is that chat can be hosted elsewhere for free so the\nstartup cost and friction is low.\n\nFrom the developer\u2019s side: when I run into an issue or problem, I want an\nanswer as soon as frickin\u2019 possible. It\u2019s blocking me, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t\nhave asked it.\n\nSure, I can context switch, but that has its own costs. So there\u2019s tremendous\nvalue from a knowledge seeker\u2019s side to pick a synchronous method of asking\nquestions.\n\nIf you had a burning question to ask, which would you prefer? Hopping on the\nphone or sending a physical email. That\u2019s the allure of the chat platforms.\n\nI will say that some forum software has built chat in, but that isn\u2019t going to\nget you an answer immediately.\n\nWhat\u2019s right for you?\n\nWell, what do you want to emphasize? Long term aggregation of knowledge and a\nculture of completeness, or community and a culture of immediacy.\n\nAs alluded to initially, you can of course use both tools at different times\nin your community\u2019s evolution. I think the longer you build, the more you\u2019ll\nmove to a forum or other public knowledge sharing solution.\n\nHere\u2019s a tweet survey that I ran a month ago asking how developers wanted to\nget tech help. (Something else turned out to mostly be \u201cwell written\ndocumentation\u201d, from the thread responses.)\n\n> As a developer seeking tech help for a platform or software package, which\n> do you
