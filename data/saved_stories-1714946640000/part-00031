Sensitive\nconversations on subjects from extra-marital affairs to confessions of crimes\nwere now a bargaining chip.\n\nMikko Hypp\u00f6nen, from Finnish cyber-security firm WithSecure, who researched\nthe attack, says the event caused shockwaves in the country and led news\nbulletins for days. \u201cA hack on this scale is a disaster for Finland - everyone\nknew someone affected,\" he says.\n\nThis was all happening in 2020 during the pandemic lockdowns and the case\nstunned the cyber-security world.\n\nThe impact of the emails was immediate and devastating. Lawyer Jenni Raiskio\nrepresents 2,600 of the victims and, at the trial, said her firm had been\ncontacted by people whose relatives had taken their own lives after the\npatient records were published online. She led a moment of silence in the\ncourt for the victims.\n\nThe blackmailer, known only as ransom_man by his sign-off online, demanded\nvictims pay him \u20ac200 Euros (\u00a3171) within 24 hours otherwise he would publish\ntheir information. If they didn't meet that deadline he increased it to \u20ac500.\n\nAbout 20 people paid before the victims realised it was already too late.\nTheir information was already published the day before when ransom_man\naccidentally leaked the entire database to a forum on the darknet.\n\nIt is all still there today.\n\nMikko and his team spent time tracking the hack and trying to help police, and\ntheories began to emerge that the hacker was likely to be from Finland.\n\nOne of the largest police investigations in the country\u2019s history closed in on\none young Finn who was already infamous in the cyber-crime world.\n\nSky News\n\nKivim\u00e4ki in a Sky News interview in 2014 called himself Ryan\n\n## Zeekill crime spree\n\nKivim\u00e4ki, who called himself Zeekill as a teenage hacker, did not become the\nnotorious figure he is by being careful.\n\nAs a teenager he was all about hacking, extorting and bragging as loudly as he\ncould. Alongside hacker teams Lizard Squad and Hack the Planet he revelled in\ncausing chaos in the extremely active teen hacking period of the 2010s.\n\nKivim\u00e4ki was a key player, carrying out dozens of high-profile attacks until,\naged 17, he was arrested in 2014 and subsequently found guilty of 50,700\nhacking offences.\n\nControversially he was not jailed. His two-year suspended prison sentence was\ncriticised by many in the cyber-security world. Even for Finland\u2019s famously\nlenient sentences, the fear was that Kivim\u00e4ki and his accomplices - mostly\nother teenagers dispersed around the English-speaking world - would not be\ndeterred.\n\nLike many of his peers during this tumultuous time, Kivim\u00e4ki did not seem to\nlet police run-ins stop him. After his arrest, and before his sentence, he\ncarried out one of the most audacious attacks of any teenage hacking gang.\n\nHe and Lizard Squad took the two largest gaming platforms offline on Christmas\nEve and Christmas Day. Playstation Network and Xbox Live went down after the\nservices were hit with an unsophisticated but powerful technique known as a\nDistributed Denial of Service attack. Tens of millions of gamers were unable\nto download games, register new consoles or play with their friends online.\n\nLizard Squad bragged about their hacks on Twitter, posting boasts with their\nlogo\n\nKivim\u00e4ki enjoyed the attention of the world\u2019s media and even accepted a TV\ninterview with me for Sky News, where he showed no remorse for the attack.\n\nAnother hacker from Zeekill's Lizard Squad gang told the BBC that Kivimaki was\na vindictive teen who loved to get revenge on rivals and show off his skills\nonline.\n\n\"He was very good at what he did and didn't care about the consequences. He\nwould always go further than others in attacks.\n\n\"Despite the attention on him he would make bomb threats and serious prank\ncalls himself with no voice disguising,\" Ryan said. He didn't want to give his\nsurname as he is still unknown to authorities.\n\nAside from being linked to a few smaller-scale hacks after his sentencing,\nKivim\u00e4ki went largely unheard of for years until his name was linked to the\nVastaamo psychotherapy attack.\n\nJoe Tidy\n\nKivim\u00e4ki's trial in Helsinki was one of the biggest in the country's history\n\n## Red Notice Issued\n\nIt took Finnish police nearly two years to gather evidence to issue an\nInterpol Red Notice for him and he became one of Europe\u2019s most wanted\ncriminals. But no-one knew where the now 25-year-old was.\n\nHe was tracked down by mistake last February when police in Paris went to his\napartment after getting a false domestic disturbance call. They found Kivim\u00e4ki\nhad been living with forged identity documents under a fake name.\n\nHe was swiftly extradited to Finland where police began preparing for one of\nthe most high-profile trials in the country\u2019s history.\n\nDet Ch Supt Marko Leponen lead the three-year case and says it was the biggest\nof his career. \u201cWe had more than 200 officers on the case at one point and it\nwas an intense investigation with so many victim statements and stories to go\nthrough.\u201d\n\nKivim\u00e4ki's trial was a major story for the country with reporters there every\nday and international media present when he took the stand.\n\nI was in court for the first day of his evidence and he maintained his\ninnocence calmly and with occasional jokes told to the silenced courtroom.\n\nBut the evidence against him was overwhelming.\n\nDet Leponen says linking Kivim\u00e4ki's bank account to the server used to\ndownload the stolen data was crucial.\n\nHis officers also used novel forensics techniques to extract Kivim\u00e4ki's\nfingerprint from an otherwise anonymous picture he posted under an online\npseudonym.\n\nPolice of Finland\n\nPolice submitted evidence from a fingerprint that this picture was Kivim\u00e4ki\n\n\u201cWe were able to prove that this anonymous person posting on the forum was\nKivim\u00e4ki. It was unbelievable but it shows that you have to use every measure\nyou know and try those you don\u2019t,\u201d said Det Leponen.\n\nIn the end the judges delivered their verdict finding him guilty of all\ncounts.\n\nAccording to the court, Kivim\u00e4ki was guilty of more than 30,000 crimes - one\nfor each victim. He was charged with aggravated data breach, attempted\naggravated blackmail, 9,231 aggravated dissemination of information infringing\nprivate life, 20,745 attempted aggravated blackmail and 20 aggravated\nblackmail.\n\nHe was sentenced to six years and three months in prison out of a maximum\nseven years, but he is likely to serve only half because of time already\nserved and the Finnish justice system.\n\nFor victims like Tiina, this is nowhere near long enough.\n\n\u201cSo many people were affected by this in so many ways - 33,000 people is a lot\nof victims and it\u2019s affected our health, and some have been targeted with\nfinancial scams as well using the stolen data too,\u201d she says.\n\nMeanwhile she and the other victims are waiting to see if there is any\ncompensation from the case.\n\nKivim\u00e4ki has agreed in principle to settle out of court with one group of\nvictims, but others are planning civil cases against either him or Vastaamo\nitself.\n\nThe psychotherapy company is now defunct and its founder has been given a\nsuspended prison sentence for failing to protect patient data. Kivim\u00e4ki has\nnot told police how much money he has in bitcoin and claims to have forgotten\nhis digital wallet details.\n\nMs Raisko hopes that the state might be able to step in but says it could take\nmany more months if not years to go through each individual case to assess how\nmuch harm was caused.\n\nThere are even calls to change the law to help deal with future mass hack\ncases like this.\n\n\u201cThis really is historical in Finland because our system is not ready for this\namount of victims. The Vastaamo hack has showed us that we have to have to be\nprepared for these large cases so I hope there\u2019s a change. This is not going\nto end here,\u201d she says.\n\nComputing\n\nCyber-crime\n\nCyber-attacks\n\nCyber-security\n\nRelated\n\n## Airline keeps mistaking 101-year-old woman for baby\n\n8 days ago\n\n## Hackers threaten to publish huge cache of NHS data\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\nSouth Scotland\n\n## Health board 'running as normal' after cyber attack\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nSouth Scotland\n\nMore\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Cyber attack recovery could cost council \u00a3500,000\n\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar says it could be six months before its IT systems\nare fully restored.\n\n4 days ago\n\nHighlands & Islands\n\n7 days ago\n\n## New law aims to protect devices from hackers\n\nSpeakers, fitness trackers and other internet-connected devices sold in the UK\nnow have to meet new requirements.\n\n7 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\n## Cyber-attack leaves street lights permanently on\n\nWhile the council's IT systems are back online, technical issues are still\naffecting street lights.\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\nLeicester\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\n## Health board apologises for cyber attack 'anxiety'\n\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway says it recognises calls for transparency in\nhandling the incident.\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\nSouth Scotland\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n## Police bust cyber gang accused of worldwide fraud\n\nPolice took down the international scam on Tuesday and say there could be up\nto 70,000 UK victims.\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\nUK\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
