That is finally beginning to\nchange.\n\nFirefox's Linux binaries have been produced for x86 32-bit and x86_64 but any\nAArch64 binaries on Linux have been left up to Linux distribution vendors and\nother third-parties wanting Firefox on Arm. But Mozilla announced this Friday\nthat Firefox Nightly builds will now see ARM64! Mozilla will begin pushing out\nARM64 Linux binaries for Firefox both as the generic .tar.gz package and the\nDebian (.deb) packages,. This includes the Debian/Ubuntu APT repository\nsupport from Mozilla.\n\nWhile initially just Firefox Nightly is seeing Linux ARM64 builds, with time\nand QA/testing the plan is to ultimately expand it so the release and ESR\nversions will also see official Linux ARM64 builds. Mozilla announced today on\ntheir blog:\n\n> \"We want to be upfront about the current state of our ARM64 builds. Although\n> we are confident in the quality of Firefox on this architecture, we are\n> still incorporating comprehensive ARM64 testing into Firefox\u2019s continuous\n> integration and release pipeline. Our goal is to integrate ARM64 builds into\n> Firefox\u2019s extensive automated test suite, which will enable us to offer this\n> architecture across the beta, release, and ESR channels.\n>\n> We encourage you to download the new ARM64 Firefox Nightly binaries, test\n> them, and share your findings with us. By using these builds and reporting\n> any issues, you\u2019re empowering our developers to better support and test on\n> this architecture, ultimately leading to a stable and reliable Firefox for\n> ARM64.\"\n\nGreat albeit arguably long overdue. Firefox 127 nightly builds for ARM64 and\nx86/x86_64 can be downloaded at Mozilla.org.\n\n3 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nFirefox 125 Adds AV1 Support In Encrypted Media Extensions, Other New Features\n\nFirefox 124 Now Available With Screen Wake Lock API\n\nMozilla Firefox 123.0 Available With Improved Translation Support, New\nDeveloper Features\n\nThunderbird Making Progress With Adopting Rust Code\n\nMozilla Has A New CEO To Focus On The Future\n\nMozilla's Latest Plan To Make Money Is Mozilla Monitor Plus\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
