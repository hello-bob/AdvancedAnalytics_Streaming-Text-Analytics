Thoughts. Smiles :)\n\n# From Reaction to Reflection\n\nMost of our behaviour is automated routine. We don\u2019t think much about walking\nto the kitchen and making tea. This works as long as our predictions of the\nworld match with what actually happens. Finding the kitchen underwater due to\na broken pipe will make for a very different and less automated approach than\njust moments ago.\n\nOur brain is built to quickly identify mismatches between prediction and\nactuality since that could always signify a threat to our current plan (the\nmost basic plan being survival). It will pull our attention to the mismatch\nand produce strong emotions like anger or fear to ensure we react to it.\n\nThese acute emotions are the primary force behind our reactions to the world\nwhen it really matters. However, they are ancient, and often, their guidance\nisn\u2019t useful for modern life, where we are no longer facing the predators and\nother dangers that they have evolved to protect us from.\n\nEmotions and the impulses connected to them can be very useful. If fear keeps\nyou from swimming in a river with strong currents, that\u2019s good. Grief is\nnecessary to process loss and adjust the mind to a new environment. Without\nthe right dosage of anger, it will be difficult to defend your boundaries and\nsay no to your boss when necessary.\n\nOf course we all have to learn not to act out every impulse unchecked. It is a\nnecessary part of childhood and adolescence to put cultural norms over our own\nmomentary needs and to become socialised by caretakers and peers.\n\nSo, we are all equipped with strategies to deal with arising emotions and the\nimpulses attached to them. But the adult environment only becomes more\ncomplicated over time: Colleagues, partners, children, neighbours, the list\ngoes on. Often, our childhood strategies don\u2019t suffice to navigate the\nincreasingly complicated terrain we\u2019re facing, at least not with the desired\noutcome in the long run.\n\nOne of the basic models of CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is the triangle\nof thoughts, feelings, and behaviour. The idea is that those three are\ninterconnected, and each influences the other two.\n\nLet me clarify this with an example. I notice that my wife is upset, because\nit seems she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. My automatic response would be\nsomething like this:\n\n  * Thoughts \u2013 \u201cOh no, what happened?\u201d, \u201cI did something wrong\u201d.\n  * Feelings \u2013 Guilt, fear, tension.\n  * Behaviour \u2013 Asking her what\u2019s wrong, trying to facilitate a conversation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem too harmful at first, but there are some problems. First, she\nmight not be upset about something I did, but my thoughts and emotions could\nquickly accelerate and confirm each other to convince me otherwise. That would\nbuild the urge to follow the behavioural impulse (Asking her what\u2019s wrong,\ntrying to facilitate a conversation). Then, if I push a conversation while she\nis signalling that she needs a moment for herself, it might just cause the\nconflict I was afraid of \u2013 firing up my thoughts and feelings even more.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that in the CBT triangle, not all three corners can be\ninfluenced in the same manner. We have close to no control over our emotions;\nwe just kind of feel the way we feel in each moment. We can also not stop\nthoughts from arising, but we can at least actively add thoughts to the mix.\nIn this model, only behaviour is fully under our control (except, of course,\nthe kinds of motor reflexes that activate when we are falling).\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The focus is on changes\nin thoughts and behaviour that will then influence the emotions.\n\nThe first step in this endeavour is paying attention. The goal is not to\nrewrite the established script but to become a curious observer of yourself.\nIt helps to analyse situations in hindsight and write out the reactions in\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviour in the way I showed. Try to make this a\nregular practice, either whenever an unpleasant situation arises or as part of\nyour journaling routine.\n\nWe all have a set of these automated systems that are responsible for most of\nthe suffering in our lives. Recognising them won\u2019t ease the pain; it might\neven worsen initially. What is it good for then?\n\nThe endgame here is to take back control of our behaviour. The point of\nobserving the thoughts and feelings in a given situation is not to change them\nbut also to recognise the behavioural impulses attached to them. Once the\nimpulse to act is known before the act, we are suddenly free not to follow it.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even mean that a great alternative must be found immediately.\nOften, just stalling is already much better than acting out the impulse. Of\ncourse, that makes it necessary to endure the emotions and thoughts, which can\nfeel quite impossible. Every moment of that endurance is a success because if\nyou feel it, you have already endured it.\n\nSharing the observations might also be worth a try. I would tell my wife, for\nexample, \u201cI can feel that you\u2019re upset and want to be alone, but I don\u2019t know\nwhy. Of course, I assume I did something wrong, making it hard for me not to\nbother you. I\u2019ll try my best, though, and will be right here when you\u2019re ready\nto talk.\u201d\n\nAll of this is essentially probing for alternative behavioural paths. Some\nwill give you better results than the automatic systems; others won\u2019t. Take\nnote of both. The main goal, however, is not to switch the established\nbehavioural system for a better one but to cultivate the form of attention\nthat allows for deviation from the automatic response, no matter what it is.\n\nSummary\n\n  * Without a framework of observation and categorisation, we are puppets of our emotions.\n  * Our automatic response to unpleasant thoughts and feelings can produce exactly what we want to avoid.\n  * Continuously updating our operating system with more sophisticated strategies to deal with acute emotions and their impulses is the foundation for meaningful and productive relationships.\n  * Cultivate the form of attention that allows for deviation from the automatic response, no matter what it is.\n\nQuote of the week: \u201cThe curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I\nam, then I can change\u201c. By Carl Rogers, sent to me by Waking Up, the App I use\nfor meditation practice. It has a function of providing a daily quote as a\npush notification, which is one of the few notifications I allow on my phone.\nIt never fails to puncture my day with a moment of clarity or reflection \u2013 not\nsponsored, just a fan. A regular mindfulness practice also helps to build the\nkind of attention I was discussing in this essay.\n\nArticle of the week: You Are Always the Other Person is a quick but profound\nread, suggesting a useful switch of perspective. It is also very relevant to\nthe topic of this essay, as it describes another approach to adjust our\nattention in social situations.\n\nVideo of the week: We Fed Our Microbes Blood So You Don\u2019t Have To by the\nwonderful Journey to the Microcosmos. Their videos\n\nSong of the week: Cinderella from the new Future and Metro Boomin Album,\nfeaturing Travis Scott.
