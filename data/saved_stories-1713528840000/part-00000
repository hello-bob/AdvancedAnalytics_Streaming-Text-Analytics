Western\ndelays over sending aid mean the country is dangerously short of something\neven harder to supply than shells: the fighting spirit required to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorale among troops is grim, ground down by relentless bombardment, a lack of\nadvanced weapons, and losses on the battlefield. In cities hundreds of miles\naway from the front, the crowds of young men who lined up to join the army in\nthe war\u2019s early months have disappeared. Nowadays, eligible would-be recruits\ndodge the draft and spend their afternoons in nightclubs instead. Many have\nleft the country altogether.\n\nAs I discovered while reporting from Ukraine over the past month, the picture\nthat emerged from dozens of interviews with political leaders, military\nofficers, and ordinary citizens was one of a country slipping towards\ndisaster.\n\nEven as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine is trying to find a way not\nto retreat, military officers privately accept that more losses are inevitable\nthis summer. The only question is how bad they will be. Vladimir Putin has\narguably never been closer to his goal.\n\nUkrainian military officers privately accept that more losses are inevitable this summer. | Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe know people are flagging and we hear it from regional governors and from\nthe people themselves,\u201d Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff,\ntold POLITICO. Yermak and his boss travel together to \u201csome of the most\ndangerous places\u201d to rally citizens and soldiers for the fight, he said. \u201cWe\ntell people: \u2018Your name will be in the history books.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf the tide doesn\u2019t turn soon in this third year of Russia\u2019s invasion, it will\nbe the nation of Ukraine as it currently exists that is consigned to the past.\n\nFor a war of such era-defining importance, the scale of Western leaders\u2019\nactions to help Kyiv repel Russia\u2019s invaders has fallen far short of their\nsoaring rhetoric. That disappointment has left Ukrainians of all ranks \u2014 from\nthe soldiers digging trenches to ministers running the country \u2014 weary and\nirritable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen POLITICO asked Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba if he felt the West had\nleft Ukraine to fight with one hand tied behind its back, his verdict was\nclear: \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said, in an interview in his office, an hour after\nanother Russian mid-morning missile attack.\n\nZelenskyy has laid out the stakes even more starkly, saying Ukraine \u201cwill lose\nthe war\u201d if the U.S. Congress does not step up and supply aid.\n\nIncreasingly it looks as if Putin\u2019s bet that he can grind down Ukrainian\nresistance and Western support might pay off.\n\nRight now, Ukraine\u2019s most urgent need is for artillery shells. | Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWithout a major step-change in the supply of advanced Western weapons and\ncash, Ukraine won\u2019t be able to liberate the territories Putin\u2019s forces now\nhold. That will leave Putin free to gnaw on the wounded country in the months\nor years ahead. Even if Russia can\u2019t finish Ukraine off, a partial victory\nwill leave Kyiv\u2019s hopes of joining the EU and NATO stuck in limbo.\n\nThe ramifications of such an outcome will be serious for the world. Putin will\nclaim victory at home, and, emboldened by exposing Western weaknesses, he may\nreinvigorate his wider imperial ambitions abroad. Lithuania, Latvia and\nEstonia are especially fearful they are next on his hit list. China, already\nan increasingly reliable partner for Moscow, will see few reasons to alter its\nstance.\n\n### Putin\u2019s big target is Ukraine\u2019s second largest city\n\nRight now, Ukraine\u2019s most urgent need is for artillery shells \u2014 millions of\nthem. Moreover, Ukraine says it needs at least two dozen Patriot air-defense\nsystems to protect troops on the front lines and to defend Kharkiv, the\ncountry\u2019s biggest city after Kyiv, which has been under ferocious missile and\nartillery attack for weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFears are growing that Russia may target Ukraine\u2019s second city for a ground\noffensive soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s symbolic because they say that Kharkiv was the first capital of Ukraine.\nIt\u2019s a big target,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an interview with POLITICO\u2019s parent\ncompany Axel Springer media outlets last week.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military is braced for more losses in the coming months. Oleksandr\nSyrskyi, commander in chief of the armed forces, has warned that the situation\non Ukraine\u2019s eastern front has \u201csignificantly deteriorated in recent days.\u201d As\nZelenskyy himself put it elsewhere, \u201cWe are trying to find some way not to\nretreat.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly it looks as if Putin\u2019s bet that he can grind down Ukrainian resistance and Western support might pay off. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe fears about the fragility of the front lines are only compounded by an\nunprecedented barrage of Russian attacks intended to knock out Ukraine\u2019s\nelectricity networks.\n\nIn recent meetings with POLITICO, the country\u2019s political leaders acknowledged\nthat public spirits are sagging, and although they all tried to stay upbeat,\nfrustration with the West came through in every conversation.\n\n\u201cGive us the damn Patriots,\u201d snapped Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s chief diplomat. Sitting\nfor an interview in the foreign ministry, he couldn\u2019t hide his exasperation\nwith the delays, and the strings that come attached to Western weaponry \u2014 like\nnot striking Russian oil facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuleba, of course, offered his unconditional gratitude for all the support\nthat has come from the Western allies over the past two years. But he warned\nthat Ukraine is trapped in a vicious cycle: The weapons it needs are withheld\nor delayed; then Western allies complain that Kyiv is on the retreat, making\nit less likely they\u2019ll send more aid in future. (Since POLITICO\u2019s meeting with\nKuleba, Germany has agreed to supply Patriots, but the question still remains\nwhether they will prove sufficient.)\n\nThe mood in the senior ranks of the military is even darker than Kuleba\u2019s.\n\nSeveral senior officers talked to POLITICO only on the understanding they\nwould not be named so they could talk freely. They painted a grim forecast of\nfrontlines potentially collapsing this summer when Russia, with greater weight\nof numbers and a readiness to accept huge casualties, launches its expected\noffensive. Perhaps worse, they expressed private fears that Ukraine\u2019s own\nresolve could be weakened, with morale in the armed forces undermined by a\ndesperate shortage of supplies.\n\nAs Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself put it elsewhere, \u201cWe are trying to find some way not to retreat.\u201d | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUkrainian commanders are crying out for more combat soldiers \u2014 one estimate\nfrom the former top commander, Valeriy Zaluzhny suggested they\u2019d need an extra\n500,000 troops.\n\nBut Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian parliament are hesitant about ordering a\nmassive fresh call-up. In an interview with POLITICO, Yermak, the powerful\nHead of the Office of the President of Ukraine, offered an important \u2014 and to\noutsiders perhaps surprising \u2014 reason for not launching a mass mobilization:\nsuch a call-up wouldn\u2019t have the backing of the people. Zelenskyy is still\n\u201cpresident of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor him, that\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s\nvery important that the people do something not just because they\u2019re ordered\nto do it.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. The West has failed to come up with what\u2019s needed, and it\nin turn is undermining Ukraine\u2019s will to do what it takes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country is facing an existential crisis \u2014 Putin literally wants to scratch\nit from the map \u2014 and yet there apparently isn\u2019t enough public support for a\nnew draft.\n\n### Young Ukrainians are dodging the military draft\n\nAdmittedly, Ukraine is no different from its neighboring European countries\nwhere recent opinion polls suggest large numbers would refuse to be\nconscripted even if their nations were under attack. But Ukraine is the\ncountry at war. An existential fight like this can\u2019t be won without mobilizing\nthe entire nation.\n\nAnd yet, as the conflict continues, Ukrainians living in Kyiv and the center\nand west of the country \u2014 away from the front lines \u2014 appear in some ways to\nbe ready to put up with war raging in the east, as long as they can get back\nto their normal lives.\n\nHence, there is draft-dodging: eligible young recruits find other things to do\nwith their time, packing into hipster bars and techno clubs in the late\nafternoons.\n\nVitali Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion now serving as Kyiv\u2019s\nmayor, said he understood why people wanted to get back to normal, arguing\nthat it is healthy. He told POLITICO the desire to resume daily activities was\nan expression of defiance in the face of Putin\u2019s attempts to wear the people\ndown.\n\nMaybe so. But faced with a relentless enemy, driving home its advantage\nagainst a badly equipped army of defenders, such a hands-off attitude seems\nhigh risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ukraine\u2019s ousted chief commander Zaluzhny found to his cost, rational\nwarnings that things may not turn out well can get commentators and analysts\nin trouble. But suspending critical thinking won\u2019t win this war either.\n\nThe West has placed too much faith in sanctions, believing they\u2019d bring Russia\nto heel. There\u2019s also beenwishful thinking about Russians turning on Putin\nover casualty figures, or hopes he may be ousted in a Kremlin coup. Instead\nRussia\u2019s economy has remained resilient and Putin has strengthened his grip on\npower.\n\nIt\u2019s true that before launching the 2022 invasion, the Russian leader may have\nbeen misled by his bungling intelligence chiefs into believing a short war\nwould offer a quick win.\n\nUkrainians living away from the front lines appear in some ways to be ready to put up with war, as long as they can get back to their normal lives. | Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut Putin can afford to wait. Last month he awarded himself another six-year\nterm as president. He can settle for a stalemate: Keeping Ukraine stuck\nbetween victory and defeat, shut out of both NATO and the EU, would still\namount to a win.\n\nAnd what would a deadlocked conflict do to Ukrainian resilience?\n\nThe early burst of patriotic fervor which saw draft centers swamped with\nvolunteers has evaporated. An estimated 650,000 men of fighting age have fled\ntheir country, most by smuggling themselves across the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years ago, the trains heading out of Ukraine were almost exclusively\ncarrying women, children and the elderly to seek refuge. This week, around a\nthird of the passengers on one train carrying this correspondent out of the\ncountry were men of fighting age. Somehow they\u2019d managed to get waiver papers\nto leave.\n\nIn Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential office in Bankova Street, his officials insist\nthey are still positive. But that Western aid, especially President Joe\nBiden\u2019s long-delayed $60 billion package of support, can\u2019t wait much longer.\n\nWhat would Putin do if Ukraine doesn\u2019t get the Western help it needs to win?\n\u201cHe would completely destroy everything. Everything,\u201d Zelenskyy told Axel\nSpringer media. Ukrainian cities will be reduced to rubble; hundreds of\nthousands will die, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople will not run away, most of them, and so he will kill a lot of people.\nSo how it will look like? A lot of blood.\u201d\n\n", "frontpage": true}
