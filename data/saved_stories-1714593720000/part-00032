With the answers to so many technology questions\ntending towards \u201cit depends\u201d as one gains experience, more perspectives reveal\nadditional factors that \u201cit\u201d could depend on.\n\nFor today\u2019s \u201cit\u201d question, I want to highlight the discussion happening in\n\u201cWhat language would be the best beginner language?\u201d User Mr Quibbles,\nrelatively new to programming, asks:\n\nI started learning programming about a year and a half ago and I started with\nPython 3.10 as my first ever language. I was advised to do so by friends of\nmine due to its English-like syntax, however, about a month ago I heard\nfriends of mine discussing that C might be a better language to start.\n\nI have been learning C++ for the past 3 months in my free time and I can see\ntheir point, C++ syntax has a lot more in common with other programming\nlanguages than Python does. So I wanna hear what others here think, which\nlanguage do you think would be best to start with, and which language did you\nlearn first?\n\nAs you may guess, much of the conversation compared C/C++ and Python as\nstarter languages.\n\nRupesh Kumar wrote - C, C++ is for learning basics building blocks and\nlearning to applying logic. Python, java like languages is library rich and\nused to create live application and solve business problems.\n\nYou can start with your preference,\n\nFor the record, your humble correspondent started with BASIC, then took some\ncomputer science classes in C and Java. Of course, it is debatable whether I\nknow programming or not. That\u2019s why we have discussions like this.\n\nMost of the votes for Python talked about how easy it was to understand.\n\nTechguy wrote - Python is a great language to learn, as it's considered very\n\"high level\" - meaning close to English in its syntax.\n\njfleach wrote - There is a reason Python is the most popular programming\nlanguage in the world.\n\n  1. It's an open source higher-level language.\n  2. It's very easy to learn and use.\n  3. It can be used for advanced projects.\n  4. You can import third party libraries with ease and is a huge time saver.\n  5. It can be used for full-stack development.\n  6. Employers love people who know Python which pays off.\n\nThe C/C++ fans, on the other hand, thought you should get the deeper\nunderstanding of CS concepts from the get-go:\n\nwyzarddoc wrote - I vote for C++. Bottom line C++ gives you full control down\nto the single bit, but also requires you to reinvent the wheel when learning.\nBy this I mean just to print something on the terminal requires you to learn\nthe contents of libraries and how to incorporate them into your code. Python\nis much easier, but is extremely inconsistent in it's coding application. For\ninstance string handling can be disguised as a list if your not aware of when\nyour function changes input from a list to a string.\n\nOne absolute madlad came in with this suggestion:\n\nLemonCool wrote - Assembly!! lots of people started from it for a reason, in\nthe end it all gets translated to low level so would be really beneficial to\nyour dev journey. In my opinion you don't want to skimp on your education and\nlearn to walk. Assembly will humble and reward your journey. If you don't want\nto go that low, probably C is the best starting point, that won't hide too\nmuch away from your keystrokes-composed-code with glue-up-behind-the-scene\nmagic.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more on this about the benefits of each, including which\nlanguages will help you get a job (not the assignment, but definitely a good\nfactor to keep in mind). Are you team Python with the easy syntax, or do you\nthink everyone should start with `malloc` on their mind? Or are you a secret\nthird thing, Haskell or death, recurse me eternal sort of programmer? Head on\nover to the discussion and chime in.\n\nAuthors\n\nRyan Donovan\n\nStaff\n\ndiscussionse-techse-stackoverflowprogramming languagebeginner\n\nRecent articles\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n# Collaborating smarter, not harder\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n# How to succeed as a data engineer without the burnout\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n# How do mixture-of-experts layers affect transformer models?\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\n# Developers with AI assistants need to follow the pair programming model\n\nLatest Podcast\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n# Net neutrality is in; TikTok and noncompetes are out\n\nLogin with your stackoverflow.com account to take part in the discussion.\n\nStack Overflow for Teams\n\nPricingCustomersOur solutionIntegrationsFeaturesCustomer SuccessSecurityReturn\non Investment (ROI) OverflowAI Try freeLog in\n\nUse casesEngineersData ScientistsDevOps & SRESupportProduct Managment\nResourcesProductivityAI/MLGuides and InsightsCustomer Academy FAQHelp center\n\nStack Overflow Advertising\n\nWhy Stack Overflow?What to expect Advertise to developersAttract tech\ntalentEngage your community\n\nUse casesMarketing TeamsEmployer Branding TeamsDevRel TeamsTalent\nTeamsTechnology TeamsAgencies ResourcesProduct guides & insightsCommunity\ninsightsAdvertising best practicesTalent best practicesCollectivesTM\n\nCompany\n\nOverflowAPI NEW\n\nStack Overflow\u2019s subscription-based API service to train and fine-tune large\nlanguage models.\n\nAboutLeadershipSocial ImpactPressCareersOpen positionsContact us\nBlogNewsletterPodcastLabs\n\nSite design / logo \u00a9 2024 Stack Exchange Inc.
