Back then we had to educate nearly every client on agile and\nits benefits. These days, many of our clients are already using agile\npractices within their internal teams.\n\n## A Quick Refresher\n\nThe Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 as a collaboration between individuals\ninfluential in the software community. The Manifesto has 12 underlying\nprinciples which boil up to the following perspectives, prioritizing:\n\n  1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n  2. Working software over comprehensive documentation\n  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n  4. Responding to change over following a plan\n\nThese simple statements have guided teams to create successful, scalable\nsoftware solutions for decades.\n\nAs it has become more common, though, I\u2019ve noticed it drifting further from\nits original intent. Here are two symptoms your team may be falling victim to\nthis trend.\n\n## Symptom 1: Too Many Meetings\n\nScrum has become the de facto framework for implementing agile practices\ntoday. At its core, scrum is meant to be a tool for setting priorities, making\ncontinuous improvements to the process, and keeping collaboration high.\n\nIf the first word that comes to your mind when you hear scrum is \u201cmeetings,\u201d\nthen you\u2019re not alone.\n\nThere are a core set of rituals that scrum advises, such as daily standup,\nsprint planning, sprint review, and backlog refinement. While some of these\nare essential, I believe that small, highly collaborative teams, can be more\ninformal around others. If you are working closely with your small team, you\nshould be incorporating feedback constantly for continuous improvement. Maybe\nyou don\u2019t need an hour every sprint for a formal retrospective. Remember,\nindividuals and interactions over tools and processes.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen this core set of rituals get blown out into a much broader\nrange of activities. Recurring meetings start popping into calendars (pre-\nrefinement, demo prep, etc.). Remember, working software over comprehensive\ndocumentation.\n\n## Symptom 2: Rigid Deadlines with Prescribed Functionality\n\nThere\u2019s a common misconception that agile is the absence of planning. This is\nsimply not true. The Manifesto states that there is value in the \u201citems on the\nright\u201d (following a plan, processes, and tools, etc.) but that the \u201citems on\nthe left\u201d are valued more.\n\nFor a product to be successful, it\u2019s important to have a vision with a roadmap\nguiding the team from today to that vision. The roadmap should highlight key\nvalue adds to the product throughout time. And, the roadmap should be subject\nto change.\n\nToday, I see many product roadmaps that are bulleted lists of features along\nwith vague delivery dates. You might see something like:\n\nQ2 2025 \u2013 Event Management Phase 1\n\n  * Event Creation and Editing\n  * Browse Upcoming Events\n  * Register for Events\n  * Personalized Events Calendar\n\nThere are several entries like the one above with delivery dates 12+ months\ninto the future.\n\nThis is Waterfall masquerading as agile. If the delivery date is not flexible,\nnor are the requirements, you are not practicing agile.\n\nRoadmaps like this deprive development teams of autonomy. They are entirely\nprescriptive on what to build, not focused on problems the solution addresses.\n\nThey also lack awareness of how software is built. Creating such concrete\nplans that far into the future limits the flexibility the business has to\nadapt to new information. Again, this is Waterfall, not agile.\n\n## Are there alternatives to agile practices?\n\nI\u2019ve recently become aware of 37signals\u2019 product development method called\nShape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters. I don\u2019t see\nShape Up as an alternative to agile, but a new framework for implementing\nagile that is closer to agile\u2019s heart.\n\nI have not experimented with Shape Up yet, but I would love to talk with\nanyone who has. If that\u2019s you, please reach out!\n\nagile\n\nRyan Abel Managing Partner at Atomic Object Raleigh-Durham.
