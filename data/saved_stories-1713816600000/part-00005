They\nwere feeling stuck. Their job was fine but not great \u2013 good enough that they\ndidn\u2019t want to switch jobs for a simple lateral move, but bad enough that they\nwere mildly unhappy much of the time. They didn\u2019t have the skillset they\nneeded to land a new job at a higher seniority and pay grade, and there were\nno opportunities for advancement at their current job. They had been trying to\nspend time leveling up, but hadn\u2019t made any progress.\n\nAt one point during the conversation, I started asking about how they set\ngoals and tracked work. It was clear to me that they had clear goals: they had\nspecific skills they knew they needed to learn to get tho the next level in\ntheir career. I was wondering if perhaps they wen\u2019t translating those goals\ninto tasks and/or executing on those tasks; I thought that maybe improving\ntheir work tracking system could help.\n\nThey told me that they use Jira for task tracking at work, and that it works\nreally well for them. They have a backlog of tickets, they review it\nregularly, and if there\u2019s a ticket for something it gets done. \u201cBut\u201d, they\nsaid, \u201cI can\u2019t exactly put \u2018get a better job\u2019 into my work Jira!\u201d\n\nThis line stuck with me because it follows a common pattern I\u2019ve seen. Many\npeople struggle to make progress on long-term goals because they don\u2019t have a\nsystem for getting things done that works for them. Sometimes \u2014 as with this\nperson \u2014 the work tracking system provided by their employer fits their brain,\nand in those cases they can get their assigned work done... but they then\nstruggle to make progress on personal priorities or long-term career moves\nthat aren\u2019t things they can use their work tracking system.\n\nMost people have tasks, projects, and goals outside work, but they often don\u2019t\napproach them with the same rigor as they approach their day jobs. That seems\nweird if you step back from it: why are you giving less time and attention to\nyour personal goals than you give to work? We use work tracking systems at\nwork because we understand that these systems can facilitate focus and help us\nget work done. When we don\u2019t do the same with our side projects and personal\ngoals, we can end up implicitly prioritizing our day jobs other work that\nbrings us more joy. Applying some level of rigor to tracking our personal work\ncan help make sure we properly prioritize it.\n\nI believe pretty strongly that everyone needs a personal work tracking system\n\u2013 a set of practices that work for them and helps them get things done and\nfeel good about their work. An employer\u2019s work tracking system might be part\nof this personal system, but most people will need additional tools and\npractices on top to account for other work.\n\nI also believe that there\u2019s no single right answer here. It\u2019s about finding a\nsystem that fits your brain. Everyone\u2019s brain works differently, and the\ncircumstances in our lives differ wildly. Systems that work well for one\nperson in one context might be totally inaccessible or hilariously wrong for\nsomeone else in a different context.\n\nSo late last year I began researching a series on these personal productivity\npractices. My plan was to interview several people and present individual case\nstudies on them, the systems they built, and why those systems work well for\nthem. I conducted a bunch of these interviews, started to write up my findings\n... and ultimately decided that I won\u2019t finish or publish the series.\n\nYou see, the more I wrote about \u201cproductivity\u201d, the more I found myself\nfalling into a trap. It\u2019s very difficult to write in this space without\napproaching the topic in a way that\u2019s weirdly moralistic. It\u2019s difficult to\navoid implying that \u201cbeing productive\u201d is some sort of objectively virtuous\nbehavior \u2013 and that conversely a lack of \u201cproductivity\u201d is some sort of moral\nfailing. I don\u2019t believe this. Nor do I believe that we have any sort of\nimperative to be maximally-productive at work. You don\u2019t need to \u201cgive 110%\u201d\nto your job. You don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d your employer any sort of maximal time and\nattention.\n\nI do think that \u201cproductivity\u201d is important, but it\u2019s a more subtle\nimportance. It\u2019s not about being a nice little compliant worker drone and\nmaximizing your contributions to capitalism! Productivity is important to me\nin the way that it contributes to feeling content and fulfilled. It\u2019s\nfrustrating and stressful to be behind at work, and that stress bleeds over\nand affects your personal life. Being productive at work means it\u2019s easier to\n\u201cswitch off\u201d when you go home. And there\u2019s no requirement that anyone be\n\u201cproductive\u201d at home \u2014 but for many people having a long list of unfinished\npassion projects is demoralizing and frustrating, and finding ways to help\nthemselves focus on projects that bring them joy can be useful.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never been able to properly find express this, to find a tone for\nthis series that doesn\u2019t land dangerously close to \u201cgrindset\u201d or \u201chustle\nculture\u201d nonsense. It\u2019s very easy, reading my unpublished drafts, to come away\nwith the impression that the people I wanted to profile are \u201cbetter\u201d in some\nway because they get more done. I even found myself getting jealous of some\npeople\u2019s output, and feeling bad about my own tendency to procrastinate.\n\nUltimately, I can\u2019t find a way to write this series in a way that won\u2019t tend\nto make some readers feel bad about themselves, which is the opposite of my\ngoal. So I\u2019m abandoning the series, archiving the drafts, and writing this\npost to try to get a bit of closure. Perhaps someday I\u2019ll become a skillful\nenough writer to cover this topic without falling into the trap. But I\u2019m not\nthere yet, so into the trash heap it goes.\n\nI always welcome feedback on my writing \u2014 please feel free to get in touch if\nyou have comments. I also try to help people with job searches, career advice,\nand other things; see some ways I can help.
