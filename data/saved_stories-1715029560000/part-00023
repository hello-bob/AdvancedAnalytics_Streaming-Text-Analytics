This repository will be updated regularly with\n> changes and new releases.\n\n## Digital Workers for each Sales Role or Superagent (a.k.a Qai )? \ud83e\udd14\n\nSales orgs have people like SDR's, BDR's, Account Execs, Head of Sales etc.\n\nThe question we ask ourselves constantly is whether we should mimic the real\nworld and have Digital Worker equivalents within the app ? or Have one\nsuperagent that co-ordinates with other software agents internally.\n\nWe are starting with the latter approach. We think based on the users role and\nrole based permissions, Qai will be able to do different things. It will also\nsimplify the requirement of remembering names of Digial workers like Qai just\nfor the sake of seeming cool. But internally, there will be an army of digial\nworkers / agents doing their job anyways.\n\nOpen to ideas.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Tech Stack\n\n  * \u2705 Framework: Typescript for frontend & NodeJS for backend\n  * \u2705 App Server Database: MongoDB\n  * \u2705 Vector Database: ChromaDB\n  * \u2705 AI Server SQL Relational Database: SQLite or anything that works with SQLAlchemy\n  * \u2705 LLM Tooling: Langchain\n\n## Prerequisites \ud83d\udc47\n\nBefore you get started, please make sure you have the following installed:\n\n  * An editor of your choice. For example, Visual Studio Code (VS Code)\n  * Node.js\n  * Git\n\n## Getting started \ud83d\ude80\n\nThere's 3 main components to running the code\n\n  * \ud83c\udfa8 Client App\n\n  * \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f App Server\n\n  * \ud83e\udd16 AI Server\n\n> Please refer to the sample People CSV file for the structure of the CSV file\n> that the user can upload to the QAI bot for generating campaigns.\n\n## Getting Started with the QRev App Server\n\nTo get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nHere is what you need to be able to run QRev.\n\n  * Node.js (Version: >=18.18.0)\n\n  * Mongo (Version: >=5.x)\n\n> If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you will have to\n> obtain credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below\n> under the integrations section.\n\n### Setup\n\n  1. Clone the GitHub repo\n    \n        git clone https://github.com/qrev-ai/qrev.git\n\n  2. Go to the server folder\n    \n        cd server\n\n  3. Setup Node If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, \"nvm\" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:\n    \n        nvm install v18.18.0\n    \n        nvm use 18.18.0\n\n> You can install nvm from here.\n\n  4. Install the packages with npm\n    \n        npm ci\n\n> npm ci makes sure that the versions of the packages installed will be from\n> package-lock.json, this will make sure the right version of packages are\n> installed.\n\n  5. Set up your .env file\n\n     * Duplicate .env.example to .env\n     * Use openssl rand -base64 32 to generate a key and add this under REFRESH_TOKEN_JWT_SECRET in the .env file.\n     * Use openssl rand -base64 32 to generate a key and add this under ACCESS_TOKEN_JWT_SECRET in the .env file.\n     * Use openssl rand -base64 32 to generate a key and add this under AI_BOT_SERVER_TOKEN in the .env file and make sure the AI server uses the same token as well.\n  6. If you haven't already configured MongoDB and got the MONGO_DB_URL, then follow the steps here to install Mongo DB locally.\n\n  7. Run the below command to start the server:\n    \n        npm start\n\n## Getting Started with the QRev App Client\n\nMake sure you have the right Environment variables\n\nThese are referenced in the Client Code\n\n### Setup\n\n  1. Go to the client folder\n\n    \n    \n    cd client\n\n  2. Install libraries\n\n    \n    \n    npm install\n\n  3. Set up the .env file via following commands\n\n     * Copy the example environment file:\n        \n                cp .env.example .env\n\n     * Add your Google client id for the variable REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\n\n     * Add your app backend server host url for REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL\n\n     * Add your app backend server host url for REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST_URL\n\nNote: Please make sure there is no / at the end of the URL environment values.\n\n  4. To prevent any formatting issues in the code files, run the following\n\n    \n    \n    git config --global core.autocrlf true\n\n  5. Run the client\n\n    \n    \n    npm start\n\n## Getting Started with the QRev AI Code\n\nPlease refer the Server README\n\n### Integrations\n\nQRev supports a few Integrations, which will expand over time\n\nPlease refer the Server README\n\n### Contributors\n\n## About\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 QRev is an Open Source AI First alternative to Salesforce.
