To\nhelp minimize this problem, researchers from Japan have developed a novel\ncooperative strategy for connecting to wireless networks using game theory. By\nprompting users to move to optimal positions, the proposed technique achieves\nimprovements in total throughput than other methods, which could be useful in\nlow-traffic environments like libraries and classrooms.\n\nTitle: Inherent limitations of WLAN networks and potential strategies to\nminimize their impact Caption: When new users join an access point (AP), their\nposition, individual throughput, and inteference can impact the performance of\nthe entire network. In this study, the researchers developed an AP connection\nstrategy based on user cooperation, where users are prompted to change their\nlocation to improve the overall performance of the system.

With the immense rise in the number of laptops, tablets, and\nsmartphones, most people nowadays expect to have access to free Wi-Fi in a\nvariety of public and private spaces. Some common examples include airports,\nrestaurants, and libraries, but even parks, trains, and subways offer Wi-Fi in\nsome cities. However, most wireless environments are based on the IEEE802.11\nWLAN standards. Though undoubtedly an amazing feat of engineering, these\nstandards suffer from inherent problems that can lower their performance for\nall users in a network. For example, if a slow user joins a wireless local-\narea network (WLAN), their slow transmission rate can affect the throughput\nrate of other users, since users share the communication channels of the\naccess point (AP, or \u2018router\u2019) by taking turns to use them. Moreover, users\ncan also interfere with each other when attempting to communicate with the AP,\nnegatively impacting each other\u2019s performance.\n\nScientists have come up with a few strategies to try to minimize the effects\nof these problems and improve the overall throughput of APs. Some of these\nmethods are cooperative, meaning that users can be prompted by the AP to\nchange their position in order to improve system throughput. Though this is\nindeed a promising strategy, many existing techniques fail to simultaneously\nconsider the interference between users and each user\u2019s transmission rate. In\nturn, other techniques fail to account for the possibility that some users may\nbe fixed, whereas others can move.\n\nTo address these limitations, a research team including Associate Professor\nSumiko Miyata from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT) has developed a\nnovel AP connection method using game theory. Their latest paper, which was\nauthored by Yu Kato from SIT and co-authored by Jiquan Xie and Tutomu Murase\nfrom Nagoya University, was published in IEEE Open Journal of the\nCommunications Society on March 21^st, 2024.\n\nGame theory is a branch of mathematics that mainly deals with the analysis of\ndecisions and decision-making, especially within clearly defined frameworks\n(\u2018games\u2019) with rules, possible actions, and agents. Usually, the goal in game\ntheory analysis is to identify optimal strategies. \u201cFor wireless communication\nenvironments where multiple users exist and must be considered, game theory is\none of the most suitable theories to use for analysis,\u201d explains Dr. Miyata.\n\u201cIn the approach proposed in our paper, the user position that maximizes\nsystem throughput is determined using what\u2019s known as a \u2018potential game,\u2019\nwhich is a type of model in game theory.\u201d\n\nThe developed potential game model, whose objective function is to maximize\nsystem throughput, condenses the incentives for all users into a single\nfunction. In this way, and unlike previous methods, the impact of the position\nof new users joining a WLAN on existing users is considered. Moreover, the new\napproach also takes into account inter-user interference by calculating the\nprobabilities of packet collisions.\n\nThe researchers tested their proposed AP connection strategy, which was\ndirectly based on their potential game model, by comparing it with previous AP\nconnection methods. They analyzed the resulting AP throughput for each method\nin a wide variety of scenarios involving different user positions. In this\nway, they proved that their proposed strategy almost always resulted in a\nthroughput improvement compared to other techniques, with the improvement in\nsystem performance reaching up to 6% in some cases.\n\nAlthough having a router prompt existing or new users to move around is not\nfeasible in every situation, the proposed strategy could find a home in\ncertain environments. \u201cOur method could be a potential option for Wi-Fi\nservices in classrooms and libraries due to their location-free\ncharacteristics and low human traffic,\u201d explains Dr. Miyata. \u201cThe Wi-Fi system\nwould calculate the optimal user positions based on their locations to enhance\noverall throughput and encourage them to take cooperative action, motivated by\na desire to increase their own throughput as well.\u201d\n\nOverall, methods like the one developed in this study are significant, given\nthe innumerable number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices present today. \u201cAP system\nshould be efficient regarding the use of their network resources. The proposed\ntechnique is an important technology for realizing smart cities, where\neverything is connected to the internet,\u201d concludes Dr. Miyata.\n\n### Reference\n\nTitle of original paper:| AP Connection Method for Maximizing Throughput\nConsidering Moving User and Degree of Interference Based on Potential Game  \n---|---  \nJournal:| IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society  \nArticle link:| 10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3380515  \n  \n### Authors\n\nAbout Associate Professor Sumiko Miyata from SIT, Japan\n\nSumiko Miyata received her B.E. from Shibaura Institute of Technology in 2007,\nand M.E. and D.E. degrees from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2009 and 2012,\nrespectively.
