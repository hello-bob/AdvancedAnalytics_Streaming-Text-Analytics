The strongest factor\nfrom a factor analysis explained 65% of variation, and was strongly linked (b\n= 0.76) to Welzel\u2019s \u201cemancipative vs. obedient\u201d [EO] dimension (\u201crestrict the\nfreedom of the individual from the group\u201d), and less so (b = 0.26) to Welzel\u2019s\n\u201csacred vs. secular\u201d [SS] dimension. The value divergence rate correlated with\nEO, but not SS.\n\n> The 7 items with the highest divergence scores each have high loadings on\n> the EO dimension. These values were (1) justifiability of homosexuality, (2)\n> justifiability of euthanasia, (3) importance of obedience of children, (4)\n> justifiability of divorce, (5) justifiability of prostitution, (6)\n> justifiability of suicide, and (7) justifiability of abortion. ... Value\n> variation across countries increased 141% for justifiability of\n> homosexuality, 94% for justifiability of prostitution, 61% for\n> justifiability of euthanasia, and 42% for importance of childhood obedience.\n>\n> Values emphasizing tolerance and self-expression have diverged most sharply,\n> especially between high-income Western countries and the rest of the world.\n> ...

Countries with more similar religious profiles have\n> more similar values.\n\nSo, bottom line, over the last 40 years, rich Western nations have changed\nlots on, moved away from the static Asia and Africa on, and became more\ninternally homogenous on, individualist values like homosexuality,\nprostitution, euthanasia, and childhood obedience (and divorce and abortion).\nThe most extreme leaders of this trend are Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and\nNetherlands.\n\nThis seems mildly good news for value diversity and drift. While rich Western\nnations have made big value changes, the rest of the world isn\u2019t following\nthem. Alas this difference doesn\u2019t seem to be much related to fertility, and\nworld elites are probably much closer to the rich Western trend; non-elites\ntend to eventually follow the lead of elites. And this new diversity still\nseems way too low, especially given how weak is cultural selection now.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n24 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n24\n\nShare this post\n\n#### World Value Drift\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nDanny mApr 19incredibly interesting.Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nSarah BaconApr 19Fascinating share, thank you so much.
