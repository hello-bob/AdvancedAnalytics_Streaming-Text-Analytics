Tesla shortened production\nshifts at Gigafactory Texas and cleared out several teams associated with\ncritical projects there.\n\nOne of those heads was Drew Baglino, former VP of Powertrain and Energy\nEngineering, who had been with the company for 18 years and led the 4680 cell\nproject. While his resignation is being publicly portrayed as voluntary, it is\nspeculated that disappointment with progress on the 4680 project had something\nto do with it.\n\nTesla also lost key executive Rohan Patel, its head of policy and business\ndevelopment, during these layoffs.\n\nAnd as we learned last week, the company also fired its entire new ad team.\n\nBut when we originally heard about Tesla\u2019s upcoming layoffs, the rumors we\nheard suggested that the numbers could involve up to 20% of the company\u2019s\nworkforce. We had seen other signals that layoffs might be coming, but the\nspecific tip came from an anonymous source within Tesla who was correct about\nthe layoff\u2019s timing, though not correct about its scale.\n\nNow, more layoffs have been finalized through an email from CEO Elon Musk to\nexecutives, first reported by The Information, stating that 6-year veteran\nRebecca Tinucci, Tesla\u2019s Senior Director of EV charging, would be leaving the\ncompany on Tuesday, along with nearly all of her 500-person charging team (\u201ca\nfew\u201d employees will be reassigned to other teams, according to The\nInformation).\n\nTinucci was responsible for Tesla\u2019s EV charging business, including\nSupercharging, which means that the cutting of the Supercharger team may\nreflect a change in direction for Tesla. Tesla has been very successful at\ngetting manufacturers to adopt its NACS plug \u2013 an effort led by Tinucci, which\ngot her onto the TIME 100 Climate list \u2013 leading many to suggest that it will\nbe able to run a profitable energy delivery business for a long time to come\n(here\u2019s her presentation from Investor Day 2023).\n\nThe email states that Tesla will continue to build out some new Superchargers,\nand will finish those under construction. But relieving the team of its duty\nmay signal a reduction in buildout of the system \u2013 at a time when, if\nanything, faster charging station deployment is needed.\n\nAnother executive layoff is 10-year veteran Daniel Ho, Director of Vehicle\nPrograms and New Product Initiatives, who was program manager for the Model S,\n3 and Y and had previously served 12 years at Ford in product roles.\n\nIn recent quarters, Tesla has guided for a \u201cpause\u201d inbetween growth phases,\nexpecting that sales growth would be more modest until the release of next-gen\nvehicles like the cheaper \u201cModel 2\u201d and robotaxi products. There has been some\nback\u2013and\u2013forth over what form those products would take \u2013 but laying off the\nhead of New Product Initiatives reflects potential problems within that team\nas well.\n\nFurther, most of former executive Rohan Patel\u2019s public policy team will be\neliminated \u2013 at a time when many public policy challenges around DC charging,\nhome charging, emissions standards, climate change, and political hostility to\nsuperior EV technology are still looming.\n\nMusk said, in his typical bluster, that he wants Tesla to be \u201cabsolutely hard\ncore\u201d about headcount reduction, saying that executives whose subordinates\n\u201cdon\u2019t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test\u201d would\nfind themselves relieved of duty as well \u2013 suggesting that he wants those\nexecutives to fire more employees or be fired themselves.\n\nAll of this news comes at a critical time for Tesla, following a quarterly\nearnings miss in which Tesla significantly missed delivery and earnings\nestimates, and had a rare year-over-year reduction in sales\n\nTesla\u2019s layoffs come at a time when many other companies in the tech industry\nare laying off staff, in an apparent game of follow-the-leader while industry\nprofits are still high.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\nFirstly \u2013 it makes absolutely no sense to lay off the Supercharger team.\nSupercharging is an incredible opportunity for Tesla, especially now that\neveryone else has adopted NACS.\n\nTesla has a fairly simple business case from here on out to become the leading\n\u201cgas station of the future.\u201d With its experience and lead on Superchargers,\nits more reliable and better-designed stations, and its existing business\nfootprint with so many stations installed around the globe, the company has a\nnatural lead. This business case is even stronger now that the entire industry\nis behind NACS.\n\nTo lay off that whole team just when the company has earned such a big win,\nwhen billions in public money is available for buildout (which would not have\nbeen available without industry NACS adoption, which was, again, spearheaded\nby Tinucci\u2019s negotiations), and when there is a lead to be maintained, is\nabsolutely crazy. This move, alone, would erode any confidence I had left in\nTesla\u2019s CEO \u2013 if I still had any.\n\n## Top comment by FC\n\nLiked by 8 people\n\nThis is going to be a disaster if they stop expanding the Supercharger\nnetwork. So many supercharger locations are already operating at or near\nmaximum capacity. Even a temporary shutdown of permitting and planning will\nhave long term effects on future site plans. Elon has got to go.\n\nView all comments\n\nOn layoffs in general, we noted in our coverage of Tesla\u2019s layoffs that the\nworst part about situations like this is that they greatly affect morale. We\nimagine morale can\u2019t be great within Tesla right now after huge layoffs, but\nthere can at least be a sense of relief that they\u2019re over after a large round\nof layoffs closes.\n\nBut if Tesla is still doing layoffs, that sense of relief is gone, and\nemployees will still be wondering whether they might show up to work without a\njob, as we heard happened to many employees on the first day of layoffs.\n\nAnd while the last layoffs were distasteful enough, continued layoffs have\neven worse optics, given Tesla\u2019s move to ask shareholders for a $55 billion\npayout for its CEO just days after firing 14,000 people. That $55 billion\ncould pay for 40 years worth of six-figure salaries for those employees. Quite\na large payday for a part-time CEO, made worse by the potential loss of\nlivelihood for more employees who might still be on the chopping block.\n\nSpeculatively, there may even be more layoffs coming. A source who was correct\nabout coming layoffs but not exactly correct about their scale or timing told\nus that potentially another 5% of staff could be laid off, including\nexecutives and long-time employees dating back to the Roadster days. These\nlayoffs seem close to that rumor (though, again, on a smaller scale), but it\u2019s\npossible that there may be more coming.
