The aphorism\nacknowledges that statistical models always fall short of the complexities of\nreality but can still be useful nonetheless. The aphorism originally referred\njust to statistical models, but it is now sometimes used for scientific models\nin general.^[1]\n\nThe aphorism is generally attributed to George E. P. Box, a British\nstatistician, although the underlying concept predates Box's writings.\n\n## Quotations of George Box[edit]\n\nGeorge Box\n\nThe first record of Box saying \"all models are wrong\" is in a 1976 paper\npublished in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.^[2] The 1976\npaper contains the aphorism twice. The two sections of the paper that contain\nthe aphorism state:\n\n> 2.3 Parsimony Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a\n> \"correct\" one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of\n> Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as\n> the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the\n> great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the\n> mark of mediocrity. 2.4 Worrying Selectively Since all models are wrong the\n> scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to\n> be concerned about safety from mice when there are tigers abroad.\n\nBox repeated the aphorism in a paper that was published in the proceedings of\na 1978 statistics workshop.^[3] The paper contains a section entitled \"All\nmodels are wrong but some are useful\". The section states (p 202-3):\n\n> Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world\n> could be exactly represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen\n> parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations. For\n> example, the law PV = nRT relating pressure P, volume V and temperature T of\n> an \"ideal\" gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it\n> frequently provides a useful approximation and furthermore its structure is\n> informative since it springs from a physical view of the behavior of gas\n> molecules. For such a model there is no need to ask the question \"Is the\n> model true?\". If \"truth\" is to be the \"whole truth\" the answer must be \"No\".\n> The only question of interest is \"Is the model illuminating and useful?\".\n\nBox repeated the aphorism twice more in his 1987 book, Empirical Model-\nBuilding and Response Surfaces (which was co-authored with Norman Draper).^[4]\nThe first repetition is on p. 74: \"Remember that all models are wrong; the\npractical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.\" The\nsecond repetition is on p. 424, which is excerpted below.\n\n> ... all models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but\n> some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always be\n> borne in mind....\n\nA second edition of the book was published in 2007, under the title Response\nSurfaces, Mixtures, and Ridge Analyses. The second edition also repeats the\naphorism twice, in contexts identical with those of the first edition (on p.\n63 and p. 414).^[5]\n\nBox repeated the aphorism two more times in his 1997 book, Statistical\nControl: By Monitoring and Feedback Adjustment (which was co-authored with\nAlberto Luce\u00f1o).^[6] The first repetition is on p. 6, which is excerpted\nbelow.\n\n> It has been said that \"all models are wrong but some models are useful.\" In\n> other words, any model is at best a useful fiction\u2014there never was, or ever\n> will be, an exactly normal distribution or an exact linear relationship.\n> Nevertheless, enormous progress has been made by entertaining such fictions\n> and using them as approximations.\n\nThe second repetition is on p. 9: \"So since all models are wrong, it is very\nimportant to know what to worry about; or, to put it in another way, what\nmodels are likely to produce procedures that work in practice (where exact\nassumptions are never true)\".\n\nA second edition of the book was published in 2009, under the title\nStatistical Control By Monitoring and Adjustment (co-authored with Alberto\nLuce\u00f1o and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Paniagua-Qui\u00f1ones). The second edition also\nrepeats the aphorism two times.^[7] The first repetition is on p. 61, which is\nexcerpted below.\n\n> All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly\n> stated, are never exactly true. All models are wrong, but some models are\n> useful. So the question you need to ask is not \"Is the model true?\" (it\n> never is) but \"Is the model good enough for this particular application?\"\n\nThe second repetition is on p. 63; its context is essentially the same as that\nof the second repetition in the first edition.\n\nBox's widely cited book Statistics for Experimenters (co-authored with William\nHunter) does not include the aphorism in its first edition (published in\n1978).^[8] The second edition (published in 2005; co-authored with William\nHunter and J. Stuart Hunter) includes the aphorism three times: on p. 208, p.\n384, and p. 440.^[9] On p. 440, the relevant sentence is this: \"The most that\ncan be expected from any model is that it can supply a useful approximation to\nreality: All models are wrong; some models are useful\".\n\nIn addition to stating the aphorism verbatim, Box sometimes stated the essence\nof the aphorism with different words. One example is from 1978, while Box was\nPresident of the American Statistical Association. At the annual meeting of\nthe Association, Box delivered his Presidential Address, wherein he stated\nthis: \"Models, of course, are never true, but fortunately it is only necessary\nthat they be useful\".^[10]\n\n## Discussions[edit]\n\nThere have been varied discussions about the aphorism. A selection from those\ndiscussions is presented below.\n\nIn 1983, the statisticians Peter McCullagh and John Nelder published their\nmuch-cited book on generalized linear models. The book includes a brief\ndiscussion of the aphorism (though without citing Box).^[11] A second edition\nof the book, published in 1989, contains a very similar discussion of the\naphorism.^[12] The discussion from the first edition is as follows.\n\n> Modelling in science remains, partly at least, an art. Some principles do\n> exist, however, to guide the modeller. The first is that all models are\n> wrong; some, though, are better than others and we can search for the better\n> ones. At the same time we must recognize that eternal truth is not within\n> our grasp.\n\nIn 1995, the statistician David Cox commented as follows.^[13]\n\n> ... it does not seem helpful just to say that all models are wrong. The very\n> word model implies simplification and idealization. The idea that complex\n> physical, biological or sociological systems can be exactly described by a\n> few formulae is patently absurd. The construction of idealized\n> representations that capture important stable aspects of such systems is,\n> however, a vital part of general scientific analysis and statistical models,\n> especially substantive ones, do not seem essentially different from other\n> kinds of model.\n\nIn 1996, an Applied Statistician's Creed was proposed by M.R.Nester.^[14] The\ncreed includes, in its core part, the aphorism.\n\nIn 2002, K. P. Burnham and D. R. Anderson published their much-cited book on\nstatistical model selection. The book states the following.^[15]\n\n> A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not\n> reflect all of reality. ... Box noted that \"all models are wrong, but some\n> are useful.\" While a model can never be \"truth,\" a model might be ranked\n> from very useful, to useful, to somewhat useful to, finally, essentially\n> useless.\n\nThe statistician J. Michael Steele has commented on the aphorism as\nfollows.^[16]\n\n> ... there are wonderful models \u2014 like city maps....\n>\n> If I say that a map is wrong, it means that a building is misnamed, or the\n> direction of a one-way street is mislabeled. I never expected my map to\n> recreate all of physical reality, and I only feel ripped off if my map does\n> not correctly answer the questions that it claims to answer.\n>\n> My maps of Philadelphia are useful. Moreover, except for a few that are out-\n> of-date, they are not wrong.\n>\n> So, you say, \"Yes, a map can be thought of as a model, but surely it would\n> be more precise to say that a map is a 'visually enhanced database.' Such\n> databases can be correct. These are not the kinds of models that Box had in\n> mind.\"\n>\n> I agree. ...\n\nIn 2008, the statistician Andrew Gelman responded to that, saying in\nparticular the following.^[17]\n\n> I take his general point, which is that a street map could be exactly\n> correct, to the resolution of the map.\n>\n> ... The saying, \"all models are wrong,\" is helpful because it is not\n> completely obvious....\n>\n> This is a simple point, and I can see how Steele can be irritated by people\n> making a big point about it. But, the trouble is, many people don't realize\n> that all models are wrong.\n\nIn 2013, the philosopher of science Peter Truran published an essay related to\nthe aphorism.^[18] The essay notes, in particular, the following.\n\n> ... seemingly incompatible models may be used to make predictions about the\n> same phenomenon. ... For each model we may believe that its predictive power\n> is an indication of its being at least approximately true. But if both\n> models are successful in making predictions, and yet mutually inconsistent,\n> how can they both be true? Let us consider a simple illustration. Two\n> observers are looking at a physical object. One may report seeing a circular\n> disc, and the other may report seeing a rectangle. Both will be correct, but\n> one will be looking at the object (a cylindrical can) from above and the\n> other will be observing from the side. The two models represent different\n> aspects of the same reality.\n\nTruran's essay further notes that Newton's theory of gravitation has been\nsupplanted by Einstein's theory of relativity and yet Newton's theory remains\ngenerally \"empirically adequate\". Indeed, Newton's theory generally has\nexcellent predictive power. Yet Newton's theory is not an approximation of\nEinstein's theory. For illustration, consider an apple falling down from a\ntree. Under Newton's theory, the apple falls because Earth exerts a force on\nthe apple\u2014what is called \"the force of gravity\". Under Einstein's theory,\nEarth does not exert any force on the apple.^[19] Hence, Newton's theory might\nbe regarded as being, in some sense, completely wrong but extremely useful.\n(The usefulness of Newton's theory comes partly from being vastly simpler,\nboth mathematically and computationally, than Einstein's theory.)\n\nIn 2014, the statistician David Hand made the following statement.^[20]\n\n> In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the\n> aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an\n> action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the\n> real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the\n> reality\u2014a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that \"all\n> models are wrong, but some are useful\".\n\nIn 2016, P. J. Bickel and K. A. Doksum published the second volume of their\nbook on mathematical statistics. The volume includes the quote from Box's\nPresidential Address, given above. It states that the quote is the best\nformulation of the \"guiding principle of modern statistics\".^[21]\n\n## Historical antecedents[edit]\n\nAlthough the aphorism seems to have originated with George Box, the underlying\nconcept goes back decades, perhaps centuries. Some exemplifications of that\nare given below.\n\nIn 1960, Georg Rasch said the following.\n\n> ... no models are [true]\u2014not even the Newtonian laws. When you construct a\n> model you leave out all the details which you, with the knowledge at your\n> disposal, consider inessential.... Models should not be true, but it is\n> important that they are applicable, and whether they are applicable for any\n> given purpose must of course be investigated. This also means that a model\n> is never accepted finally, only on trial.\n>\n> \u2014 Rasch, G. (1960), Probabilistic Models for Some Intelligence and\n> Attainment Tests, Copenhagen: Danmarks Paedagogiske Institut, pp. 37\u201338;\n> republished in 1980 by University of Chicago Press\n\nIn 1947, the mathematician John von Neumann said that \"truth ... is much too\ncomplicated to allow anything but approximations\".^[22]\n\nIn 1942, the French philosopher-poet Paul Val\u00e9ry said the following.^[23]\n\nCe qui est simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l'est pas est inutilisable.|\nWhat is simple is always wrong. What is not is unusable.^[24]  \n---|---  \n\u2014Val\u00e9ry, Paul (1942), Mauvaises pens\u00e9es et autres, Paris: \u00c9ditions Gallimard  \n  \nIn 1939, the founder of statistical process control, Walter Shewhart, said the\nfollowing.^[25]\n\n> ... no model can ever be theoretically attainable that will completely and\n> uniquely characterize the indefinitely expansible concept of a state of\n> statistical control. What is perhaps even more important, on the basis of a\n> finite portion of the sequence [X_1, X_2, X_3, ...]\u2014and we can never have\n> more than a finite portion\u2014we can not reasonably hope to construct a model\n> that will represent exactly any specific characteristic of a particular\n> state of control even though such a state actually exists. Here the\n> situation is much like that in physical science where we find a model of a\n> molecule; any model is always an incomplete though useful picture of the\n> conceived physical thing called a molecule.\n>\n> \u2014 Shewhart, W. A. (1939), Statistical Method From the Viewpoint of Quality\n> Control, U.S. Department of Agriculture, p. 19\n\nIn 1923, a related idea was articulated by the artist Pablo Picasso.\n\n> We all know that art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,\n> at least the truth that is given us to understand. The artist must know the\n> manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.\n>\n> \u2014 Picasso, Pablo (1923), \"Picasso speaks\", The Arts, 3: 315\u2013326;^[26]\n> reprinted in Barr, Alfred H.
