This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness\nwill reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it\u2019s not too early to ask\nwhy, and what we need to do about it.\n\nMany of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on\none government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed\u2014no\nWestern country, or state, or city was prepared\u2014and despite hard work and\noften extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the\nproblem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.\n\nPart of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the\nother part of the problem is what we didn\u2019t *do* in advance, and what we\u2019re\nfailing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our\nwidespread inability to *build*.\n\n### Want more a16z?\n\n#### Thanks for signing up.\n\nMANAGE MY SUBSCRIPTIONS By clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWe see this today with the things we urgently need but don\u2019t have. We don\u2019t\nhave enough coronavirus tests, or test materials\u2014including, amazingly, cotton\nswabs and common reagents. We don\u2019t have enough ventilators, negative pressure\nrooms, and ICU beds. And we don\u2019t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and\nmedical gowns\u2014as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for\nrain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America!\n\nWe also don\u2019t have therapies or a vaccine\u2014despite, again, years of advance\nwarning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists will hopefully invent\ntherapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the manufacturing factories\nrequired to scale their production. And even then, we\u2019ll see if we can deploy\ntherapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter\u2014it took scientists 5 years to get\nregulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge\u2019s\n2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.\n\nIn the U.S., we don\u2019t even have the ability to get federal bailout money to\nthe people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers\nand their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious\ntrouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money\nwithout potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from\nall its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to\ndistribute money to us when it\u2019s needed most.\n\nWhy do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits\ninvolve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are\nhard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these\nthings but we chose not to\u2014specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms,\nthe factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*.\n\nYou don\u2019t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status\nquo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare\ngenerally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout\nAmerican life.\n\nYou see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u2019t build\nnearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential\u2014which\nresults in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco,\nmaking it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of\nthe future. We also can\u2019t build the cities themselves anymore. When the\nproducers of HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d wanted to portray the American city of the\nfuture, they didn\u2019t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin\u2014they went to\nSingapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living\nenvironments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now;\nwhere are they?\n\nYou see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the\ncapacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year\nolds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world\neach year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u2019t that the most important\nthing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities,\nor scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education\nwas Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u2019ve been doing education\nresearch that\u2019s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not\nbuild a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-\nto-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard\ndeviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven\u2019t we\nbuilt systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically\nimprove student success?\n\nYou see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American\nmanufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing\nbeen offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build\nhighly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs\nwe would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know\u2014and\nwe\u2019re experiencing right now!\u2014the strategic problem of relying on offshore\nmanufacturing of key goods. Why aren\u2019t we building Elon Musk\u2019s \u201calien\ndreadnoughts\u201d\u2014giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every\nconceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest\npossible cost\u2014all throughout our country?\n\nYou see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the\nmillions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring\nmonorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?\n\nIs the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to\nwage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks,\nairlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion\ncoronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I\u2019m with\nNicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we\ndon\u2019t know\u2014all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be\nprime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor\nand the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly\nnot, or we wouldn\u2019t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals,\ncars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.\n\nThe problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia.\nWe need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The\nproblem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these\nthings, even if incumbents don\u2019t like it, even if only to force the incumbents\nto build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things.\n\nAnd we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and\npolitics. Both sides need to contribute to building.\n\nThe right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right\nis generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold\nback market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight\nhard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-\ninducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-\nfriendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly)\ninnovation.\n\nIt\u2019s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support\nfrom the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries,\nin new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.\n\nThe left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of\nthese areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the\npublic sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better\ntransportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old,\nthe entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future.\nMilton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies\nand programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking\nthat as an insult, take it as a challenge\u2014build new things and show the\nresults!\n\nShow that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and\neffective\u2014how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes\nalong, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with\npublic funding; why can\u2019t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard?\nWhy shouldn\u2019t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the\nclimate crisis by building\u2014energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical\npower generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-\nemission nuclear reactors, so let\u2019s build those. Maybe we can start with 10\nnew reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?\n\nIn fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we\nbuild in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The\nthings we don\u2019t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price.\nWhat\u2019s the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a\nfamily you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price\ncurves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every\nAmerican can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.\n\nBuilding isn\u2019t easy, or we\u2019d already be doing all this. We need to demand more\nof our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We\nneed to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more\nfrom one another. We\u2019re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.\n\nEvery step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the\nquestion, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping\nother people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of\npeople who are building? If the work you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t either leading to\nsomething being built or taking care of people directly, we\u2019ve failed you, and\nwe need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can\ncontribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most\nbroken systems\u2014we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we\nhave, and on building the answers to those problems.\n\nI expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u2019s a modest proposal to\nmy critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own!\nWhat do you think we should build? There\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll agree with\nyou.\n\nOur nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our\nforefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then\nthe computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other\nthings that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our\nlives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their\nlegacy and to create the future we want for our own children and\ngrandchildren, and that\u2019s to build.\n\n##### audio version:\n\n### Want more a16z?\n\nSign up to get the best of a16z content, news, and investments.\n\n###### Thanks for signing up for the a16z newsletter.\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome note.\n\nMANAGE MY SUBSCRIPTIONS By clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nContributor\n\n  * Marc Andreessen is a Cofounder and General Partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n    * Follow\n    * X\n\nMore From this Contributor\n\n  * Game On: Marc Andreessen & Andrew Chen Talk Creative Computers Marc Andreessen and Andrew Chen\n  * Money, power, politics, and the internet\u2019s next battleground Ben Horowitz, Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, and Robert Hackett\n  * Fixing Higher Education & New Startup Opportunities with Marc and Ben Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz\n  * Crisis in Higher Ed & Why Universities Still Matter with Marc & Ben Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz\n  * The Future of Longevity with Tony Robbins Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, and Tony Robbins\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management,\nL.L.C.
