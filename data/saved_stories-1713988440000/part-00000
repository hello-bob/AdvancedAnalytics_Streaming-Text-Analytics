I noticed my daughter thought it\nwas really cool, so that's where the seed for the idea came from.\n\nThen it was just a case of asking what product was the best fit for AI\ngenerated poems - I settled with online greeting cards.\n\nAnd so, Greetio was born \ud83d\ude42\n\nIs there a maximum gift collection amount for a single card?\n\nYes, the maximum is \u00a3500.\n\nDon't think that's enough? Please feel free to get in touch at\nsupport@greetio.co to see what we can do for you.\n\nCan I get a refund?\n\nWe do not offer refunds for cards - all purchases are final. If you are\nexperiencing a problem with the service, or feel its missing a feature, please\nfeel free to get in touch at support@greetio.co\n\nFor gift contributions, as long as the gift collection has not been claimed,\nyou can request a refund of the gift amount (excluding admin fee) by\ncontacting us at support@greetio.co\n\nWill the card always be accessible once sent?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nThe card will exist as long as Greetio exists. If you feel this is too long,\nyou are welcome to get in touch at support@greetio.co to request that the card\nbe deleted.\n\nCan I get a physical card?\n\nI'm afraid not - we offer digital cards that are only available online.\n\nHowever, you do have the option to export a GIF version of a card - simply\nclick the Export GIF button.\n\nHow long does it take for a recipient to receive their gift?\n\nIn short, about 5 working days.\n\nThere are various factors that influence the gift claim process, like waiting\nfor payments to clear, fraud checks etc.\n\nIf you haven't received your gift claim 10 working days after attempting to\nclaim it, please get in touch at support@greetio.co and we will look into this\nfurther for you.\n\nCan I get a discount please?\n\nIf you don't ask, you don't get!\n\nAnd seeing as you asked so nicely, you can use the promo code FAQ10 to get 10%\noff (1 time use).
