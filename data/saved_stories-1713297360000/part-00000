Without seriously\nquestioning whether such a system can and should be built, researchers are\nworking to create \u201csafe AGI\u201d that is \u201cbeneficial for all of humanity.\u201d We\nargue that, unlike systems with specific applications which can be evaluated\nfollowing standard engineering principles, undefined systems like \u201cAGI\u201d cannot\nbe appropriately tested for safety. Why, then, is building AGI often framed as\nan unquestioned goal in the field of AI? In this paper, we argue that the\nnormative framework that motivates much of this goal is rooted in the Anglo-\nAmerican eugenics tradition of the twentieth century. As a result, many of the\nvery same discriminatory attitudes that animated eugenicists in the past\n(e.g., racism, xenophobia, classism, ableism, and sexism) remain widespread\nwithin the movement to build AGI, resulting in systems that harm marginalized\ngroups and centralize power, while using the language of \u201csafety\u201d and\n\u201cbenefiting humanity\u201d to evade accountability. We conclude by urging\nresearchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety\nprotocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system\nsuch as AGI.\n\n## Downloads\n\n  * HTML\n  * PDF\n\n## Published\n\n2024-04-14\n\n## How to Cite\n\nGebru, T., & Torres, \u00c9mile P.
