Click anywhere on the Northern hemisphere\nand that point will become the central point on the left. Or, click anywhere\non the Southern hemisphere and that point will become the central point on the\nright. Click on the Spin/Pause to start a dynamic rotation of the two disks.\nIf you want to click on a different location, click Reset to start over.\n\nNote: What is shown here are the two sides of a flat disk. To make the disk,\njust set the backgound to \"light\", print this page, fold the paper so that the\ndisk are front/back to each other, tape them, and then cut out the disk.\n\nClick here for a higher-resolution version.\n\nClick here for a rectangular projection.\n\nClick here for a printable pdf file version of the map.\n\nThe paper describing the projection is posted here:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08176v1.pdf Here's an article in the NY Times\ndescribing the map: New World Map And, here's a Scientific American article\nabout the map: The Most Accurate Flat Map Of Earth Yet\n\n", "frontpage": true}
