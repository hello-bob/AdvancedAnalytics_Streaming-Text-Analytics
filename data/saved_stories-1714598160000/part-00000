We\u2019re going to see the real basic\ninfrastructure of the city, things like libraries, closed and sold off, and\nwhen they\u2019re gone they can\u2019t be replicated. I\u2019m seeing the heart ripped out of\nmy city.\u201d\n\nBirmingham city council, the largest local authority in the country,\nrepresenting over 1 million people, issued a section 114 notice effectively\ndeclaring bankruptcy in September, citing an equal pay liability of about\n\u00a3760m and a \u00a3100m bill to fix a failed IT system upgrade.\n\nThis led councillors to pass the biggest local authority budget cuts in\nhistory last month, as well as a 21% council tax rise over two years. Now\nquestions are being asked about the basis on which these cuts were made.\n\nMax Caller, the chief commissioner drafted in by the government to get the\ncouncil back on track, told one meeting that the current equal pay figure\nwould eventually be replaced by a \u201creal number\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s the only time it\nis worth worrying about\u201d.\n\nFred Grindrod, a Labour councillor and chair of the council\u2019s audit committee,\nsaid \u201cserious questions\u201d remained about the figure and the assertion that it\nmay not be real was a \u201cmind-boggling situation to be in\u201d.\n\nExternal auditors are in the process of verifying the equal pay figure, but\nhave yet to report back on their findings. Union sources, who are fighting for\nequal pay for female council employees, also said they had no idea where the\n\u00a3760m liability figure had come from or how it had been calculated. It could\nbe underestimated or overestimated, they said.\n\nJames Brackley, a lecturer in accounting at the University of Sheffield, has\nspent months studying council documents and audit reports to piece together\nthe trail that led to Birmingham\u2019s financial meltdown.\n\nHis work, through the university\u2019s Audit Reform Lab, found that the failed\nOracle IT system was by far the council\u2019s biggest financial problem, and its\nbudget deficits \u201chave little to do with the equal pay issue\u201d.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there\u2019s no logical reason to trigger a section 114 bankruptcy over\na number that\u2019s so speculative, and relates to liability so far in the future.\nIt\u2019s a very odd thing to do,\u201d said Brackley. \u201c[The \u00a3760m figure] has still not\nbeen audited, and we still don\u2019t have any disclosure as to how it\u2019s been\ncalculated.\u201d\n\nReports from external auditors leading up to March 2023, three months before\nthe \u00a3760m liability was announced, raised no serious concerns about the\ncouncil\u2019s management of the situation.\n\nBrackley said his research suggested service cuts and asset sales were being\nmade too quickly, and with little guarantee they would provide good value for\nmoney in the long run.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt has created chaos because they\u2019re just cutting stuff and they\nhaven\u2019t done the value for money assessments so they don\u2019t know where that\nleaves them.\u201d\n\nStaff have also raised alarm at the extent of the council\u2019s IT meltdown\nfollowing the installation of a new Oracle system \u2013 the council\u2019s first major\nIT upgrade since 1999 \u2013 that led the council to lose control of its financial\nreporting system.\n\nCouncillors said issues arose after staff tried to amend and customise the\nOracle system to fit the council\u2019s older processes, rather than installing the\nsystem as it comes.\n\nTilsley said: \u201cIt is so bad that if I was to ask our director of finance: \u2018How\nmuch money have we got in the bank today?\u2019 nobody would be able to tell me.\nWe\u2019ve lost complete control over the financial management.\u201d\n\nHe added that while the council had been \u201cbadly served by a number of senior\nofficers\u201d, he was not \u201cletting the Labour administration off the hook\u201d for\nlosing control of the situation.\n\nOne whistleblower in the council\u2019s IT department said that when the new system\nwas first launched in 2022, \u201cnothing was working apart from payroll\u201d and the\ncouncil was unable to track its income and expenditure.\n\nFor about seven months, the council was also unable to collect council tax and\nbusiness rates debt as the system could not show who had and hadn\u2019t paid, they\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThere was no financial reporting. How did we know what was in the budgets,\nwhat cash had been collected, what cash had been spent? We couldn\u2019t,\u201d the\nwhistleblower said.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019ve received income for 30,000 things, and you\u2019re trying to work\nout who the hell gave it to you and who you spent it with. That\u2019s what we\u2019re\ntalking about.\u201d\n\nThey said that although the system had improved, there was still unidentified\nrevenue and issues with the book-keeping process.\n\n\u201cYou need to know all that information to set a budget. So do I believe that\nthis budget they\u2019ve set is correct? Well, they don\u2019t even know the equal pay\nliability. So I\u2019m not sure,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cOracle has cost \u00a3110m and its still not functioning. I think we\u2019re still at\nleast two years away from getting this completely sorted. To be honest, I\nbelieve the equal pay stuff is really covering up this Oracle mess.\u201d\n\nGrindrod said the issues with the IT system \u201cbeggar belief\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not a stable place for any organisation to be in, and is absolutely\nnot a position that a council that provides essential services to 1.2 million\nresidents, underpins communities over 102 square miles, and is the underlying\nnetwork of the second biggest city in the country, should be in,\u201d he said.\n\nInternal inquiries are ongoing to establish what went wrong at the council,\nand the leader, John Cotton, has called for a public inquiry.\n\nA spokesperson for Birmingham city council said: \u201cIn early 2023, there were a\nvariety of estimates of equal pay liability, which were wide-ranging and\nclearly needed further work. Further detailed analysis was requested and\nsubsequently the findings were shared with the public and all members of this\ncouncil.\n\n\u201cSince then the council has worked tirelessly with trade unions and the\ncommissioners to agree a job evaluation scheme that will help to end the equal\npay liability once and for all.\n\n\u201cA budget for the next two years was approved by full council in March. We\nmust now focus on how we spend what we have in the most effective way, and we\nare committed to getting the basics right across a whole range of service\nareas.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the department for levelling up, housing and communities\nsaid: \u201cBirmingham city council faces this financial situation following its\nfailure to get a grip of the significant issues it faces and years of severe\nmismanagement. This is why commissioners were appointed in October 2023 to\nprotect residents and taxpayers in the city.\n\n\u201cCommissioners have the Secretary of State\u2019s full support in taking whatever\nsteps are necessary to drive forward the required improvements\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Birmingham\n  * Local government\n  * England\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
