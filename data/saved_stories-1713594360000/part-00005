shares fell 10% on Friday, the worst day for the chipmaker since March\n2020, when the company's value was one-twelfth of its current $1.9 trillion\nmarket cap.\n\nThe stock plunge wasn't tied to any news out of Nvidia. But Super Micro\nComputer, one of the vendors that build Nvidia-based servers, saw shares drop\n23% Friday after the company broke from its recent pattern of providing\npreliminary results, and announced it would report earnings later this month.\n\nIn January, Super Micro increased its sales and earnings guidance 11 days\nbefore announcing second-quarter financials. The company will report fiscal\nthird-quarter results on April 30.\n\nSuper Micro and Nvidia were the two worst performers in the S&P 500 on Friday.\nSuper Micro was added to the index in March.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Super Micro has seen its sales skyrocket of late on the\nback of insatiable demand for Nvidia-based computers that are used to build\nartificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT.\n\nIn addition to those two names, investors scaled back their holdings of many\nsemiconductor stocks ahead of earnings later this month.\n\nThe chip-focused VanEck Semiconductor Index fell 4.5%, and Arm shares fell 17%\non Friday. Arm sells a kind of intellectual property for chips that's seen as\ncomplementary to Nvidia graphics processor-based AI servers. AMD, Nvidia's\nprimary GPU competitor, saw shares fall 5%.\n\nShares of Super Micro are still up about 151% this year after climbing 246% in\n2023. The stock's move on Friday was its steepest drop since Aug. 9, 2023,\nwhen it fell 23.4%. Nvidia shares are up over 58% so far in 2024.\n\nWhile Super Micro is getting a big boost from its ties to Nvidia, the market\nremains highly contested, with competitors including Dell and Hewlett Packard\nEnterprise planning to build systems using Nvidia's latest generation of\nBlackwell graphics processing units.\n\n## Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\n  * \u2018Big bargains\u2019: Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n  * A Chinese smartphone maker is breaking into EVs and challenging Tesla.
