The effort, funded\nby the National Institutes of Health (NIH), used data from thousands of\nanalyses of 19 tissue types and identified molecular changes in genes,\nproteins, and metabolites, which are substances essential to the metabolism of\na particular organism or to a particular metabolic process. The findings are\npublished in a group of papers in Nature.\n\nWhile molecular changes were seen in all tissues, the way in which each tissue\nresponded was unique. For example, effects on the functions of mitochondria,\nwhich are cellular hubs for energy production and metabolism, were observed\nacross the body yet the specific changes observed differed depending on the\ntissue. For example, researchers found that mitochondria in the adrenal gland\nresponded substantially to endurance training, including a change in\nregulation of nearly half the mitochondria-associated genes. This was\nsurprising as adrenal glands had not been explored in detail for their role in\nexercise previously.\n\nAdditionally, differences were found in molecular responses to endurance\nexercise between young male and female rats in most tissues tested, including\nthe brain, adrenal gland, lung, and fat tissue. Scientists uncovered striking\ndifferences in responses between the sexes in white fat tissue, findings that\nmay play a role in researching how exercise interventions could be recommended\nfor men or women experiencing conditions such as obesity. The differences\nbetween the exercise responses of the sexes in humans or animals have not been\nwell characterized, and these findings emphasize the need for inclusion of\nboth sexes in future exercise research to fully understand its role in health.\n\nBy tracking exercise\u2019s impact on biological molecules in humans and rats,\nscientists are creating a map of molecular changes in the body following\nexercise. Studies in rats allow for a wider range of tissue types to be\nanalyzed compared to human studies, and the resulting knowledge will allow a\nvariety of hypotheses to be explored and guide the researchers in their\nanalysis of the human data.\n\nResearchers are currently conducting an exercise study in humans that will\nenhance our understand of why the body responds to exercise and how much the\nresponse varies for people of different ages, sexes, body compositions, and\nfitness levels. In the long-term, these insights could make it possible for\nclinicians to recommend specific, personalized exercise regimens to their\npatients to treat or prevent a variety of ailments and health conditions.\n\nNIH\u2019s Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC),\nlaunched in 2016 to uncover how exercise improves and maintains our health at\nthe molecular level, is funded by the NIH Common Fund and overseen in\ncollaboration with the National Institute on Aging , the National Institute of\nArthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and the National Institute of\nDiabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
