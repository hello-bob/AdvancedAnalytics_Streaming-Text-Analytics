But career experts differ on their opinions\nabout LinkedIn\u2019s \u201copen to work\u201d banner, the green sign that shows up just\nunder your photo if you choose to activate it.\n\n\u201cIt is the biggest red flag\u201d in a job candidate, says Nolan Church, former\nGoogle recruiter and current CEO of salary data company FairComp.\n\n\u201cThere is a truism in recruiting that the best people are not looking for\njobs,\u201d he says, and therefore those people would not be advertising that\nthey\u2019re looking for work either. Former Amazon recruiter and current career\ncoach Lindsay Mustain agrees.\n\nWhen it comes to recruiting, it\u2019s all about a power dynamic, she says.\nRecruiters want to want you, not the other way around. With that banner\nactivated, \u201cbecause you need something from me, that means that I have the\npower in this conversation,\u201d she says. And that can be a turn off.\n\nBut not all career experts agree, and LinkedIn\u2019s own data does not necessarily\nsupport this thinking. Here\u2019s how the site has found the banner affects\njobseekers.\n\n## More than 33 million LinkedIn users currently have it\n\nLinkedIn introduced the \u201copen to work\u201d banner during the Covid-19 pandemic, in\nJune 2020, when millions of people found themselves out of a job in a matter\nof weeks. The company had already been offering a feature to signal to\nrecruiters privately when someone was looking, but the pandemic seemed to\nindicate a need for something more public, a LinkedIn spokesperson told CNBC\nMake It.\n\nThese days, the sign is a popular one. More than 33 million people on LinkedIn\nare currently using it, according to the site.\n\nLinkedIn can\u2019t necessarily tell how many job offers have resulted from using\nthe banner (they can\u2019t see private messages between people). But they\u2019ve seen\nthat people who turn it on are twice as likely to get messaged by a recruiter.\nThose people are also 20% more likely to get messages from the LinkedIn\ncommunity at large, some of them messages about job openings at people\u2019s\ncompanies.\n\n## For smaller companies, \u2018it can be really, really helpful\u2019\n\nOne benefit of using the banner is that smaller companies that don\u2019t have the\nbudget for the recruiters\u2019 version of LinkedIn can see who\u2019s looking for work.\n\nWhen Angelina Darrisaw\u2019s executive and leadership coaching company C-Suite\nCoach was hiring, the banner \u201cwas something that just made looking for\ncandidates a lot easier,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cFor those smaller companies, it can be really, really helpful in identifying\nnew talent,\u201d she says, adding that, \u201cyou determine the quality of the talent\nin the interview process, not by them putting their hand up and saying, \u2018Hey,\nI\u2019m available.\u2019\u201d\n\n## If \u2018your profile is a wasteland,\u2019 it\u2019s not going to matter\n\nUltimately, it might be down to cultural fit. Some employers find the sign\nuseful, others are turned off by it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weeding out of opportunities\nfor you to find the right one for you,\u201d says Darrisaw.\n\nAnd regardless of the banner, what matters most is what\u2019s in your LinkedIn\nprofile: a list of your previous and current titles, your accomplishments in\neach role, keywords relevant to your jobs, featured links with some of your\nwork and activity showing you\u2019re engaged in conversations about your industry.\n\n\u201cIf you have \u2018open to work\u2019 up but your profile is a wasteland, it\u2019s not going\nto make a difference at all,\u201d says career coach Phoebe Gavin. \u201cBecause even if\na recruiter finds you, they\u2019re not going to learn anything useful.\u201d\n\nWant to land your dream job in 2024?
