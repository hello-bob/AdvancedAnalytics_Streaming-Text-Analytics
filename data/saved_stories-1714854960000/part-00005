These circular, elevated\nedifices are designed to prevent the soil, and the sacred elements of earth,\nfire and water, from being contaminated by corpses.\n\nBodies are placed on top of the towers, where they decompose, while vultures\nand other scavengers eat the flesh on the bones. After being bleached by the\nsun and wind for up to a year, the bones are collected in an ossuary pit at\nthe centre of the tower. Lime hastens their gradual disintegration, and the\nremaining material, along with rainwater runoff, filters through coal and sand\nbefore it is washed out to sea.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer able to fulfil our traditions,\u201d Hoshang Kapadia, a Karachi\nresident in his 80s, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a way of life, our culture.\u201d\n\nKapadia explained that the purpose behind the Parsi burial customs was to\n\u201ctake less and give more\u201d to the world. \u201cThe whole idea is not to pollute the\nearth,\u201d he said\n\nVultures gather on a Parsi \u2018tower of silence\u2019, circa 1880. Offering one\u2019s\ndeceased body to the birds is regarded as the devout Zoroastrian\u2019s ultimate\nact of charity.

The city has just two remaining towers of silence, both barely\nfunctional.\n\nAnother Karachi Parsi, Shirin, said: \u201cThe vulture\u2019s mystical eye is believed\nto aid the soul\u2019s cosmic transition, and offering one\u2019s deceased body to the\nbirds is regarded as the devout Zoroastrian\u2019s ultimate act of charity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe massive urbanisation and environmental changes in Karachi have led us to\nrevisit our burial rites, as dakhmas were usually built on top of hills in\nlocations distant from urban areas.\n\n\u201cOur tradition is dying. Our culture is dying in a time of increasing\nenvironmental change.\u201d\n\nUnlike many scavengers, vultures are classified as \u201cobligate\u201d. This means they\ndo not opportunistically switch between predation and scavenging, as their\nmammalian counterparts do, but rely solely on locating and feeding on animal\ncarcasses.\n\nIn recent decades, vultures have been dying in large numbers across the Indian\nsubcontinent, primarily due to inadvertent poisoning with the anti-\ninflammatory drug diclofenac, which is extensively administered to cattle in\nIndia and Pakistan.\n\nWhen these cattle die, vultures feed on their carcasses and ingest the drug,\nwhich causes painful swelling, inflammation, and ultimately kidney failure and\ndeath in vultures. Research in 2007 estimated that about 97% of the three main\nvulture species in India and the surrounding region had disappeared.\n\nBombay, the Parsee Repository for their Dead, an illustration from 1722.\nPhotograph: CPA Media Pte Ltd/Alamy\n\nThe Parsi community in India is exploring captive vulture breeding and the use\nof \u201csolar concentrators\" to expedite the decomposition of bodies. As the solar\nconcentrators only work in clear weather, some have been forced to opt for\nburial instead.\n\nKapadia said: \u201cParsis in Karachi [are forced to] opt for alternative methods\nof disposal, such as cremation or burial in designated Parsi cemeteries, as\nthe two towers of silence in Karachi are barely functional\u201d. He added that\nwhen vulture numbers declined at the towers of silence, some community members\nsuggested creating a small captive group of vultures in an aviary to continue\nthe traditional practice.\n\nTo prevent the extinction of vulture species, scientists have recommended\nbanning the use of diclofenac in livestock, a move so far taken by India,\nPakistan and Nepal. Captive-bred vultures have also been released into the\nwild in India in a bid to boost the threatened populations.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Pakistan\n  * India\n  * Iran\n  * South and central Asia\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * Birds\n  * Pharmaceuticals industry\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
