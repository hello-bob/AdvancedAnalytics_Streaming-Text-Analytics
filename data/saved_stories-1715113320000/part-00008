The\nvast majority of Alzheimer\u2019s cases occur after age 65. But research published\nMonday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene,\nit\u2019s more than a risk factor, it\u2019s an underlying cause of the mind-robbing\ndisease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \u201cprofound implications,\u201d said Dr. Juan\nFortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older\nadults who develop Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer\u2019s patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning\nthose cases \u201ccan be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\u201d\nFortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer\u2019s were thought to be only\ntypes that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1% of all\ncases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that\ntarget the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won\u2019t offer the only drug that has been\nshown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair\nbecause they\u2019re especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa\nSperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital\nin Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer\u2019s and \u201cthis data\nfor me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they\nbecome symptomatic.\u201d\n\nBut the news doesn\u2019t mean people should race for a gene test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important not to scare everyone who has a family history\u201d of Alzheimer\u2019s\nbecause this gene duo isn\u2019t behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\n## How do genetics affects Alzheimer's?\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer\u2019s.\nA handful of genes are known to cause rare \u201cearly-onset\u201d forms, mutations\npassed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some\ncases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\n## Latest news on Alzheimer's disease\n\n  * A type of belly fat may be linked to increased risk of Alzheimer's.\n  * In an unusual move, FDA postpones decision on Lilly's Alzheimer's drug.\n  * Decades-old HGH treatments linked to five cases of early Alzheimer's.\n\nBut Alzheimer\u2019s most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to\n80s, and the APOE gene \u2014 which also affects how the body handles fats -- was\nlong known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people\ncarry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease\nAlzheimer\u2019s risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against\nAlzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life\nAlzheimer\u2019s, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global\npopulation is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\n## Pointing to a cause for a subset of Alzheimer's\n\nTo better understand the gene\u2019s role, Fortea\u2019s team used data from 3,297\nbrains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European\nAlzheimer\u2019s studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s\nsuch as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than\nthose with just one copy or the \u201cneutral\u201d APOE3 gene variety, they reported in\nthe journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque\nbuildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers \u2014 who also were more\nlikely to have initial Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms around that age rather than in the\n70s or 80s.\n\n### Recommended\n\nCancer\n\n### CancerLandmark study of cancer in Black women launches in 20 states,\naiming to be largest ever\n\nU.S. news\n\n### U.S. newsPlanters nuts recalled due to potential for listeria\ncontamination\n\nFortea said the disease\u2019s underlying biology was remarkably similar to young\ninherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \u201ca familial form of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Eliezer\nMasliah of the National Institute on Aging. \u201cIt is not just a risk factor.\u201d\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms\nand researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite destiny,\u201d she said.\n\n## How new findings may affect research\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said\nit\u2019s not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a\nhigh risk of a side effect from the drug \u2014 dangerous brain swelling and\nbleeding. One research question is whether they\u2019d do better starting such\ndrugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to\nspecifically target APOE4. He said it\u2019s also crucial to understand APOE4\u2019s\neffects in diverse populations since it\u2019s been studied mostly in white people\nof European ancestry.\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they\u2019re typically used only to evaluate if\nsomeone\u2019s a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer\u2019s\nresearch \u2014 especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease.\nSperling said the people most likely to carry two APOE4 genes had parents who\nboth got Alzheimer\u2019s relatively early, in their 60s rather than their 80s.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
