Specifically,\nTwain made a series of humpback whale calls known as \u201cwhups\u201d in response to\nplayback recordings of whups from a boat of researchers off the coast of\nAlaska. The whale and the playback exchanged calls 36 times.\n\nOn the boat was naturalist Fred Sharpe of the Alaska Whale Foundation, who has\nbeen studying humpbacks for over two decades, and animal behavior researcher\nBrenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California, Davis. The\nexchange was groundbreaking, Sharpe says, because it brought two linguistic\nbeings\u2014humans and humpback whales\u2014together. \u201cYou start getting the sense that\nthere\u2019s this mutual sense of being heard.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn their 2023 published results, McGowan, Sharpe, and their coauthors are\ncareful not to characterize their exchange with Twain as a conversation. They\nwrite, \u201cTwain was actively engaged in a type of vocal coordination\u201d with the\nplayback recordings. To the paper\u2019s authors, the interspecies exchange could\nbe a model for perhaps something even more remarkable: an exchange with an\nextraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nSharpe and McGowan are members of Whale SETI, a team of scientists at the SETI\nInstitute, which has been scanning the skies for decades, listening for\nsignals that may be indicative of extraterrestrial life. The Whale SETI team\nseeks to show that animal communication, and particularly, complex animal\nvocalizations like those of humpback whales, can provide scientists with a\nmodel to help detect and decipher a message from an extraterrestrial\nintelligence. And, while they\u2019ve been trying to communicate with whales for\nyears, this latest reported encounter was the first time the whales talked\nback.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWHY, HELLO: This recording marks the first time a whale in the wild has\nverbally responded to a sound humans have intentionally sent out. Video\ncourtesy of SETI.\n\nIt all might sound far-fetched. But then again, Laurance Doyle, an\nastrophysicist who founded the Whale SETI team and has been part of the SETI\nInstitute since 1987, is accustomed to being doubted by the mainstream science\ncommunity.\n\nFor years, Doyle sought out other worlds beyond our solar system. When he and\nothers started looking for these worlds, they were rejected by the prevailing\nastronomy community. Now, we know there are thousands of exoplanets, some of\nwhich appear to be in the habitable zone around their stars\u2014not too hot, not\ntoo cold, and a bit wet; they could harbor life, some perhaps even life\ncomplex enough to communicate across the cosmos.\n\nDoyle and his peers use radio observatories to try to detect narrowband radio\nsignals from outer space. SETI was founded on the idea that if\nextraterrestrial intelligences reached out to worlds beyond them, they would\ndo so through radio signals, which travel at the speed of light and slice\nthrough space \u201cnoise\u201d unimpeded. As SETI points out, the universe is full of\n\u201ccosmic noisemakers,\u201d including pulsars, quasars, and the interstellar gas of\nour own Milky Way. SETI focuses on narrowband radio signals because they can\nbe distinguished from the cosmic noise, and, importantly, can only be produced\nby transmitters, meaning some intelligence must have designed them, and they\nmust contain some form of information. Their nickname is \u201ctechnosignatures.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> How much information does a humpback call carry at any one time?\n\nOf course, after more than 50 years of radio astronomy, we haven\u2019t detected a\nsingle technosignature. Even if we did, how might we interpret it? Are\nscientists even prepared for that question?\n\nDoyle recounted a talk he gave to other SETI scientists. He had only five\nminutes and decided to spend one of them playing a humpback whale song. \u201cI\nplayed a humpback whale song that lasted for maybe a minute. And then I said,\n\u2018What if that had come from space? Is that intelligent?\u2019 And everybody got it\nalmost right away. They\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, we are not prepared, are we?\u2019\u201d\n\nA big part of the problem is that scientists don\u2019t have a way to tell whether\nan alien signal contains complex information or is even designed to be\nunderstood. They need to know both these things before they get anywhere near\nthe hard work of assigning meaning to the information. The only way to start\nworking on that problem, Doyle says, is to start practicing. And the only\nthings to practice with are non-human species on Earth.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Here, they discuss their experiment in\nwhich they try to exchange messages with whales in the wild. Credit: Jodi\nFrediani; NOAA Permit 19703.\n\nDoyle started this work back in 1999, when he proposed studying the clicks and\nwhistles of bottlenose dolphins to try and find markers of complexity and\nintelligence in their linguistic repertoire. The idea, based on an earlier\nconcept supported by Carl Sagan, was that studying\u2014and ultimately, talking\nto\u2014dolphins could help inform the search for signals coming from an\nextraterrestrial intelligence. In 2016, Nautilus spoke with Doyle about how\ndolphin communication revealed linguistic hallmarks that could, in turn, help\nseparate a signal from the noise of the cosmos.\n\nSince then, Doyle has turned his attention to humpback whales, which have even\nmore complex communication. These creatures are the ideal practice partners,\nhe says. They are highly intelligent, their calls are often extremely long,\nrepetitive, and broadcast across vast swathes of ocean\u2014and those calls contain\ncomplex information.\n\nLike humans yelling at one another over a distance, some of what one whale is\nsaying to another will be lost to the environment because of how far it must\ntravel and the interference it meets along the way. Yet the whales still get\nthe gist of what\u2019s being said. That means some parts of the signal may carry\nmore information than others, or perhaps some parts of the signal carry key\npieces of information that let the whales fill in the blanks. The better\nscientists understand the nature of whale signals, the better they may be\nready to understand the nature of alien ones.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nMuch of Doyle\u2019s theories rest on information theory and, particularly, Zipf\u2019s\nlaw, a principle in quantitative linguistics used to plot the frequency of a\nword or letter in a language against its frequency in any given text. For most\nhuman languages, word frequencies tend to follow a pattern of word\ndistribution, where the most common word in the language is twice as frequent\nas the next most common. It\u2019s not entirely clear why most languages appear to\nfollow Zipf\u2019s law.\n\nOne idea proposed by American linguist George Kingsley Zipf himself\u2014and Doyle\nagrees\u2014is that language is designed to be used and understood with minimal\neffort on both the speaker and listener\u2019s part. For example, if a friend calls\nto you from far away and all you hear is \u201cgoing ... beach ... Wednesday,\u201d you\ncan infer that someone is going to the beach on Wednesday. Zipf\u2019s law is an\nexpression of this.\n\nPlotting linguistic data according to Zipf\u2019s law can, in turn, reveal a\nlanguage\u2019s rules and syntax. If animal communication\u2014or an extraterrestrial\nsignal\u2014follows Zipf\u2019s law, scientists can assume it is a language, and then\nmake inferences about the information carried within the signal. \u201cWe\ndiscovered syntax in humpback whales, so they have structure in their\ncommunication system,\u201d Doyle says.\n\nWAVE HELLO: Humpback whales can be identified by their flukes, which are as\nindividual as human fingerprints. This fluke belongs to Twain, the female\nwhale the researchers exchanged calls with. Credit: Jodi Frediani; NOAA Permit\n19703.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n\u201cLooking at the way other organisms communicate is a useful way of saying,\n\u2018OK, is there a language fingerprint? Is there not a language fingerprint?\u2019\u201d\nsays Arik Kershenbaum, a zoologist at Cambridge University, who studies animal\ncommunication and is a board member of the thinktank Messaging\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence, focused in part on designing messages to be\nreceived by an extraterrestrial intelligence. Kershenbaum is not part of the\nWhale SETI team.\n\n\u201cDo whales have a language? My guess is no,\u201d Kershenbaum says. \u201cI think they\nprobably don\u2019t. But I think the communication is complex enough that we can\nuse it to build physical models of what complex communication is.\u201d In turn,\nKershenbaum says, that could help SETI scientists tell how much information is\nin a signal from outer space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the real advantage of this approach is: Can we quantify the\namount of information in a signal?\u201d Kershenbaum says. \u201cWhereas it\u2019s not very\nhelpful when you start thinking about translating.\u201d\n\nKershebaum hits on the fact that once scientists have a snippet of complex\ncommunication, whether from a humpback whale or an alien intelligence, they\nare still largely unable to assign meaning beyond making broad assumptions\nbased on the context of the communication.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n\u201cWe can use things like AI and other machine learning-type systems to find\npatterns in the data,\u201d animal behavior expert McCowan explains. \u201cBut the\npatterns alone are not going to be enough. We\u2019re going to need to understand\nwhat those patterns mean. And that\u2019s the hard work animal behaviorists and\nanimal communication researchers focus on.\u201d\n\n> What if that had come from space? Is that intelligent?\n\nDoyle describes this as a search for carrying capacity\u2014in other words, how\nmuch information does a humpback call carry at any one time? And, in turn, how\nmuch uncertainty is there in their calls? Humans, for example, can still get\nthe gist of a message even if chunks of it are missing, and it\u2019s possible the\nwhales do something similar.\n\nThe next step for Whale SETI is to use AI to refine the whale playback calls\nin the hope that a future encounter might lead to a more dynamic\n\u201cconversation,\u201d whereby the whale and the researchers could exchange\nvocalizations in a more natural way. Ultimately, they want to better\nunderstand how much information is carried in the whales\u2019 different calls and,\nperhaps, get a sense of what they mean.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nKershebaum makes the analogy of the 2016 sci-fi movie Arrival, when linguist\nLouise Banks (played by Amy Adams) manages to translate a complex alien\nlanguage she has never come across fast enough to save the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like that because we haven\u2019t started\u201d decoding non-human\ncommunication on Earth, Kershebaum said. \u201cAnd the place to start is with that\ncomplex animal communication. It is the only thing we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nOne particular aspect of humpback communication, over most other animal\ncommunication, that could help SETI, Doyle says, is their ability to transmit\nmessages across vast distances and have them be understood. If SETI scientists\ncan work out what pieces of information are crucial to humpback understanding,\nit could in turn help them pinpoint where relevant information might lie in a\ntechnosignature that has been broadcast over a vast distance in space and\ntime.\n\nIn fact, Doyle says, the whales have already answered at least one big\nquestion for SETI scientists.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

And that\u2019s something we can investigate\nlike the encounter with Twain. Twain heard \u2018hello\u2019 in humpback and came over!\u201d\n\nLead photo by Jodi Frediani; NOAA Permit 19703\n\n  * ###### Claire Cameron\n\nPosted on April 26, 2024\n\nClaire Cameron is a science and technology journalist based in New York.\nOriginally from Scotland, her work has appeared in various award-winning\npublications, including Nautilus, Inverse, Spectrum, Discover, and the Daily\nBeast.\n\n#### Get the Nautilus newsletter\n\nCutting-edge science, unraveled by the very brightest living thinkers.\n\nZoology\n\nThe Animals that Turn Bodily Fluids Into Weapons\n\nPhysics\n\nMaking Light of Gravity\n\nHistory\n\nThe Age of Rebellion\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Animals that Turn Bodily Fluids Into Weapons\n\n    * By Kristen French\n    * April 29, 2024\n    * Zoology\n\nFour explosive tales of blood, spit, and venom.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Making Light of Gravity\n\n    * By Claudia de Rham\n    * April 25, 2024\n    * Physics\n\nPhysicist Claudia de Rham on her 3 greatest revelations while writing The\nBeauty of Falling: A Life in Pursuit of Gravity.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Age of Rebellion\n\n    * By Katharine Gammon\n    * April 23, 2024\n    * History\n\nThe surprising relationship between age and success in rebellions.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Feminist Botanist\n\n    * By Rebecca Batley\n    * April 22, 2024\n    * History\n\nA 19th-century tale of hermaphrodite flowers, Charles Darwin, and women\u2019s\nright to vote.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Psychology of Getting High\u2014a Lot\n\n    * By Michael Inzlicht\n    * April 19, 2024\n    * Psychology\n\nTime to extinguish the slacker cliche.\n\n## NAUTILUS: SCIENCE CONNECTED\n\nNautilus is a different kind of science magazine.
