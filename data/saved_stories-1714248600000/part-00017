In other words,\nthe trial was not \u201cblinded\u201d for purposes of comparing the drug\u2019s effect, which\nundermines the results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nICER researchers also said trials may have been skewed by therapist\nparticipants who are boosters of MDMA as a mental health treatment, as well as\nlarge numbers of subjects who had previous experience taking MDMA. The report\ncited concerns that some participants that received MDMA felt \u201cpressured to\nreport good outcomes and suppress bad outcomes,\u201d and flagged a documented case\nof therapist misconduct that raised safety risks.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate group of researchers is petitioning the FDA, which put\nMDMA-assisted therapy on a fast track for approval, to slow down and convene\nan extended public hearing to consider the many unique issues at play.\n\nThe potential of psychedelics has bloomed in recent years as a treatment for\nmental health disorders and addiction, with technology luminaries and\ninvestors betting hundreds of millions of dollars on companies developing a\nrange of treatments, from psilocybin to ibogaine. MDMA is the first of these\nto reach the doorstep of FDA approval, and leaders in the psychedelic medicine\nfield say the agency\u2019s decision could lay the groundwork for how the federal\ngovernment regulates drugs that do not fit the mold of traditional\npharmaceuticals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a huge decision with pretty sweeping consequences,\u201d said Shane\nPennington, a Washington D.C. attorney who specializes in FDA regulations\ninvolving controlled substances. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the first shot fired. It\u2019s\ngoing to be precedential.\u201d\n\nICER\u2019s report highlights the complexity of the FDA\u2019s decision as well as\nconsiderations for insurers, who use ICER\u2019s assessments to inform decisions\nabout coverage. While ICER staff acknowledged that some PTSD patients\nexperienced \u201csubstantial benefit,\u201d they found that the evidence in two\npositive, late-stage trials of therapy with MDMA was too murky to determine a\nnet benefit or a fair price, according to the draft report last month.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty unusual all the way through,\u201d said David Rind, ICER\u2019s chief\nmedical officer. \u201cIf this is the best trial that can be done, it\u2019s not that\ngood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company seeking the drug approval, has said the FDA is\nexpected to make a decision by August and said it supports the agency\nscheduling an open public hearing.\n\n\u201cWe stand behind the design and results of our clinical trials and are\ngrateful to the patients and investigators who participated in them,\u201d a\nspokesperson for the company said in response to questions from The Washington\nPost. In a bid to preserve neutrality, the company said, patients\u2019 PTSD\nsymptoms were evaluated by staff who didn\u2019t know whether participants received\nthe drug or placebo.\n\nBrett Waters, executive director of psychedelic advocacy group Reason for\nHope, said the ICER report gives too much weight to concerns from a small\nnumber of people, and that the benefits of MDMA therapy greatly outweigh the\nrisks. \u201cIf we overregulate, people won\u2019t be able to afford it and it will be\ndriven to the underground,\u201d he said, adding that MDMA research has already\nproved its bona fides.\n\nUntil recently, Lykos was a wholly owned subsidiary of a nonprofit, the\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. MAPS, as it is known,\nwas founded by Rick Doblin, who in the 1980s unsuccessfully tried to block the\nfederal government from criminalizing MDMA. \u201cI knew that the only way to bring\nit back was through the FDA,\u201d he said at a 2022 event.\n\nSo MAPS embarked on a decades-long effort to prove that the drug had merit as\na medicine, raising $140 million from donors to pay for clinical trials. The\norganization formed what is now Lykos a decade ago as a public-benefit\ncorporation, in anticipation that MDMA-assisted therapy would win FDA approval\nand start to reap taxable revenue that it couldn\u2019t manage as a nonprofit. In\nJanuary, Lykos announced it had raised more than $100 million from investors,\nand MAPS is now a minority shareholder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe FDA said it couldn\u2019t comment on pending applications. The agency last\nsummer published guidance for companies developing psychedelic medications,\nacknowledging \u201cunique challenges\u201d of taking them through clinical trials.\n\nZoloft and Paxil are approved by the agency to treat PTSD \u2014 a condition that\naffects about 5 percent of U.S. adults \u2014 but the drugs don\u2019t always deliver\nrelief. MDMA releases chemicals in the body that affect mood and behavior, and\nsubdues brain activity associated with fear while promoting trust, according\nto MAPS researchers, enabling patients to openly discuss traumas and unlocking\ntheir \u201cinner healer.\u201d\n\nThe application to the FDA pairs the drug with various types of therapy, some\nof which critics say fall outside the mainstream of accepted science. That\nincludes \u201cnurturing touch\u201d and \u201cholotropic breathwork,\u201d according to a MAPS\nmanual for treating PTSD.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of new age with spiritual components,\u201d said Bruce E. Wampold,\na counseling psychology professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at\nMadison who has studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy in clinical trials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the periphery of what I would say evidence-based treatments would\nbe.\u201d\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration lists MDMA in its most restrictive\ncategory of drugs that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical\npurpose.\n\nIn late-stage clinical trials that generated buzz about what could be a\nfundamentally new treatment, participants who received the drug reported\nsignificantly reduced symptoms of PTSD relative to the placebo group.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPatients in the MDMA and placebo groups reported a variety of undesirable side\neffects, including suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Such adverse events\nweren\u2019t significantly more common in the treatment group, and no participants\nreported an outcome that was disabling, life-threatening or required\nhospitalization, according to published studies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome researchers doubt those safety results.\n\nNese Devenot, a psychedelics ethics researcher who co-authored the petition,\ncited published accounts of MDMA trial participants describing how their\nsymptoms worsened afterward. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can make a case that the\ndata that they\u2019ve provided to FDA is an accurate representation of what\u2019s\nactually going on in the\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\ntrials,\u201d Devenot, who has been critical of MAPS, said in an interview.\n\nICER staffers \u2014 who spoke to a handful of former patients and people\nassociated with MAPS trials \u2014 noted the some of the adverse effects they\nlearned about were not reflected in data they had seen. The report said\npressure to gloss over negative impacts of MDMA may be skewed by the zeal of\nthe psychedelic enthusiasts involved as both patients and researchers, though\nICER staff couldn\u2019t determine this extent of this dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt would have been preferable to have maybe a little more space between the\norganization that was promoting MDMA assisted therapy and the organization\nresearching it,\u201d ICER\u2019s Rind said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nICER staff also spoke with people involved in a podcast by New York Magazine,\nwhich probed the ethics of the MAPS clinical trials and interviewed some\npatients who said they were victimized by their therapists or pressured to\nreport positive outcomes. In one account, a woman who participated in one of\nMAPS\u2019s smaller trials described being abused by her therapists.\n\n\u201cMAPS views these violations as a breach of trust between patient and\nclinician and a violation\u201d of its ethics code, the nonprofit said previously.\n\n\u201cBoundaries, including sexual boundaries, were severely crossed with at least\none patient,\u201d ICER wrote in its draft report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompounding ICER\u2019s concerns, the report said, was that in the second late-\nstage trial published last year, 94 percent of participants who received MDMA,\nand 75 percent of those who got the placebo, correctly guessed their group.\n\nPatients who know they got the treatment might \u2014 consciously or subconsciously\n\u2014 report better outcomes to please researchers, even if those effects are not\ncompletely accurate, said Asbjorn Hrobjartsson, a professor of clinical\nresearch methodology at the University of Southern Denmark.\n\n\u201cPatients, like most people, are polite individuals and they react on the\nsocial atmosphere of being in a trial,\u201d Hrobjartsson said.\n\nTo counteract this risk of biasing the results, the FDA suggests that a\ncompany could run two clinical trials: one comparing the drug against a\nplacebo to better gauge its safety, and another with a control group that\nreceives a \u201csubperceptual dose\u201d of the psychedelic drug or other drugs that\n\u201cmimic some aspects of the psychedelic experience.\u201d\n\nMAPS and Lykos, however, had already completed their trials when the FDA\npublished its guidance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nThe Post\u2019s View\n\nViews from The Post\u2019s Editorial Board on current events\n\nOpinion|The Trump immunity case is easy.
