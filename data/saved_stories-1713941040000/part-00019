Under the absence of regular precipitation,\nmicroorganisms are the main ecological component mediating nutrient fluxes by\nusing soil components, like minerals and salts, and atmospheric gases as a\nsource for energy and water. While most of the previous studies on microbial\necology of desert environments have focused on surface environments, little is\nknown about microbial life in deeper sediment layers. Our study is extending\nthe limited knowledge about microbial communities within the deeper subsurface\nof the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. By employing intracellular DNA\nextraction and subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing of samples collected from a soil\npit in the Yungay region of the Atacama Desert, we unveiled a potentially\nviable microbial subsurface community residing at depths down to 4.20 m. In\nthe upper 80 cm of the playa sediments, microbial communities were dominated\nby Firmicutes taxa showing a depth-related decrease in biomass correlating\nwith increasing amounts of soluble salts. High salt concentrations are\npossibly causing microbial colonization to cease in the lower part of the\nplaya sediments between 80 and 200 cm depth. In the underlying alluvial fan\ndeposits, microbial communities reemerge, possibly due to gypsum providing an\nalternative water source. The discovery of this deeper subsurface community is\nreshaping our understanding of desert soils, emphasizing the need to consider\nsubsurface environments in future explorations of arid ecosystems.\n\nAtacama, hyperarid, desert soil, subsurface, microbial community\n\nSubject\n\nEnvironmental Sciences (Physical Sciences and Engineering) Microbiology\n\nIssue Section:\n\nBiological, Health, and Medical Sciences\n\nEditor: Ivet Bahar\n\nIvet Bahar\n\nEditor\n\nSearch for other works by this author on:\n\nOxford Academic\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nSignificance Statement\n\nMicroorganisms are the main actors by controlling nutrient fluxes in hyperarid\ndesert ecosystems. However, only few studies have explored microbial\ncommunities of desert subsurface soils. Our study used intracellular DNA to\ncharacterize the living microbial community along a soil profile in the\nAtacama Desert and revealed diverse communities down to a depth of 4.20 m.\nThis discovery is expanding our understanding of desert biodiversity\nsuggesting that subsurface niches are colonized under favorable environmental\nconditions, implying that the global biodiversity of deserts might have been\nunderestimated in previous studies. An example of favored conditions is the\npresence of a gypsum-containing geological substrate, providing water by\ndewatering to anhydrite and thus being a potential analog for subsurface\nhabitable niches on Mars.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDespite being characterized by some of the harshest and life-threating\nconditions on Earth, extreme desert environments harbor microbial life and\nthus represent unique ecosystems exhibiting an exceptional resilience to\nendure. Microorganisms are the main and often only biological component in\nthese environments and are driving major ecological functions including\nnutrient cycling, soil formation, and water preservation, often without major\ninput of moisture by precipitation (1).\n\nThis applies especially to the 105,000 km^2 large Atacama Desert in northern\nChile, which is considered the driest hot desert in the world and therefore a\nhighly relevant location to study life under extreme aridity. A comprehensive\n4-year study conducted by McKay et al. (2) in the hyperarid region of the\nYungay Valley revealed only one rain event of 2.3 mm during the entire\nobservation period, underscoring the desert\u2019s remarkably dry characteristics.\nDue to these harsh environmental conditions where chemical weathering,\nerosion, and biological activity are nearly absent, the processes of soil\nformation differ significantly from those observed in other regions on our\nplanet, resulting in the accumulation of atmospheric particles including salts\nand dust (3, 4). This leads to the presence of various salts of sulfates and\nhalides but also highly soluble salts of nitrate, iodate, and perchlorate (5).\n\nWith higher forms of life largely being absent, the hyperarid soils are mainly\ndominated by bacteria (6\u20138). These soils are inhabited by a diverse range of\ntaxa from phyla such as Acidobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi,\nFirmicutes, and Actinobacteriota. Especially taxa affiliated to\nActinobacteriota, particularly those associated with common soil and desert\nspecies/genera, can be detected (7, 9\u201311). Communities in samples from the\natmosphere\u2013soil interface comprise organisms with a high tolerance toward\ndesiccation and UV radiation, e.g. Rubrobacter species (8).\n\nHypolithic and endolithic microorganisms have been found to inhabit various\nsubstrates in the Atacama Desert, such as halite (12, 13) and quartz crystals\n(13\u201315). These niches are primarily occupied by cyanobacteria, often in\nassociation with salt- and desiccation-tolerant Actinobacteriota and nitrogen-\nfixing Alphaproteobacteria (12, 13, 15). However, there are exceptions, such\nas so-called red hypoliths, which are dominated by taxa of the phylum\nChloroflexi (15). These niches provide favorable conditions for\nmicroorganisms, including increased moisture levels due to the hygroscopic\nproperties of salts (12, 16). Endolithic microbial communities have also been\nfound to colonize gypsum crystals (13, 17). The porous matrix of the crystal\nstructure forms a microclimate, which protects microbes from ultraviolet\nradiation while providing enough light for photosynthesis (17, 18).\n\nStudying microbial diversity and distribution is essential to fully understand\nthe pivotal role of microbial-driven processes in maintaining the ecological\nbalance and functionality of desert ecosystems and its future development,\nparticular against the backdrop of a changing climate. This is especially\nimportant when considering the largely unexplored microbial populations\nresiding in deeper subsurface horizons (>100 cm depth). Shallow horizons (0\u201380\ncm depth) of desert subsurface sediments have been suggested to represent\nniche environments shielded from UV radiation and with higher water\navailability (11). Therefore, these subsurface conditions may provide\nessential nutrients for microbial life and metabolic activity. Despite initial\nefforts using clone sequencing and a Life Detector Chip and recent next\ngeneration sequencing (NGS)-based efforts to assess the biodiversity of the\ndeeper layers of the Atacama soils down to a depth of 520 and 340 cm (19, 20),\nknowledge about microbial distribution and microbial processes in deeper\nAtacama sediments is still limited, as most of the other available datasets\nprimarily focus on the upper sediment layers down to approximately 100 cm in\nmaximum (8, 11). Consequently, it is necessary to further evaluate microbial\nlife in deeper sediments to obtain a better understanding if and how\nmicroorganisms exist and survive in these settings.\n\nIn recent years, cultivation-independent methods have significantly advanced\nour understanding of microbial diversity in environmental settings, surpassing\nthe limitations of traditional cultivation-based approaches. NGS methods have\nplayed a pivotal role in this progress by generating vast amounts of microbial\nsequence data from a single sample, unraveling the community structure and\nfunctional potential of unculturable microorganisms. However, besides recent\nstudies on lithic dryland habitats in Namibia and rain-affected Atacama soils\n(8, 13, 21), studies on microbial soil communities in deserts have primarily\nfocused on analyzing total DNA, e.g. (7,11\u201313,22), lacking the ability to\ndifferentiate between sequences derived from living, potentially active\ncommunities and those originating from relic organisms (22). To address this\nlimitation, a novel extraction method was developed. This method enables the\nseparate recovery of intracellular DNA (iDNA) and extracellular DNA (eDNA)\nfrom the same sample, facilitating the analysis of DNA derived specifically\nfrom intact cells, including living and dormant microorganisms (23, 24). For\nthis, cells and DNA are first washed out of the sediment using multiple rounds\nof specific buffer incubations and low-speed centrifugations and then filtered\nthrough a 0.22-\u03bcm filter to collect the cells. After this, the iDNA can be\nextracted from the filter using a phenol\u2013chloroform protocol. This approach\nprovides a significant improvement for microbial diversity studies of extreme\nenvironments as it effectively eliminates bias from DNA derived from dead\ncells, thereby ensuring more accurate and reliable results for understanding\nmicrobial life in extreme environments. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity\nto assess potentially active microorganisms in habitats with low biomass,\nwhere conventional RNA-based activity analysis reaches the detection limit due\nto low biomass.\n\nThe aim of this study was to explore microbial diversity in previously\nuncharacterized, deeper (>1 m) subsurface sediments of the hyperarid Atacama\nDesert and test whether the deep sediments in this region can represent a\nniche for specialized microbial communities. Therefore, we selected a sampling\nsite located in a playa of the Yungay Valley, one of the driest places of the\nhyperarid core of the Atacama Desert (2). Playas are small and closed\nephemeral wetlands that typically form in semiarid to arid regions and are\ncharacterized by accumulations of clay and evaporation features (25, 26). The\nsampling location differs from previous Atacama Desert study sites, as the\nvesicular layer, which is a common surface feature consisting of gypsum and\nanhydrite typically found close to the surface within the upper 50 cm, is\nburied underneath the playa sediments at a depth of approximately 2 m. We\nemployed iDNA analysis (NGS and quantitative PCR, qPCR) and compared it to\ngeochemical analysis (X-ray diffraction, XRD; ion chromatography (27)) to\nstudy the microbiology of the hyperarid subsurface down to a depth of 420 cm,\nincluding both playa sediments and alluvial fan deposits.\n\n## Study site\n\n### Profile description and mineralogy\n\nThe exact same soil profile was previously investigated under a paleoclimatic\naspect and consisted of two distinct zones based on grain size distribution\n(27). The upper half of the profile down to a depth of 184 cm consisted\nprimarily of silty sediments with intermittent thin sand layers (Fig. 1A).\nDesiccation cracks, characteristic of fine playa sediments, were observed on\nthe surface and within deeper layers down to 10\u201320 cm depth. Between 184 and\n230 cm depth, the sediment transitioned to coarser textures, including sand\nand pebbles. Below 230 cm, the profile was consistently contained of pebble-\nto cobble-sized grains. During excavation, salt accumulations of gypsum\n(CaSO_4 \u00d7 2H_2O), anhydrite (CaSO_4), and halite (NaCl) were encountered (Fig.\n1B). The first major saline horizon composed of halite was found between 40\nand 150 cm depth. Based on XRD data, halite amounts peaked at 100 cm depth\naccounting for 16% of the overall mineralogy. Gypsum was detected across the\nentire profile with a mean proportion of 16% in the upper part of the profile\nbetween 0 and 180 cm. Deeper sediments between 180 and 330 cm depth were\ncharacterized by degraded remnants of the sulfate-rich vesicular layer. This\nobservation also correlates with higher proportions of gypsum in the XRD data\nshowing average amounts of 53% and peaking at 190 cm depth with a value of\n80%. Small amounts of anhydrite (1\u20133%) appear in association with gypsum\nbetween 200 and 240 cm depth. Below 330 cm depth, gypsum concentrations were\ndecreasing to values below 10%.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nStratigraphic column A) and geochemical attributes of the paleo profile\nplotted against depth according to Arens et al. (27). Mineralogy B) was\nmeasured semiquantitatively using XRD and is limited to the relevant salts in\nthis study. Cation C) and anion D) concentrations per dry weight (dw) were\nacquired using ion chromatography. Error bars indicate the standard derivation\nof three technical replicates.\n\n### Geochemistry\n\nGenerally, sodium, calcium, sulfate, nitrate and chloride ions could be\nmeasured after leaching with MilliQ water (27). According to the ion\nconcentrations, the profile can be divided into two main sections. In the\nupper third of the profile sodium, sulfate, nitrate, and chloride\nconcentrations form a broad peak between 40 and 110 cm depth (Fig. 1C and D).\nMaximum concentrations for sodium (14.8 mg g^\u22121 [dw]), nitrate (8.6 mg g^\u22121\n[dw]), and chloride (15.0 mg g^\u22121 [dw]) were measured in sediments from around\n100 cm depth and decreased between 150 and 200 cm depth (Fig. 1C and D).\nModerate sodium concentrations (1.6\u20134.1 mg g^\u22121 [dw]) defines the lower\nprofile section from 150 to 420 cm depth, whereas calcium and nitrate\nconcentrations in this section are low (<1 mg g^\u22121 [dw]). Calcium and sulfate\nions were constantly detected throughout the entire profile with\nconcentrations around 2.5 mg g^\u22121 (dw) for calcium and values between 4.8 mg\ng^\u22121 (dw) and 12.4 mg g^\u22121 (dw) for sulfate (Fig. 1C and D). Notably, 12.4 mg\ng^\u22121 (dw) in our method corresponds to 2,000 mg l^\u22121, which is close to the\nmaximum solubility of gypsum (2,500 mg l^\u22121 at 20 \u00b0C) explaining why the\nsulfate data are not following the trends of the relative amount of gypsum\ndetected using XRD. We therefore, consider the XRD data to be more reliable\nfor evaluating the presence of gypsum in the soil layers.\n\n## Results\n\n### Microbial composition and diversity\n\n#### Data generation and sequencing statistics\n\nOverall, 16S rRNA gene sequencing generated 10,632,339 reads resulting in the\nidentification of 9,992 unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Removal of\nlow-quality, mitochondria, chloroplast, and contaminant sequences reduced the\nnumber of ASVs to 9,605 accounting for a loss of 3,933,284 reads. In addition,\nonly 23 samples from 36 samples which were send to sequencing showed\nconsistency between at least two replicates. From the remaining samples, e.g.\nthe upper surface sample between 0 and 2 cm depth as well as all the samples\nfrom 100 to 190 cm depth, no reproducible, reliable sequencing data could be\nrecovered. Therefore, these samples were removed from the dataset.\n\n#### Microbial abundance and diversity\n\nGene copy numbers of iDNA were highly scattered across the upper 80 cm,\nranging between 5.9 \u00d7 10^4 copies g^\u22121 soil found at 5 cm depth and 751 gene\ncopies g^\u22121 soil at 80 cm depth (Fig. 2C). Below 200 cm depth, gene copy\nnumbers were relatively constant with an average of 4.4 \u00d7 10^3 g^\u22121 soil.\nHighest gene copy numbers in the lower profile section were observed for the\nsamples collected at 330, 360, and 420 cm depth all exceeding 10^4 gene copy\nnumbers per gram soil, while the samples from the 240 and 390 cm horizon\nshowed the lowest copy numbers with 1.8 \u00d7 10^3 g^\u22121 soil and 1.4 \u00d7 10^3 g^\u22121\nsoil, respectively.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\n16S rRNA gene data showing the microbial composition A), diversity B), and\nabundance C) plotted against depth. Microbial composition is depicted at\nphylum level. Alpha diversity is shown as Shannon index values (H) and was\ncalculated using a subsampled dataset to compensate for varying sequencing\ndepth of the samples. Microbial abundance was measured using qPCR and was\nnormalized to number of 16S rRNA gene copies g^\u22121 soil. Note that the scale\nfor the microbial abundance plot C) is logarithmic.\n\nMicrobial diversity across the paleo profile samples was evaluated by\nassessing the number of observed ASVs (richness) and calculating the Shannon\nindex. While microbial richness solely accounts for the number of different\nASVs present, the Shannon index incorporates both the richness and the\nabundance of each ASV. Reported diversity indices were normalized to 24,755\nsequences. Shannon values ranged from 0.8 to 3.5 with a median of 2.6.\nObserved richness ranged between 119 and 215 with a median of 164 observed\nASVs (Fig. 2B). Diversity measurements suggest two distinct microbial\ncommunities across the paleo profile. Diversity metrics varied in the upper\npart of the profile between 0 and 80 cm depth, with values of H = 0.77 at 30\ncm depth and H = 3.52 at 10 cm depth. Highest richness values in this profile\nsection were observed at 20 cm depth with 180 observed ASVs, while at 40 cm\ndepth the lowest richness of 133 ASVs was detected. Sediments from the lower\nprofile section from 200 cm downwards were characterized by on average higher\nShannon values, ranging from 1.8 to 3.0, being highest at 390 cm depth (H =\n2.98). The number of ASVs ranged between 119 and 215 in samples from this\nsection and were highest in samples from 215 cm depth.\n\nBeta diversity was assessed using Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity between samples. A\nnonmetric multidimensional scaling plot (NMDS) based on the dissimilarity\nmatrix revealed three distinct clusters, suggesting microbial communities to\nvary across the paleo profile (Fig. 3). Samples from the lower subsurface\nprofile section (below 200 cm) clustered together in the right part of the\nordination graph around NMDS1 = 1.5 and NMDS2 = 0, except for the communities\nat 390 and 420 cm depth. Samples in this cluster showed a stronger presence of\nASV 1 and 18 (Tables S3 and S4), both classified to the bacterial order\nFrankiales, which's members are commonly inhabiting root nodules. The second\ncluster was more scattered and included samples from 20 to 80 cm depth. Three\nASVs were characteristic for this cluster including ASV 2 (Bacilliales), ASV\n242 (Luteolibacter sp.), and ASV 898 (Marinococcaceae). The surface sample\nfrom 2 to 5 cm depth was most distinct from every other sample, clustered\nseparately and was especially defined by the presence of ASV 934\n(Acidimicrobiia) and ASV 1040 (Pseudonocardia sp.). The communities from 10,\n390, and 420 cm depth did not cluster with any of the before mentioned profile\nsections. While the deepest community from 420 cm depth was still in close\nspatial proximity of the lower subsurface cluster on the right side of the\nplot, the 10 and 390 cm communities were plotting far removed from all other\ncommunity associations in the lower section of the NMDS plot.\n\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nAn NMDS displaying sample dissimilarity based on a Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity\nmatrix.

Each ASV's name and taxonomy are labeled in close\nassociation with the dots.\n\n#### Microbial community structure\n\nMost of the sequences were assigned to bacterial taxa, while only 0.5% of the\nreads were assigned to Archaea. In general, microbial communities were\ndominated by three different bacterial phyla which account for over 90% of all\nsequences. The most abundant phylum was Actinobacteriota (51%) followed by\nFirmicutes (24%) and Proteobacteria (21%). The remaining identified phyla\nincluding Bacteroidota, Gemmatimonadota, Chloroflexi and Deinococcota\naccounted for <2% of the overall community. The most abundant archaeal phylum\nwas Crenarchaeota with an overall relative abundance of 0.3%.\n\nThe uppermost sediments from 2 to 5 cm depth were dominated by the presence of\nActinobacteriota (95%, Fig. 2A). Actinobacteriota were less abundant in\nsediments between 10 and 80 cm depth, ranging between 1.7% (30 cm) and 36% (20\ncm) relative abundance. Microbial communities in this part of the profile were\ncharacterized by a strong presence of Firmicutes with relative abundances\nranging from 47% (at 40 cm depth) to 93% (at 30 cm depth). Only the 70 cm\nsample was characterized by a lower relative abundance of Firmicutes at 34%.\nMicrobial communities in sediments below 200 cm were again dominated by\nActinobacteriota. Sequences classified to this phylum consistently appeared\ndown to a depth of 420 cm with minimum abundances of 62% at 240 and 280 cm\ndepth and a maximum abundance of 88% at 360 cm depth. Firmicutes abundance\ndecreased significantly in sediments below 200 cm with relative abundances\nbelow 15%. However, Firmicutes were the most dominant taxon in sediments from\nthe 390 cm deep sample, with a relative abundance of almost 50%.\nProteobacteria distribution was more constant across the entire profile.\nProteobacteria were especially enriched in sediments from the upper part of\nthe profile with relative abundances of 46% at 10 cm depth, 35% at 40 cm\ndepth, and 47% at 70 cm depth. In deeper sediments (below 200 cm),\nProteobacteria abundance ranged between 10% (260 cm) and 38% (390 cm), but\nProteobacteria were almost absent from 360 cm deep sediments.\n\nTo get a more detailed understanding of the microbial community and identify\nkey organisms and their potential role in the unique Atacama Desert subsurface\necosystem, the most abundant and frequently occurring ASVs were evaluated more\nclosely. ASV level characterization further emphasized the presence of two\ndistinct communities existing in the upper sediments (down to 80 cm) and\ndeeper sediments (below 200 cm).\n\nActinobacteriota dominance in surface sediments (2\u20135 cm depth) could be\nattributed to the presence of ASV 7 (86% of all reads at this depth). ASV 7\nwas assigned to the Acidimicrobiia, but could not be classified below the\nclass level (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nHeatmap showing the relative abundance of the dominant ASVs (mean abundance >\n0.5%) and their highest assignable taxonomic rank. A schematic stratigraphic\ncolumn shows sample association to specific profile zones and highlights the\ngap between 80 and 200 cm depth. For true to scale representation of the\nstratigraphy, see Fig. 1.\n\nFirmicutes dominance in sediments taken from 10 to 80 cm depth was driven by\nASV 2, which was assigned to the order Bacillales. ASV 2 was highly abundant\n(>50%) in this section of the profile, reaching up to 88% relative abundance\nin 30 cm deep sediments. The only notable appearance of Actinobacteriota in\nthis profile section was observed at 20 cm depth, where ASV 26, assigned to\nthe family Nitriliruptoraceae was determined to have a relative abundance of\n33%. Proteobacteria communities in 40 and 70 cm deep sediments were especially\nenriched in two ASVs assigned to the genera Enhydrobacter (ASV 11; 4 and 11%)\nand Halomonas (ASV 21; 0.04 and 13%).\n\nThe dominance of Actinobacteriota in the subsurface sediments below 200 cm\ndepth could be attributed to the presence of several ASVs (Fig. 4). The most\nabundant ASV (ASV 1) could be assigned to the order Frankiales, with\nabundances ranging from 34 to 65%. Other abundant Frankiales ASVs were ASV 18,\nASV 20, ASV 59, and ASV 3. Most of them cooccurred with ASV 1. A similar\npattern was observed for ASV 28 belonging to the order Micrococcales, albeit\nat lower relative abundances (0.03\u201310%). Only a small number of\nActinobacteriota ASVs were observed in sediments from 390 cm depth. However,\nin the deepest profile sediments at 420 cm depth, they were abundant again,\nspecifically with ASV 14 (21%, Micrococcales) and ASV 27 (20%, Aeromicrobium\nsp.).\n\nASVs belonging to the Proteobacteria were characterized by ASV 23, assigned to\nthe genus Aminobacter. This ASV was especially enriched in sediments from 270\nand 280 cm depth, with relative abundances of 15 and 19%, respectively.\nAnother abundant Proteobacteria ASV belonging to the genus Pseudomonas (ASV\n16, 18% relative abundance) was detected in the deepest sample. Other, less\nabundant Proteobacteria ASVs in the deeper part of the profile, were ASV 11\naffiliated to the genus Enhydrobacter (reaching 8% at 240 cm depth) and ASV 42\naffiliated to the genus Paracoccus (reaching 7% at 200 cm depth).\n\nFirmicutes ASVs were detected infrequently in the deeper sediments. Two\nFirmicutes ASVs assigned to the genus Brevibacillus (ASV 144) and to the\nfamily Paenibacillaceae (ASV 97) were identified at abundances of 15 and 12%\nin the 390 cm sample, respectively. Across the remaining horizons only one\nFirmicutes ASV was detected at relative abundances above 1%, with ASV 70\nassigned to the family Bacillaceae at 330 and 360 cm depth.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe extraction and sequencing of iDNA from sediment samples collected from a\nsoil profile in the Atacama Desert allowed the assessment of potentially\nactive communities in an exceptionally oligotrophic habitat where common\nactivity proxies such as metatranscriptomics often fail due to the low\nabundance of extractable RNA and the fast decay of RNA (28, 29). This\ninvestigation revealed potentially viable microbial communities to inhabit the\nhyperarid soils down to a depth of at least 420 cm. To our knowledge, this\nrepresents the deepest microbial survey and discovery of microbial life in\nAtacama soils to this day with previous studies mostly covering only shallow\nsubsurface soils to a depth of 80 cm, e.g. Warren-Rhodes et al. (11) and\nSchulze-Makuch et al. (8), with only two exceptions reaching down to 340 and\n520 cm depth (19, 20). Considering the lack of input of nutrients from\natmospheric sources in the deeper subsurface of deserts, communities described\nin this study could represent the upper extent of a deep biosphere underneath\nhyperarid desert soils.\n\n### Depth-related diversity trends\n\nDiversity in Atacama soils is reported to decrease with depth suggesting\nharsher conditions in the subsurface of the desert (11). In the upper meter of\nthe soil profile, a similar trend was observed as gene copy numbers decreased\nfrom 5 to 80 cm depth. Furthermore, it was observed that the diversity of\nmicrobial communities in this specific profile section tended to be lower\ncompared to previously reported values (7, 11). The diversity values recorded\nin this study, with a median Shannon index (H) of 1.8 and a minimum value of\n0.8 at a depth of 30 cm, are lower than the values of 2.6 observed at the\nstudy site Kevin Garden and 2.1\u20133.5 in the surface playa soils as reported by\nCrits-Christoph et al. (7) and Warren-Rhodes et al. (11), respectively. As\nindicated by the measured chloride, nitrate, and sodium concentrations, in\naddition with an increase of halite in the mineralogy, saline conditions are\nincreasing with depth within the upper meter of the paleo profile. Therefore,\nconsistent to previous observations (11), the overall low diversity and\ndecrease in biomass is likely connected to the higher osmotic stress on the\nmicroorganisms. No reliable microbial community data could be collected for\nsediments from around 100 cm depth, where ion and mineralogy data suggest\nsalinity to be highest. Despite microorganisms are known to withstand very\nhigh salt concentrations inhabiting salt nodules in surface soils, e.g. de los\nR\u00edos et al. (12) or even benefit from deliquescence processes in the\nsubsurface (20), osmotic regulation requires substantial energy supply which\nis achieved through energetically beneficial metabolisms like photosynthesis,\naerobic respiration, and denitrification (30). We propose that under the\nabsence of sunlight and limited organic matter halophilic life is limited and\nthus living biomass is too low for sufficient iDNA yield in subsurface layers\nwhere salinity is peaking. However, the gap in iDNA recovery persists beyond\nthe extent of the highly saline layers to the bottom of the playa deposits\ndown to a depth of 190 cm. An explanation for this could be the isolation from\nwater and nutrient input in sediments below the chloride- and nitrate-rich\nhorizons as these salts in desert soils often mark the maximum infiltration\ndepth of water during rare rain events (3). It is not clear whether such an\ninfiltration process could also act in playa sediments, since clay rich\ndeposits are considered to seal off water. Playas are known to serve as an\nimportant landform for groundwater-recharge where infiltration rates can be\nhigh due to waterflow along desiccation cracks (31). Such an infiltration\ncould indeed be responsible for the deposition of nitrate and chloride salts\naround 100 cm depth in the playa sediments. However, the climate record of the\nplaya sediments also shows that the onset of higher nitrate and chloride\nconcentrations correlates with higher fluvial activity in the basin, implying\nthe salts to be transported and deposited from the surrounding slopes (27).\nIndependent from the origin of the salt accumulation, the deeper playa layers\nare more isolated from nutrient and water input than the upper 80 cm which\nhighly limits the colonization and persistence of microbial communities in the\nlayers between 150 and 200 cm depth. Microbial diversity below 200 cm depth\nwas found to be stable (H index between 1.8 ando 3.0), showing no depth-\nrelated trend. This observation suggests a mostly substrate-dependent\ncommunity which probably colonized the alluvial deposits prior to its burial\nunderneath the playa sediments. Overall, this indicates a transition zone at\naround 2 m depth, which is impacted by the precipitation of salts, reaching a\nfairly isolated deeper subsurface that is unaffected by surface processes.\n\n### Specialized communities in playa sediments (0\u201380 cm)\n\nThe community composition in the upper playa sediments of the soil profile\nexhibits significant fluctuations. Reliable sequencing data could not be\nobtained from little amounts of DNA recovered from the surface (0\u20132 cm depth)\nof the profile, likely due to the low biomass. This aligns with previous\nobservations conducted in the Yungay area (10, 32). The microorganisms at the\nsoil\u2013atmosphere interface in the desert faces stress from diurnal temperature\nfluctuations, desiccation, and intense UV radiation (1). To escape these harsh\nconditions endolithic bacteria often colonize rocks or salt crystals, e.g.\nLacap-Bugler et al. (15), de los R\u00edos et al. (12), and Genderjahn et al. (21),\nproviding niches which allow microbes to be permanently active (33). We\nhypothesize that the absence of larger salt crystals or minerals within the\nfine particles of the playa deposits prevent potential endolithic life as\nthere is no shelter from the extreme environmental conditions, e.g. the\ncolonization by cyanobacteria on/in surface sediments, e.g. (12, 15).\nFurthermore, endolithic life relies on moisture supply which has been reported\nto be insufficient in surface soils of Yungay (17). Based on these\nobservations, we conclude that the lack of reliable sequencing data in the\nupper 2 cm of the soil profile are due to limited microbial colonization\ncaused by the harsh surface conditions and the lack of potential microniches\nto provide refuge from these conditions.\n\nThe 2\u20135 cm sample had a high abundance of taxa belonging to Actinobacteriota,\na phylum known to dominate the soils of the Atacama Desert (7, 8, 10).\nHowever, this particular horizon exhibits a remarkable presence of an\nuncultured bacterium belonging to the class Acidimicrobiia, which constitutes\n86% of the entire sample. While this ASV was almost only observed in the 2\u20135\ncm horizon of the paleo profile, members of the same class have regularly been\nencountered in previous studies of the Atacama Desert and are considered part\nof the native core community which is present at different sites and soil\ndepths (7, 8, 11). The identified ASV 7 is closely affiliated with GenBank\nentries of another uncultured Acidimicrobiia bacterium (e.g. 99.21%,\naccession: OW750262.1) extracted from desert soil. Moreover, members of the\nAcidimicrobia are native to deserts around the world as the isolation of a\nnovel organism from soils in the Chinese Gurbantunggut desert led to the\nproposal of the Acidimicrobiia species Desertimonas flava (34). The ASV 7\nidentified in the 2\u20135 cm horizon likely represents a highly specialized and\nundescribed organism that is well adapted to desiccation. This bacterium\nthrives in the surface layers unaffected by UV radiation, where salt\nconcentrations remain relatively low due to occasional dissolution during rare\nrain events. The absence of this ASV in the other layers of the upper\nsediments is likely attributed to increasing salt contents of the sediments\nbelow 5 cm depth. Similar to other Acidimicrobiia native to desert\nenvironments, the here identified ASV may have the genetic potential for\nhydrogenotrophic carbon fixation (35). The flexibility to switch to a\nchemolithotrophic metabolism could offer this ASV the opportunity to persist\nand compete over long times with limited external nutrient supply.\n\nFrom 20 to 80 cm depth, where the salt concentrations start to increase, the\nmicrobial community is defined by a dominance of Firmicutes. This dominance is\nalmost entirely facilitated by ASV 2 closely related to Scopulibacillus\ndarangshiensis (98.02%; accession: FN646630.1), Salinibacillus xinjiangensis\n(96.84%; accession: NR_125634.1), and Alteribacillus bidgolensis (96.84%,\naccession: NR_109122.1), which are halophilic and strictly aerobic organisms\nisolated from hypersaline lakes (36, 37). This is consistent with the\naccumulation of chloride and nitrate salts in this zone and observations of\nviable, halophilic Firmicutes taxa in the hyperarid core of the Atacama (8,\n20). Salinity between 20 and 80 cm depth is, therefore, not only influencing\ndiversity but also defining the community composition of this profile section.\n\nThe fine-grained playa sediments are usually deposited during times of\ntemporal lake formations in the basin. Such temporary wetting phases have most\nlikely a major impact on the input of microbial communities to the playa\nsediments. Many Firmicutes are endospore-forming organisms; therefore, it is\npossible that the Firmicutes communities inhabiting the saline layers of the\npaleo profile are dormant under the current dry conditions and become active\nduring the short flooding events of the basin. In our study, iDNA was\nextracted using a phenol\u2013chloroform-based cetyltrimethylammonium bromide\n(CTAB) protocol with bead beating which could lyse endospores. However,\nSchulze-Makuch et al. (8) could prove decreasing influence of sporulation\nbiomarkers with increasing aridity, indicating that the Firmicutes taxa in the\nupper meter of the studied profile could be potentially vegetative.\n\nOverall, the microbial community of the first meter of the paleo profile is\nhighly adapted, with halophilic Firmicutes being abundant across most of the\nsamples and suggesting depth-related salt concentrations to be the main factor\nshaping microbial community and diversity in playa sediments.\n\n### A gypsum-dependent deep subsurface niche\n\nOne of the most notable findings from this study is that microbial cells were\nrecovered from sediments below 200 cm depth where the playa deposits\ntransition into alluvial deposits. Contrary to assumptions which were based on\nprevious patterns observed in other subsurface environments (11), microbial\ndiversity and abundance did not decrease in deeper sediments. The potentially\nviable communities between 200 and 420 cm depth showed a consistent Shannon H\ndiversity of around 2.7 which is comparable to values from previous studies on\nAtacama surface soils (7, 11). Although gypsum is present across the entire\nprofile, gypsum as a major part of the vesicular layer was only observed\nwithin the coarser sediments of the alluvial fan deposits. Porous gypsum has\nbeen observed to be inhabited by endolithic microorganisms that utilize the\npore spaces as an ecological niche in various environments, e.g. Hughes and\nLawley (38) and Wierzchos et al. (17). These endolithic communities near the\nsurface often consist of phototrophs, which form a consortium alongside\nheterotrophic bacteria closely related to taxa found in the surrounding soils\n(12, 15). The structure of gypsum crystals is known to provide protection\nagainst harmful UV radiation, while also being translucent and retaining\nmoisture within the pore space (17, 18). Cyanobacteria are even reported to\nactively dissolve gypsum crystals to recover the water incorporated into the\nmineral structure (39). However, the gypsum crystals subsurface alluvial\ndeposits of the paleo profile were not colonized by cyanobacteria due to\nmissing light, but creating a niche that is inhabited by specialized\nmicroorganisms. Between 200 and 240 cm depth, gypsum was accompanied by small\nfractions of anhydrite. This subsurface layer contains the remnants of the\nvesicular layer which has been investigated in surface soils of the\nsurrounding slopes and shown to be a capable to maintain microbial activity\nover a longer period compared to the surface samples (8). Biogenic-induced\ndissolution of gypsum by bacteria has been speculated to cause partial\ntransformation of initial gypsum to anhydrite due to the loss of water and the\nreprecipitation of CaSO_4 (39). However, experiments showed that the direct\ndehydration of gypsum to anhydrite requires high temperatures generally above\n85 \u00b0C (40, 41) and it is unclear if microbes can facilitate this\ntransformation. Recently, the formation of anhydrite in the Atacama has been\nattributed to secondary dissolution of gypsum and reprecipitation of anhydrite\nwhich could be thermodynamically favored by high concentrations of nitrate and\nhalite salts (42, 43). In this study, the occurrence of anhydrite is not\naccompanied by higher concentrations of nitrate or halite but with the\npresence of an Actinobacteria-dominated microbial community. Additionally, the\nlower sections of the alluvial fan deposits, below a depth of 340 cm where the\ngypsum content decreased, gene copy numbers reached a minimum value at 390 cm\ndepth. This together with previous evidence of gypsum supporting microbial\nlife in the Atacama (8, 17, 18, 39) further suggests gypsum to play a crucial\nrole for microbial biodiversity by possibly providing water or increasing\nwater retention in hyperarid soils.\n\nAnother major difference between the upper playa deposits and the lower\nalluvial fan deposits is their deposition age. The fine-grained playa\nsediments are relatively young, with sedimentation starting approximately\n19,000 years ago (27). In contrast, the alluvial deposits represent a much\nolder depositional record, dating back up to 3.8 million years at a depth of\n420 cm (27). The age of the alluvial fan deposits, coupled with the\npersistence of the habitat, may contribute to the higher diversity and\ncommunity stability observed, resulting in the selection of taxa that are\nadapted to the desert soil conditions. Long-lasting environments not only\naccumulate active microbial members but also allochthonous DNA (44, 45), which\ncould be especially true for low activity settings where DNA is not as quickly\nconsumed as in other environments. Furthermore, certain materials like clay or\nsalts bind eDNA, making it unavailable for consumption and thus additionally\ncontribute to the accumulation of eDNA (46, 47). In our study, we were able to\nseparate this potential bias by specifically analyzing the iDNA pool which\nenables us to directly look at the members of the potentially viable\nsubsurface community.\n\nThe community composition of the alluvial fan deposits in this study is\ncomparable to previous studies conducted on surface sediments in the Atacama\nDesert, where Actinobacteriota have been identified as the dominant phylum (7,\n8, 10, 48). Within the Actinobacteriota, the assigned ASVs belonging to the\norder Frankiales are affiliated with the species Geodermatophilus pulveris\n(ASV 18; 97.23% similarity) and Modestobacter caceresii (ASV 1; 97.23%), both\nof which have been previously found in desert habitats (49\u201351). Notably, M.\ncaceresii, isolated from hyperarid Atacama soils, demonstrates remarkable\ngenetic capacities to withstand the diverse challenges in this extreme desert\nenvironment. It exhibits resistance to temperature fluctuations, osmotic\nstress, UV radiation, and low nutrient conditions, while also possessing the\npotential for a chemolithotrophic metabolism, utilizing CO as the sole carbon\nand energy source (50). Other Actinobacteriota identified in the lower\nsubsurface, including ASVs belonging to the order Micrococcales (ASV 14 and\n28), were also identified in previous Atacama Desert studies (8). This\nsuggests that this particular community colonized the soil prior to its burial\nby the playa deposits 19,000 years ago and that it was flexible enough to\npersist under the extremely nutrient isolated conditions in the deeper\nsubsurface of the desert. Hydrogenotrophic carbon fixation is known to be an\nimportant process in hyperarid soils dominated by Actinobacteriota classes\nwhich possess the genes to fix CO_2 by oxidizing atmospheric hydrogen (35).\nSymbiotic and free-living Frankia, a common genus within the order Frankiales\ndominating the lower subsurface deposits in the paleo profile, are typically\nable to fix atmospheric nitrogen while also having the metabolic potential to\noxidize hydrogen (52\u201354). The close affiliation of the Frankiales ASVs to\npotentially chemolithoautotrophic organisms (M. caceresii (50)) and the\nabsence of recent phototrophically produced organic carbon highlights the\nimportance of mixotrophy or specifically chemolithoautotrophy in subsurface\nlayers below 2 m depth. The discovery of potentially active\nchemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in previously unknown subsurface niches\nchanges our understanding of microbial life in desert soils. This finding\nindicates that the contribution of chemosynthetically produced carbon in\ndeserts may have been significantly underestimated thus far.\n\n### Active or dormant community?\n\nCell viability can be roughly defined by (i) the presence of functional\nnucleic acids, (ii) cellular activity, and (iii) membrane integrity (55). Our\nwork demonstrates how iDNA analysis can help to better understand present\necosystems in extreme settings, including nutrient limitation, osmotic stress,\nand drought, which often lead to low biomass and thus, make RNA-based methods\nvery challenging or even impossible. However, in contrast to\nmetatranscriptomics or ATP analysis, iDNA cannot distinguish between active or\ndormant organisms as it is only referring to physiologically intact cells. In\nthis study, we used the term \u201cliving communities\u201d to describe the state of the\ncell assemblages assuming the fraction of dead cells with intact membranes to\nbe negligible, especially considering the oligotrophic nature of the hyperarid\nsediments, where the decomposition of microbial cell walls as a nutrient\nsource is expected to be more pronounced due to reduced water activity (56).\nFurthermore, a small overlap of ASVs between iDNA and eDNA in hyperarid soils\nof the Atacama Desert indicated very low cell turnover rates (8). We assume\nthat low turnover rates could additionally mitigate the risk of overestimating\nthe living community by minimizing the likelihood of extracting intact but\ndeceased cells, since cell death is likely to appear more infrequently in\ncomparison to more metabolically active habitats. Furthermore, spore formation\nis reported to be a minor factor in hyperarid Atacama soils, even when typical\nendospore-forming Firmicutes taxa were encountered (8). Therefore, microbial\ncommunities\u2019 patterns in our study, such as the dominance of Firmicutes in\nplaya sediments, do not necessarily imply a dormant community but rather may\nreflect snapshots of slow yet dynamic community processes leading to\nsubstrate-dependent shifts in community composition.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis study expands our knowledge about microbial biodiversity of desert\nenvironments through the discovery of a previously undiscovered subsurface\nniche hosting a viable and potentially active community. By reaching down to a\nsampling depth of 420 cm covering playa sediments and underlying alluvial fan\ndeposits, different community dynamics in regard to depth and soil type were\nobserved. The upper 2 m of the profile are characterized by depth-dependent\ncommunities, as diversity and habitability decrease with depth due to\nincreasing salinity and water scarcity, findings that correspond to previous\nobservations in Atacama Desert soils (11). However, unlike previous\ninvestigation, we show that microbial communities reappear in the deeper\nalluvial fan deposits which could be connected to the presence of vesicular\ngypsum potentially offering an alternative water source through dissolution to\nanhydrite. This subsurface community is more diverse than the specialized\nsurface communities found in the playa sediments and is likely completely\nisolated from the surface. Even though gypsum may not be ubiquitous in the\nsubsurface of all deserts, the presence of this subsurface niche could\nindicate that the global biodiversity of deserts was underestimated so far and\nthat under given circumstances a subsurface community can persist in the\ndeeper layers of the driest places on Earth. Finally, this study also holds\nimportant implications for the search of extremophilic life beyond Earth. The\nexploration of gypsum-associated subsurface environments in the Atacama Desert\nhas direct relevance to astrobiology, since gypsum deposits on Mars (57) are,\nas this study further underlines, not only evidence of past liquid water (58,\n59) but could also possibly serve as a source of water for present microbial\nlife. Thus, the data from this study is helping us to understand if and how\nlife may exist in similar environments on other planets or moons across our\nsolar system.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Sampling\n\nThe sampling site is a playa/clay pan situated in a closed basin located in\nthe Yungay Valley of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, approximately 60 km\nsoutheast of Antofagasta (24\u00b005\u203241.4\u2032\u2032S 70\u00b001\u203242.7\u2032\u2032W; Fig. 5). Sampling of\ndeep soil profiles while providing sterile sampling conditions (e.g. avoiding\nthe use of heavy drilling instruments) in this region is extremely challenging\ndue to the highly consolidated nature of the desert ground. Therefore, the\nsampling was conducted over the time span of one month during March and April\nof 2018 and included the excavation of a 1.5- to 2-m deep, preexisting soil\npit to a depth of 420 cm. Three pristine samples covering a lateral extend of\n1 m for each layer were taken progressively while digging downwards excavating\n50 cm laterally into the profile to reduce the influence of atmospheric gases\ndiffusing into the soil layers.\n\nFig. 5.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nMap showing the location of the study site in the hyperarid core of the\nAtacama Desert.\n\nThe initial 5 cm of the soil profile were sampled in two segments: 0\u20132 and 2\u20135\ncm in depth. Subsequently, samples were collected in 10 cm intervals. For the\nsamples designated for biological analysis, a modified sampling interval of\nevery 30 cm was implemented between 300 and 420 cm, resulting in a total of 36\nsamples. Each sample was carefully collected by sampling multiple spots across\na meter wide horizontal layer, which were than pooled and homogenized to\naccurately represent the entirety of the excavated pit\u2019s area. Sampling was\nperformed using a flamed sterilized spoon transferring the sediment into\nsterilized 125 mL containers. Sampling containers were stored at ambient\ntemperatures after sample collection and at 4\u00b0C during transport to Germany.\nUpon arrival in Potsdam, the samples were transferred to \u221220\u00b0C for long-term\nstorage. In addition, a total of 44 samples were collected for geochemical\nanalysis using Nasco Whirl-Pak bags and stored at room temperature until\ndownstream analysis.\n\n### DNA extraction\n\n#### Separation of iDNA and eDNA\n\nTo separate iDNA and eDNA from sediment samples at different depths, a\nmodified version of the protocol developed by Alawi et al. (23) and Medina et\nal. (24) was used. Three replicates per sample each containing 3 g of sediment\nwere mixed with 6 mL of 120 mM sodium phosphate (NaP) buffer pH 8.0 (400 mL of\n120 mM Na_2HPO_4 + 29.2 mL of 120 mM NaH_2PO_4, sterile filtered over a 0.2-\u03bcm\nPES filter and autoclaved) and incubated on an orbital shaker at 4\u00b0C for 10\nmin. The slurry was then centrifuged at 500\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C for 10 min to separate\nthe sediment from the solution. This process was repeated 3 times by\nresuspending the resulting pellet in 3 mL of NaP buffer to maximize DNA and\ncells yield.\n\nThe separation of the two DNA fractions was achieved by filtering the\ncollected supernatant through a 0.22-\u03bcm Sterivex filter (preflushed with NaP\nbuffer) using a sterile 20-mL syringe, allowing intact cells (iDNA) to be\ncaptured on the filter membrane, while the eDNA remained in the buffer. To\nensure complete transfer of the eDNA fraction, the filter was flushed with NaP\nbuffer afterwards. All steps were performed in a sterile bench. The filter\ncontaining the iDNA was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until DNA extraction.\n\n#### Extraction of iDNA\n\nFor the extraction of iDNA, the frozen Sterivex filters were subjected to a\nCTAB\u2013polyvinylpyrrolidone DNA extraction method based on Nercessian et al.\n(60). The filter membrane was cut and transferred to a sterile 2-mL screwcap\ntube. To lyse the cells, a mixture of zirconia and glass beads, 600 \u03bcL CTAB\nbuffer, 60 \u03bcL 10% SDS, and 600 \u03bcL phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)\nwere added to the tube, then vortexed for 45 s at 6 ms^\u22121 using a bead beater.\nAfter bead beating, the tubes were centrifuged, and the upper aqueous phase\ncontaining the DNA was transferred to a new tube. This step was repeated with\n600 \u03bcL chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to remove any residual phenol. The\nDNA was precipitated with two volumes of PEG 6000/NaCl and 1 \u03bcL linear\npolyacrylamide, centrifuged, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and finally\ndissolved in PCR-grade water. The extracted DNA was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for\nfurther processing.\n\n#### Library generation and NGS\n\nIn this study, the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was targeted using\nthe universal primer pair F\u2032515 (5\u2032-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3\u2032; modified by Parada\net al. (61)) and R\u2032806 (5\u2032-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u2032; modified by Apprill et al.\n(62)) which is suitable for the amplification of both archaea and bacteria.\nPCR with barcoded primers was done using the following program in a Bio-Rad\nT100 Thermal Cycler: a first denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by\n35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C\nfor 1 min. The PCR products were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP kit\n(Beckman Coulter Life Science, Krefeld, Germany), pooled and send for\nsequencing. Illumina paired-end sequencing was performed at Eurofins Genomics\n(Ebersberg, Germany) on an Illumina HiSeq machine with MiSeq V3 chemistry (2 \u00d7\n300 bp paired-end reads).\n\n#### Data processing\n\nThe sequencing library was demultiplexed using cutadapt v3.5 (63) using the\nfollowing parameters: -e 0.2 -q 15,15 -m 150 --discard-untrimmed. The ASVs\nwere generated using trimmed reads and the DADA2 package v1.20 (64) with R\nv4.1 using the pooled approach with the following parameters: truncLen =\nc(240,200), maxN = 0, rm.phix = TRUE, minLen = 200. Taxonomic assignment was\ndone using DADA2 and the SILVA database v138 (65). Subsequently, ASVs\nrepresenting chloroplasts, mitochondria, and singletons were removed.\n\nContamination was traced by running negative controls during DNA extraction as\nwell as library preparation and including them in the sequencing library.\nContaminating sequences, which showed comparable or greater abundance in at\nleast one of the negative controls, were carefully removed from the dataset.\nIn addition, extraction replicates were checked for consistency to eliminate\ncontaminated or low sequencing read count data points. Samples for which two\nor more replicates had to be removed were not included in downstream analyses.\nDiversity analysis (alpha and beta diversity) was done on a subsampled dataset\nto avoid effects of different sample sizes. All samples were subsampled to a\nread count of 24,755 using R's vegan package (66) which corresponds to the\nsample with the lowest sequencing depth in this library. Data visualization on\nphylum and ASV level was done after the nonrarefied read counts were\ntransformed into relative abundances. All plots were generated using the R\npackages phyloseq (67), vegan (66), and ggplot2 (68).\n\n#### Quantitative PCR\n\nThe qPCR analysis was conducted using a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR detection\nsystem (Bio-Rad). A 20-\u03bcL master mix was prepared, consisting of 10 \u03bcL of\nKAPPA Hifi SYBR Mix 1 \u00d7 (Qiagen), 0.4 \u03bcL each of 10 \u03bcM primers 341 F\n(5\u2032-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032), and 534 R (5\u2032-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3\u2032) (69), 5.2 \u03bcL of\nPCR-grade H_2O, and 4 \u03bcL of DNA template. The qPCR cycling parameters were set\nas follows: an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40\ncycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 20 s, elongation\nat 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and plate reading at 80\u00b0C for 3 s. All samples were analyzed\nin triplicate for technical replicates. To establish a standard curve and\ndetermine efficiency (>90 to <110%), a known concentration (2.5 \u00d7 10^8 gene\ncopies) of a 16S rRNA gene PCR fragment from Bacillus subtilis was used, with\nserial dilutions ranging from 10^1 to 10^7 gene copies. The Bio-Rad CFX\nsoftware was employed for efficiency calculation. Extraction negative controls\nand qPCR nontemplate controls were included in the analysis. Additionally, a\nmelting curve analysis was performed at the end of each run to detect any\nnonspecific DNA amplification (70).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank the Chilean\u2013German field parties during the Atacama\ncampaign 2018.
