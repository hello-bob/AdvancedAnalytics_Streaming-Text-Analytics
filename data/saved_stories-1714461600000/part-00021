Just kidding. The layoffs were so poorly executed that\nsecurity was forced to scan employees\u2019 badges at the door to figure out who\nhad been laid off. And, apparently, that included a guy who had taken to\nsleeping in his car and showering at the factory so he could work longer\nhours.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla Laid Off A Bunch Of Employees And Forced Security To Sort It Out At The\nDoor\n\nBusiness Insider Found Seven Tesla Workers Who Aren't Sure About A Union So\nThat Settles That\n\nThe Hype Behind Tesla Stock Success In 2023\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nThe Hype Behind Tesla Stock Success In 2023\n\nNico Murillo, who until April 15 had been working as a production supervisor\nat Tesla\u2019s Freemont facility, recently posted his layoff experience on\nLinkedIn and sharing the timeline of how he discovered he\u2019d lost his job:\n\n> 4:30am: Opened my laptop, account was de activated. Thought it was just\n> another IT problem, so didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n>\n> 5:00am I usually check my emails while on my autopilot commute to work (1hr\n> 30min drive) Email read: \u201cUnfortunately as a result, your position has been\n> eliminated by this restructuring.\u201d\n>\n> 5:05am Texted my manager, but he said \u201ceveryone got it, we\u2019ll get more info\n> later\u201d\n>\n> 5:50am Tried to badge in, and the security guard took my badge and told me I\n> was laid off\n>\n> 6:00am Sat in my car in disbelief.\n\nYou would think that someone who works at Tesla would know that even with\nTesla\u2019s so-called \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d software, Autopilot is only a Level 2\nsystem and still requires the driver to monitor the road instead of checking\nemails. After all, its use has been linked to more than 200 crashes and at\nleast 29 deaths, but for the purposes of this post, we\u2019re just going to move\non because his story takes a quick, depressing turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla Laid Off A Bunch Of Employees And Forced Security To Sort It Out At The\nDoor\n\nBusiness Insider Found Seven Tesla Workers Who Aren't Sure About A Union So\nThat Settles That\n\nThe Hype Behind Tesla Stock Success In 2023\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Hype Behind Tesla Stock Success In 2023\n\nAccording to Murillo, in his five years at Tesla, he moved from an entry-level\nProduction Associate role to Lead Production Associate and eventually\nProduction Supervisor. Also, with a 90-minute commute each way, in 2023, he\napparently started sleeping in his car, showering at the factory and\nmicrowaving his dinners on days that he was working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately for Murillo, no amount of loyalty to a company is going to be\nmet with any amount of loyalty to you. Even if you post better numbers than\nyour coworkers, you\u2019re ultimately just another meat sack they\u2019re forced to pay\nuntil they can figure out how to replace you. Which might explain why the\nUnited Auto Workers union is making huge gains in Alabama, of all states, and\nVolkswagen workers in Chattanooga recently voted to join the UAW even though a\nsimilar vote failed back in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant isn\u2019t too far behind Volkswagen\u2019s Chattanooga\nfacility. They deserve better than being forced to line up at the door so they\ncan wait for security to figure out who still has a job.\n\nH/T: CarScoops\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
