It was 60,000 bees\n\n16 hours ago\n\nBy Rachel Looker,BBC News\n\nBBC\n\nSaylor Class, three, inspecting some of the winged insects who were keeping\nher up at night\n\nWhen three-year-old Saylor Class began complaining of monsters in her bedroom,\nher parents thought it was just a figment of a child's overactive imagination.\n\nBut then a beekeeper discovered tens of thousands of honeybees above the\ngirl's bedroom.\n\nSaylor had complained of \"monsters in the wall\" of her room at their farmhouse\nin Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nHer mother, Ashley Massis Class, and her husband thought nothing of it.\n\nThey had after all just shown their daughter the Pixar movie, Monsters, Inc.\n\n\"We even gave her a bottle of water and said it was monster spray so that she\ncould spray away any of the monsters at night,\" said Ms Massis Class, a home\ndesigner.\n\nAshley Massis Class\n\nA beekeeper removed 55,000 - 65,000 bees from the wall of the home\n\nBut over the following months, Saylor became more insistent that there was\nsomething in her closet.\n\nIt began to make more sense when Ms Massis Class noticed bees swarming in\nclusters near the attic and chimney outside their 100-year-old house.\n\nThey thought Saylor might be hearing the buzzing near her bedroom ceiling.\n\nMs Massis Class called a pest control company that found the winged insects\nwere honeybees, a protected species in the US.\n\nShe and her husband contacted a beekeeper who noticed the insects were\ntravelling towards the floorboards of the attic - right above her daughter's\nbedroom.\n\nThe bees had spent eight months building the monster hive.\n\nThe beekeeper brought a thermal camera to scan the walls in the three-year-\nold's bedroom.\n\nAshley Massis Class\n\nAshley Massis Class estimates the damage from the honeybees will cost $20,000.\n\n\"It lit up like Christmas,\" Ms Massis Class said.\n\nThe beekeeper said he had never seen a hive go that far down into the wall.\n\nHe tracked it to a coin-sized hole in the corner of an attic vent.\n\nThe beekeeper - whom Massis Class's daughter began calling the monster hunter\n- opened the wall to reveal a large honeycomb.\n\n\"They just came pouring out like a horror movie,\" Ms Massis Class said.\n\nThe beekeeper has removed between 55,000 and 65,000 bees and 100lb (45kg) of\nhoneycomb.\n\nThere have been three extractions by reverse vacuuming the insects out of the\nwall to put them into boxes. The insects are being relocated to a honeybee\nsanctuary.\n\nMs Massis Class has had to screen off the room between extractions to prevent\nthe bees from buzzing around her home.\n\nThe honeybees and their honey damaged the house's electric wiring, Ms Massis\nClass said.\n\nShe said her homeowner's insurance won't cover anything pest-related because\nthey deem it preventable.\n\nShe estimates the bees have caused more than $20,000 (\u00a316,000) in damages.\n\n## You may also be interested in:\n\nThe home owner originally assumed the noise was a plane or power tool being\nused.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBees\n\nUnited States\n\nRelated\n\n## Eight US officers shot, four killed, in home siege\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\nWATCH\n\n## Charlotte mayor emotional as three officers killed\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## Video captures 'traumatic' bear cub handling\n\n18 Apr 2024\n\nUS & Canada\n\nMore\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## How does US electoral college choose presidents?\n\nHow does the US electoral college elect the president?
