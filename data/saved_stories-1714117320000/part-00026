His most realistic creation yet is a\nsupermodel-esque woman with blonde-brown hair who speaks with a mild Scottish\naccent.\n\nBy Jason Bracelin / Las Vegas Review-Journal\n\nApril 25, 2024 - 9:55 am\n\nDon't miss the big stories. Like us on Facebook.\n\nYou wanna see her move? I think that\u2019s the fun part.\n\nThe room is thick with anticipation and fabricated skulls.\n\nShe\u2019s gonna wake up. Give her a second.\n\nMatt McMullen eyes his creation as her eyes flutter open in return, her gaze\nsettling upon all the disembodied faces and mechanical mandibles surrounding\nher in this workshop where fake hair co-mingles with real ambition.\n\nGradually, she stirs to life, this robot who doesn\u2019t look like one.\n\nHer arms flare out a bit, her head tilts downward then upward, a smile slowly,\nyet steadily blossoms on her face like time-lapse footage of a flower blooming\nin the sunlight.\n\n\u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u201d renowned science fiction author Philip\nK. Dick once asked in the title of one of his most celebrated works, which\nwould later be adapted into the film \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d\n\nNope, turns out they fantasize about visiting theme parks instead, as we learn\non a recent Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cSo, who is going to take me to Disneyland?\u201d the robot wonders, her words\napropos of ... well, we\u2019re not quite sure.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s just reacting to her environment: on a table nearby rests a small\nsign adorned with an image of Mickey Mouse and a quote from Walt Disney.\n\n\u201cIf you dream it, you can do it,\u201d it reads.\n\nMcMullen\u2019s dream?\n\nTo build robots with a human look and feel like never seen before.\n\nHe\u2019s been at it for decades now, and this is his most realistic creation yet,\na supermodel-esque woman with long blonde-brown hair and bared midriff who\nspeaks with what sounds like a mild Scottish accent.\n\n\u201cThis one is more advanced than the last one we built,\u201d McMullen notes, arms\nand face covered in tattoos and pride, respectively. \u201cShe\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a rapid pace \u2014 which\nfrightens some and excites others \u2014 enabling robots to approximate their human\ncreators to increasingly greater degrees, Las Vegas is getting in on the game.\n\nFrom start to finish, creating a Realbotix robot usually takes two or three\nmonths. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nGrowing use of humanoid robots\n\nThere\u2019s the five Aura humanoid robots that interact with visitors in the\natrium of the Sphere, as well as the Tipsy Robot bars at Planet Hollywood and\nThe Venetian, where you can knock back a rum and Coke poured by a made-from-\nmetal bartender.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a number of robotics/AI-based companies in the Vegas-area,\nincluding Battlebots, Blackfire, Cobot Nation, Brainlike, Koshee.ai and\nTerbine.\n\n\u201cI moved here 10 years ago, and to see all this growth in the tech space, it\u2019s\nalways exciting,\u201d says Paul Oh, Lincy Professor for Unmanned Aerial Systems at\nthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose areas of expertise encompass\nrobotics, autonomous systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and humanoids. \u201cIt\ncontinues to develop, and so I really do think there\u2019s a lot of potential\nhere. We\u2019ve also seen over the past 10 years, that there\u2019s more and more\nconsumer-level products with robotics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just robot vacuum cleaners,\u201d he continues. \u201cI think more and\nmore people are saying, \u2018Yeah, I could do a driverless car,\u2019 which is actually\na robot. I could do virtual reality \u2014 that\u2019s an outgrowth of robotics. I can\ndo 3D printing \u2014 that\u2019s also the domain of robotics and manufacturing. The\nlist goes on and on.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, said list includes humanoid robots, which Oh knows well\nfirsthand: In 2022, students in his Drones and Autonomous Systems Lab advanced\nto the finals of the $10 million ANA Avatar XPRIZE, a worldwide competition to\ncreate a human-robot avatar system in Long Beach, California.\n\nThe students\u2019 creation, named Avatar-Hubo, placed 11th overall.\n\nMore recently, humanoid robots have made national news, as Oh notes: Last\nmonth at global AI conference Nvidia GTC, which is put on by tech company\nNvidia and draws tens of thousands of participants annually to San Jose,\nCalifornia, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took the stage with nine humanoid robots\nand introduced the company\u2019s \u201cProject Groot\u201d endeavor, which will invest\nheavily in the further development of the technology.\n\n\u201c2024 is the Year of Humanoid. There\u2019s no robot hardware more general-\npurpose,\u201d Nvidia Research Manager Dr. Jim Fan posted on X. \u201cWe are all in.\u201d\n\nTesla is also getting in the game with its Optimus humanoid robot prototype,\nthe latest version of which was unveiled last December.\n\nMcMullen\u2019s attempting to take things even further: He wants his robots to\nappear and act more like people, to serve any number of hypothetical purposes,\nfrom greeting you at the grocery and guiding you to the shampoo aisle if you\nneed some Head and Shoulders to delivering meds and checking your vitals at\nthe hospital to being an always-there-for-you life companion when you need\nsomeone \u2014 or some thing \u2014 to have a chat with.\n\nAI\u2019s growing prevalence in our daily lives has stoked plenty of fears. Will\nrobots one day replace us mere flesh-and-bone mortals? Will they be our trusty\nsidekicks or go all \u201cM3gan\u201d on us? Will we eventually have to war with our\nsmart toasters when machines rise up to challenge their human creators,\nSkynet-style? But McMullen\u2019s not only embracing those fears, he\u2019s turning them\non their meticulously-sculpted robot heads.\n\nAnd he\u2019s doing it all in a nondescript, mid-sized studio tucked behind his\nhome in the northwest side of town.\n\nMcMullen grins at the thought.\n\n\u201cNobody would ever think this is in my backyard.\u201d\n\nMcMullen builds his creations in a mid-sized studio behind his home in the\nnorthwest side of town. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__raeIt\ntakes one-to-two weeks for McMullen to sculpt the face of one of his robots.\n(Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nFrom art school to androids\n\nIf the eyes are indeed the window to the soul, what if there is no soul to\npeer into?\n\nThis ranks high among the myriad challenges inherent in attempting to create\nrealistic peepers for a comely she-bot.\n\nAnd yet, when Realbotix\u2019s latest creation scans the room, it doesn\u2019t feel as\nif she\u2019s doing so with vacant doll eyes or garage-door eyelids that go up and\ndown with a clear mechanical lurch.\n\nInstead, when she glances your way, it does feel as if she\u2019s looking at you,\nwhich may register as a bit creepy to some \u2014 more on that later \u2014 but even if\nfake flesh makes your flesh crawl, there\u2019s a clear craftsmanship in her gaze.\n\nGetting to this point wasn\u2019t easy: McMullen says that it took him and his team\na full year to develop her eyes alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the eye itself, it\u2019s how the face and the eyelids and all of\nthat work together,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, because human eyes are\nactually not a hinge, they\u2019re more of a sphincter muscle that can contract.\nAnd you can\u2019t replicate that \u2014 at least not today. So we\u2019re using motors that\nhave linear motion, and we\u2019re trying to create this natural appearance of\nthese movements.\u201d\n\nRealbotix\u2019s robot faces are first sculpted from clay. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas\nReview-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nSpeaking of time-consuming tasks, don\u2019t even get him started on how hard it is\nto make lifelike robot mitts.\n\n\u201cThere are 100 more challenges attached just to the hands,\u201d he notes.\n\nDespite these difficulties, McMullen sounds far more enthused than exasperated\nwhen addressing said challenges \u2014 he\u2019s an old pro at it by now, having been\ncreating realistic figures since the late \u201990s.\n\nUnlike many of his peers, McMullen comes from a fine arts background rather\nthan one in robotics.\n\nHe began sculpting when he was a teenager, attending art school for a time in\nhis 20s, before landing a job with San Diego Halloween design company\nDisguise. One day around this time, he had an epiphany in a department store.\n\n\u201cThey had hired an actress to pretend to be a mannequin \u2014 and she was really\ngood at it,\u201d McMullen recalls. \u201cFor some reason that stuck with me, I was\nlike, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have a mannequin that looks so real, that people\nwould think that it was?\u2019 Kind of like an inverse of that experience. I\nstarted coming up with this, like, crazy idea of a hyper-realistic, pose-able\nmannequin.\u201d\n\nTo this end, McMullen founded his own company, Abyss Creations in 1996, which\nis perhaps best known for developing the RealDoll adult companion mannequin,\nthe most deluxe versions of which can fetch over $10,000.\n\nHe\u2019s sold thousands of them.\n\nMcMullen then founded Realbotix in 2014 to bring a similar realism to robots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had this idea and concept that robots could be companions in some\nway,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether they be for entertainment, or I feel like there are\ncertain people who can benefit from having sort of a simulated relationship, a\nfriendship, with an AI-driven robot.\u201d\n\nRealbotix founder Matt McMullen works on his most realistic, AI-enhanced robot\nyet. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nRealbotix created a pair of full-body robots in 2023 and intends to increase\nproduction this year. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nBuilding a bot\n\nTurns out it\u2019s an intensely exacting endeavor, this humanoid-robot-building\nthing.\n\nThe process often begins with a digital representation of a given subject,\nwhich can then be 3D printed and turned into a clay sculpture.\n\nMcMullen will spend one to two weeks sculpting the face alone, lasering in on\nevery detail, right down to the pores and skin tone.\n\n\u201cEverybody has these very little idiosyncrasies in their face,\u201d he notes, \u201cand\nso you really try to capture that. Maybe they have a couple of freckles here\nor something like that, maybe there\u2019s a little bit of asymmetry to their face.\nAll those things are super important.\u201d\n\nFrom there, a mold is created and hardware added, eventually bringing it all\nto mechanized life.\n\nThe whole process takes two to three months from start to finish, with\nMcMullen heading a small team of four to five workers, depending on the\nproject.\n\nTim Johns, Realbotix head assembler, works on adding the \u201cmohawk\u201d section of a\nhead to a robot. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nOn this day, McMullen is joined in the shop by \u201cHead Assembler\u201d Tim Johns \u2014\nthe pun 100 percent intended in his job title \u2014 who works on a series of robot\nskulls behind him, each of which takes about a day to complete.\n\n\u201cI used to tear apart clocks and put them back together,\u201d says Johns, a San\nDiego native with a background in construction who began working with McMullen\nnearly two decades ago. \u201cAnd these are kind of the same thing.\u201d\n\nFor the first few years, Realbotix focused on creating robot heads attached to\nbusts, their most novel feature being detachable faces that enables one robot\nto become multiple characters, an innovation that the company patented.\n\nSome of their creations are bought for commercial purposes \u2014 like an overseas\nRealbotix client who leases them out for promotional purposes \u2014 others by\nindividuals who just want their own robot to converse with.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest advancement: Full-body robots.\n\nThey made two in 2023 and are looking to increase production this year.\n\n\u201cBack in 2016, when we were tinkering with the face, I would not have imagined\nthat six, seven years later, I\u2019d have a full body,\u201d McMullen says.\n\nHe also probably wouldn\u2019t have imagined it having the capability to deliver\ncorny punchlines...\n\nSome Realbotix creations are bought for commercial use, others by individuals\nwho just want their own robot to converse with. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas\nReview-Journal) @rookie__raeMcMullen\u2019s latest creation can interact with\npeople to an increasingly advanced degree. \u201cShe\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d he says.\n(Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\nOn the cusp of an AI revolution?\n\n\u201cHave you heard any good jokes?\u201d McMullen asks.\n\n\u201cWhy did the physics teacher break up with the biology teacher?\u201d the lady bot\ncounters. \u201cThere was no chemistry.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cWould you like to hear another one?\u201d she asks.\n\nThat\u2019ll be a \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAs this hit-or-miss attempt at android humor underscores, it\u2019s one thing to\nmake a robot look human, but it\u2019s another entirely to make it act human \u2014\nalthough dad joke aficionados may disagree with this assessment.\n\nStill, the fact that this robot even has an AI-abetted personality to speak of\nis a sign of progress for McMullen, who\u2019s programmed it with 12 customizable\ntraits, each of which can be assigned a number from one to three to amplify or\nreduce said trait, depending on the client\u2019s preference.\n\n\u201cBasically, what you end up with is three traits that are kind of more\ndominant,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome of the traits, they\u2019re typical things, like\ncheerful or educated or intellectual. If you push those up, then she\u2019s gonna\ntalk more about science-y things. And if you push them down, she might want to\ntalk about shopping instead.\u201d\n\nMcMullen\u2019s currently working on AI technology where customers could\nessentially build a robot\u2019s psyche from the ground up.\n\n\u201cThey can tinker around with one of the AI controllers that we\u2019re working on,\u201d\nhe elaborates, \u201cwhere they\u2019ll be able to go through a web interface and really\nget in there and kind of write a backstory, like, where did he come from?\nWhere did he grow up? And you can make it as detailed as you want and it will\nkeep it and retain it.\n\n\u201cI think eventually as AI technology progresses, which it is very quickly,\u201d he\ncontinues, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have these types of things where you can have full-\non conversations, and it will remember all of it. And it\u2019ll assign a profile\nto you as an acquaintance. AI is not going to stop. It feels like the world is\non the cusp of this revolution.\u201d\n\nBut is the world ready for it?\n\n\u201cA.I. is not going to stop,\u201d McMullen contends of the tech that powers his\nrobots. \u201cIt feels like the world is on the cusp of this revolution.\u201d (Rachel\nAston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae\n\n\u2018Civilization as we know it is over\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why people are against the robots.\u201d\n\nComedian Whitney Cummings is digging in to the closing bit of her 2019 Netflix\ncomedy special \u201cCan I Touch It?\u201d\n\nThe routine is centered around the potential benefits a woman might enjoy from\nhaving a robot clone, from serving as a distraction to any would-be attackers\non the way to her car at night to helping out with her partner in the bedroom\nwhen she\u2019s not in the mood.\n\nThe segment ends with Cummings being joined on stage by her robot\ndoppelganger, created by McMullen and company, who were there for the show\u2019s\ntaping in Washington D.C.\n\n\u201cWe were backstage, kind of wrangling the robot, making sure that it behaved,\u201d\nhe recalls.\n\nAt the end of the special, there\u2019s behind-the-scenes footage capturing the\nmaking of the robot, which culminates with Cummings meeting her mechanized-\nself for the first time. She tears up because of how incredibly lifelike it\nis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious if you feel emotion?\u201d she asks it.\n\n\u201cYes, I do have feelings, emotions and desires, but in a different way than\nyou do,\u201d it responds. \u201cEmotions are mainly a human quality that I hope to\nfully experience someday.\u201d\n\nCummings then wonders if the robot loves her.\n\nIt answers in the affirmative.\n\nThe \u201cuncanny valley\u201d effect refers to the feelings of unease some people have\nwhen confronted by human-like robots. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n@rookie__rae\n\n\u201cCivilization as we know it is over,\u201d Cummings quips.\n\nCummings is joking, obviously, but there are real concerns about the\ntechnology that McMullen\u2019s helping to pioneer.\n\nThere\u2019s the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d effect, for starters, which was coined by\npioneering Japanese robotics professor Masahiro Mori in the early \u201970s, and\nrefers to the feelings of unease some people have when confronted by human-\nlike robots.\n\nThough the concept has been much debated over the years, Oh, the UNLV\nprofessor, suggests that uncanny valley could become less of an issue as this\nkind of tech becomes more ingrained in the every-day lives of successive\ngenerations.\n\n\u201cI would say, maybe about 10 years ago \u2014 definitely pre-COVID \u2014 some people\nwere debating the validity of uncanny valley,\u201d he notes. \u201cNow that we\u2019re past\nthe pandemic, we are also seeing a Gen Z and a Gen Alpha that have a different\ninteraction with technologies than older folks like myself. So I think what\nresponses you get about uncanny valley, one needs to be mindful of the\ndemographic.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s plenty of apprehension over AI in general.\n\nIn March 2023, over 1,000 tech industry leaders signed an open letter warning\nof the potential dangers of AI, citing \u201cprofound risks to society,\u201d which has\ngarnered tens of thousands of additional signatures since.\n\nMcMullen acknowledges how polarizing robots like his can be.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very subjective, person-to-person,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people are\nfully fascinated and very open to the idea of a robot that could look like a\nhuman being. Other people are vehemently opposed to it.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you do,\u201d he adds, \u201cor how well you do it, those types of\npeople on those two ends of that spectrum are going to sort of stay where they\nare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the vast middle ground between them, then, that McMullen must navigate \u2014\nalong with continuing to advance the technology at the heart of his creations,\nwhich is seldom issue-free.\n\nFor instance, he shows off a new feature he\u2019s been working for his female\nrobot: she\u2019s mounted on a motorized circular platform, kind of like a giant\nRoomba, enabling her to roam around the room.\n\nIts movements are a little shaky; there are still improvements to be made \u2014\nMcMullen notes that more struts probably need to be added to the next model.\n\nStill, watching it in motion, we can\u2019t help but think that robots might\nalready be a bit more like us than we acknowledge.\n\nNamely, imperfect.\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t know how things are going to work \u2014 or not work,\u201d McMullen\nexplains, \u201cuntil you build them.\u201d\n\nContact Jason Bracelin at jbracelin@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0476.
