Current fixations: keyboards, DIY\ntech, and the smart home.\n\nApr 18, 2024, 7:24 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nUrsa is a new keycap profile for Topre keyboards. I want it.\n\nRender: FKCaps\n\nListen, I don\u2019t want to be the guy who always posts about weird keyboard\nstuff. I have other interests. But I need to tell the dozens of Verge readers\nwith Topre keyboards about these keycaps. Ursa is a new spherical doubleshot\nkeycap profile for Topre that is available for group buy until May 15th.\n\nReactions to the previous sentence will likely fall into three camps:\n\n  1. I recognize some of those words\n  2. Already smashed that checkout button\n  3. A keycap group buy? In 2024? In a new profile? For Topre boards? What could go wrong?\n\nI am usually a group three, but today, I am in group two. If you\u2019re in group\none, here is what some of those words mean. Topre keyboards, like the Happy\nHacking Keyboard Professional, use different switches than standard mechanical\nkeyboards. They use little rubber domes with a snappy, top-heavy tactile feel\nthat you can\u2019t really get anywhere else (I\u2019ve tried).\n\nBut Topre is a tiny slice of the massive mechanical keyboard market. Unlike\nstandard MX-style mechanical keyboards \u2014 where keyboard, switch, and keycap\noptions each number in the thousands \u2014 there are only a handful of Topre\nboards out there and a very small number of ways to customize them.\n\nIn addition to the HHKB, Topre switches are also found in Realforce keyboards\nand a few Leopold boards, like my beloved FC660C. With a few exceptions, they\ndon\u2019t work with regular MX-style keycaps, and pickings are slim.\n\nThere are the stock keycaps, which are very good dye-sub PBT but only come in\na few color options. There are a few extremely expensive high-profile keycaps\nfrom discontinued keyboards and some janky aftermarket sets. Most people who\nwant to change out the keycaps on their Topre boards end up putting in MX-\ncompatible sliders.\n\n(If you are wondering why people would spend hundreds of dollars on a keyboard\nthat is perfect right out of the box and then spend a bunch more money\nchanging everything about it, we all have brain worms.)\n\n1/5\n\n1/5\n\nSo, back to Ursa. The Ursa profile was developed by designer Andreas Chlupka\nand manufactured by FKCaps. I\u2019ve been following its development for a couple\nof years now, because I am a creature who likes pretty keycaps. And these are\npretty, with nice sculpted spherical tops and centered legends. They\u2019re the\nfirst doubleshot PBT keycaps available for Topre boards that I\u2019m aware of.\n\nThe Ursa keycaps are available in classic gray and off-white, black with white\nlegends (with optional red or blue modifier keys), and a Minitel 1-inspired\nretro brown, green, and cream. $80 will get you a set that can cover an HHKB\nor an FC660C; it\u2019ll cost $120 to cover a full-sized Realforce. If you don\u2019t\nneed legends (the part that tells you what key it is), a full set of blanks in\neither black or classic will cost $60.\n\nThey\u2019re estimated to ship in Q1 2025, which seems like a long way away but is\nrelatively short in keycap group buy land.\n\nThese Ursa prototypes are 3D-printed. The production versions will have the\nsame shape but only English legends to start.\n\nPhoto: Andreas Chlupka\n\n### What could go wrong?\n\nPlenty of things could go wrong! The FKCaps team seems pretty clear-eyed about\nthe challenges. The most immediate is that if they don\u2019t get enough orders to\npay for the double-shot tooling, they can\u2019t make the keycaps and the group buy\nwill be canceled. Personally, I do not prefer this outcome.\n\nThen there is the group buy model itself, which is common in enthusiast\ncommunities but does require paying for a product well before it\u2019s actually\nmade and trusting the vendor to pay the manufacturer, the manufacturer to make\nthe thing and get it to the vendor, and the vendor to send it to you. Many a\ngroup buy has foundered at one of those stages!\n\nSimon Tarchichi, co-founder of FKCaps, told me via email, \u201cWe understand the\nconditions are not good for a group buy, and we certainly would have done it\ndifferently if we could. That being said, we have experience in producing new\nkeycap profiles, this is our 5th venture (after MBK, HEX, MNT Pocket and SLK)\nand despite the fact that this one is more complex because they are\ndoubleshot, we wouldn\u2019t be collecting customer\u2019s money if we weren\u2019t 100%\nconfident in the outcome.\u201d\n\nThe next challenge, of course, is actually making the keycaps. Right now,\naside from 3D-printed prototypes, FKCaps only has single-shot keycap samples\nfrom their manufacturer, and some of the stems are crooked. This is a common\nproblem with aftermarket Topre caps like the KBDfans set I\u2019m using right now.\nPBT is a tricky material to work with, with lots of shrinkage, so it may take\na few tries to get the stems straight and the legends right, which is why\nFKCaps built in five months to create and refine the tooling. Tarchichi told\nme that the manufacturer is the same one that makes their other keycaps and\nthat it has experience making doubleshot PBT caps, which is reassuring.\n\nI am not going to tell you to buy these keycaps. Group buys are risky, and\nmanufacturing is hard \u2014 FKCaps only resorted to a group buy after it couldn\u2019t\nfind an investor to front the money for what is, after all, an incredibly\nniche product. And nobody needs to spend this kind of money on keycaps for an\nalready expensive keyboard.\n\nI did, though.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  2. ## Google fires 28 employees after sit-in protest over Israel cloud contract\n\n  3. ## The free Delta game emulator for iPhones is live on Apple\u2019s App Store\n\n  4. ## Sony might have perfected Mini LED TVs with its new 2024 lineup\n\n  5. ## Boston Dynamics\u2019 new Atlas robot is a swiveling, shape-shifting nightmare\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Tech\n\n  * ### All the news on Qi2 wireless charging\n\n  * ### Meta says Llama 3 beats most other models, including Gemini\n\n  * ### The Humane AI Pin is lost in translation\n\n  * ### You should be playing Music League\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
