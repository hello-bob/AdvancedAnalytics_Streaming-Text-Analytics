But fisheries managers in New England and the Pacific Northwest\nare recognizing the ecological importance of lampreys in their native waters\nand are stepping up efforts to help them recover.\n\nBy Ted Williams \u2022 April 25, 2023\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n\n\u201cThousands of sea lamprey are passed upstream [on the Connecticut River] each\nyear. This is a predator that wiped out the Great Lakes lake-trout fishery.\n[Lampreys] literally suck the life out of their host fish, namely small-scale\nfish such as trout and salmon. The fish ladders ought to be used to diminish\nthe lamprey.\u201d So editorialized the Lawrence (Massachusetts) Eagle-Tribune on\nDecember 15, 2002.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, why this spring is Trout Unlimited \u2014 the nation\u2019s leading\nadvocate for trout and salmon \u2014 assisting the Town of Wilton, Connecticut and\nan environmental group called \u201cSave the [Long Island] Sound\u201d in a project that\nwill restore 10 miles of sea lamprey spawning habitat on the Norwalk River?\n\nWhy this summer will the first big returns from stocked Pacific lampreys \u2014 a\nspecies similar to sea lampreys \u2014 climb specially-designed lamprey ramps at\nColumbia River dams and surge into historical spawning habitat in Oregon,\nWashington, and Idaho?\n\nAnd why, when the canal at Turners Falls on the Connecticut River is drawn\ndown in September, will the Connecticut River Conservancy, Fort River\nWatershed Association, and the Biocitizen environmental school rescue stranded\nsea lamprey larvae?\n\n> In their native habitat, marine lampreys are keystone species, providing\n> food for everything from insects to eagles.\n\nThe answer is ecological awakening \u2014 the gradual realization that, if the\nwhole of nature is good, no part can be bad. In their native habitat, marine\nlampreys are \u201ckeystone species\u201d supporting vast aquatic and terrestrial\necosystems. They provide food for insects, crayfish, fish, turtles, minks,\notters, vultures, herons, loons, ospreys, eagles, and hundreds of other\npredators and scavengers. Lamprey larvae, embedded in the stream bed, maintain\nwater quality by filter feeding; and they attract spawning adults from the sea\nby releasing pheromones. Because adults die after spawning, they infuse\nsterile headwaters with nutrients from the sea. When marine lampreys build\ntheir communal nests, they clear silt from the river bottom, providing\nspawning habitat for countless native fish, especially trout and salmon.\n\n### NEVER MISS AN ARTICLE\n\nSubscribe to the E360 Newsletter for weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\nSign Up.\n\nEnvironmental consultant Stephen Gephard, formerly Connecticut\u2019s anadromous-\nfish chief, calls lampreys \u201cenvironmental engineers\u201d as important to native\necosystems as beavers.\n\nMarine lampreys, our elders by some 340 million years, depend on cold, free-\nflowing freshwater for spawning. They are boneless, jawless, eel-like fish\nwith fleshy fins. They extract body fluids from other fish via tooth-studded\nsuction disks. Both sea lampreys and Pacific lampreys are widely reviled\nbecause they are perceived as \u201cugly\u201d and because sea lampreys decimated\nindigenous fish in the upper Great Lakes when they gained access to those\nwaters via human-built canals, most likely the Welland Canal that bypassed\nNiagara Falls. Once there, they nearly wiped out valuable commercial and sport\nfisheries for lake trout (the largest char species, not a true trout like\nrainbows, cutthroats, and browns).\n\nA bald eagle carries a sea lamprey snatched from the Connecticut River in\nWindsor, Vermont. Mary Holland / Naturally Curious\n\nBy the 1960s, non-native sea lampreys had reduced the annual commercial take\nof lake trout in the upper Great Lakes from about 15 million pounds to half a\nmillion pounds. In 1955, Canada and the United States established the Great\nLakes Fisheries Commission, which controls lampreys with barriers, traps, and\na remarkably selective larvae poison called TFM. Lamprey control costs $15 to\n$20 million a year; and without it, ongoing lake-trout recovery would be\nimpossible, and populations of all other sport fish would crash.\n\nBut in saltwater, lampreys are in natural balance and deplete nothing. When\nthey run up freshwater streams to spawn they can\u2019t \u201csuck the life out of their\nhost fish\u201d because they go blind and lose their teeth.\n\nThe native habitat of sea lampreys extends from Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico\nand from Norway to the Mediterranean. Native habitat of Pacific lampreys\nextends from the Aleutians to Baja California and from Siberia to Japan.\n\nPacific lampreys are highly valued for food, ceremonies, and medicine by\ntribes in the Pacific Northwest, and these tribes are driving recovery. The\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service now recognizes the Pacific lamprey as a \u201chigh\nconservation risk\u201d in most river basins. The most recent international status\nassessment lists it as \u201ccritically imperiled\u201d in Oregon, Washington, and\nIdaho. And Mexico lists it as \u201cthreatened.\u201d\n\n> As recently as the early 2000s, the Maine fisheries department was capturing\n> and killing spawning sea lampreys.\n\nSea lampreys are a traditional delicacy in Europe. In a fit of royal gluttony,\nKing Henry I of England is said to have died from a \u201csurfeit of lamprey.\u201d In\nSpain, Portugal, and France, they\u2019re still commercially fished. There\u2019s\nrecovery work, especially in Portugal where the species is listed as\n\u201cvulnerable.\u201d\n\nBut in North America, lampreys have been largely ignored as food. And because\nof the Great Lakes catastrophe, appreciation for them is an ongoing process.\nAs recently as the early 2000s the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and\nWildlife was capturing and killing spawning sea lampreys. And it opposed dam\nremoval on the Sheepscot River (completed in 2019) because it would let\nlampreys access historical spawning habitat.\n\nWhen Fred Kircheis was directing the Maine Atlantic Salmon Commission, he\nattributed the department\u2019s persecution of lampreys to \u201cuninformed bias\u201d and\nthe fact that \u201ctransformers\u201d (newly metamorphosed larvae) left scars the width\nof a pencil on a few landlocked salmon in Sheepscot Lake. Usually, he\nexplains, transformers are just hitchhiking by merely sucking onto fish. But\nwhen low water temporarily blocks access to the sea, they occasionally feed.\nwith scant damage to hosts.\n\nToday the department is completely on board with lamprey recovery. On Maine\u2019s\nPenobscot River, lamprey runs are exploding now that the biggest river-\nrecovery project in North America has removed two dams and bypassed a third,\nopening 2,000 additional miles of habitat. Maine researchers report that small\nfish are growing faster and larger around the communal lamprey nests and that\nbrook trout and salmon are spawning in the wide expanses of gravel lampreys\nclear of silt.\n\nLeft: Douglas Nemeth of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service holds a Pacific\nlamprey at a Nez Perce facility in Idaho. Right: Nez Perce biologist Tod Sween\nreleases lampreys into a Columbia River tributary. U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService\n\nThe global leader in both sea-lamprey recovery and education is Connecticut.\nNot only is it removing dams and impassable culverts, it\u2019s the only state\nrestoring extinct sea-lamprey runs by translocating larvae and pre-spawn\nadults. Sea lampreys don\u2019t home to natal rivers like salmon, so when\nConnecticut transfers lampreys to former habitat, the entire Atlantic Coast\nbenefits.\n\n### ALSO ON YALE E360\n\nWarming waters challenge Atlantic salmon, both wild and farmed. Read more.\n\n\u201cConnecticut was the first state to publicly contradict the commonly held\nbelief about sea lamprey and took every opportunity to educate the public and\npromote restoration,\u201d says Gephard. \u201cNo erroneous statements or\nmisrepresentations were left unchallenged. The opposition to sea lamprey\ndisappeared quickly in Connecticut, followed by the other Connecticut River\nstates and finally most of New England.\u201d\n\nWriting in the May 2022 Estuary Magazine, Gephard and his colleague, fisheries\nconsultant Sally Harold, reported what they observed while snorkeling\ndownstream of a communal lamprey nest: \u201cAn entire school of spottail shiners\nis lingering, intimidated by our presence and gobbling any errant eggs that\nare swept past the gravel mound. Dozens of common shiners, the males\ndisplaying vivid flashes of orange on their fins, are darting in and out of\nthe nest, snatching the tiny eggs before they sink to the bottom. Even when an\negg falls amongst the gravel, it may not be safe. As we watch, the heads of\nsmall American eels \u2014 elvers \u2014 protrude from the gravel in search of eggs. A\ntypical lamprey female will produce around 200,000 eggs, so there are enough\nto share.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIn California, we displayed a Pacific lamprey, and a kid from Hoopa tribe\n> said, \u2018That looks delicious.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the Connecticut River\u2019s main stem, Gephard sees the carcasses of spawned-\nout lampreys seething with feeding caddisfly larvae, prime forage for birds\nand dozens of fish species.\n\nSean Ledwin, director of Maine\u2019s Bureau of Sea Run Fish and Habitat, used to\nwork on Pacific lampreys. To illustrate the difference in western and eastern\nperceptions he tells the story of his outreach efforts. \u201cIn Maine,\u201d he says,\n\u201cpeople are horrified when we show them sea lampreys. In California we\ndisplayed a Pacific lamprey in a tank, and a kid from Hoopa tribe said, \u2018That\nlooks delicious.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut outside the tribes, education remains a challenge. \u201cThe general perception\nis that lampreys are ugly, gross, and dangerous,\u201d remarks Christina Wang of\nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Columbia River Fish and Wildlife\nConservation Office. \u201cNewspapers keep running headlines like \u2018Blood-Sucking\nVampire Fish. Save Them or Kill Them?\u2019 People, especially transplants from the\nMidwest, get creeped out by lampreys. I\u2019ve been a lamprey biologist for 20\nyears. When I started the only people who cared about lampreys were the\ntribes. Now we\u2019re getting through to more people. We have an exhibit at the\nOregon Zoo. The general person comes up and says, \u2018Oh, are you trying to get\nrid of them? Are they going to attach to our legs?\u2019 But then we tell them the\nfacts, and they change their minds.\u201d\n\nMembers of Pacific Northwest tribal nations catch lampreys at Williamette\nFalls in Oregon. Gosia Wozniacka / AP Photo\n\nUnlike sea lampreys, Pacific lampreys can climb sheer waterfalls, sucking on\nand resting as they go. But they have trouble with the rough, sharp edges of\ntraditional fish ladders. So the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a partner in\nthe multi-entity Pacific Lamprey Conservation Initiative, has designed near-\nvertical, aluminum lamprey ramps with resting pools that allow a large\npercentage of lampreys to make it over Columbia River dams.\n\nIn the river, Pacific lampreys face swarms of non-native predators like\nsmallmouth bass, striped bass and walleyes, as well as an unnatural\nsuperabundance of native predators created by the impoundments and by the\nlampreys and other sea-run fish massed against the dams. These predators\ninclude sturgeon, sea lions, seals, gulls, terns, cormorants, and northern\npikeminnows. The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission even pays a bounty\non pikeminnows.\n\nPredators, habitat destruction, global warming, and past persecution of\nlampreys \u2014 including by managers using the fish-poison rotenone \u2014 have reduced\nPacific lampreys to the point that the only place the tribes can now legally\ncatch them is Willamette Falls on the Willamette River.\n\nBut the tribes are fighting back. The Nez Perce in Idaho, the Yakama in\nWashington, and Umatilla in Oregon are transferring pre-spawn adults,\ncollected in traps at the three lower Columbia River dams, to depleted habitat\nupstream. And the Yakama and Umatilla raise Pacific lampreys in hatcheries for\nstocking.\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry if native lampreys creep people out,\u201d says one fisheries\n> biologist. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s got to make a living.\u201d\n\nPacific lampreys also differ from sea lampreys in that adults can spend a year\nor two in the river before spawning. This makes transplantation easier. The\nYakama transfer the most but keep a few to maintain hatchery stock.\n\nIt\u2019s working. \u201cLarvae take three to nine years to transform, so we\u2019re just\nstarting to get adults from the ocean from the juveniles we\u2019ve stocked,\u201d says\nRalph Lampman, biologist for the Yakama Lamprey Project. \u201cWe got 20 adults\nback in 2020 but more than 500 in 2022.\u201d This year he\u2019s expecting lots more.\nThe 2023 run will peak in July.\n\nOn both coasts, the greatest education challenge is in Vermont, because the\nstate is killing lampreys with one hand and restoring them with the other. In\nLake Champlain Vermont is engaged in intense lamprey poisoning with TFM. This\nis necessary because even if lampreys are native to Champlain, without control\nthey would annihilate the hatchery-bred strains of salmon and lake trout that\ndidn\u2019t co-evolve with them and that have replaced the native strains\nextirpated long ago by dams, pollution, and overfishing.\n\nBut in the Connecticut River system, Vermont is engaged in equally intense\nlamprey recovery, determining traditional spawning habitat and opening known\nhabitat by removing dams and impassable culverts.\n\n### MORE ON YALE E360\n\nThe East Coast whale die-offs: Unraveling the causes.
