Many of the\nnegative results are translations of abstract complexity bounds from the\ncomputer science literature. I show that these bounds do do not constitute\nproofs that difficult economic calculations are ``impossible'' and discuss the\ntype of hardware and software that can make it possible to solve very hard\nproblems. I discuss four different ways to break the curse of dimensionality\nof economic problems: 1) by exploiting special structure, 2) by decomposition,\n3) by randomization, and 4) by t aking advantage of ``knowledge capital.''\nHowever these four methods may not be enough. I offer some speculations on the\nrole of decentralization for harnessing the power of massively parallel\nprocessors. I conjecture that decentralization is an efficient ``operating\nsystem'' for organizing large scale computations on massively parallel\nsystems. Economies, immune systems and brains are all types of massively\nparallel processors that use decentralization to solve difficult computational\nproblems. However knowledge capital, in the form of effective institutions, is\nnecessary to ensure that decentralization leads to effective cooperation\nrather than anarchy and chaos. I suggest that onereason why economists have\nhad great difficulty computing approximate solutions to detailed models of\nindividual behavior and large scale models of the economy is that they are not\nusing appropriate hardware and software. Economists should structure their\ncomputations to mimic the key operating features of brains and economies,\nusing parallel processing and decentralized `agent-based'' modeling strategies\nto solve more realistic economic models where solutions arise endogenously as\n``emergent computations''.JEL-codes: C8 (search for similar items in\nEconPapers) Pages: 45 pages Date: 1996-10-28, Revised 1997-10-21 Note: TeX\nfile, Postscript version submitted, 45 pages References: View references in\nEconPapers View complete reference list from CitEc Citations: View citations\nin EconPapers (5) Track citations by RSS feedDownloads: (external link)\nhttps://econwpa.ub.uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/comp/papers/9610/9610002.pdf\n(application/pdf) https://econwpa.ub.uni-muenchen.de/econ-\nwp/comp/papers/9610/9610002.ps.gz (application/postscript)Related works: This\nitem may be available elsewhere in EconPapers: Search for items with the same\ntitle.Export reference: BibTeX RIS (EndNote, ProCite, RefMan)\nHTML/TextPersistent link:\nhttps://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wpa:wuwpco:9610002Access Statistics for\nthis paperMore papers in Computational Economics from University Library of\nMunich, Germany Bibliographic data for series maintained by EconWPA\n(volker.schallehn@ub.uni-muenchen.de).| Share  \n---|---  \nThis site is part of RePEc and all the data displayed here is part of the\nRePEc data set.Is your work missing from RePEc?
