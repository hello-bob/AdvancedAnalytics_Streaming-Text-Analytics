For example:\n\n    \n    \n    brew install make gmake && sudo gmake install\n\n## Documentation\n\nAfter installing, you can access the documentation in man page format:\n\n  * man dte\n  * man dterc\n  * man dte-syntax\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Contributor guidelines\n  * Packaging information\n\n## Contact\n\nQuestions and patches may be sent by email, to the address printed by:\n\n    \n    \n    echo ofmisnmfbqgzdfchcbamilkoca | tr zka-hm-t @.m-ta-h\n\n...although GitLab issue reports and merge requests are preferred, when\npossible.\n\nFor general discussion, we also have a #dte channel on the Libera.Chat IRC\nnetwork.\n\n## Donations\n\nDonations can be made via Liberapay. All support is very much appreciated and\nallows me to spend more time working on dte.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013-2024 Craig Barnes.
