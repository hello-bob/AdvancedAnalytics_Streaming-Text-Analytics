Set to\nbe announced on May 7, the OLED iPad Pro models will feature LTPO (a more\npower efficient form of OLED), a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, and a tandem\nstack and glass thinning that will bring \"ultra-thin and light displays\" that\nsupport high brightness, extended battery life, and a long lifetime.\n\nAs has been previously rumored, today's report suggests that the iPad Pro\nmodels will be available in 12.9-inch and 11.1-inch sizes, with both options\nto feature slimmed down bezels and a much thinner design. The 12.9-inch\nversion, for example, will be over 1mm thinner than the current model.\n\nThere is a possibility that the 11.1-inch iPad Pro will be in short supply at\nlaunch because Apple has been dealing with light leakage issues that are not\nimpacting the 12.9-inch model.\n\nAlong with the best OLED display on the market, the iPad Pro models could get\nApple's next-generation AI-optimized M4 chip, and they are expected to ship\nalongside a new Apple Pencil and an updated version of the Magic Keyboard.\nApple will also introduce new 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch LCD iPad Air models.\n\nApple plans to unveil the updated iPads on Tuesday, May 7 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific\nTime.\n\nRelated Roundup: iPad Pro\n\nBuyer's Guide: 11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy), 12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)\n\nRelated Forum: iPad\n\n[ 90 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\ndumastudetto\n\n3 hours ago at 10:15 am\n\n> Don't care.\n>\n> Let us put macOS on it Apple.
