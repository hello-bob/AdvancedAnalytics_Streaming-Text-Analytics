New York City passed new incentives to electrify ride-sharing\nvehicles, which made the situation even worse.\n\nTesla had promised to install 100 additional chargers around the city by the\nend of 2024. Given the latest news, however, those sites will likely never be\nrealized.\n\nOr at least, Tesla won't be operating them. EV charging company Revel has\nalready expressed interest, per Electrek, in taking over three of the four\nsites where initial work had already begun.\n\nIn short, Musk's commitment to a core feature that sets it apart from its\nrapidly growing competition is seriously waning, highlighting just how much\ntrouble the car company is.\n\nThe rest of the car industry has fallen woefully behind, struggling to provide\na reliable \u2014 and fast enough \u2014 way to charge EVs in many parts of the country.\n\nPerplexingly, Tesla is blowing a considerable lead. The carmaker is in a\nunique position, especially considering its fast-charging plug, the North\nAmerican Charging Standard is quickly becoming ubiquitous across other car\nbrands.\n\nTesla is making some drastic changes in a very short amount of time. Even the\nteam designated to develop and market new vehicles was let go in its entirety\nduring the second round of layoffs, which could have major repercussions for\nTesla's alleged plans to build a cheaper passenger car.\n\nMore on Tesla: Tesla Reportedly Laying Off Every Single Employee Working on\nSuperchargers\n\nShare This Article\n\nDown Sized\n\nTesla Fans Furious as Company Fires Supercharger Team, Cancels Supercharger\nLeases\n\nMay 2, 11:40 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nRunning Out of Juice\n\nTesla Reportedly Laying Off Every Single Employee Working on Superchargers\n\nApr 30, 2:46 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nJust Tell Me What You Want\n\nAs Tesla Profits Fall, Elon Musk Says Tesla Will Make a Cheaper Car After All\n\nApr 24, 10:45 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nTarnished Tesla\n\nFired Tesla Workers Say Elon Musk Is in Big Trouble Without Them\n\nApr 22, 9:45 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
