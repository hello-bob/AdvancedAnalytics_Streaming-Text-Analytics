Credit: Nanyang Technological University\n\nResearchers from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore),\nhave created a method that extracts more than 80% of the available protein in\ngrain leftovers from brewing beer, commonly known as brewers' spent grain.\n\nBrewers' spent grain (BSG) is the solid residue from malted barley after\nbrewing beer. It is the most significant byproduct of the beer brewing\nindustry, making up 85% of the total waste. Globally, about 36.4 million tons\nof spent grain are produced every year.\n\nThis spent grain is typically discarded after its primary use in brewing beer.\nWhile some efforts are made to repurpose BSG in applications such as animal\nfeed, biofuel production, or composting, a substantial portion still ends up\nin landfills, generating greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.\n\nAfter exploring new use cases for the BSG proteins, the researchers from NTU's\nFood Science and Technology program say their protein extraction method could\nhelp reduce waste. The extracted proteins could then be used to enrich diets\nand even for cosmetic purposes, feeding into growing consumer preferences\ntowards sustainably sourced and eco-friendly goods, with 66% of global\nconsumers expressing readiness to pay premium prices for products from\nsustainable brands.\n\nThe researchers extracted up to 200 grams of protein from one kilogram of BSG,\nindicating its potential as a protein source. The Singapore Health Promotion\nBoard recommends that the average woman requires 40 grams of protein daily,\nwhile an average adult man needs 56 grams daily.\n\nThe researchers note that BSG proteins are safe for human consumption and of\nhigh quality, making them suitable for direct use in supplements and for\nenhancing the protein content of plant-based foods. The findings were\npublished recently in the journal Innovative Food Science and Emerging\nTechnologies.\n\nGiven the importance of plant-based foods in providing essential proteins to\nour diets, incorporating BSG protein into these foods has the potential to\nenhance their nutritional value significantly. This addition could assist\nindividuals in meeting their daily protein requirements more effectively.\n\nThis would also help mitigate a possible protein shortage due to a forecast\n73% increase in meat consumption by the year 2050 following rapid global\npopulation growth, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUN (FAO).\n\nThe proteins extracted by the NTU researchers were found to be rich in\nantioxidants, which could not only protect human skin from pollutants but\ncould also extend the shelf life of cosmetics like body lotions and\nmoisturizers.\n\nThis could present an eco-friendly alternative to conventional cosmetic\ncomponents such as parabens, which disrupt hormone function in aquatic\norganisms, and petroleum-based ingredients, known to contribute environmental\npollution during extraction and production processes.\n\nSenior author Professor William Chen, Director of NTU's Food Science and\nTechnology (FST) program, who led the study, said, \"Our study, which presents\nmore sustainable and efficient ways to add value to brewers' spent grain\ndisposal, is a crucial step towards mitigating its contribution to greenhouse\nemissions and reducing environmental strain, while also enriching the global\nfood supply chain.\n\n\"Demonstrating that the protein-rich qualities of brewers' spent grain could\nbe successfully extracted and funneled into supplements and enriching plant-\nbased proteins to make them more attractive to the consumer addresses two\nglobal pressure points\u2014food wastage and food shortage.\"\n\nProf Chen is also the Director of the Singapore Agri-food Innovation Lab\n(SAIL) and Director of the Singapore Future Ready Food Safety Hub (FRESH).\n\nFirst author of the study, Dr. Chai Kong Fei, Senior Research Fellow at NTU's\nFST program, said, \"The protein extracted from brewers' spent grain from the\nNTU-developed method has been shown to not only have potential to be included\nin our diets, but they could also serve in another industry\u2014cosmetics.\n\n\"Due to their natural exfoliating properties and abundance of antioxidants, we\nfeel they could be incorporated into various skincare formulations, from\nmoisturizers to body lotions, offering an alternative to chemicals such as\npreservatives, which have been shown to cause damage to wildlife and the\nenvironment after being washed down our sinks.\"\n\nSeveral NTU industry partners have received the NTU innovation positively.\nMirte Gosker, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific, said,\n\"Innovative applications of underutilized grains like those being brewed up at\nNTU have the potential to reduce Singapore's dependence on raw-material\nimports, provide an additional revenue source for local producers, and help\nentrepreneurs craft more nutrient-dense plant-based meats. Amid rising food\ndemand pressures, protein extraction from agricultural side streams is field\nprimed and ready to be tapped.\"\n\nThe study, which presents an innovation that promotes a sustainable food tech\nsolution that reduces waste, reflects NTU's commitment to mitigate our\nenvironmental impact, one of four humanity's grand challenges that the\nUniversity seeks to address through its NTU 2025 strategic plan.\n\n## Unlocking the protein within\n\nThe NTU FST Program collaborated with Heineken Asia Pacific, the producer of\nTiger Beer, using the brewers' spent grain in the study.\n\nTo extract the protein from the spent grain, the researchers first sterilized\nit before using Rhizopus oligosporus, a food-grade fungus commonly used to\nferment soybeans to produce tempeh, a soy-based food popular in Southeast\nAsia. The three-day fermentation process helps break down the BSG's complex\nstructure, making its protein content more easily extractable.\n\nThe fermented BSG is then dried, ground into a powder, sieved, and spun in a\ncentrifuge to separate the protein, which would float to the top from the rest\nof the mixture. Once extracted, the protein could be added to foods to boost\ntheir protein content or combined with lotions or creams to boost their\nmoisturizing and antioxidant properties.\n\nProf Chen added, \"Our method presents an innovative way to repurpose beer\nwaste into a valuable protein source for global nutrition. Beyond mere\ninnovation, our work embodies a narrative of turning what was once considered\nwaste into a vital resource, a symbol of sustainability, and a solution to one\nof humanity's most pressing challenges: protein scarcity.\n\n\"Our endeavor underscores NTU's pioneering role in food technology science and\nour commitment to addressing real-world problems with ingenuity and\nforesight.\"\n\nMore information: Kong Fei Chai et al, Recovery of antioxidative protein\nhydrolysates with functional properties from fermented brewer's spent grain\nvia microwave-assisted three phase partitioning, Innovative Food Science &\nEmerging Technologies (2023).
