The AI arms race has prompted leaders from tech, academia and civil\nsociety to urge caution before developing and deploying ever more advanced AI\nsystems, warning that AI could pose an existential risk to humanity and\nalready poses real threats to human rights and wellbeing. Despite global\npushes to coordinate regulation on AI, military applications have been\nconspicuously absent from many discussions. Leaders at recent talks in Vienna\nwarned autonomous weapons defy traditional means of arms control and that AI\nis fast approaching its \u201cOppenheimer Moment,\u201d a reference to one of the\ninventors of the atomic bomb. While military uses of AI have been a growing\nconcern on the international stage, nuclear weapons have long loomed large\nover international relations and tensions have soared in recent years. The\nKremlin has repeatedly threatened to use its nuclear weapons in Ukraine and\nagainst its enemies, potentially as a first strike, a noteworthy escalation in\nrhetoric. China has also been expanding its nuclear arsenal in recent years,\nthough Beijing says it is committed to a \u201cno-first-strike\u201d policy it is\nactively encouraging other nuclear states to adopt.\n\n## Tangent\n\nThe U.S. formally accused Moscow of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention\nand deploying chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops on Wednesday. In a\nstatement, the State Department said Russia had used chloropicrin against\nUkrainian forces, a chemical that was widely used during World War I but is no\nlonger approved for military use. It is an irritant and choking agent that\ncauses irritation of the lungs, skin and eyes and can cause vomiting and\ndiarrhea, according to the CDC. The State Department said its determination\nadds to previous assessments concluding Russia has used \u201criot control agents\nas a method of warfare in Ukraine,\u201d which also violates the international\ntreaty. \u201cThe use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident, and is\nprobably driven by Russian forces\u2019 desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from\nfortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,\u201d Washington\nsaid. Moscow, which has repeatedly been accused of flouting the treaty with\nchemical attacks in recent years, denied wrongdoing and dismissed the\nallegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n## Big Number\n\n9\\. That\u2019s how many countries in the world possess nuclear weapons, according\nto the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. In addition to the\nfive permanent Security Council members listed above \u2014 the only countries\nofficially recognized as having nuclear weapons by the nuclear\nnonproliferation treaty \u2014 Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea are credibly\nbelieved to possess them. ICANW estimates the states have 12,700 warheads\nbetween them. The vast majority of these lie with Russia and the U.S., who\nrespectively possess around 5,900 and 5,200 nuclear warheads.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nForbesHere's What You Should Do In A Nuclear Attack, Experts SayBy Robert Hart\n\nForbesAI Could Cause Human 'Extinction,' Tech Leaders WarnBy Robert\nHartForbesUN Approves Global AI Rules-Here's What To Know About The US-Led\nResolutionBy Robert Hart\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
