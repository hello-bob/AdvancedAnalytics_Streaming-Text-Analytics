What does it do and what value does it provide\nto your customers?\n\nProjectionHub helps startups and small businesses create financial projections\nfor potential investors and lenders. When a startup or small business is\nlooking to raise capital, an investor or lender will often request financial\nprojections. We provide over 100 industry specific financial projection\nspreadsheet templates. Whether you are starting a trucking business, a\nrestaurant, a SaaS business or an eCom startup, we have a template for you.\n\nIn addition to our templates, we offer services to fill out or customize our\nfinancial projection templates.\n\n## What inspired you to start this business?\n\nI spent over a decade as an SBA (Small Business Administration) lender. As a\nlender, we often asked our clients to provide financial projections. Our\nclients commonly struggled with this request which inspired me to find a\nbetter way to help small businesses and startups create financial projections.\n\n## Can you describe the journey from the idea stage to the actual launch of\nyour business?\n\nInitially, I set out to build a \u201cTurboTax for financial projections.\u201d I\nrecruited my brother who is a Software Engineer to join me and help build this\nsoftware tool. We built an ugly first version of the tool, launched it, and we\nstarted to get paying customers relatively quickly, but we certainly ran into\nsome challenges.\n\n## What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced while building\nyour company?\n\nThe primary challenge that we ran into is that our business model of charging\na monthly fee for a SaaS product didn\u2019t work well when it came to financial\nprojections. Financial projections are a thing that you need at a specific\npoint in time when you are trying to raise capital. Once you secure the\ninvestment or the loan, you no longer need financial projections. Because of\nthis, the product just didn\u2019t make sense as a recurring SaaS product.\n\nAdditionally, as we kept trying to add new features we realized that we were\njust rebuilding features that already exist in Excel. Excel is still quite\npowerful when it comes to financial modeling, so it really didn\u2019t make sense\nto spend all of this time and money developing a tool that essentially\nreplicated what was already possible in Excel.\n\nSo after 8+ years of trying to get the software business to work, we finally\nrealized that we should just lean in to Excel spreadsheets. We started\nbuilding custom spreadsheets for clients. We built a set of projections for a\ncoffee shop client and then we took that spreadsheet and made it work for any\ncoffee shop, turned it into a template, threw up a landing page and put it up\nfor sale.\n\nWithin a couple of years our spreadsheet template sales exceeded our software\nproduct sales, and today our template sales are 15x more per month than our\nbest month ever of software sales.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a recurring SaaS product, but I learned that every product doesn\u2019t\nneed to be a recurring SaaS product in order to have a good business.\n\n## Can you talk about how you use some of the software tools/services to run\nyour business? Which are the most vital?\n\nOur business runs on Hubspot. We moved to Hubspot about 18 months ago and in\nthe process we were able to remove roughly 5 different software tools that we\nused and consolidate all into Hubspot. Hubspot has been vital to the growth of\nour business over the last 18 months as it has allowed us to keep up with the\nincreasing number of customers and keep our communication with customers\norganized and consistent.\n\nWe are also big fans of Loom. Loom allows us to record videos quickly and\nsimply share a link with our customers. We use Loom to demonstrate how to do\nsomething in a spreadsheet and provide customer service quickly and\nefficiently. Our customers are thrilled with our service.\n\nWe have also started to use Loom to record video quotes for custom consulting\nwork. If a client needs a customized financial model we can record a quick\nvideo to demonstrate our approach, introduce ourselves, build trust, and offer\na quote. This has really improved our sales pitch conversion rate.\n\n## Were there any tools or services that didn\u2019t work out for your business?\n\nWe used ClickFunnels for our template sales landing pages initially. It\nactually worked quite well, but as we scaled we wanted to have our template\nlanding pages in Webflow where the rest of our website lived. We moved\neverything over to Webflow about two years ago which has been a good move.\nClickFunnels was a great place to start though!\n\n## What advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs who wish to start\ntheir own business?\n\nI always say, just get started. Just start something in a small way and start\ngenerating revenue. I am an avid podcast listener, but I have certainly\nlearned way more about business by trying and failing and trying again than I\never have in the thousands of hours of podcasts I have listened to. Just get\nstarted with a small, manageable risk and grow from there.\n\n## Social Links/Contact Information:\n\n### adam@projectionhub.com\n\n### LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamhoeksema/\n\n### Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCciYOSvOZI89705ua5Ebm7g\n\n## Discover the stacks behind successful entrepreneurs\n\nFounder Stacks\n\nContactPrivacy PolicyBLOG\n\n", "frontpage": false}
