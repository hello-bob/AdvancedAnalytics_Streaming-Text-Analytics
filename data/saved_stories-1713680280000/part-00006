But, if you want to make a validation, or\na transformation during the set method, for example, you need to declare the\nvariable as private, and create both, set and get method.\n\nThis is not conveniente, so with this RFC we are introduci\u00f3n hooks for\nproperties to override the behaviour of a property.\n\nThis property hooks are inspired by languages like Kotlin, C#, and Swift, and\nthe syntax will be like this:\n\n    \n    \n    class User { public function __construct(public string $first, public string $last) {} public string $fullName { get { return \"$this->first $this->last\"; } set (string $value) { [$this->first, $this->last] = explode(' ', $value, 2); } } }\n\nAnd then you can use this property like this:\n\n    \n    \n    $u = new User('Larry', 'Garfield'); $u->fullName = 'Ilija Tovilo'; echo $u->first; // prints \"Ilija\"\n\n\u2190 Go back to the blog\n\n## Work with me\n\nDo you own a company or need help with your Laravel project?

For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level\ndeveloper now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one\navailable).\n\nAside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all\ntimes, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize.\n\nWith the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as\nyou need to ensure you're only paying your developer when you have work\navailable for them.\n\nNo, once subscribed you're able to request as many things as you'd like, and\nthey will be delivered one by one.\n\nDelivery will always be fast without compromising quality. Very complex\nrequests will be divided into smaller products for continuous delivery.\n\nAlways, before starting to work, we can make a planning so that you know,\nbefore starting, when each change will be delivered.\n\nYou'll work directly with me, the founder and only person behind DeveloperJoy.\n\nWe understand you may not have enough work to fill up entire month. Perhaps\nyou only have one or two requests at the moment. That's where pausing your\nsubscription comes in handy.\n\nBilling cycles are based on 31 day period. Let's say you sign up and use the\nservice for 21 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means\nthat the billing cycle will be paused and you'll have 10 days of service\nremaining to be used anytime in the future\n\nI had experience making products with PHP, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\nAlso I feel really comfortable working with WordPress, Laravel, Symfony,\nVue.js, React, Svelte, and more.\n\nMail me and we will see how best to collaborate.\n\nYou can make this request by email, sharing a task board with me or, depending\non your plan, by call or Slack.\n\nThat's fine. You can pause your subscription when finished and return when you\nhave additional requests needs. There's no need to let the remainder of your\nsubscription go to waste.\n\nDue to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.\n\n\u00a9 2024 DeveloperJoy\n\n  * Pricing\n  * Blog\n  * Contact\n  * Login\n\n", "frontpage": false}
