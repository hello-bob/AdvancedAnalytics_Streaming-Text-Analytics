The trade-offs are\nmore power and heat, which are generally worthwhile.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * +\n\nStrong all-around performance\n\n  * +\n\nTLC at 2TB for single-sided M.2 2230\n\n#### Cons\n\n  * -\n\nRuns a little hotter than desired\n\n  * -\n\nNot particularly power-efficient\n\n  * -\n\nOEM model\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and\ncomparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out\nmore about how we test.\n\nThe WD SN740 is one of the most popular M.2 2230 SSDs available for use in\nportable game systems like the Steam Deck, Steam Deck OLED, ASUS ROG Ally,\nLenovo Legion Go, and more. Despite being an OEM drive, it achieved popularity\nbecause it offered the holy grail: 2TB of TLC NAND flash in a single-sided\nform factor. Most other TLC-based drives cap out at 1TB, while the use of QLC\nflash for 2TB requires compromises on performance. This made the SN740 and its\nrebrands top sellers, with the drive even being offered on Framework. WD would\nlater capitalize on this popularity by releasing the retail WD Black SN770M.\n\nThe WD SN740 remains popular, being widely available even though it's designed\nfor system OEMs. It can often be found at a lower price than the SN770M, and\notherwise the two drives are similar. The hardware on the two drives is the\nsame, but there are some differences such as with the inferior write\nendurance, or TBW, specifications.\n\nThe SN740 has the same faults as the SN770M, too: high power consumption and\nhigh temperatures under load. This can be a problematic combination for\nportable devices, though power-saving features mean the battery life at least\nwasn't compromised in our Steam Deck testing. One potential advantage of the\nSN740 is its optional support for hardware encryption, but that is a rather\nniche demand.\n\nFor PCIe 3.0 devices like the Steam Deck we think QLC flash is quite fine,\nunless you want the very best full-drive performance. For 4.0 devices, which\nis most other portable gaming systems, the SN740 remains viable, particularly\nif you want the best performance at 2TB. However, future M.2 2230 and 2242\ndrives look to supplant the SN740 and SN770M by offering equal or better\nperformance at up to 2TB or more. These drives, like the existing TLC-based\noptions that top out at 1TB, will be more efficient and cool-running than the\nSN740, which should be factored into any purchase decision.\n\n## WD SN740 specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\n\nProduct| 256GB| 512GB| 1TB| 2TB  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPricing| $17.99+| $55.00+| $79.95+| $155.00+  \nForm Factor| M.2 2230 (SS), M.2 2280| M.2 2230 (SS), M.2 2280| M.2 2230 (SS),\nM.2 2280| M.2 2230 (SS), M.2 2280  \nInterface / Protocol| PCIe 4.0 x4 / NVMe 1.4| PCIe 4.0 x4 / NVMe 1.4| PCIe 4.0\nx4 / NVMe 1.4| PCIe 4.0 x4 / NVMe 1.4  \nController| SanDisk 20-82-10081-A1| SanDisk 20-82-10081-A1| SanDisk\n20-82-10081-A1| SanDisk 20-82-10081-A1  \nDRAM| N/A (HMB)| N/A (HMB)| N/A (HMB)| N/A (HMB)  \nMemory| WD/Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5)| WD/Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5)|\nWD/Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5)| WD/Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5)  \nSequential Read| 4,000 MB/s| 5,000 MB/s| 5,150 MB/s| 5,150 MB/s  \nSequential Write| 2,000 MB/s| 4,000 MB/s| 4,900 MB/s| 4,850 MB/s  \nRandom Read| 270K| 460K| 740K| 650K  \nRandom Write| 470K| 800K| 800K| 800K  \nSecurity| TCG Pyrite 2.01/Opal 2.01| TCG Pyrite 2.01/Opal 2.01| TCG Pyrite\n2.01/Opal 2.01| TCG Pyrite 2.01/Opal 2.01  \nEndurance (TBW)| 200TB| 300TB| 400TB| 500TB  \nPart Number| SDDPNQD/PTQD/QNQD/QTQD-256G| SDDPNQD/PTQD/QNQD/QTQD-512G|\nSDDPNQD/PTQD/QNQD/QTQD-1T00| SDDPNQD/PTQD/QNQD/QTQD-2T00  \nWarranty| 5-Year| 5-Year| 5-Year| 5-Year  \n  \nThe WD SN740 is an OEM drive with a decent capacity range, from 256GB to 2TB.\nThis allows more flexibility than the retail Black SN770M, which starts at\n500GB, though most gaming portables would be better off with a higher\ncapacity. There's also a small difference in marketed capacity, for example\nbetween 500GB on the SN770M and 512GB on the SN740. This is due to the SN740\nhaving less overprovisioning, which does mean that it will have more user\nspace available. This should not significantly impact performance or\nendurance.\n\nThe SN740 is an OEM drive so pricing will vary, but you can find a rebranded\nSN740 2TB on Amazon for $159. We purchased our test drive from AliExpress for\n$122, if you're willing to go that route. Either way, it's typically less\nexpensive than the WD Black SN770M 2TB at $209 \u2014 with the drawbacks of not\nbeing a retail part and the lack of a manufacturer warranty.\n\nThe SN740 mostly performs the same as the SN770M, or the desktop M.2 2280 WD\nSN770 for that matter. Sequential performance tops out at 5,150/4,900 MB/s for\nreads / writes and the drive can hit up to 740K / 800K random read / write\nIOPS. Things deviate with the expected lifespan, as the SN740 has lower TBW at\nall capacities than its retail counterpart. This includes only 500TB written\nat 2TB, compared with 1200TB on the SN770M. Luckily, write endurance under\nwarranty isn\u2019t particularly important for this type of drive.\n\nAnother place the SN740 deviates is with it having SKUs that support hardware\nencryption through Opal 2.01. This is optional as the base SKUs are only TCG\nPyrite 2.01 compatible, so be sure to look carefully at the model number if\nyou are seeking hardware encryption support.\n\n## WD SN740 software and accessories\n\nThe WD SN740 is an OEM drive, so normally you would not expect much if any\nsoftware support. WD\u2019s Digital Dashboard lists specific support for Black, or\nWD_BLACK, SSDs like the Black SN770 and SN770M. The SN740 has the same\nhardware, though, and the Digital Dashboard does work with other SSDs.\n\nWD also offers an OEM version of Acronis True Image but this also specifies\nBlack SSDs. Luckily, there are free applications available for imaging and\ncloning if that doesn\u2019t work for you. If you want to be completely sure about\nyour drive being supported, buy a retail SN770M or a vendor-supported SN740.\n\n## WD SN740 \u2014 A closer look\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nOur SN740 sample is \u201cSDDP\u201d which indicates it does not support TCG Opal. This\ncan be verified on WD\u2019s site. This drive comes in both M.2 2230 and 2280 forms\nas well, so if you\u2019re looking for encryption in the latter form factor you can\nget that with the SN740. In all cases, the drive is single-sided.\n\nThe label indicates the drive could pull up to 8W or more, but WD rates it for\n6.3W peak and the highest power state by SMART is 5.4W. We\u2019ll check in on the\npower consumption later in our testing.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe SN740 has an SSD controller and a single NAND flash package, without any\nDRAM present. It\u2019s not common to find DRAM on M.2 2230 drives unless it\u2019s part\nof an embedded package. That makes hitting 2TB more difficult, particularly\nwith TLC flash, but DRAM is not explicitly required for SSDs. When physical\nspace and simplicity are at a premium, this can be a worthwhile trade-off.\n\nThe 2TB SN740\u2019s flash package has sixteen 1Tb BiCS5 dies. These are special\nBiCS5 dies with an interface speed of 1600 MT/s, allowing the SN740 to hit up\nto 5 GB/s or more with just a four-channel controller. This isn\u2019t as exciting\nas it used to be, as there are now faster drives in this segment, but it\u2019s\nmore than enough to saturate a PCIe 3.0 device like the Steam Deck.\n\nThis hardware is the same as found on the popular SN770 and SN770M, and while\npowerful it's also starting to show its age. In particular, the SN740 is not\nas cool-running or as power-efficient as drives using newer hardware. This is\nmore of a concern when packed into a small form factor designed for a portable\ndevice.\n\nMORE: Best SSDs\n\nMORE: Best Hard Drive\n\nMORE: Best SSD for the Steam Deck\n\nWD SN740 (2230) 2TB SSD: Price Comparison\n\n12 Amazon customer reviews\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n$165\n\n$153\n\nView\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\npowered by\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n\nCurrent page: WD SN740 Features and Specifications\n\nNext Page WD SN740 2TB Performance Results\n\nShane Downing\n\nFreelance Reviewer\n\nShane Downing is a Freelance Reviewer for Tom\u2019s Hardware US, covering consumer\nstorage hardware.\n\nLatest\n\nAlibaba's Yitian 710 is the fastest Arm-based CPU for cloud servers, study\nclaims\n\nNASA demonstrates space network speeds of up to 267 Mbps \u2014 Deep Space Optical\nCommunications stretch beyond 140 million miles\n\nChinese vendor appears to be selling Arrow Lake-S engineering samples for $14\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\n8 Comments Comment from the forums\n\n  * HideOut\n\nShouldnt the endurance go up in a ratio the same as the storage pool size? 2TB\nshould be double of 1, 1 should be double of 512 and such.

A few\nseconds brought me to the specs pages:\nhttps://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/pc-\nsn740-ssd?sku=SDDPNQE-2T00 And sure enough, WD has some curious numbers.\n200TBW for 256GB, up to 500TBW for 2TB. Why? Because this is an OEM drive, and\nso the requirements are different. Apparently, WD doesn't want to give a\n\"reasonable\" TBW guarantee on larger models of the SN740. If you took the\n200TBW for the 256GB and scaled it, that would be 1600TBW for the 2TB model,\nwhich would be more than what you get on the SN770M. \ud83e\udd37\n\nRealistically, I doubt there's a \"drop dead\" setting in the firmware, so the\ndrives will work as long as they can, and that likely means the 2TB SN740 can\ndo far more than the listed 500TBW. But it's not guaranteed.\n\nReply\n\n  * Avro Arrow\n\nThe power difference between the WD SN740 (2.5W/GB) and the Corsair MP600\n(1.7W/GB) is pretty substantial. We're talking a difference of 800W/TB and\nthat can add up pretty quick.\n\nHaving said that, they're SSDs and as such are already remarkably efficient\ncompared to the old platter and optical drives.\n\nReply\n\n  * Aragorn\n\nThats actually a total power of 2500Ws/TB (that's 2500WattSeconds or .694Wh to\nwrite a TB extrapolation from that graph, a non-negligible but still small\namount of power. (Edited for bad math, missing a 10^3)\n\nReply\n\n  * Notton\n\nI figured the TBW endurance was low, because it was a 2230 drive. Sabrent\nrocket Q4 2230 2TB also only has 450TBW.\n\nWhen looking at the WD SN770 2TB, it has a similar chip configuration. 1x\ncontroller and 1x 2TB density NAND. However, it gets an endurance of 1200TBW.\n\nI wonder if the rating for 2230 versions are so low due to heat?\n\nReply\n\n  * JarredWaltonGPU\n\n> Notton said:\n>\n> I figured the TBW endurance was low, because it was a 2230 drive.

Great to see Tom's add this to your 2230 lineup.\n\nMy main critique is this review is lacking a stronger discussion around\npricing. GB/$ is king for most when looking at purchasing a drive, and this\nbeats every other drive by min of $30 to 2x the price while offering\ncomparable performance. The main drawback is OEM so good luck with a warranty\nif you need it... But many of us are comfortable with this, evident by us\npurchasing a drive off Aliexpress, won't lie as I was very worried about it\nbeing some fake drive for the price initially. Other point of contention, the\n1TB are great for benchmark comparison, but they truly are a separate class,\nso the suggestion of purchasing BC711 doesn't make sense to me as it has no\n2tb entry, would be a fairer fight to compare the sn740 1tb entry as I suspect\nits performance and efficiency profile may improve(Sacrifices were made to\ncram 2tb in this form factor). When we are in the 2tb class we are here\nbecause we need/desire the space.\n\nIt was great to see this drive sometimes beat the SN770M(at a fraction of the\nprice) as well as having equivalent real world performance and battery life\n(which one would not expect from its poor efficiency showing). Also thank you\nfor the in-depth sustained write performance data, really found the\ninconsistent performance intriguing as it seems to be capable of flushing the\ncache, speed returns only to fill it back up again and throttle down. The\ninitial performance of the S91 is amazing on QLC, can't wait to see what WD\ncan do with an update, but this might be the end of TLC, I would expect them\nto follow QLC for the next release... I can't seem to find it anywhere but I\nwould be interested in seeing what max temp was seen during the sustained\nwrite performance for each drive, gives a good indication on how the\ncontroller is tuned for performance and how important cooling is to maintain\npeak capabilities.\n\nThanks again to adding this to your line up of 2230 drives! Will be a great\nbaseline going forward to compare against as we get newer entries into this\nsmall form factor space(I sure hope we see 4TB drives or pcie gen 5 entries\neven though both in this form factor is a bit absurd:cheese:). What we really\nneed is someone brave enough to integrate a solid state fan (airjet) with\nthese solid state drives (Throw power consumption out the window, make it PCIE\ngen 5 and set some records). I don't expect it to sell well, Optane didn't, as\nstorage is too price sensitive of a space but like drag racing, it is a fun\nhobby.\n\nReply\n\n  * JarredWaltonGPU\n\n> cyrusfox said:\n>\n> Superb review!

The SN740 reports three different temperatures in HWiNFO64,\nand they're all quite high. The first and third numbers appear to be the same\nand peaked at 91C in our write saturation test, while the second number peaked\nat 101C. Yeah, that's hot. The good news is that in PCIe 3.0 mode the temps\nwere MUCH lower: 62C on the first and third columns, and 74C on the second\ncolumn.\n\nThe WD SN770M seems to have been tuned to be a bit better on thermals, with\nthe first and third columns at 85C peak and 95C for the second column when\noperating in PCIe 4.0 mode. Again, PCIe 3.0 greatly reduces thermals and it\npeaked at 70C / 80C \u2014 so hotter in PCIe 3.0 mode than the SN740, but cooler in\nPCIe 4.0 mode. \ud83e\udd37\n\nThe QLC NAND and Phison E21T combination incidentally tends to hit max temps\nof around 65~70C in the same write saturation testing. Obviously, being able\nto write at much higher sustained speeds with TLC is a big part of that.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nRazer Blade 14 (2024) review: Small frame, full power, high price\n\nIntel Core i5-14400 Review: Intel's value gaming chip falls behind AMD\n\nAlienware AW2725DF 360 Hz OLED gaming monitor review: OLED for hardcore\nplayers\n\nDell XPS 16 (9640) and XPS 14 (9440) review: New looks and great performance\ncombined with a few quirks\n\nAsus ROG Swift PG49WCD 49-inch gaming monitor review: The most colorful OLED\nyet\n\nLogitech G Pro X 60 Lightspeed Review: Compact and Customizable\n\niBuyPower Y60 Gaming Desktop Review: Premium Mainstream Performance\n\nLinksys Velop Micro 6 mesh router review: Wi-Fi 6 with pint-sized nodes and\nmeager performance\n\nCreality K1C Review: C for Carbon\n\nInland TN470 SSD review: Efficient, fast, and inexpensive\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 12) Review: Light in Weight, Heavy in AI\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
