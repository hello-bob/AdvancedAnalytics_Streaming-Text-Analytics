Gitlin - 4/30/2024, 1:20 PM\n\nEnlarge / Tesla is laying off around 500 staff who have worked on its\nSupercharger network, plus its new vehicle development team and its public\npolicy team.\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n263\n\nThere's more chaos at Tesla this week. The Information reports that last\nnight, the company's erratic CEO Elon Musk emailed workers with the news that\nhe has dismissed a key pair of executives\u2014one responsible for the Supercharger\nnetwork, and the other head of new vehicle development.\n\nThe electric car maker posted its quarterly results last week and they paint a\npoor picture, with shrinking sales and plummeting profit margins. While Tesla\nonce had a strong first-mover advantage and benefited from Musk's marketing\nsavvy, the company has frequently ignored the many hard-learned lessons of the\nauto industry.\n\nCustomers not turned off by Musk's antics instead are losing interest with a\nproduct line up of two EVs that are ancient in car years (the Models S and X)\nand two EVs that are merely old (the Models 3 and Y). The Models 3 and Y are\nalso the only two vehicles that Tesla sells in volume. Any other automaker\nwould have a second-generation Model 3 ready to go either this year or next,\nbut at Tesla the product pipeline is empty.\n\nAnd yet, Tesla is not just laying off Daniel Ho, director of vehicle programs\nand new product introduction, but also his entire team.\n\n## \"Hard-core about headcount\"\n\nEven Tesla's harshest critics must concede that the company's Supercharger\nnetwork is its star asset. Tesla has more fast chargers in operation than\nanyone else, and this year has opened them up to other automakers, which are\nadopting the J3400 plug standard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of which makes the decision to get rid of senior director of EV charging\nRebecca Tinucci\u2014along with her entire team\u2014a bit of a head-scratcher. If I\nwere the driver of a non-Tesla EV expecting to get access to Superchargers\nthis year, I'd probably expect this to result in some friction. Musk told\nworkers that Tesla \"will continue to build out some new Supercharger\nlocations, where critical, and finish those currently under construction.\"\n\nMany Tesla fans had been holding out hope that Musk would debut a cheap Model\n2 EV in recent weeks. Instead, the tycoon promised that robotaxis would save\nthe business, even as both of its partially automated driver assistance\nsystems face recalls and investigations here in the US and in China.\n\nDelivering on that goal is more than just a technical challenge, and will\nrequire the co-operation and approval of state and federal authorities. But\nMusk is also dissolving the company's public policy team in this latest cull.\n\n\"Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely\nhard-core about headcount and cost reduction. While some on exec staff are\ntaking this seriously, most are not yet doing so,\" Musk wrote to employees.\nMusk also told staff that he would ask for the resignation of any executive\n\"who retains more than three people who don't obviously pass the excellent,\nnecessary and trustworthy test.\"\n\nEarlier this month Tesla engaged in another round of layoffs that decimated\nthe company and also parted ways with longtime executive Drew Baglino, who was\nresponsible for Tesla's battery development.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n263\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
