For us, that means bringing in people with different\nbackgrounds, different experience, different insights, different knowledge,\nand creating a team where all of us can play our part. For us, it's clear that\nthat diversity is mission critical.\n\n\u201cWe're on a journey to make sure that we reach out and connect to people\nwho've never thought of working with us. And today we're launching on LinkedIn\nas a way of starting to showcase a little bit more of the work that we do and\nsome of the amazing people who work at GCHQ.\"\n\nAs part of our launch, and in true GCHQ-style, we've also released a new\nvisual puzzle. The new puzzle has been co-created with Manchester-based\nartist, Justin Eagleton, to celebrate our presence in Manchester city centre,\nin addition to a hub in London and headquarters in Cheltenham.\n\nPuzzles are at the heart of our vital work. These skills represent our\nhistoric roots in cryptography and encryption and continue to be important to\nour modern-day mission to keep the country safe.\n\nWe offer a breadth of different careers, from intelligence analysts and data\nscientists to business support and engineers - and having a degree isn\u2019t\nalways a key requirement.\n\nWe're encouraging LinkedIn users to tackle the puzzle and share their progress\non our new LinkedIn page.\n\n## Topics\n\nBack to top\n\nDownload / Print article PDF\n\n##### Share\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\n##### Share\n\n##### Facebook\n\n##### Linkedin\n\n##### Twitter\n\n##### Copy Link\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\n##### Share\n\n##### Facebook\n\n##### Linkedin\n\n##### Twitter\n\n##### Copy Link\n\n  * ##### Published\n\n    * 13 March 2024\n\n  * ##### News Type\n\n    * General news\n\n  * ##### Published\n\n    * 13 March 2024\n\n  * ##### News Type\n\n    * General news\n\nBack to top\n\n## Also see\n\nNEWS\n\n  * 14 December 2023\n\n#### The GCHQ Christmas Challenge 2023\n\nThe GCHQ Christmas Challenge returns, and this year's is our toughest yet!\n\nINFORMATION\n\n#### The GCHQ National Language Competition 2024\n\nINFORMATION\n\n#### North West Partnership for Security and Trust\n\n## Follow Us\n\n## MISSION\n\n  * Overview\n  * Counter Terrorism\n  * Cyber Security\n  * Serious and Organised Crime\n  * Strategic Advantage\n  * Support to Defence\n\n## CULTURE\n\n  * Belief & values\n  * Life at GCHQ\n  * Diversity & inclusion\n  * Education & Outreach\n  * Giving back\n  * Awards\n\n## LOCATIONS\n\n  * Cheltenham\n  * Scarborough\n  * Bude\n  * Manchester\n  * London\n\n## HISTORY\n\n  * Our origins & WWI\n  * Bletchley Park & WWII\n  * 1950s onwards\n  * People from our past\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n  * Leadership\n  * Accountability\n  * Legal Framework\n  * Oversight\n\n## CAREERS\n\n  * Working for GCHQ\n  * Current Opportunities\n\n## SERVICES AND INFORMATION\n\n  * Media Centre\n\n## GENERAL\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Cookies\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms and Conditions\n\n## USEFUL LINKS\n\n  * NCSC\n  * FCDO\n  * GOV.UK\n  * MI5\n  * SIS\n\n## Search\n\n### Popular searches\n\nCareers\n\nPuzzles\n\nHistory\n\n", "frontpage": false}
