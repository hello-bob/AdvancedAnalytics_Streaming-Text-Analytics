Work\nalongside data managers and statisticians, familiarizing yourself with common\ndocuments and procedures. Produce four Clinical Study Reports (CSRs), one for\neach Mock Trial, facing hidden challenges found in real scenarios. For each\nstudy, get direct feedback from lead programmers during code review, dry runs,\nand interim analyses as we approach \"database lock\", where final reports are\nsubmitted for scoring.\n\nGet Certified\n\nPrepare for three certification exams with hands-on practice: 1. Base SAS\nSpecialist Programming 2. SAS Clinical Trials Programming 3. CDISC Tabulate\nOur online resources and on-site staff are available to support your progress.\nNote: It's advised to achieve at least one certification before Orientation\nDay due to the program's rapid pace. EDA has no affiliation with SAS or CDISC.\n\nGet Interviewed\n\nAfter receiving your exam scores and completing your Clinical Study Reports\n(CSRs), you will respond to \"information requests\" from interviewers. These\nrequests simulate real-life situations where regulatory agencies question a\nstudy sponsor's submission. They offer a chance to showcase your comprehension\nof the analysis, trial result accuracy, and adherence to submission standards.\nCompanies aim to impartially evaluate your skills as a statistical programmer\nin clinical trial contexts. Our controlled simulations serve this exact\npurpose.\n\nGet Hired\n\nWe want to establish long-term working relationships. After your interviews,\nrank your opportunities using various criteria to help us identify where\ninterests align, and then select from your top matches. You will also have the\nopportunity to consult with our advisors and connect with our partners at\nsponsored events. We will help you build networks, interview, and improve your\njob search even after graduation and job placement!\n\n# Deliver Results\n\n##### Each deliverable becomes an opportunity for you to improve components of\neach Clinical Study Report before their final due date.\n\n##### \"Collecting data from multiple remote sources may require strong data\nmanagement skills and data management platforms.\"\n\nLeonard Sacks, MD, Associate Director for Clinical Methodology in CDER\u2019s Office of Medical Policy The Evolving Role of Decentralized Clinical Trials and Digital Health Technologies | FDA\n\n## Structured\n\nAvoid the pitfalls of online learning and experience a structured atmosphere\nthat is tailored to onboard you into a specific job\n\n  * Ensure you remain on course with our daily meetups and open office hours while receiving weekly reports to celebrate your progress.\n\n  * Deliver four comprehensive clinical study reports with your teammates, spanning across all four phases of clinical research and exploring diverse therapeutic areas.\n\n  * Apply data standards and execute statistical analysis plans to prepare for examinations and earn widely recognized and highly valued certifications.\n\n  * Use your credentials to confidently present and defend your results during the interview process, paving the way to a new career in clinical research.\n\nHow It Works\n\nRealistic\n\nYour portfolio at EDA represents the components of the Clinical Study Report,\na comprehensive document that summarizes the results and findings of a\nclinical trial.\n\n  * Follow standard operating procedures which represent the same processes that employers have.\n\n  * Utilize special tools for data management, programming and development, not publicly available although well-established in industry.\n\n  * Access authentic study documents, including Statistical Analysis Plans and protocols, to produce CSRs that are verified for accuracy and compliance, akin to genuine clinical trial submissions.\n\n  * Address \"unexpected\" errors strategically designed to hone critical thinking skills and equip candidates for handling interviews.\n\nFile Share\n\nProfessional\n\nUnderstand the wide and varied responsibilities of a statistical programmer\nalongside other members of the study team\n\n  * Each study is assigned a lead programmer who offers one-on-one mentorship to help you achieve your goals, learn effective programming practices, stay focused, and master the delivery of first-time quality work.\n\n  * Apprentices collaborate with Statisticians and Data Managers to ensure deliverables are completed with a high level of confidence in their quality.\n\n  * Our network of mentors help you plan, search, interview, and negotiate successfully \u2014 available even after you complete the program, whenever you are ready for your next challenge.\n\n  * Connect with fellow Apprentices online where you can access forums, share files, and receive feedback on your projects.\n\nForum\n\n# Transform clinical data into life-saving solutions\n\n##### Managing clinical data from the start to the finish of a trial offers\nthe appropriate context for programmers who are new to the field.\n\nPhase I Study: mRNA Vaccine plus Immunotherapy in Subjects with Solid Tumors\n\nPhase I studies typically recruit healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety,\ntolerability, and pharmacokinetics of new treatments. However, Phase I\noncological studies often enroll patients who have exhausted standard\ntreatment options for advanced or metastatic cancer. In this study exploring a\ntherapeutic combination of an mRNA vaccine and immunotherapy, researchers hope\nto enhance anti-tumor activity, minimize toxicity, and delay or prevent\ndisease progression.\n\nPhase II Study: Immunogenicity, Safety and Tolerability of Chikungunya Vaccine\nin Healthy Subjects\n\nPhase II studies evaluate promising treatments with more patients. They\ntypically recruit patients with the specific disease or condition of interest.\nHowever, when developing a vaccine against a mosquito-borne virus, the\ntreatment will ultimately be administered to healthy subjects at risk of\ninfection, in order to keep them healthy by preventing the target disease.\nTherefore, healthy volunteers are recruited to test the vaccine's safety and\ntolerability, as well as its immunogenicity - which is key to its ability to\nprevent infection.\n\nPhase III Study: Non-invasive Device to Alleviate Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a\nDecentralized Trial\n\nMedical devices exist for a multitude of uses, from diagnostics to prevention\nand treatment. Unlike pharmaceuticals, which often undergo rigorous phase III\nclinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy, the regulatory pathway for\nmedical devices varies based on factors such as the risk classification of the\ndevice and the specifics of its intended use. In some cases, clinical data\nfrom smaller studies or bench testing may be sufficient to support marketing\napproval for lower-risk devices.\n\nPhase IV Study: Anticoagulant Treatment in Routine Clinical Practice in\nPatients with Venous Thromboembolism\n\nPhase IV studies, also known as post-marketing surveillance trials, assess the\nreal-world effectiveness and safety of treatments after they have been\napproved and are in widespread clinical use. Typical Phase IV studies involve\na larger patient population and longer follow-up periods to gather data on\nrare adverse events and better understand the treatment's performance in\nroutine clinical practice.\n\n# Orientation Day Pittsburgh, PA\n\nPittsburgh has world-class facilities and a supportive technical community.\nCarnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh are famous\nfor their cutting-edge research in robotics, AI, biotechnology, and\nhealthcare. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Allegheny\nHealth Network are actively engaged in clinical trials.\n\nAny questions?\n\nYou can reach us Monday to Friday from 8am - 6pm EST by calling +1 412 405\n1447\n\nLimited Seats\n\nApply Now\n\nLearn More\n\nCopyright 2024\n\n###### Contact\n\n#### Main Office\n\n#### Four Smithfield Street\n\n#### Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA Call Us +1 412 405 1447\n\nGeneral Inquiries\n\ninfo@edaclinical.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 EDA Clinical.
