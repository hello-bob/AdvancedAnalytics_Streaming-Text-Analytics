This genre of anime is called\nrobot anime or mecha anime. Well-known robot anime series include Nagai Go\u2019s\nMazinger series, Tomino Yoshiyuki\u2019s Gundam series, Kawamori Shoji\u2019s Macross\nseries, and Anno Hideaki\u2019s Evangelion series. These anime robots take the\ngeneral humanoid form, which resembles the human body because they usually\nhave a head with eyes (sometimes even nose and mouth), one torso, two arms,\nand two legs. Anime robots are categorized into two groups: super robot (Fig.\n1A) and real robot (Fig. 1B) (Wikipedia, 2024). In general, super robots are\nimaged as gigantic superheroes with incredible powers, and real robots are\ntreated as mass-produced weapons governed by seemingly realistic technological\nlimitations.\n\nFigure 1.

Source: Cattic\u2019s Workshop\n(https://blog.naver.com/whitesav/221907083584).\n\nThe two anime robot groups contrast to each other quite distinctively from\nmechanical engineering perspectives as follows (TV Tropes 2024a, 2024b). The\ncommon features of super robots include: (1) super robots are often the\ncreations of mad scientists and engineers who work alone or as a small team,\naliens, or an ancient civilization; (2) super robots are usually gigantic and\npowered by mystical energy sources; (3) super robots are controlled by a\nrelatively simple system such as a handful of buttons and a joystick, motion\ncapture, voice command, or direct link to the mind or brain of the pilot; and\n(4) the motion of super robots is unrealistically humanlike, such as running,\njumping, and kicking (Fig. 1A).\n\nBy contrast, realism is emphasized for the real robot group, although they are\nstill fictional. The common features of real robots are: (1) real robots are\ndesigned, developed, tested, and mass-produced by governments or large\ncommercial corporations; (2) real robots are often developed through stages of\nprototype, test-type, and mass-production types; (3) real robots rely on\nlargely conventional, yet futuristic, power sources; (4) real robots require\nperiodic extensive maintenance and the logistics to supply fuel, ammunition,\nand spare parts; (5) real robots happen to malfunction and break down; (6)\nreal robots use scaled-up and advanced versions of infantry ranged weapons,\nwhich require ammunition cartridges; and (7) real robots use an elaborate\nsystem of controls for manual operation. As such, real robots are usually\nsmaller and less powerful than super robots.\n\nJapanese anime robots have various sizes, ranging from a few meters to several\nhundred meters (Fig. 1C). Similarly, their mass varies over a wide range. As\nresearchers and educators in mechanical engineering, we question whether there\nexists any relationship between the height and mass of anime robots. As such,\nthe main research question of this study is whether anime robots show any\nscaling relationship between their height and mass and whether anime robots\nare isometric or allometric.\n\nISOMETRY VS ALLOMETRY\n\nA scaling relationship between size and mass can be exemplified by the\nfollowing cube example (McMahon & Bonner, 1983; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984; Vogel,\n2013). In this example, we are going to find a relationship between the size\nand mass of cubes of various sizes. As shown in Fig. 2A, we start with a cube\nwith the height of 1. The volume of this unit cube is 1, and if the density of\nthe cube is assumed to be 1, then the mass of the cube is 1. The next step in\nthis example is to double the height of the cube by stacking up eight unit\ncubes. Simply, the second cube is two times larger than the unit cube in terms\nof the size. However, its volume, and thus mass, have increased by a factor of\n8 (= 2^3). As the cube size is tripled, the height and mass of the cube\nbecomes 3 and 27, respectively.\n\nFigure 2. Isometric cubes. A. Cube stacks of increasing height with the same\nproportion. B. Linear scale plot of height and mass. C. Logarithmic scale plot\nof height and mass.\n\nFigure 2B visualizes how the mass of the cube (m) increases with the height\n(h). As h increases from 1 to 10, m increases from 1 to 1,000. Since the data\npoints form a curvy alignment, it is hard to find any clear relationship\nbetween m and h. When the same data are plotted in the logarithmic scale as\nshown in Figure 2C, all the data points are aligned on a single straight line.\nBecause the slope of the line is 3, this line means log(m) ~ 3log(h), which is\nequal to m ~ h^3. Thus, the scaling relationship between the mass and height\nof the cubes is found to be m ~ h^3. This scaling relationship is known as the\ncube law (Froese, 2006).\n\nThe found relationship means that as the size of the cube increases, its mass\nalso increases when a constant density is assumed. This finding is quite\nobvious because the mass of a cube with the height h is proportional to its\nvolume h^3. Thus, it can be easily found that when the cube size increases by\na factor of n, its mass increases by a factor of n^3. The found relationship\nis called geometric isometry, and the cubes are isometric because their shapes\nare identical with the same proportion regardless of their size.\n\nIsometry is also found for the human body. According to data collected by\nvarious life insurance companies, the following relationship was found between\nthe height and mass of humans: m ~ h^2.9 (McMahon & Bonner, 1983). It is\nnoticeable that the scaling exponent is very close to that of the cube\nexample. Because our bodies have similar proportions and similar density,\nhuman bodies follow the isometric relationship between the height and mass.\n\nNow, we are going to change the way we stack up the unit cubes. As Figure 3A\nshows, each layer has a different number of the unit cubes, and the number\nincreases from the top to the bottom layer by one, like an arithmetic\nsequence. The stacks in Figure 3A have the same heights as Figure 2A, but\ntheir mass differs because the total number of the unit cubes is different.\nWhen the mass of the cube stacks is plotted with their height in the\nlogarithmic scale, all the data points appear to be aligned on a single\nstraight line as shown in Figure 3B. The slope of the data points is found to\nbe 1.75, which shows that the mass of the cube stack increases with their\nheight following m ~ h^1.75. In this case, the scaling exponent is not 3.\nBecause the proportion of the cube stacks changes as they get higher, as shown\nin Figure 3A, the found scaling exponent is different from that of the\nisometric cubes shown in Figure 2. This non-isometric scaling relationship\nfound for the second case is called allometry (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984).\n\nFigure 3. Allometric cubes. A. Cube stacks of increasing height with different\nproportions. B. Logarithmic scale plot of height and mass.\n\nMost anime robots have similar body structures to the human body, as shown in\nFigure 1, and thus they are expected to have similar proportions regardless of\nwhether they are super robots or real robots. Then, it can be hypothesized\nthat Japanese anime robots are isometric like humans. This hypothesis can be\nexamined by finding proportions of anime robots, but unfortunately only their\nheight information is available, whereas other dimensions such as leg length\nand body width are unknown. This is understandable because the height of\nrobots is the physical dimension that viewers can feel on screen. Therefore,\nthis study examined that hypothesis by using currently available height and\nmass data of anime robots, and by finding scaling exponents between them.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nOne can find specification information of anime robots on the internet, but\noften those values could vary depending on sources. Instead of using values\nfound in online sources, we used published reference books about anime robots\n(Studio Hard MX, 1997; Media Works, 2003, 2004; Office J.B, 2012a, 2012b;\nSunplant, 2013).\n\nFrom these books, we chose 190 super robots and 210 real robots that appeared\nin anime from 1963 to 2003 and organized their data of height and mass. Some\nrobots had different values between reference books. In such cases, the\naverage value was found and used in this study. The following units were used\nin this study: meter (m) for height and ton (t) for mass (1 t = 1,000 kg). The\nspecifications of some robots are given in fictional units, and they are\nincluded in this study if conversion factors are known. For certain real\nrobots such as Gundam, two different mass values are shown in the reference\nbooks: body weight and gross weight. Because gross weight includes the mass of\nweapons and accessory equipment, only body weight values were considered in\nthis study.\n\nThe scaling exponent between height and mass was found by fitting m = ah^b\nagainst the data using the method of least squares. Here, b is the scaling\nexponent of our interest, and if the found value of b is close to 3, anime\nrobots will be found to be isometric.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 4A compares the height and mass distribution between the super robot\ngroup and the real robot group. Although the ranges of height and mass differ\nbetween the two groups, they agree well with each other for the height range\nof 5\u2013100 m. Overall, their mass increases with height.\n\nFigure 4. Scaling relationship between height and mass of robots. A.\nComparison between super robots, real robots, and real-world robots. B. Super\nrobots (N = 190). C. Real robots (N = 210). The green dashed line is a power\nfunction (m = ahb) fitted against the data, and its slope corresponds to the\nscaling exponent between the height and mass of robots.\n\nTable 1 compares the statistics of height and mass between the two groups. The\nsuper robot group has wider ranges both for height and mass than the real\nrobot group, as shown by the respective maximum and minimum values. This is\nmainly because of one outlier in the super robot group: Macross from Super\nDimension Fortress Macross. This humongous robot is actually an alien space\nbattleship that fell to Earth from outer space. When this battleship\ntransforms into the humanoid form, which is known as the Storm Attacker mode,\nit becomes a robot that is 1,800 m in height and 18 million tons in mass. One\nmay argue that the real robot group also has one outlier, which is Iron-Gear\nfrom Xabungle. This gigantic hovercraft-type battleship can also transform to\na humanoid form, and it is 128.6 m in height and 49,890 t in mass. Although\nIron-Gear is gigantic, it is much smaller than Macross since the former is 14\ntimes shorter and 360 times lighter than the latter.\n\nTable 1. Height and mass of anime robots.\n\nIt is harder to grasp a physical sense of mass than height because we can\neasily sense length dimensions using our vision. The following machines can\nserve as references. Typical passenger cars weigh 2 t in average, and fully\nloaded dump trucks mass about 40 t. Boeing 777 series are one of the biggest\naircrafts in the world, and their empty operating mass ranges from 135 t to\n168 t. Then, what is the heaviest movable machine of human civilization? The\nanswer is aircraft carriers. The U. S. Navy Nimitz class aircraft carrier is\none of the largest ships, and each ship is about 325 m long and 99,000 t\nheavy. Since Iron-Gear is shorter and lighter than Nimitz class aircraft\ncarriers, its size and mass seem somewhat realistic although it is still\nquestionable to fly such a heavy machine in the air. In contrast, Macross is\nvery unrealistic because Macross is equal to a pile of 182 Nimitz class\naircraft carriers in terms of mass.\n\nIn general, super robots are taller and heavier than real robots in all\nmetrics, which are mean, mode, and median. Because of the high standard\ndeviation and skewness of height and mass, it appears more reasonable to use\nmode and median rather than mean. Both super and real robot groups have\nsimilar mode and median values in each group for height. Super robots are\nmostly 24\u201325 m tall while real robots are mostly about 18 m tall. However, the\ntwo groups are different in terms of mass because the real robot group has\ncloser mode and median than the super robot group does. It is probably because\n69% of the examined real robots are from the Gundam series. In this most\nfamous real robot series, many robots, which is called Mobile Suits, are about\n18 m in their height.\n\nIn Figure 4A, both groups exhibit roughly linear trends between height (h) and\nmass (m) when plotted in the logarithmic scale. As shown in Figure 4B and C,\nthe obtained values of m and h are similar between the two groups: m =\n0.24h^1.88 for super robots, and m = 0.11h^2.09 for real robots. This\nsimilarity was expected from the good agreement between the two groups shown\nin Figure 4A. These curve fitting results show that super robots roughly\nfollow m ~ h^1.88 and real robots m ~ h^2.09. Since the exponent values are\nclose to 2, the mass of robots in Japanese animation can be thought to\nincrease with their height following m ~ h^2 regardless of types. Truly the\nline of m ~ h^2 well represents all the data collected for this study as shown\nin Figure 4A. Because the found scale exponents are not 3, anime robots\nexhibit allometric relationships between their height and mass regardless of\ntheir type, and the main hypothesis of this study is found to be wrong.\n\nHere, it needs to be reminded that a constant density was assumed for finding\nthe isometry of cubes in the same shape: the cubes were made of the same\nmaterial and thus they have the same density. For the aforementioned isometry\nof human height and mass (i.e., m ~ h^2.9), it is reasonable to assume that\nthe body density of humans is constant because the materials that make up the\nhuman body are the same and their compositions are similar across individuals.\nThe same goes for the isometry of various animals. Regarding anime robots,\nhowever, their body density appears to vary significantly because those robots\nare constructed with all different types of substances. The following are some\nexamples: Super-Alloy Z for Mazinger Z, Gundarium for First Gundam, and\nIdeonite for Ideon. More surprisingly, Aurora Battlers like Dunvine are made\nup of materials obtained from animals. Since materials for anime robots are\nall different, it is reasonable to assume that their densities are also\ndifferent.\n\nMoreover, anime robots usually have cavities or empty spaces in their body to\naccommodate pilots and to store weapons and fuel, similar to real-world\nvehicles (of course, no weapons in real-world vehicles). In fact, the\nrelationship between the mass and length of typical passenger vehicles is\napproximately m ~ h^1.85, which is very similar to the scaling relationship\nfound for anime robots. Because most cars have a stressed skin structure\n(i.e., monocoque), their mass is mainly proportional to the body surface area.\nLet\u2019s return to the isometric cube example in Figure 2. If these cubes are\nassumed to have a shell structure with a constant thickness, their mass\nincreases with the surface area, which results in m ~ h^2. The similarity in\nthe scaling relationships between anime robots, passenger vehicles, and empty\nisometric cubes suggests that the cavities in anime robot\u2019s body is\nresponsible for the found allometry of anime robots, despite their similar\nshapes and proportions, along with variations in the material density.\n\nOur finding suggests how Tomotani can improve his estimation of the mass of\nanime robots (Tomotani, 2016). Tomotani estimated the mass of AMT-09-ST\nScopedog (h = 3.8 m) and RX-78-2 First Gundam (h = 18 m) using the cube law\nassuming isometry of robots. His estimations quite differed from the official\nspecifications: 3.9 t vs. 6.4 t for Scopedog, and 445 t vs. 60 t (gross\nweight) for First Gundam. Tomotani attributed the discrepancy to \u201cunknown\nmaterial\u201d used for robots, as we pointed out. Tomotani may be able to estimate\nthe mass of anime robots and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann more reasonably by\nusing the scaling relationship of m ~ h^2 found in this study.\n\nARE ANIME-ROBOT-LIKE ROBOTS POSSIBLE IN THE REAL WORLD?\n\nOne may question whether robots like anime robots are possible in the real\nworld. Japan has a few real scale (i.e., 1:1 scale) Gundams at various cities\nincluding First Gundam in Yokohama, Unicorn Gundam in Tokyo, and n Gundam in\nFukuoka, as shown in Figure 5. These real scale Gundams can move parts of\ntheir body. As shown in Figure 5A, Unicorn Gundam transforms between the\nunicorn mode and the destroy mode. n Gundam in Figure 5B can move its head and\none arm. However, they are fixed on the ground. In other words, they are more\nlike moving statues rather than robots.\n\nFigure 5. Real-scale moving statues of Gundam in Japan. A. Unicorn Gundam in\nTokyo, which transforms between the unicorn mode (left) and the destroy mode\n(right). B. n Gundam in Fukuoka.\n\nIt is too early to be disappointed because several humanoid-type robots have\nbeen developed by various industry and academia sectors. Popular two-legged\nreal-world robots include Asimo of Honda (Japan), Atlas of Boston Dynamics\n(USA), T-HR3 of Toyota (Japan), and Apollo of Apptronik (USA) as shown in\nFigure 6A\u2013D. Since these robots are 1.3\u20131.7 m tall and 50\u201390 kg heavy, they\nare smaller than average adults but still as heavy as average adults. So,\nthese humanoid robots are like Astro Boy Atom.\n\nFigure 6. Real-world robots. Images used under Fair Use (limited non-profit\nand educational use). A. Asimo of Honda.

Source:\nKorea Future Technology (http://www.method-2.net/).\n\nBigger robots do exist in the real world. Suidobashi Heavy Industry (Japan)\ninvented Kuratas (Fig. 6E), which is about 4 m in height and about 4.5 t in\nmass. Kuratas had a price tag of about USD 1.4 million in 2013. Similar robots\nwere made by MegaBots (USA), and MegaBots robots challenged Kuratas for duels.\nRecently, Tsubame Industry (Japan) introduced Archax (Fig. 6F). This\n3-million-dollar robot is 4.5 m in height and 3.5 t in mass. These robots are\nmuch heavier than humanoid robots. Considering their heavy mass, it seems\nunrealistic for them to walk. As such, these robots are wheeled for mobility\nlike Guntank and Getter-3.\n\nMethod-2 of Korea Future Technology (South Korea) can walk (Fig. 6G). Being\n4.2 m in height, Method-2 is similar to Kuratas and Archax in size. However,\nMethod-2 is much lighter because it weighs about 1.6 t including a human\npilot. Although Method-2 is a real-world robot most similar to anime robots so\nfar, it is actually more like Amplified Mobility Platform featured in the\nmovie Avatar (20th Century Fox, 2009).\n\nThese examples of real-world robots are compared with anime robots in Figure\n4A. Similar to anime robots, real-world robots get heavier as they get bigger.\nIt is quite surprising that the real-world robot group agrees relatively well\nwith the anime robot groups. This agreement suggests that for the height range\nof 1\u20135 m, the height and mass of anime robots are somewhat realistic.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe super and real robots featured in Japanese animation are mostly of\nhumanoid form, mimicking the human body. Their similar proportions suggest\nthat these anime robots are isometric. This hypothesis was examined by finding\npower-law scaling relationships between the height and mass of anime robots.\nSuch analyses found that the mass of anime robots roughly increases with their\nheight with a power of 2. Because the found scaling exponent significantly\ndiffers from 3, which is the expected exponent value for isometry, anime\nrobots are allometric regardless of their type. Considering that isometry\nbetween mass and height assumes constant density, the found allometry of the\nanime robots suggests that their body densities are not constant, which is\nsupported by the variety of materials used for anime robots.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFroese, R.
