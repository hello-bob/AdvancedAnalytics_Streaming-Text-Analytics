I also did not track1\nmy learning, so I focused on learning as many tools as possible.\n\nAs time passed, and I engaged with more experienced engineers, it was clear\nthat a common good trait was that they would do was to keep track of their\nprocess and daily/weekly wins.\n\n##\n\nWhy track your progress?\n\nYou may have different reasons why you want to write down your high/lowlights,\nand some would want to do it:\n\n  * To ensure that they are on top of their daily tasks\n\n  * To write up reports\n\n  * For discussions in 1:1 with managers\n\nRegardless of the reason, all the reasons above are still good reasons for you\nto at least get into the habit of tracking your progress. I personally started\ndoing it more often to keep my manager informed and brainstorm ideas.\n\nInitially, it seemed as if I was wasting my time, as I thought that not\neverything should be relevant to share or that I should always have very\ndistinct learnings. Yet, when I revisited the older notes, I realised the\ngrowth and how much I was learning as time went by.\n\nThat boosted my confidence in the topics I am faced with on a daily basis and\nalso improved my position in many discussions with other team members, as I\ndidn't have to rely on my memory and talk from a good reference point2 .\n\nLastly, keeping track of my progress helps to ensure that I am well aware of\nmy career goals and the opportunities for growth.\n\n##\n\nWhat to track and when to do it?\n\nYou may be asking now:\n\n  * What should I include in my journal?\n\n  * In which frequency should I do it?\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all approach, as it all depends on you and your\ncurrent scope. In my personal case, I keep a small notepad where I dump all my\ndaily to-dos and expand my weekly journal from there.\n\nI also schedule at least 45 minutes every Friday to write a more comprehensive\nnote containing all the week's highs and lows. The topics I cover are:\n\n  * Highlights: describing what went well, and this also includes learnings;\n\n  * Lowlights/Blockers: what are my current challenges and items that I may or may not need assistance with;\n\n  * Discussion points: this may not be applicable for everyone, but I use this to discuss the points I want to debate with my managers and other ICs3 on the team\n\nOverall, journaling or writing up your daily/weekly/monthly updates is an\nexcellent way to observe where you can improve and what you are already doing\nwell.\n\nI'd encourage you to create a small routine in which you can write, review,\nand retain this to help you become aware of where you are in your career and\nidentify what's next.\n\n1\n\nTrack: it will be used interchangeably to reference a journal or note.\n\n2\n\nThe Pragmatic Engineer \u2014 Topic 22: Engineering Daybooks\n\n3\n\nIC: Individual Contributor\n\nThanks for reading BK's Newsletter!

We do have a daily\nactivities channel where we need to log all our activities during the day,\nIt's cool to keep everybody aware of what we're working on, especially being a\n'remote-first' company. Also, I had a weekly habit of summarizing what we\naccomplished every Friday or monday; I need to get back to it.Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nThink twice, code once!\n\nThink before you code\n\n6 hrs ago \u2022\n\nBruno Kiafuka\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Think twice, code once!\n\nbrunokiafuka.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bruno Kiafuka\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
