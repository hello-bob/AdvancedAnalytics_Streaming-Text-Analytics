It is not possible to\nproduce cheap green ammonia or Sustainable Aviation Fuel without cheap\nhydrogen.\n\nSteel, shipping, aviation, and chemicals will need a lot of hydrogen to\ndecarbonise. In most cases, they won\u2019t use hydrogen directly, but will use\nchemicals built from hydrogen.\n\n## Caution! Sometimes hydrogen is shit!\n\nHydrogen is versatile - you can use it to decarbonise lots of things. But just\nbecause you can, it doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nOften, using electricity instead of hydrogen is cheaper and safer.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: we could use hydrogen for cars, but we don\u2019t. EVs eat\nhydrogen cars for breakfast.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple guide to where we should use hydrogen to decarbonise.\n\nFor a more detailed version, check out Michael Liebreich\u2019s hydrogen ladder. He\ndoes an excellent 20 minute walkthrough.\n\nNow let\u2019s get into the interesting bit. How do we produce hydrogen?\n\n## Making hydrogen\n\nToday, hydrogen is a climate problem, not a solution.\n\nWe already make a lot of hydrogen today - about 100 million tons a year. It\u2019s\nmainly used to:\n\n  1. Make ammonia for fertiliser, and\n  2. Refine oil and produce petrochemicals.\n\nThis means that producing hydrogen is responsible for 2% of total emissions,\nand 6% of global natural gas usage.\n\nToday, we mostly make hydrogen with a process called Steam Methane Reforming\n(SMR). We call this type of hydrogen grey hydrogen, because it uses fossil\nfuels.\n\nAbout 70% of global hydrogen is made using methane (natural gas). In China,\ncoal is often used, which emits about 2x the CO2. China is coal-rich and gas-\npoor, so it's a logical choice.\n\nIf you want to get an email when I release future guides like this (climate\ntech focused), you can drop your address here.\n\n## Clean hydrogen\n\nFossil fuels are cringe, so we need find a way to produce hydrogen cleanly.\nThere are two main methods.\n\n### Blue hydrogen\n\nBlue hydrogen simply takes grey hydrogen and slaps carbon capture on top.\n\nBlue hydrogen is controversial, cos carbon capture has a long history of...\nnot working. Carbon capture tech is pretty simple, but the incentives for\ncompanies to make it work are poor. You are adding cost & energy requirement\n(all downside) for no financial gain.\n\nAdditionally, blue hydrogen still uses methane (natural gas) - which leaks\nduring production and transport. These methane leaks can cause even more\nwarming than the CO2 emitted from SMR (depending on where you get your\nmethane).\n\nBut make no mistake: carbon capture does work. Most of the CO2 in Europe\u2019s\nbeer and fizzy drinks was captured from a grey hydrogen plant.\n\nIt's easier to capture CO2 from hydrogen production than from other industrial\nprocesses, because SMR exhaust gases contain highly concentrated CO2 (>50%).\nThe higher the CO2 concentration, the easier it is to capture carbon.\n\n### Green hydrogen\n\nNow we're hitting the cool stuff. Green hydrogen is the most important\nproduction method to understand.\n\nMaking green hydrogen is simple: it\u2019s just two electricity-conducting sticks\nin some water. Passing electricity through H2O splits it into H and O.\n\nImage source: NovAzure\n\n(PS - if you are a looking for a climate tech activity for a dinner or an\nEXTREMELY ROMANTIC DATE, make green hydrogen with a 9-volt battery, two\npencils, and a glass of salty water)\n\nmaking green hydrogen with the bois\n\n# Green hydrogen uses a lot of electricity\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how green hydrogen is made, because it will have\na huge impact on our global energy system.\n\nThe IEA predicts that by 2050, making green hydrogen will use 20% of global\nelectricity.\n\nSource: IEA Net Zero 2023 review, Ember Global Electricity Review 2023sorry.\n\nLet\u2019s learn a bit more about the machines that will slurp up all this\nelectricity.\n\n## Electrolysers\n\nSplitting water to make hydrogen is electrolysis, and the machines that do\nthis are called electrolysers.\n\nThere are three types of electrolysers. You can impress any hydrogen nerd by\nasking what type of electrolyser they\u2019re using.\n\nPEM is well suited to running off of renewable power, because you can\ntemporarily overload it. It deals well with spiky electricity.\n\nThere\u2019s also a fourth type of electrolyser called AEM - which is a cross\nbetween Alkaline and PEM. In theory, you receive the benefits of PEM\n(flexibility), without the high cost of the rare materials. It\u2019s early days,\nbut AEM is being commercialised by Enapter.\n\nOver the past five years, we\u2019ve installed roughly twice as much alkaline as\nPEM.\n\n# Unit economics of hydrogen\n\nLet\u2019s go through some rules of thumb for the cost and energy requirements of\ngreen hydrogen.\n\nHeads up: people usually measure hydrogen in kilograms (kg).\n\n### Energy (kWh per kg)\n\nTo make green hydrogen, there is a minimum energy requirement. It is the\nminimum energy needed to split water, and it is 40 kWh per kg of hydrogen.\n\nOf course, electrolysers are not 100% efficient, so most today achieve around\n50 kWh / kg on a good day.\n\n\ud83e\uddea\n\nThis means we are already near the theoretical maximum efficiency for making\ngreen hydrogen.\n\nWe can use the electricity a bit more efficiently, but the real cost\nreductions are in (1) finding the cheapest electricity to run the\nelectrolyser, and (2) making the cheapest possible electrolysers.\n\n### Cost ($ per kg)\n\nHere, we\u2019re competing with fossil fuels.\n\n  * In Europe (where gas is expensive), grey hydrogen costs about $2.50 / kg\n  * In the US (where gas is cheap) grey hydrogen costs about $1.50 / kg\n\nThe dream is for green hydrogen to one day cost $1 / kg or less. At that level\nit would blow grey hydrogen out of the water. But is it realistic?\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s figure out how much the electricity for green hydrogen will\ncost us.\n\n##### Grid electricity\n\nLet\u2019s initially assume that we power our electrolyser from the electricity\ngrid.\n\nRemember, we need 50 kWh of electricity to make a kg of hydrogen.\n\nIf each kWh costs $0.10 (roughly the price of US grid electricity), then the\nelectricity will cost $5 per kg of hydrogen.\n\nThat\u2019s not a good start. Even with the colossal IRA subsidy of $3 / kg for\ngreen hydrogen, we\u2019re still far from our target price of $1 / kg. And we\nhaven\u2019t even spent any money to build an electrolyser yet.\n\n##### Off-grid electricity\n\nIf electricity at $0.10 per kWh is too expensive, where can we find some\nthat\u2019s cheaper?\n\nThe answer is renewables. When the sun is shining and the wind is blowing,\nelectricity is the cheapest it\u2019s been in history.\n\nWe could either:\n\n  * Build dedicated solar or wind farms, just for powering electrolysers. Or,\n  * Use the excess energy from existing renewables, when they generate too much energy.\n\n(That second one might sound silly - how can we have too much renewable\nenergy? But it\u2019s actually a big problem. In the UK we spend \u00a3billions per year\nturning off wind turbines).\n\nThe problem with both of these approaches is that you build an expensive\nelectrolyser that just doesn\u2019t get used very often - because renewables are\nintermittent.\n\nThe best way to get an intuitive grasp of the CAPEX/OPEX tradeoff here is to\nplay around with a hydrogen calculator. I like Electric Hydrogen\u2019s one.\n\nAssuming 20yr plant, 10% WACC, installed CAPEX $850 / KWe standard, $250 / KWe\ncheap.\n\nThis means that the hydrogen tech we should be building is the opposite to\nwhat many assume (and what most acadamic research is focused on). It\u2019s not\nabout making efficient electrolysers that are cheap to run, it\u2019s about making\nrudimentary ones that are cheap to build. Reducing CAPEX, not OPEX, is the key\nto building an electrolyser that can pay off its costs.\n\n# Transport\n\nHydrogen is a pain to handle. Today, most hydrogen is not transported at all.\nIt\u2019s used right next to where it was produced.\n\nHydrogen is tricksy because (1) it\u2019s not very dense, (2) it\u2019s a very small\nmolecule, so it leaks a lot, and (3) hydrogen is very flammable - The\nHindenburg was not cool.\n\nYou can move hydrogen by pipeline, truck, rail, or boat.\n\n### Pipeline\n\nSometimes, natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to carry hydrogen - but\nthere are some hefty caveats.\n\nThree things to consider:\n\n  1. Leaks. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule in the world. It will find its way out of seals, valves and cracks that natural gas would not.\n  2. Embrittlement. Local gas distribution pipes (made from soft steels and plastic pipes) can handle hydrogen just fine. But putting hydrogen through large national gas pipelines - made from hard steels - can \u201cembrittle\u201d (corrode and crack) the steel.\n  3. Compression. To deliver the same amount of energy using hydrogen as with natural gas, you must use 3x the energy compressing it (h/t Paul Martin). That\u2019s why today we pump around natural gas instead, and turn it into grey hydrogen where required.\n\nSome people talk about blending a small amount of hydrogen into natural gas\npipelines (usually less than 10%). But blending\ud83d\udc4f is\ud83d\udc4f bullshit\ud83d\udc4f.\n\nSince hydrogen takes up 3x more space than natural gas (for the same energy),\na blend of 10% volume only replaces 3% of the energy content. You have to pipe\nmore of the blended mixture to compensate for the lower density.\n\n### Truck\n\nHydrogen as a gas at room temperature takes up a lot of space. Roughly 3x more\nspace than natural gas, and 300x more than diesel.\n\nSo moving it in its uncompressed form isn\u2019t an option: we have to squish it.\n\n(Note: hydrogen is very dense in terms of mass. It carries more energy per kg\nthan even fossil fuels. But that doesn\u2019t stop it taking up a lot of space.)\n\nTo put hydrogen on the road, you can either: (A) cool it a lot and transport\nit as a liquid in a tanker, or (B) pressurise it a lot and transport it as a\ngas in a tube trailer.\n\nImg creds: US DOE, Rob Cussons\n\nBoth of these options are a bit pants. Liquifying hydrogen uses up about 30%\nof its energy, and hydrogen as a gas just isn\u2019t very dense. You\u2019d need >10\ntube trailers to transport the same energy as a diesel tanker truck.\n\n### Ship\n\nFun fact: there is one hydrogen tanker in the world, and it is the Suiso\nFrontier - made in 2019.\n\nSource: Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain.\n\nWe liquefy hydrogen to ship it, and so we encounter the same 30% loss from\nliquefying it - plus around 0.2-1% of the hydrogen will \u201cboil off\u201d for every\nday of the voyage.\n\nShipping pure hydrogen is rubbish. A more attractive way to ship hydrogen is\nin the form of ammonia. People sometimes refer to ammonia as a hydrogen\ncarrier. This is pretty interesting, and we\u2019ll cover it in part two of this\nseries, which is all about ammonia!\n\n## Storage\n\nLastly, we have storage.\n\nWe can store hydrogen as a dense liquid for a short time, but because we have\nto keep it at -253\u00b0C, it would be too energy intensive to do this for long\nperiods.\n\nThat means we have to store it as a gas. That would require huge storage\ntanks, but luckily some geographies are blessed with the ability to store\nhydrogen underground.\n\nThere are three main places we could store it: gas fields, aquifers, and salt\ncaverns. These are the same places that we store natural gas. If you want to\nlearn more, the wikipedia page on geological natural gas storage is a great\nplace to start.\n\nSource: Miocic et al (2023) - original research Griffioen et al. (2014)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe will need a lot of green hydrogen - even if it's not as much as the natural\ngas industry wishes.\n\nThat means we'll need an eye-popping amount of electricity to make it. This\nsimple fact produces some of the biggest costs & headaches in industrial\ndecarb. If you want to make a clean steel plant that uses green hydrogen, the\neasy part is building the green steel plant. The hard part is sourcing the\ngreen hydrogen and necessary TWhs of electricity.\n\nHuge thanks to Gniewomir Flis for giving his thoughts on this piece.
