The hypothesis attempted to explain how rotating\nobjects, such as gyroscopes and spinning celestial bodies, maintain a frame of\nreference.\n\nThe proposition is that the existence of absolute rotation (the distinction of\nlocal inertial frames vs. rotating reference frames) is determined by the\nlarge-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:^[2]\n\n> You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting\n> freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now\n> start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled\n> away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are\n> whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?\n\nMach's principle says that this is not a coincidence\u2014that there is a physical\nlaw that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame.\nIf you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some\nphysical law which would make it so you would feel a centrifugal force. There\nare a number of rival formulations of the principle, often stated in vague\nways like \"mass out there influences inertia here\". A very general statement\nof Mach's principle is \"local physical laws are determined by the large-scale\nstructure of the universe\".^[3]\n\nMach's concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the general\ntheory of relativity. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of\nmatter would determine the metric tensor which indicates which frame is\nstationary with respect to rotation. Frame-dragging and conservation of\ngravitational angular momentum makes this into a true statement in the general\ntheory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many\ndistinct statements have been made which would qualify as a Mach principle,\nsome of which are false. The G\u00f6del rotating universe is a solution of the\nfield equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst\npossible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster\nand faster as one moves further away. This example does not completely settle\nthe question of the physical relevance of the principle because it has closed\ntimelike curves.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMach put forth the idea in his book The Science of Mechanics (1883 in German,\n1893 in English). Before Mach's time, the basic idea also appears in the\nwritings of George Berkeley.^[4] After Mach, the book Absolute or Relative\nMotion? (1896) by Benedict Friedlaender and his brother Immanuel contained\nideas similar to Mach's principle.^[page needed]\n\n## Einstein's use of the principle[edit]\n\nThere is a fundamental issue in relativity theory: if all motion is relative,\nhow can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with\nrespect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its\nown in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of\nmotion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a\nparticle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.\n\nIn Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:^[5]\n\n> [The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate\n> connections, say, of the masses of the universe. There will hover before him\n> as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which\n> accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.\n\nAlbert Einstein seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines\nof:^[6]\n\n> ...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...\n\nIn this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical\nholism. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation\ntheories should be relational theories. Einstein brought the principle into\nmainstream physics while working on general relativity. Indeed, it was\nEinstein who first coined the phrase Mach's principle. There is much debate as\nto whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never\nstates it explicitly.\n\nThe writing in which Einstein found inspiration was Mach's book The Science of\nMechanics (1883, tr. 1893), where the philosopher criticized Newton's idea of\nabsolute space, in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the\nexistence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called \"Newton's\nbucket argument\".\n\nIn his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Newton tried to\ndemonstrate that one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the\nabsolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute\nrotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate,\ninitially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the\nvessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the\nborders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the\nrotation. This experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only\nwhen the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented\nhere by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead,\nwhen the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces\nwere produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the\nabsolute space.\n\nMach, in his book, says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when\nthe water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are\nproduced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the\nexperiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they\nbecame leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be\nsubstituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or\naccelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (i.e., one cannot\nsimply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with\nrespect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that\nseem to permit discrimination between relative and \"absolute\" motions should\nonly be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in\nour reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are\nsmall (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and\ndistant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.\n\nThis same thought had been expressed by the philosopher George Berkeley in his\nDe Motu. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if\nthe philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between\nheavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies,\nin a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute\nthe most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere\n\"redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term\nspace\".^[7] What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the\nformer way, originating a long-lasting debate.\n\nMost physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a\nquantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars\ncan have such an effect. Mach himself never made his principle exactly\nclear.^[7]^: 9\u201357 Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's\nprinciple, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental\nassumption of general relativity, although the principle of equivalence of\ngravitational and inertial mass is most certainly fundamental.\n\n## Mach's principle in general relativity[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(November 2015) (Learn how\nand when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nBecause intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly\nis meant by \"Mach's principle\" in general relativity is even less clear than\nin Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are\npossible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.^[7]^: 530 A\nrelatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one\nplace should affect which frames are inertial in another.\n\nEinstein, before completing his development of the general theory of\nrelativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's\nprinciple. We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a\nlarge spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background. The\nreference frame in the interior of this shell will precess with respect to the\nfixed background. This effect is known as the Lense\u2013Thirring effect. Einstein\nwas so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a\nletter to Mach expressing this:\n\n> it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between\n> bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail\n> experiment... If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed\n> stars about an axis going through its center, a Coriolis force arises in the\n> interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a Foucault pendulum is dragged\n> around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).^[6]\n\nThe Lense\u2013Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion\nthat \"matter there influences inertia here\".^[8] The plane of the pendulum\nwould not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it\nwere not spinning. As for the statement that \"inertia originates in a kind of\ninteraction between bodies\", this, too, could be interpreted as true in the\ncontext of the effect.\n\nMore fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed\nbackground, which Einstein describes as \"the fixed stars\". Modern relativists\nsee the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.\nEssentially, we humans seem to wish to separate spacetime into slices of\nconstant time. When we do this, Einstein's equations can be decomposed into\none set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set,\nwhich describe how to move between slices. The equations for an individual\nslice are elliptic partial differential equations. In general, this means that\nonly part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while\nthe geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on\nthe slice.^[clarification needed]\n\nIn the context of an asymptotically flat spacetime, the boundary conditions\nare given at infinity. Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an\nasymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has\nmeaning. By performing a Lorentz transformation on the distant universe, of\ncourse, this inertia can also be transformed^[clarification needed].\n\nA stronger form of Mach's principle applies in Wheeler\u2013Mach\u2013Einstein\nspacetimes, which require spacetime to be spatially compact and globally\nhyperbolic. In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as the\ndistribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other\ninformation) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial\nframe at each point in the universe (where \"a particular moment in the\nuniverse\" refers to a chosen Cauchy surface).^[7]^: 188\u2013207\n\nThere have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully\nMachian, such as the Brans\u2013Dicke theory and the Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of\ngravity, but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an\nexit poll of experts, held in T\u00fcbingen in 1993, when asked the question \"Is\ngeneral relativity perfectly Machian?\", 3 respondents replied \"yes\", and 22\nreplied \"no\". To the question \"Is general relativity with appropriate boundary\nconditions of closure of some kind very Machian?\" the result was 14 \"yes\" and\n7 \"no\".^[7]^: 106\n\nHowever, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would\nnecessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:\n\n> So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia\n> that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on\n> which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:\n>\n>   1. The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.\n>   2. The principle of equivalence.\n>   3.

Sciama proposed the addition of an\nacceleration dependent term to the Newtonian gravitation equation.^[9]\nSciama's acceleration dependent term was where r is the distance between the\nparticles, G is the gravitational constant, a is the relative acceleration and\nc represents the speed of light in vacuum. Sciama referred to the effect of\nthe acceleration dependent term as Inertial Induction.\n\n## Variations in the statement of the principle[edit]\n\nThe broad notion that \"mass there influences inertia here\" has been expressed\nin several forms. Hermann Bondi and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct\nstatements that can be called Mach principles, labelled Mach0 through\nMach10.^[10] Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a\nflavor for the variety possible.\n\n  * Mach0: The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.\n  * Mach1: Newton's gravitational constant G is a dynamical field.\n  * Mach2: An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.\n  * Mach3: Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.\n  * Mach4: The universe is spatially closed.\n  * Mach5: The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.\n  * Mach6: Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.\n  * Mach7: If you take away all matter, there is no more space.\n  * Mach8: is a definite number, of order unity, where is the mean density of matter in the universe, and is the Hubble time.\n  * Mach9: The theory contains no absolute elements.\n  * Mach10: Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Physics portal\n\n  * Absolute rotation \u2013 Rotation independent of any external reference\n  * Brans\u2013Dicke theory \u2013 Proposed theory of gravitation\n  * Frame-dragging \u2013 Effect of general relativity\n  * History of general relativity\n  * Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of gravity \u2013 Theory in Mechanics\n  * Hughes\u2013Drever experiment \u2013 comparing energy levels of nucleons or electronsPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n  * Luminiferous aether \u2013 Obsolete postulated medium for the propagation of light\n  * Shape dynamics\n  * Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory \u2013 Interpretation of electrodynamics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hans Christian Von Bayer, The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science, Courier Dover Publications (2001), ISBN 0-486-41707-7, page 79.\n  2. ^ Steven, Weinberg (1972).
