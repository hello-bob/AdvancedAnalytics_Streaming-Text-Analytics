Our experiments show that information about government is encoded\n> across all transformer layers, but predominantly in the early layers of the\n> model. We find that, for both languages, a small number of attention heads\n> encode enough information about the government relations to enable us to\n> train a classifier capable of discovering new, previously unknown types of\n> government, never seen in the training data. Currently, data is lacking for\n> the research community working on grammatical constructions, and government\n> in particular. We release the Government Bank -- a dataset defining the\n> government relations for thousands of lemmas in the languages in our\n> experiments.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.14270 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.14270v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14270arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jue Hou [view email] [v1] Mon, 22 Apr 2024 15:15:50 UTC (3,220 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled What do Transformers Know about Government?, by\nJue Hou and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
