Each field consists of a\ncheckerboard pattern of 10 x 262 cells. Each cell contains one of 128 colours\nand is 8 pixels wide by 1 pixel deep. This produces an effective resolution of\n80 x 262 @ 30 frames per second, with 10 colors per line.\n\nSound is 4 bit mono produced at 15.720 KHz.\n\nJoystick controls brightness, volume, and shuttle position.
