Individuals use defensive pessimism as a strategy to prepare for\nanxiety-provoking events or performances. Defensive pessimists then think\nthrough specific negative events and setbacks that could adversely influence\ntheir goal pursuits. By envisioning possible negative outcomes, defensive\npessimists can take action to avoid or prepare for them.^[1] Using this\nstrategy, defensive pessimists can advantageously harness anxiety that might\notherwise harm their performance.^[2]\n\nDefensive pessimism is utilized in a variety of domains, and public speaking\nprovides a good example of the process involved in this strategy. Defensive\npessimists could alleviate their anxiety over public speaking by imagining\npossible obstacles such as forgetting the speech, being thirsty, or staining\ntheir shirts before the event. Because defensive pessimists have thought of\nthese problems, they can appropriately prepare to face the challenges ahead.\nThe speaker could, for instance, create note cards with cues about the speech,\nplace a cup of water on the podium to alleviate thirst, and bring a bleach pen\nto remove shirt stains. These preventive actions both reduce anxiety and\npromote superior performance.\n\nDefensive pessimism was identified by Nancy Cantor and her students in the\nmid-1980s.^[3]\n\n## Strategy effectiveness[edit]\n\nThough defensive pessimists are less satisfied with their performances and\nrate themselves higher in \"need for improvement,\" they do not actually perform\nworse than people with a more optimistic strategy. Norem and Cantor (1986)\ninvestigated whether encouraging defensive pessimists, and thereby interfering\nwith their typical negative thinking, would result in worse performances.\nParticipants in the study were in either encouragement or non-encouragement\nscenarios as they prepared to complete anagram and puzzle tasks. In the\nencouragement condition, the defensive pessimists were told that, based on\ntheir GPA, they should expect to do well. Defensive pessimists performed worse\nwhen encouraged than the defensive pessimists whose strategy was not\nmanipulated.^[2] Defensive pessimism is an adaptive strategy for those who\nstruggle with anxiety: their performance decreases if they are unable to\nappropriately manage and counteract their anxiety.^[4]\n\n## Key components[edit]\n\n### Prefactual thinking[edit]\n\nTemporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment^[5]\n\nPrefactual (i.e., \"before the fact\") thinking is an essential component of\ndefensive pessimism. Synonymous with anticipation, it denotes a cognitive\nstrategy in which people imagine possible outcomes of a future scenario. The\nterm prefactual was specifically coined by Lawrence J. Sanna, in 1998,^[6] to\ndenote those activities that speculate on possible future outcomes, given the\npresent, and ask \"What will be the outcome if event E occurs?\"\n\nThe imagined outcomes are either positive/desirable, negative/undesirable, or\nneutral. Prefactual thinking can be advantageous because it allows the\nindividual to prepare for possible outcomes of a scenario.\n\nFor defensive pessimists, prefactual thinking offers the primary and critical\nmethod to alleviate anxiety.^[3] Usually, this prefactual thinking is paired\nwith a pessimistic outlook, resulting in negative/undesirable imagined\nscenarios. With regard to the earlier example, the public speaking defensive\npessimist anticipates forgetting the speech or becoming thirsty as opposed to\ngiving an amazing speech and receiving a standing ovation.\n\n### Anxiety[edit]\n\nAs defensive pessimism is motivated by a need to manage anxiety, it is\nunsurprisingly also correlated with trait anxiety and neuroticism.^[3]\nNegative mood states promote defensive pessimists' goal attainment strategy by\nfacilitating the generation of potential setbacks and negative outcomes that\ncould arise during goal pursuit, which can then be anticipated and prevented.\nWhen defensive pessimists are encouraged into positive or even just neutral\nmood states, they perform worse on experimental tasks than when in a negative\nmood state. They are more anxious because they are prevented from properly\nimplementing their preferred cognitive strategy for goal attainment.^[7]\n\n## Self-esteem[edit]\n\nDefensive pessimism is generally related to lower self-esteem since the\nstrategy involves self-criticism, pessimism, and discounting previous\nsuccessful performances. Indeed, Norem and Burdzovic Andreas (2006) found\nthat, compared to optimists, defensive pessimists had lower self-esteem\nentering college. At the end of four years of college, however, the self-\nesteem of the defensive pessimists had increased to nearly equal levels as\noptimists. The self-esteem of optimists had not changed, and the self-esteem\nof pessimists who did not employ defensive pessimism had fallen slightly by\nthe end of college.^[8] While defensive pessimism may have implications for\nself-esteem, it appears that these effects lessen over time.\n\n## Compared to pessimism[edit]\n\nUnlike pessimism, defensive pessimism is not an internal, global, and stable\nattribution style, but rather a cognitive strategy utilized within the context\nof certain goals.^[3] Pessimism involves rumination about possible negative\noutcomes of a situation without proactive behavior to counteract these\noutcomes. Defensive pessimism, on the other hand, utilizes the foresight of\nnegative situations in order to prepare against them. The negative possible\noutcomes of a situation often motivate defensive pessimists to work harder for\nsuccess. Since defensive pessimists are anxious, but not certain, that\nnegative situations will arise, they still feel that they can control their\noutcomes.^[9] For example, a defensive pessimist would not avoid all job\ninterviews for fear of failing one. Instead, a defensive pessimist would\nanticipate possible challenges that could come in an upcoming job interview \u2013\nsuch as dress code, stubborn interviewers, and tough questions \u2013 and prepare\nrigorously to face them. Defensive pessimism is not a reaction to stressful\nevents nor does it entail ruminating on events of the past, and should\ntherefore be distinguished from pessimism as a trait or a more general\nnegative outlook. Instead, defensive pessimists are able to stop using this\nstrategy once it is no longer beneficial (i.e., does not serve a preparatory\nrole).^[9]\n\n## Compared to other cognitive strategies[edit]\n\n### Self-handicapping[edit]\n\nElliot and Church (2003) determined that people adopt defensive pessimism or\nself-handicapping strategies for the same reason: to deal with anxiety-\nprovoking situations. Self-handicapping is a cognitive strategy in which\npeople construct obstacles to their own success to keep failure from damaging\ntheir self-esteem. The difference between self-handicapping and defensive\npessimism lies in the motivation behind the strategies. Beyond managing\nanxiety, defensive pessimism is further motivated by a desire for high\nachievement. Self-handicappers, however, feel no such need. Elliot and Church\nfound that the self-handicapping strategy undermined goal achievement while\ndefensive pessimism aided achievement. People who self-handicapped were high\nin avoidance motivation and low in approach motivation. They wanted to avoid\nanxiety but were not motivated to approach success. Defensive pessimists, on\nthe other hand, were motivated to approach success and goal attainment while\nsimultaneously avoiding the anxiety associated with performance. Although it\nwas found that defensive pessimism was positively correlated with goals\nrelated to both performance-avoidance and anxiety-avoidance, it was not found\nto be a predictor of one's mastery of goals. ^[10]\n\n### Strategic optimism[edit]\n\nIn research, defensive pessimism is frequently contrasted with strategic\noptimism, another cognitive strategy. When facing performance situations,\nstrategic optimists feel that they will end well. Therefore, though they plan\nahead, they plan only minimally because they do not have any anxiety to face.\nWhile defensive pessimists set low expectations, feel anxious, and rehearse\npossible negative outcomes of situations, strategic optimists set high\nexpectations, feel calm, and do not reflect on the situation any more than\nabsolutely necessary.^[11] Strategic optimists start out with different\nmotivations and obstacles: unlike defensive pessimists, strategic optimists do\nnot have any anxiety to surmount. In spite of their differences in motivation,\nstrategic optimists and defensive pessimists have similar objective\nperformance outcomes.^[1] For both strategic optimists and defensive\npessimists, their respective cognitive strategies are adaptive and promote\nsuccess.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Cultural pessimism \u2013 Conviction that culture is in decline\n  * Depressive realism \u2013 Hypothesis about depression\n  * Negative visualization \u2013 Visualization of the worst-case scenario(s\n  * Optimism \u2013 Positive mental attitude\n  * Preparedness paradox \u2013 Perceived risk of mitigated dangers\n  * Pessimism \u2013 Negative mental attitude\n  * Worst-case scenario \u2013 Concept in risk management to consider the most severe outcome that can reasonably be projected\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Norem, J.
