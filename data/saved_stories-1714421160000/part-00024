Both countries are aiming to stick to that schedule\nto prevent Beijing from scoring a propaganda coup by landing a Chinese\nastronaut on the moon before 2028, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cCertainly, I expect Beijing to take this as a direct challenge,\u201d said Lance\nGatling, president of Nexial Research and an aerospace and defence analyst.\n\n\u201cFor years, the Japanese and Chinese have headed opposing space cooperation\norganisations or networks that sought to corral Asian nations\u2019 space\naspirations and both use their accomplishments in space as propaganda,\u201d\nGatling told This Week in Asia.\n\nA Japanese robotic moon rover called Smart Lander on the moon.

The astronauts are slated to spend six months aboard the space\nstation, conducting experiments and making preparations ahead of a likely\nmanned moon mission.\n\nEvery Saturday\n\nA weekly curated round-up of social, political and economic stories from China\nand how they impact the world.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

A basic lunar base jointly developed by\nChina and Russia is also targeted for completion by 2035.\n\nHundreds of thousands of things must go right for any moon mission to be a\nsuccess, Gatling said. In the event of a failure \u2013 particularly one that\ninvolved the loss of crew \u2013 it would be \u201ca massive propaganda disaster\u201d, he\nadded.\n\n02:09\n\nJapan\u2019s \u2018Moon Sniper\u2019 rover lands, but may die in matter of hours\n\nJapan\u2019s \u2018Moon Sniper\u2019 rover lands, but may die in matter of hours\n\n\u201cBut I expect the question to evolve into how the Chinese assess the risks,\nmanage them and decide to proceed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe joint Japan-US plan is part of the Artemis lunar exploration programme,\nwhich involves several other nations and is designed to serve as a foundation\nfor future space exploration.\n\nJapan has agreed to develop and sustain the operations of a pressurised lunar\nrover. The US will tap its more extensive experience in manned space missions,\nprovide flight opportunities and astronaut training and \u201cmanage the risks of\nthese challenging and inspiring lunar surface missions,\u201d a statement from the\nWhite House said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two nations plan to jointly explore the use of materials found on the\nlunar surface, such as water ice at its south pole, which will be critical to\nsustaining human life during a moon mission.\n\nThe agreement also covers collaboration on a Low Earth Orbit detection and\ntracking constellation for missiles, such as hypersonic glide missiles.\n\nGatling said this part of the agreement was \u201ca big deal\u201d as Tokyo was\npreviously opposed to the Japan Space Exploration Agency taking part in any\nmilitary or defence project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe challenge of the importance of the space industry to national economic\nand security issues, along with the challenge of China, has combined to\nconvince Japan to change its policies and embark on explicitly military space\nprogrammes,\u201d he said.\n\nKazuto Suzuki, a professor of science and technology policy at Tokyo\nUniversity, said the importance of the White House agreement was mostly\nsymbolic.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was all about ritual, but that is done to demonstrate to the rest\nof the watching world \u2013 primarily China \u2013 that the US and Japan are all in\ntogether, that they are working on AI, semiconductors and space,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe message is that they are looking to the future and that space and moon\nexploration is critical to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are very aware that they are competing with China in exploration of the\nmoon, so this is going to be the Apollo programme on steroids.\u201d\n\nAccording to Suzuki, the aim of having a Japanese as the first non-American to\nset foot on the moon \u201cis so that it is not a Chinese astronaut, as that would\nincrease Chinese pride in their space capabilities and make them believe they\nare equal to the US\u201d.\n\nWhile China had made good progress in its space projects in recent years,\nincluding having an orbiting space station, it was not ready to put an\nastronaut on the moon any time soon, Suzuki said.\n\n\u201cThey know they are still behind, and they are focused on making steady\nprogress with the space station, a probe on the other side of the moon and\nonly then will they look at landing on the surface,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn astronaut on the moon is a very tough proposition, and they will not want\nto risk lives. They still need to build their capacity before they attempt\nthat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen\n\n33\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
