Modern Ireland is directionless with one\nprobable cause the lack of a unifying narrative that compels a portion of the\npopulation to become agentic.\n\nThanks for reading Robert's Reflections! Subscribe for free to receive new\nposts and support my work.\n\nFor \u00c9ire Accelerationism (\u00c9/Acc) to succeed, the movement must have some body\nof work that distils the core ideas necessary for Ireland to realise its\ndestiny as a country with infrastructure, energy and housing in abundance.\nSuch writings should emphasise the unique and disproportionate role the island\nhas played in civilisation\u2019s history, prize all that being high agency\nentails, including individualism, and highlight the importance of the misfit,\nthe Great Man Theory of history should follow logically if the importance of\nbeing agentic is assumed. Poorly constructed but tempting ideas should as\nutilitarianism should be avoided for fear of attracting the wrong personality\ntypes, as has happened in other movements, and instead only those ideas that\ncan be logically proven to be true should be accommodated - Burke must be\nlionised, John Stuart Mill should not be.\n\nThinkers and doers must be attracted to \u00c9/Acc, pure thinkers should not be in\norder for a framework where the Builder is the ideal. A community that enables\nIreland to meet its full potential must have an urgency to it; there is no\nplace for daydreamers at such a critical juncture in history. Thinking about\nthis has led to my sense that the below might be the start of such a reading\nlist, feel free to make suggestions.\n\nThe \u00c9/Acc Logo\n\n##\n\nSuggestions\n\n'From Third World to First: The Singapore Story' - Lee Kuan Yew\n\nWith an emphasis on getting the basics right, Singapore has transformed itself\nfrom a backwater to having the world\u2019s fourth highest GDP per capita in mere\ndecades. Notably, Lee Kuan Yew recognised the importance of the populace\u2019s\ntrust in implementing reform, a pillar that is currently lacking for Ireland\u2019s\npolitical class to implement an agenda of reform. Like Singapore, Ireland has\ndeveloped a thriving services economy that, since its inception, has grown\nexponentially.\n\nUnlike Singapore, Ireland has failed to develop its infrastructure alongside\nthe concurrent increase in GDP as pointed out regularly by S\u00e9an Keyes and Emma\nWaldron Chen. From Third World to First charts how Singapore managed to avoid\nthe trap of securing Foreign Direct Investment in services without developing\nits more tangible economy. Most of all, the book charts how Kuan Yew managed\nto steer Singapore successfully in a multi-polar world.\n\n'Lady Gregory's Complete Irish Mythology' - Lady Gregory\n\nMyths are an integral part of a country\u2019s culture as espoused by \u2018Hamlet\u2019s\nMill\u2019 by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend given the intuitive way\nin which they transmit knowledge. Lady Gregory\u2019s Complete Irish Mythology\ncollects what was, up to then, a largely verbal history of Ireland and is, in\nmy opinion, the most complete compendium of the gods, tribes and heroes that\nwent on to inspire later Irish independence movements. Otherwise known as Of\nGods and Fighting Men, the book begins with stories of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann,\nthe tribe of the gods, that were cast as idealised humans living in an\nOtherworld whose heroism was meant to inspire mortals.\n\nThe book also collects stories of the Fianna and the Children of Lir - these\nstories are fundamental parts of the Irish cultural tapestry and ought to be\npart of refounding Ireland\u2019s purpose. It is not a coincidence that these same\nstories inspire both the Gaelic Revival, and an Irish literary renaissance,\nand independence leaders such as Pearse and De Valera, for an agenda of reform\nto be successful, Ireland\u2019s uniqueness, and destiny, should be at its core.\n\n'The Atlantean Irish: Ireland's Oriental and Maritime Heritage' - Bob Quinn\n\nTo think a book is important, one does not necessarily have to agree with its\npremise. Open-mindedness should be part of an abundance mindset, one likely\nreason for the lack of imagination in Irish policymaking is the fact the\nOverton window is too narrow, and appears unusually so in an international\ncontext and one . Quinn convincingly places Ireland\u2019s maritime heritage at the\ncentre of over eight millennia of international trade and thinks of Irish\ncivilisation first and foremost as a maritime one and so Ireland\u2019s outlook has\nalways been an international one.\n\n'An Irish Atlantic Rainforest' - Eoghan Daltun\n\nAbundance does not have to come at the expense of the environment, indeed\nproviding infrastructure at scale will help create a more sustainable Ireland,\nsee S\u00e9an Keyes\u2019 Rail Theory of Everything for details on how this could be\nachieved vis-vis more housing. Daltun describes how one can achieve abundance\nin a microclimate in West Cork\u2019s Beara Peninsula through rewilding a 73-acre\nfarm. The Plantations of Ireland played a critical role in what were then\nunprecedented levels of deforestation from which the island only started to\nrecover in the 20th century through commercial forestry. For Ireland to regain\nits true self, rewilding is part of the story.\n\nAt Ireland\u2019s cultural height, described in Lady Gregory\u2019s Complete Irish\nMythology and conjectured in The Atlantean Irish, native forests were a core\npart of Irish identity, perhaps restoring them would help create the scenius\nnecessary for the island to meet its potential.\n\nP\u00e1draic Pearse: The Collected Works\n\nTaking advantage of the blog of his day, Pearse was a prolific writer and\npublished numerous books at a time when the printing press became accessible\nfor many. Too little is his work referenced today and, on reading Pearse, the\nreason is obvious: independence has likely failed from the perspective of many\nof those who led the movement.\n\nIn From a Hermitage, Pearse decries those who spend their days debating and\nnot creating something tangible. For \u00c9/Acc to succeed, there must be an\nunwavering emphasis on building, an often daunting task, and Pearse places\nimmense importance on symbolism as a way of inspiring builders in From a\nHermitage. Crucially, the book contains an Open Letter to Douglas Hyde, an\nanalogue to today\u2019s tweet, and demonstrates the importance of laughter in\nundertaking monumental tasks - \u00c9/Acc should not make its adherents miserable.\n\nThe Murder Machine outlines a vision for education, one that aims to inspire\nthe learner rather than repress. Today\u2019s system has changed little since\nindependence with British civil service exams being the foundation for the\nethos which fuels the Leaving Certificate system. Despite the numerous reforms\nwhich has occurred, perhaps \u00c9/Acc could advocate for a system that gives both\nthe learner and the teacher more freedom, as Pearse advocated, in a framework\nthat is reminiscent of Dominic Cummings\u2019 idea of an Odyssean Education.\n\nPearse\u2019s body of work is voluminous, all books and speeches are essential\nreading given that ambition and high agency are placed at almost every\nargument\u2019s core.\n\nEndurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage - Alfred Lansing\n\nThis is a masterful account of how Ernest Shackleton led the last great voyage\nof the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration for which he is said to have posted\nthe infamous advertisement:\n\n###\n\n\u2018Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of\ncomplete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of\nsuccess.\u2019\n\nOf the twenty-eight men on the Endurance, the crew aiming to make the first\nland crossing of Antarctica, Shackleton, Tom Crean and Tim McCarthy were\nIrish. The book recounts Shackleton\u2019 effective fundraising skills, unusual\ninterviewing techniques that sought unique candidates and rejection of\nhierarchy to create the crew that achieved one of the most feted expeditions\nin history. Shackleton\u2019s approach to organisation and leadership creates a\nblueprint that ought to be replicated by \u00c9/Acc.\n\n\u2018Reflections on the Revolution in France\u2019 - Edmund Burke\n\nBurke correctly predicted the French Revolution would end in tragedy\nsuggesting its ideas were too abstract to sustain such a movement. Every\nmovement should have a theory of change, Burke argues such groups should focus\non the practicality of their solutions rather than purely philosophical\nconcepts - something \u00c9/Acc must keep at the forefront of its thinking.\n\n###\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note\n\nThanks to Will O\u2019Brien for founding \u00c9/Acc, I think the movement has a high\nprobability of effecting an evolution in the kind of thinking that creates\npublic policy in Ireland over the coming decades. My burgeoning interest in\naccelerationism is due to Matvey Boguslavskiy, Amaan Ahmad and Levan Bokeria.\nYou can contact me at tolanro [at] tcd [dot] ie.\n\nThanks for reading Robert's Reflections!
