Photo: linkedin.com\n\nAndy Stone, the spokesman for Meta, is being tried in absentia in Russia on\ncharges of \u201cjustifying terrorism.\u201d The accusation stems from a tweet Stone\nposted in March 2022, explaining the company\u2019s new moderation rules. At the\ntime, in the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Meta had decided to\ntemporarily allow calls for violence against \u201cRussian occupiers.\u201d Today, a\nmilitary court in Moscow began considering Stone\u2019s case. We attended the\nhearing, which turned into a humiliation for the prominent prosecutor Boris\nLoktionov.\n\n\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\n\nToday, the Moscow District Military Court began hearing the case against Andy\nStone\u2014the spokesman for the U.S. technology giant Meta that owns Facebook,\nWhatsApp and Instagram\u2014in absentia. Stone is accused of \u201cjustifying\nterrorism.\u201d He was placed under arrest in absentia in Russia last November and\nput on the federal wanted list.\n\n\u201cThe court took measures to notify Stone but received no response,\u201d commented\nJudge Roman Kiforenko on the absence of Meta\u2019s press secretary in the\ncourtroom. The defendant\u2019s lawyer, Valentina Filippenkova, insisted that her\nclient had not been properly notified about the start of the proceedings. She\nrequested to postpone the hearing, but the judge seemed irritated from the\nvery beginning and not inclined to delay the case.\n\nThe prosecution was represented by Boris Loktionov\u2014one of the most experienced\nprosecutors in Russia. The 67-year-old Loktionov has participated in many\nhigh-profile trials: 10 years ago, he represented the prosecution in the trial\nof the members of the Combat Organisation of Russian Nationalists; in 2018, in\nthe trial of the notorious \u201cthief in law\u201d Zakhariy Kalashov (Young Shakro);\nand in 2020, in the trial against Karina Tsurkan, a top manager of Inter RAO\naccused of espionage.\n\nIt was Loktionov who demanded 24 years of imprisonment for journalist Ivan\nSafronov (the FSB accused him of treason, Safronov received 22 years). After\nthe start of the war, politician Vladimir Kara-Murza was also accused of\ntreason, and the court sentenced him to 25 years\u2014with Boris Loktionov again as\nthe prosecutor in the trial. For his participation in the Kara-Murza case, the\nprosecutor was sanctioned by the United Kingdom.\n\nIn court, Loktionov said that the Russian embassy in Washington helped\nestablish Andy Stone\u2019s personal data and also suggested that the investigation\n\u201cpay attention\u201d to other Meta directors: former COO Sheryl Sandberg, president\nof global affairs Nick Clegg, and chief product officer Chris Cox.\n\n\u201cThe competent U.S. authorities refuse to extradite individuals due to the\nabsence of a bilateral extradition treaty,\u201d the case materials read, which the\nprosecutor recited in court. The investigation has no information indicating\nthat Andy Stone has ever visited Russia.\n\nLoktionov received his share of irritation from Judge Kiforenko for the\ncareless preparation of the criminal case materials, which are mainly filled\nwith documents on recognising Meta as an \u201cextremist organisation\u201d in Russia in\n2022.\n\n\u201cWhat does this prove?\u201d Judge Kiforenko exclaimed, but allowed the flustered\nprosecutor to finish reading the materials.\n\nThe investigation managed to introduce the translation of one of Stone\u2019s\ntweets on the third attempt: the first version of the expert examination did\nnot have a Russian translation at all; for the second examination, a automated\ntranslation was provided; and only for the third examination did a person\ntranslate the two sentences.\n\n> Our statement on what's happening: pic.twitter.com/UQqb3vQeep\n>\n> \u2014 Andy Stone (@andymstone) March 10, 2022\n\nIt was this tweet by Andy Stone that became the reason for the criminal case.\nHe posted it on March 11, 2022, during the early stages of the invasion of\nUkraine, after Meta decided not to block users calling for the \u201cdeath of\nRussian invaders\u201d and Vladimir Putin. The company insisted that the new\nmoderation rules only applied to posts about \u201cRussian invaders,\u201d not\ncivilians.\n\nThe Investigative Committee launched a criminal case on the same day. Ten days\nlater, the Tverskoy District Court in Moscow recognised Meta as an \u201cextremist\norganisation\u201d\u2014by that time, both Facebook and Instagram had already been\nblocked in Russia; WhatsApp is not blocked to this day.\n\nLoktionov received another reprimand from Judge Kiforenko for confusing the\nactual criminal articles. Initially, the case against Stone was opened under\nthree articles: calls for terrorist activity, public calls for extremist\nactivity, and public justification of terrorism. In the end, the charges were\nlimited to only the last article, but the indictment still contained wording\nabout calls for terrorism and extremism.\n\n\u201cAre you accusing Andy Stone of publicly justifying terrorism? But the\ndescription of the criminal act contains an assessment of the phrases not only\nas containing justification but also as containing calls to commit [terrorist]\nactions. How should this be understood?\u201d the judge asked.\n\n\u201cYour Honour, I have brought to your attention what is within the scope of the\ncharges brought...\u201d Loktionov justified. \u201cI think this is superfluous...\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, when will you be able to correct the charges, and will they be subject\nto correction at all? Superfluous or not. I would like to hear the final\nversion of the charges within which the court can work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the scope of the charges I have announced, the court can work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are we going to do with the \u2018public calls\u2019 that have already been\ncancelled? The charges are unclearly formulated within the indictment. You\nread the indictment and prepared for the trial. Did no questions arise on your\npart?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the court will make an objective and lawful decision on its own.\u201d\n\nThe defence asked to return the case to the prosecutor\u2019s office to clarify the\ncharges, but Judge Kiforenko demanded that Prosecutor Loktionov explain the\ninaccuracies in the case materials in court today. The judge gave the\nprosecutor only 10 minutes to prepare a response.\n\nThis time was not enough for the prosecutor\u2014Loktionov was still unable to\nexplain how the other two articles disappeared.\n\nDespite this, the trial of Andy Stone in absentia could have ended in one\nhearing if not for a hitch with the only witness for the prosecution. This is\nSergey Timoshev, who simply told the investigator that he had seen Stone\u2019s\ntweet. Prosecutor Loktionov initially insisted on questioning Timoshev in\ncourt, but Judge Kiforenko demanded an explanation of the point in waiting for\nthis witness.\n\n\u201cWas he an eyewitness to the commission of the crime?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Honour, he just read a message that was published on the internet. And\nhe discussed this message with his, let\u2019s say, friends and colleagues. As\nsuch, we will not get any significant evidentiary form from his testimony. I\ndon\u2019t need this witness!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, but if you don\u2019t even need him, then the defence certainly doesn\u2019t need\nhim either. Do you insist on ensuring his appearance?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need this witness! I do not insist on his appearance.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the prosecutor time to think over his position, and after a\nten-minute break, he dryly said that he still demands to wait for the witness\nwho personally saw the criminal tweet.\n\nThe hearing was adjourned until Monday, April 22. Most likely, on this day,\nprosecutor Loktionov will request a sentence for Meta\u2019s spokesman.\n\nEditor: Egor Skovoroda\n\nSupport Mediazona now!\n\nYour donations directly help us continue our work\n\nContact us\n\nContact us\n\n  * Alligator clips on the legs.
