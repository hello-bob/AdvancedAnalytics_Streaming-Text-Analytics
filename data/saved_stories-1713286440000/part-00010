Here we address this research question by querying 252\nparticipants from a representative sample of U.S. Twitter users 5 times per\nday over 7 days (6,218 observations). Results revealed that Twitter use is\nrelated to decreases in well-being, and increases in political polarization,\noutrage, and sense of belonging over the course of the following 30 minutes.\nEffect sizes were comparable to the effect of social interactions on well-\nbeing. These effects remained consistent even when accounting for demographic\nand personality traits. Different inferred uses of Twitter were linked to\ndifferent outcomes: passive usage was associated with lower well-being, social\nusage with a higher sense of belonging, and information-seeking usage with\nincreased outrage and most effects were driven by within-person changes.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Worldwide divergence of values\n\nArticle Open access 09 April 2024\n\nJoshua Conrad Jackson & Danila Medvedev\n\n### Anger is eliminated with the disposal of a paper written because of\nprovocation\n\nArticle Open access 09 April 2024\n\nYuta Kanaya & Nobuyuki Kawai\n\n### Increase in concerns about climate change following climate strikes and\ncivil disobedience in Germany\n\nArticle Open access 04 April 2024\n\nJohannes Brehm & Henri Gruhl\n\n## Introduction\n\nSocial media has become so widespread^1 that even if it had only a small\nimpact on people, it could produce meaningful changes in society. It is thus\ncritical to evaluate how and if social media impacts its users. Here, we delve\ninto the daily experience of social media users by focusing on one\nparticularly influential social media platform, Twitter.\n\nAlthough small in comparison to other platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok,\nTwitter (now X) has received outsized attention because it hosts elites in\nentertainment, journalism, and politics. As such, the experience on Twitter\nhas the potential to shape how elites (and by consequence, the public) regard,\ndepict, and regulate social media. Despite its importance, there have been few\nsystematic attempts to describe the impact of using Twitter. Most Twitter\nresearch examines how public data, such as tweets and followings, relate to\npolitical polarization^2,3, expressions of outrage^4,5, and subjective well-\nbeing^6. Nevertheless, public Twitter data does not reliably represent users\u2019\nthoughts: 80% of the tweets on the platform were produced by 10% of the users,\nwho tend to be more engaged with and tweet more about politics than the\naverage user, who tends to be younger, richer, more educated, and more engaged\nwith politics than the average U.S. adult^7,8. Thus, it remains unclear\nwhether these findings generalize to most social media users or even most\nTwitter users.\n\nAs platforms constantly introduce changes and get replaced, research on their\neffects can easily become obsolete. To avoid obsolescence, we examine the\npsychological impact of Twitter use as a function of its features and\naffordances, thereby facilitating the translation of findings to different\nplatforms and time periods. In addition, we also explore potentially\nbeneficial effects of social media use (such as sense of community). Towards\nthese ends, we examine the prevalence of the different forms of Twitter use\nand how they relate to subjective well-being, political polarization, outrage,\nand sense of belonging in a sample of users more representative of the\npopulation than previous studies. Please note, we refer to the name of the\nplatform as Twitter, not X, as the data we obtained before the platform\nchanged names. Where applicable, we will generalize the results to X.\n\nHow does Twitter use relate to subjective well-being? Although the effects of\nTwitter use on subjective well-being\u2014defined as how individuals evaluate their\nlife satisfaction and feel about their own lives, including both positive and\nnegative emotions^9\u2014have not been thoroughly investigated, research on social\nmedia more generally abounds.\n\nIn the past few years, studies suggesting that social media is to blame for a\nrecent worsening of subjective well-being and related constructs (such as\ndepression and loneliness)^10,11,12,13,14,15 gained media attention^16.\nNevertheless, these effects are contested. Some researchers argue that the\neffect sizes of social media use on well-being are so small that they have no\npractical significance^17,18; others claim that the relationship is likely\nnonexistent^19,20,21,22, and that significant effects are explained by\nconfounding variables, such as personality^23,24. This debate has led to the\ndevelopment of a line of research focused on fundamental questions in social\nmedia research: can self-reported measures of social media use\u2014used in most\nresearch and only modestly correlated with actual social media use^25,26\u2014be\ntrusted? Can we be sure about the causal links between social media use and\nwell-being without disentangling the processes that happen intra-individually\n(within a person over time) from those that happen between people^27? Despite\nthe lack of consensus, we address these issues by using more ecologically\nvalid measures of Twitter use and statistical analyses that allow the\ndisentangling of effects at different levels of analysis.\n\nAffective polarization is the emotional component of political polarization.\nIt is the degree to which people dislike and distrust the other side of the\npolitical spectrum^28. How does it relate to Twitter use? Most works on the\nsubject examine the connectivity among users (through followings, replies, and\nretweets) to investigate the extent to which networks are segregated^3,29.\nAlthough these studies provide some evidence that Twitter networks tend to be\npolitically segregated, they often overlook whether these structures relate to\nactual feelings and attitudes towards political issues.\n\nStudies done on other social media platforms have examined affective\ncomponents of polarization. In two studies, U.S. participants who were\nrandomly assigned to leave Facebook for a week or a month were less polarized\nthan participants who remained on Facebook as usual^30,31. However, a\nreplication of this experiment in a sample comprised of Bosnians, Serbs, and\nCroats found opposite effects^32, suggesting that the relationship between\nsocial media use and polarization is not so straightforward. These\ninconsistent findings suggest that the relationship might be moderated by\nother variables, such as the degree to which one\u2019s online network is\nsegregated in comparison to one\u2019s offline network. Besides, only a small\nminority of users engage with political content on social media; most people\nuse social media to keep in touch with family and friends^33. Political\nengagement on social media platforms seems to be more prevalent among\nintellectual elites, many of whom are found on Twitter but whose experience is\nnot representative of the larger population^34.\n\nOutrage is a class of emotions (usually anger, contempt, and disgust) that\nfollow moral judgments^35. Although relatively rare in life, expressions of\noutrage seem to be more prevalent on social media^5 Research suggests that\nthis phenomenon is driven by the algorithmic amplification of outrage\u2014as a\nhighly arousing emotion, users are more likely to engage with content that\nelicits outrage and produce content that provokes outrage in others^36. For\ninstance, each moral-emotional word in a politics-related tweet increases the\nchances of a retweet by 20%^4. Yet, it remains unclear whether online\nexpressions of outrage are merely performative (to generate engagement) or if\nthey originate from real high-arousing emotions.\n\nEstablishing and maintaining relationships is a human need. As such, social\nrelationships are predictors of psychological health^37. Social media\nplatforms emerged as an online alternative to in-person socialization, but can\nthey satisfy the need for social connection? Research dating back to the early\nyears of social media linked social media presence with increases in social\ncapital, meaning that people who used social media tended to have more friends\nand a better social life^38,39. Nevertheless, not much attention has been\ngiven to this topic recently. Thus, we aim to understand how Twitter use might\ncontribute to this important but neglected mental health predictor,\nconceptualizing it as a sense of belonging\u2014the subjective experience of being\nvalued and respected as part of a group.\n\nEven if social media had a clear net negative impact on people, it is possible\nthat some aspects of social media are beneficial to some while other aspects\nare detrimental to others: a more nuanced approach would allow us to better\nmaximize its benefits while minimizing its harms^24. Thus, to understand the\npsychological effects of social media use it is critical to consider the\ncontextual variables that might moderate the relationship: who uses social\nmedia, how they use it, and why they use it.\n\nSocial media use, as a rich and complex behavior, can be categorized in\nnumerous ways. Previous studies have attempted to classify social media use as\npassive or active, yielding promising results^40,41. However, recent reviews\nindicated inconsistent outcomes due to the absence of standardized\noperationalization^42. To achieve a comprehensive categorization of social\nmedia use, it is crucial to analyze both the structural and functional aspects\nof these behaviors. The structural approach entails identifying the\naffordances of social media platforms, such as messaging, liking, and\nscrolling through a feed. In contrast, the functional approach involves\nexamining the purpose of these actions, such as scrolling the feed to\nalleviate boredom or search for news. This approach facilitates the\nexamination of reasons for moderating effects (e.g., social media seems to be\nmore detrimental to girls, but why?)^15 Characteristics of the user might also\nbe important moderators for the effects of social media use. Personality\ntraits, for instance, are linked to different types of social media usage:\nNeuroticism, Agreeableness, and Extraversion are positively related with self-\nexpression on social media^43.\n\nHere, we investigate everyday use of Twitter and estimate its effects on\nsubjective well-being, experienced emotions, political polarization, outrage,\nand sense of belonging. Critically, we move beyond simply probing the average\neffect of social media use^24 and instead ask how these effects (if any) are\nmoderated by who the person is (e.g., personality traits, age, gender), what\nthey are doing on social media (e.g., commenting, passive scrolling, etc.),\nand why they are using social media (e.g., for entertainment, news\nconsumption, etc.).\n\nTo address the limitations of prior social media studies (e.g., cross-\nsectional methods and retrospective self-reports)^24,44), we conduct an\nexperience sampling study. This method involves surveying participants\nmultiple times a day over several days to capture the occurrence of events and\nwithin-person changes over time. Although still a self-report method, the\nexperience sampling approach attempts to mitigate some of the common\nchallenges associated with self-report methods. Traditional self-report\nmethods often face issues such as recall bias, where participants might not\naccurately remember past events. Experience sampling offers high ecological\nvalidity and low recall biases^45, complementing existing social media\nresearch methods. It also enables the separation of between and within-subject\neffects and the examination of causal heterogeneity^46. Given that within\ngroups associations do not translate into within individual associations,\nprocesses at both levels of analysis should be examined^27.\n\n## Method\n\n### Sampling strategy\n\nUsing multi-level simulations^47 (with d = 0.15 and 80% statistical power), we\ndetermined that a sample size of 220\u2013300 participants (each providing 20\nobservations) would suffice. We ultimately aimed to collect data from 300\nparticipants. To get as close as possible to a representative sample of\nTwitter users in age, gender, and race, we used quota sampling on Prolific\nAcademic^48, where we screened participants for Twitter use, inviting those\nwho used the platform at least twice a week to participate in our study. 404\nparticipants accepted the invitation to join the study and answered the\nbaseline survey. We ran the screening and the invitations to the study in\nbatches (8 in total) until we had at least 300 participants answering at least\none of the experience sampling surveys (N = 309). Data was collected from\nMarch to June 2021. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at\nthe University of Toronto. All participants gave informed consent before\njoining the study.\n\nAfter excluding participants for failing attention checks or not responding to\nenough surveys (less than 9), our final sample was reduced to 252\nparticipants. A sensitivity analysis revealed that our final sample still\nallowed to detect effect sizes d = 0.15 for within-subject effects and d =\n0.35 for between-subject effects considering 80% power. These individuals had\nan average age of 42.99 years (SD = 14.06), were 51% male, and had a racial\ncomposition roughly representative of the US population (72% white, 14% black,\n7.5% Asian, 4% mixed race, and 2.5% other ethnicities). 67.5% of the sample\nself-identified as liberal, 13.5% as conservative, 16.3% as moderates, and\n2.8% did not report political ideology. On Twitter, 14% of the users consider\nthemselves to be very conservative and about 64% of heavy users identify as\nDemocrats (compared with 55% of light users)^7. These numbers suggest that our\nsample was roughly representative of Twitter user in terms of political\nideology. While our sample was not strictly representative, it was an\nimprovement over many social media studies that rely on convenience samples of\nundergraduate students or focus on the most active Twitter users (Pew Research\nCenter, 2021).\n\n### Procedure\n\nAfter participants joined the study on Prolific, they completed a baseline\nsurvey that included the Big Five personality questionnaire^49 and more\ninformation about the experience sampling study. We included but did not\nanalyze numerous other variables. For a full list of the measures see the\nsupplementary methods in the Supporting Information file. Figure 1 contains a\nflowchart of the study procedures.\n\nFig. 1: Flowchart of study procedures.\n\nParticipants were pre-screened based on Twitter use frequency (left box).\nParticipants then answered the baseline survey (center box) and were invited\nto join the experience sampling study (right box), where they received 5\nsurveys a day for 7 days asking about their social media use and psychological\noutcomes.\n\nFull size image\n\nAfter participants answered the baseline survey, they were invited to join the\nexperience sampling study. To get a representative sample of people\u2019s\nexperience, the experience sampling surveys were sent five times a day for\nseven days between 9 am and 10 pm at random times with an interval of at least\ntwo hours between surveys; they answered a total of 6218 surveys (see detailed\nstudy procedures on Fig. 1). The surveys were sent via text message with\nSurveySignal and distributed via Qualtrics. Participants had up to 40 min to\nanswer the survey before the link expired. In these surveys, participants were\nasked if they had used Twitter in the past 30 min (yes/no); and if they\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d, we explored further details of their experience.\n\nSurveys asked participants if they had used Twitter in the past 30 min; if\nthey said yes, they were probed to provide details of their usage. If they\nsaid no, they completed filler questions so that the survey would be the same\nlength had they reported using Twitter or not. To examine the different types\nof use, participants next reported on their Twitter behaviors (what they were\ndoing on Twitter, for example passively scrolling or commenting) and Twitter\nfunctions (why they were using Twitter, for example to seek information or for\nentertainment). Participants were then asked to report on their current levels\nof well-being, experienced emotion, affective polarization, and sense of\nbelonging.\n\nWe conceptualized Twitter behaviors as observable actions or activities they\ncould do on Twitter, such as tweeting or messaging. To obtain that\ninformation, we asked participants to select which behaviors they had\nperformed on Twitter in the past 30 min from a list of behaviors containing\n(1) scrolling down the feed, (2) liking tweets, (3) retweeting tweets, (4)\ntweeting, (5) making a comment, (6) messaging, (7) seeing the trending topics,\nand (8) seeing others\u2019 profile. Participants indicated all the behaviors they\nperformed in binary form. We also asked participants if they had interacted\n\u201cwith anyone who holds different values or a different worldview\u201d from theirs\non Twitter (\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d).\n\nWe conceptualized Twitter functions (the why of Twitter use) as the underlying\nmotivations or reasons for the Twitter behaviors. For instance, I can comment\non a tweet because I want to socialize with others or because I want to\nrelieve my boredom. To get a sense of the possible functions, we consulted\nqualitative research on why people use social media^50 and then created and\npiloted a scale that captures functions of social media use into five factors:\nusing social media for entertainment, escapism, social interaction, self-\npromotion, and information seeking. All details of the development of the\nFunctions of Social Media Use scale can be found under supplementary methods\nand tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information file. In the experience\nsampling surveys, participants answered \u201cwhy did you use Twitter in the past\n30 min?\u201d by selecting one or more options from a list containing \u201cTo entertain\nmyself/have fun.\u201d (entertainment factor), \u201cTo distract myself from stressful\nevents.\u201d (escapism factor), \u201cTo interact with a community or group of people.\u201d\n(social interaction factor), \u201cTo promote myself or my work.\u201d (self-promotion\nfactor), \u201cTo seek information or inspiration.\u201d (information seeking factor).\nAll responses were recorded in binary form. Participants who indicated that\nthey had not used twitter in the past 30 min were provided with filler\nquestions so that the survey would have the same length had they reported\nusing Twitter or not.\n\nFinally, we measured our dependent variables. First, we asked participants\nabout their current levels of well-being with a modified version of the Scale\nof Positive and Negative Experience^51, a scale that asks participants to\nindicate the extent to which they have felt 13 different emotions in the past\n30 min. We modified the scale to add some emotional experiences we were\ninterested in (bored, lonely, anxious, disgusted, repulsed, excited, tired)\nand excluded some items that were somehow redundant (good, bad, pleasant,\nunpleasant, happy, contented) to keep it short. From the original scale, we\nkept positive, negative, sad, afraid, joyful, and angry. Participants\nindicated in a 5-point Likert scale the extent to which they have felt each\nemotion ranging from \u201cnone at all\u201d to \u201ca great deal\u201d. We conceptualized\nmomentary well-being as the difference between the mean of positive emotions\n(positive and joyful) and the mean of negative emotions (negative, sad,\nafraid, and angry). We conceptualized outrage as the sum of the emotions\nangry, disgusted, and repulsed (Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.80).\n\nWe then prompted participants about their sense of belonging in an online\ncommunity with a two-item measure adapted from the sense of belonging in sport\nscale^52 in which participants answered in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from\n\u201cStrongly Agree\u201d to \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d. The items asked participants the\nextent to which they felt like they belonged to a community and the extent to\nwhich they felt valued and respected in a community. To inquire about\nparticipants\u2019 current levels of affective polarization, we used a thermometer\nscale that asked them to rate from 0 to 100 how warm they felt towards\nDemocrats and Republicans^53. Polarization was operationalized as the absolute\nvalue of the difference between warmth towards Democrats and Republicans. We\nalso wanted to know the effects of social interactions on well-being, so we\nasked participants if they had any social interaction in the past 30 min, if\nthat interaction was online or in person, and the quality of that interaction\nin a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cvery negative\u201d to \u201cvery positive\u201d.\n\nParticipants were compensated for their participation according to how much\ndata they provided. All participants who answered the baseline survey and at\nleast one of the experience sampling surveys received $5. Participants could\nearn up to $25 if they answered more than 90% of the surveys and proved that\nthey had an active Twitter account (by providing a Twitter handle of an\nexisting account).\n\nParticipants have filled out, on average, 24.67 surveys out of the 35 sent\n(calculated across participants), with an SD of 7.15. The median of responses\nacross participants was 26, and the mode was both 31 and 32 (17 observations\neach). The lowest number of surveys that a participant could answer and still\nbe included in our analysis was 9 (the actual sample minimum). 11 participants\nanswered all 35 surveys.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nWe used multilevel Bayesian models using the package brms^54 in R 4.0.3^55 to\nanalyze the data. We were interested in the average effects and in the\nvariability of the effect among participants, so we used models with random\nintercepts and random slopes. The outcome variables were z-scored to\nfacilitate comparison of the magnitude of effects among different DVs. To\nprevent the confounding of different levels of analysis, we divided our\npredictors into between-subjects means and within-subjects deviations^56. This\nallowed us to differentiate when the effects were driven by within-person\ndifferences or between-person differences. To estimate the practical\nsignificance of our effects, we compared coefficients with a positive control,\na benchmark predictor that had a predictable and meaningful effect on one of\nthe DVs.\n\nAn example of the model is in Eq. (1), where Y is the outcome of interest, X\nis the predictor, and t is the number of the observation (such that t - 1 is a\nlagged observation). In all models, we controlled for the lagged outcome\nvariable (Y_t-1) to remove the variance explained by previous levels of the\noutcome variable. We also controlled for past levels of the predictor (X_t-1)\nto remove the variance that might be related to previous experiences. These\ncontrols allowed us to estimate the association between Twitter use and\nchanges in the outcome variable of interest (e.g., the difference in well-\nbeing between two time points a few hours apart).\n\n$$Y = Y_{t - 1} + X + X_{t - 1} + \\left( {Y_{t - 1} + X + X_{t -\n1}|\\;participant} \\right)$$\n\n(1)\n\nFor each model, we used 4 Markov chains Monte Carlo with 10,000 iterations\neach, discarding the first 5000. The total number of draws after warmup was\n20,000. We did not specify any priors, so the models used the brms default\n(flat). For each result, we report the mean of the posterior samples as well\nas two-sided 95% Credible Intervals (lower 95% CI and upper 95% CI). Data,\nmaterials, and code can be found at osf.io/e8krz.\n\n### Preregistration\n\nWe initially preregistered our study protocol at osf.io/en92q. However, during\nour research, the data we collected prompted a significant shift in our\nanalysis. Instead of testing the preregistered hypotheses, then, we adapted\nour approach to explore the correlations of Twitter use more thoroughly. We\nalso used robust Bayesian analyses, something we did not foresee. This major\ndeviation from our original plan, driven by the nature of the rich data we\ncollected, means that the current study diverged significantly from its\npreregistration\u2014so we no longer consider it a preregistered study. However,\nfor the sake of transparency, we note and link to the original preregistration\nand justified our decision to not consider this study preregistered.\n\n## Results\n\nTo analyze the data, we used Bayesian multilevel models controlling for past\nlevels of the dependent variable and the independent variable\u2014these controls\nallowed us to better isolate effects of Twitter use in the past 30 min on\nrecent changes in the outcome variables. To avoid conflating cross-sectional\nand longitudinal effects, all our predictors were separated into two\nvariables: one containing the variance of individual differences (the\nparticipant\u2019s mean for that variable, labeled as between-person level of the\npredictor) and another containing the variance of participants\u2019 change over\ntime (score mean-centered around participant\u2019s mean, labeled within-person\nlevel). This strategy allowed us to disentangle effects at different levels.\nAll outcome variables were z-scored to facilitate comparison. We considered\nassociations as substantial if they did not include zero in their 95% credible\nintervals. We report point estimates and 95% credible intervals to facilitate\ninterpretation.\n\n### Description of everyday Twitter use\n\nOn average, participants reported being on Twitter on 26.7% of the surveys\nthey answered (SD = 21%). Most of the Twitter use was passive, as active\nTwitter behaviors (Tweeting or Retweeting) were reported on average in only\n18.2% of the surveys in which they used Twitter (SD = 29.4%). The most common\nbehavior on Twitter was scrolling down the feed; participants reported this\nbehavior in 74% of the surveys they reported Twitter use. The least common\nbehavior was messaging other people on Twitter, reported in 7% of the survey\nwhere Twitter use was reported. A breakdown of all Twitter behaviors is on\nFig. 2. The co-occurrence of behaviors and functions can be seen in Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 2: Frequency of different types of Twitter use.\n\nLeft: Diagram of all the reported behaviors performed on Twitter. In dark\nblue, we have the total amount of surveys answered by the participants (n =\n6218). In the center, we have the proportion of the total answers in which\nparticipants reported Twitter use (26%) in light blue and the proportion of\nsurveys in which participants did not report Twitter use (74%) in orange. On\nthe right side of the lest panel, we have a breakdown of the frequency of each\nbehavior on Twitter. Behaviors were not mutually exclusive, so they are not\nsupposed to sum 100%. Note that the percentages of the behaviors are relative\nto the total amount of surveys in which they reported having used Twitter\n(e.g.: scrolling down was reported in 74% of 1610 surveys). Right: Boxplots of\nthe percent of times that participants reported using Twitter for specific\nfunctions. The average was calculated across participants. All the percentages\nare relative to the total amount of times of surveys in which Twitter use was\nreported (1610). The Twitter functions were not mutually exclusive, so\nparticipants could select multiple in a single survey.\n\nFull size image\n\nFig. 3: Co-occurrence of the what and why of Twitter use.\n\nA heat map of the frequency of reported behaviors (rows) and functions\n(columns). Darker colors indicate that the behavior and function co-occurred\nmore often.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe also asked participants why they used Twitter in the past 30 min and let\nthem select as many options as they wanted from the functions of social media\nuse scale. Participants reported having used social media for \u201centertainment\u201d\npurposes most of the time (66% of the surveys), followed by \u201cinformation\nseeking\u201d (49%), \u201cinteracting with others\u201d (23%), \u201cescapism\u201d (18%), and \u201cself-\npromotion\u201d (2%). Participants reported encountering people whose opinions\ndiffered from theirs 14% of the time they were on Twitter (SD = 24%).\n\n### Twitter use, well-being, and emotions in daily life\n\nTo assess well-being, participants answered a modified version of the Scale of\nPositive and Negative Experience^51, indicating the extent to which they have\nfelt 13 different emotions in the past 30 min. Momentary well-being was\nconceptualized as the difference between the mean of positive emotions\n(positive and joyful) and the mean of negative emotions (negative, sad,\nafraid, and angry).\n\nWhen participants used Twitter, they reported a decrease of .10 SD in well-\nbeing, b_within = 0.10, CrI = [\u22120.15, \u22120.04] (Fig. 4). That effect was found\nonly at the within-person level. To estimate how meaningful the effects were,\nwe used a benchmark from our own sample. In our survey, we asked participants\nif they had personally interacted with others in the past 30 min. Because\nsocial interactions have a meaningful and overall positive effect on people\u2019s\nwell-being^57, estimating its effect on well-being in our sample serves as a\ngood benchmark to compare against our effect sizes.\n\nFig. 4: Relationship between Twitter use and main outcome variables.\n\nThe diagram represents the relationship between Twitter use and the main\noutcome variables as well as the relationship between social interaction and\nwell-being (our benchmark condition). b_w is the coefficient for within-person\ndifferences, b_b is the coefficient for between-person differences. Asterisks\nindicate that the credibility interval does not include zero.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe found that having an in-person social interaction in the past 30 min\n(versus not) was related to a 0.15 SD increases in well-being (within-person),\nb_within = 0.15, CrI = [0.02, 0.28]. The coefficient for the effect of Twitter\nuse on well-being (b_within = \u22120.10) was in the opposite direction but had\ntwo-thirds of the magnitude of our benchmark, suggesting substantial effects.\n\nWe also investigated the effects of Twitter use on reported boredom, anxiety,\nand loneliness, emotions that could complement the relationship with well-\nbeing (all measured as individual items in the Scale of Positive and Negative\nExperience). Twitter use was related to a 0.22 SD increase in boredom at the\nwithin-person level, b_within = 0.22, CrI = [0.14, 0.30], and a 0.50 SD\nincrease at the between person level, b_between = 0.50, CrI = [0.18, 0.83].\nBoth coefficients were larger than our benchmark, again suggesting substantial\neffects (Fig. 4). Twitter use was related to a 0.42 SD increase in loneliness,\nonly at the between-person level (i.e., people who use Twitter more are, on\naverage, lonelier),b_within = 0.42, CrI = [0.05, 0.78]. Twitter use was not\nrelated to anxiety at any level of analysis, b_within = 0.02, 95% CrI =\n[\u22120.03, 0.08], b_between = 0.16, 95% CrI = [\u22120.18, 0.50].\n\n### Twitter use and sense of belonging\n\nSense of belonging online was measured using a two-item scale that asked\nparticipants to express the extent to which they felt like they belonged to a\ncommunity and the extent to which they felt valued and respected in a\ncommunity^52 in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d to\n\u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d.\n\nTwitter use was related to a 0.11 SD increase in sense of belonging,b_within =\n0.11, CrI = [0.04, 0.17], only at the within-person level with a coefficient\nclose to the benchmark, suggesting a meaningful association between Twitter\nuse and sense of belonging (Fig. 4).\n\n### Twitter use and polarization\n\nParticipants\u2019 current levels of affective polarization were operationalized as\nthe absolute difference between warmth towards Democrats and Republicans. It\nwas measured using a thermometer scale, where 0 was cold and 100 was warm^53.\nTwitter use was significantly related to a 0.03 SD increase in polarization,\nb_within = 0.03, CrI = [0.00, 0.06], at the within-person level, with a\ncoefficient one-fifth of the absolute magnitude of our positive control\nbenchmark, so quite small (Fig. 4).\n\nWe also asked participants if they had interacted with anyone who holds\ndifferent values or a different worldview from theirs on Twitter (\u201cyes\u201d or\n\u201cno\u201d). We examined whether encountering people with different views or\nopinions would be related to changes in polarization but the credibility\nintervals included zero, b_within = \u22120.05, 95% CrI = [\u22120.16, 0.74], b_between\n= \u22124.52, 95% CrI [\u22120.13, 0.10], suggesting that the relationship might be too\nweak to be detected or non-existent.\n\n### Twitter use and outrage\n\nWe conceptualized outrage as the sum of the emotions angry, disgusted, and\nrepulsed (Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.80). Twitter use was related to a 0.19 SD\nincrease in reported outrage at the within-person level, b_within = 0.19, CrI\n= [0.10, 0.28]. The magnitude of this effect was larger than the benchmark\n(Fig. 4). The large effect suggests that Twitter use and experiences of\noutrage tend to be closely related. We also tested if encountering people with\ndifferent opinions would be related to changes in outrage. Our results did not\nsuggest a relationship between the two variables, b_within = 0.13, 95% CrI =\n[\u22120.53, 0.78], b_between = 0.35, 95% CrI = [\u22120.31, 1.00], which could stem\nfrom low statistical power or a lack of association between the variables. A\nsummary of the associations between Twitter use and the main outcome variables\ncan be found in Table S3 in the supplementary information file.\n\n### The what of Twitter use\n\nTwitter behaviors were conceptualized as observable actions or activities they\ncould do on Twitter, such as (1) scrolling down the feed, (2) liking tweets,\n(3) retweeting, (4) tweeting, (5) making a comment, (6) messaging, (7) seeing\nthe trending topics, and (8) seeing others\u2019 profile. Participants indicated\nall the behaviors they performed in binary form. To examine what aspects of\nTwitter use are related to different consequences for the users, we ran models\nincluding all Twitter behaviors while controlling for past levels of the\noutcome variable. Samples for each behavior were restricted to the count of\nparticipants who reported engaging in them. We found that scrolling down the\nfeed predicted a 0.08 SD (CrI = [\u22120.15, \u22120.01]) decrease in well-being at the\nwithin-person level with a magnitude half the size of our benchmark. Replying\nto others\u2019 tweets (b_within = 0.23, CrI = [0.06, 0.4]), visiting trending\ntopics (b_within = 0.15, CrI = [0.05, 0.25]), and visiting others\u2019 profiles\n(b_within = 0.15, CrI = [0.01, 0.28]) predicted increased sense of belonging\nat the within-subject level with effects at least as large as our benchmark.\nRetweeting behavior predicted 1.15 SD increases in polarization (b_within =\n1.15, CrI = [0.21, 2.15]) at the between-person level (i.e., people who tend\nto retweet a lot are more polarized). No Twitter behaviors were associated\nwith changes in outrage. A summary of the relationships is reported in Fig. 4.\nFor a full list of associations, see Table S4 and Fig. S2 in the Supporting\nInformation File.\n\n### The why of Twitter use\n\nWe conceptualized Twitter functions (the why of Twitter use) as the underlying\nmotivations or reasons for the Twitter behaviors. For instance, I can comment\non a tweet because I want to socialize with others or because I want to\nrelieve my boredom. Because there were no available measures for this\nconstruct, we consulted qualitative research on why people use social media^50\nand then created and piloted a scale that captures functions of social media\nuse into five factors: using social media for entertainment, escapism, social\ninteraction, self-promotion, and information seeking. All details of the\ndevelopment of the Functions of Social Media Use scale can be found under\nsupplementary methods in the Supporting Information file. In the surveys,\nparticipants answered \u201cwhy did you use Twitter in the past 30 min?\u201d by\nselecting one or more options from a list containing a description of the five\nfactors. All responses were recorded in binary form. We ran models including\nall functions of use as predictors and controlling for past levels of the\noutcome. Using Twitter for escapism predicted decreases in well-being at both\nthe within (0.25 SD, CrI = [\u22120.39, \u22120.12]) and between-person (1.43 SD, CrI =\n[\u22122.78, \u22120.25]) levels. Using Twitter for entertainment predicted a 0.04\nwithin-person increase in polarization, CrI = [0.01, 0.08]. Using social media\nfor social interaction predicted a 0.70 SD increase in between-person sense of\nbelonging, CrI = [0.11, 1.31]. Finally, increased outrage was predicted by\nescapism at the between-person level (0.33 SD, CrI = [0.62, 2.9]) and\ninformation seeking at the within-person (0.14 SD, CrI = [0.03, 0.25]). Except\nfor the effect on polarization, all effects were larger in magnitude than our\nbenchmark. All relationships are reported in Fig. 5. These results suggest\nthat different ways of using Twitter can effectively lead to varied outcomes\nat the within- and between-person levels.\n\nFig. 5: Relationships between Twitter behaviors and functions with well-being,\npolarization, sense of belonging, and outrage.\n\nA all the relationships between Twitter behaviors, functions of Twitter use,\nand the main outcome variables. Positive signs indicate a positive\nrelationship. Oval boxes represent the effect at the within-person level,\nround rectangles are the relationships at the between-person level.

C Z-scored coefficients for the types of use that predicted\nthe outcome variables at the between-subject level. Lines represent\ncredibility interval (n = 252).\n\nFull size image\n\n### The who of Twitter use\n\nEven though we found aggregate effects of Twitter use on well-being, sense of\nbelonging, polarization, and outrage, all effects were heterogeneous among\nparticipants. Figure 6 shows how much the coefficients (slopes) varied among\nparticipants. Note, for instance, that in the domain of well-being, despite\nthe overall impact of Twitter use being negative, many participants\nexperienced increased well-being with Twitter use.\n\nFig. 6: Heterogeneity of the effects of Twitter use among participants for\neach outcome.\n\nOn each plot, we have a spaghetti plot where the x axis represents Twitter use\n(where zero is no twitter use and one is reported Twitter use), and the y axis\nis the centered outcome variable. In clockwise order, each plot represents the\nvariability for well-being, polarization, outrage, and sense of belonging.\nEach grey line represents the regression slope for one participant when the\noutcome variable is mean centered around the participant mean. Red line\nrepresents the average slope. All models controlled for past levels of the DV\nand the IV. The outrage plot has 248 participants, the sense of belonging plot\nhas 245 participants, the well-being plot has 246 participants, and the\npolarization plot has 248.\n\nFull size image\n\nBecause of this high variability and research suggesting that the effects of\nsocial media use might be moderated by individual differences^24, we next\nprobed the who of Twitter use, examining whether any individual variables,\nsuch as personality, age, and gender, would moderate the relationship between\nTwitter use and its various outcomes. We found no evidence that individual\nvariables moderated the effects of Twitter. The lack of interactions could\nhave resulted from our limited statistical power, so we compared the model fit\nbetween models with and without interactions. The model fit comparison\napproach supported the null results for individual differences. All results\nare reported in Table 1. Although unexpected, this finding is corroborated by\nJohannes and colleagues^23, who found no evidence that reported social media\nuse was associated with individual differences.\n\nTable 1 Results of the interaction effects between Twitter use and the\nmoderating variables\n\nFull size table\n\n## Discussion\n\nAs the number of social media users increases every year, it is crucial to\nestimate how both people and society are affected by it. In the current study,\nwe estimated the effects of Twitter use (now X), a social media platform that\nhas the potential to shape public opinion and decision-making. Using the\nexperience sampling technique over a period of one week, we found that Twitter\nuse was related to overall within-person decreases in well-being and within-\nperson increases in sense of belonging, polarization, outrage, and boredom. We\nalso found that specific Twitter behaviors were linked to different outcomes:\nscrolling down the feed or using Twitter to distract oneself from problems\n(passive uses) were linked to within-person decreases in well-being,\nconsistent with the idea that passively using social media is more detrimental\nto people^41,58. Using it to connect with others on the platform (by replying\nto others, checking the trending topics, or checking other\u2019s profiles) was\nlinked to within-person increases in sense of belonging; using it for\nentertainment was linked to within-person increases in polarization; while\nusing it for information seeking was linked to within-person increases in\noutrage. All estimates were compared to a benchmark (the effect of a social\ninteraction on well-being) and were comparable in magnitude: the smallest\neffect was one fifth of the benchmark while the largest was 25% larger.\n\nThe decomposition of variances into within-person and between-person\ncomponents has shed light on specific associations unique to each level,\npotentially providing clarity to enduring debates in the literature. For\nexample, a connection between loneliness and Twitter use emerged solely at the\nbetween-person level. This absence of association at the within-person level\ncould imply that Twitter use does not inherently exacerbate loneliness.\nInstead, external factors contributing to loneliness might simultaneously\ndrive individuals to use Twitter, although potential causal processes at\nextended timescales cannot be dismissed. Regarding other outcome variables,\ncertain associations were discerned only at the within-person level, such as\nthe impact of Twitter use on well-being, polarization, outrage, and sense of\nbelonging. These findings may indicate that while fluctuations in emotional\nstates and Twitter use may coincide, these correlations do not persist over\ntime to be observable in between-person analyses.\n\nAt the between-person level, people who used Twitter a lot were lonelier and\nmore bored; people who retweeted a lot were more polarized; people who used\nTwitter to avoid their problems (escapism) had lower well-being and higher\noutrage levels; and people who used Twitter for social interactions had a\nhigher sense of belonging. That people who retweet more often are more\npolarized is consistent with previous findings that most Twitter data are\nproduced by a minority of users who tend to be more politically engaged than\nthe average user^8. The relationship between social interaction on Twitter and\nsense of belonging was also consistent with expectations: people who generally\nfeel a stronger sense of community are more likely to do activities that\ninvolve social interactions. Finally\u2014because avoidant coping strategies tend\nto be unsuccessful and cause emotional distress^59 and because well-being and\noutrage were operationalized as a function of negative emotional\nexperiences\u2014people who generally used Twitter to escape their problems\nprobably felt less happy and more outraged due to the negative emotional\nconsequences of using avoidant strategies to deal with their problems.\n\nWhy does whether someone uses Twitter or not relates to changes in\npsychological states? One explanation lies in how people use Twitter. When it\ncomes to well-being, for instance, the predominance of passive or reactive\ntypes of use, such as scrolling down the feed, liking a tweet, and checking\nthe trending topics, leaves users susceptible to the types of content they\nencounter on Twitter, which could lead users to engage in negative social\ncomparisons and consume news, behaviors that are potentially linked to\nnegative emotional consequences^24,60,61. Our study design, however, did not\nallow us to infer the direction of the relationships, so it is possible that\nwhat people feel influences their likelihood of using Twitter in specific\nways.\n\nSimilarly, the relationship between Twitter use and increased outrage can be\npotentially explained by information seeking on Twitter. Since people are more\nlikely to encounter moral violations on social media^5, they are more likely\nto get outraged when on social media, and the effect might be especially\nprominent when users go to the platform with the intention of looking for news\nor information. Although the effects of encountering moral violations seem\nespecially prominent in the domain of politics, it is likely that it also\noccurs in non-political contexts^5,62. Because effect direction cannot be\ndetermined, it is also possible that participants use Twitter when they are\nexperiencing outrage. This finding also suggests that expressions of outrage\non social media are not merely performative\u2014as some might speculate\u2014, as\nparticipants report feeling these emotions in surveys that only the\nresearchers would see.\n\nWe also found that not only is Twitter associated with a higher sense of\nbelonging, but that specific types of use, such as using Twitter for social\ninteractions, replying to others\u2019 Tweets, visiting others\u2019 profiles, and\nchecking the trending topics are especially linked to higher sense of\nbelonging, corroborating our hypothesis that how people use Twitter matters.\nThe first three types of use were not surprising: they refer to interactions\nwith other people on the platform, which might generate a sense of community\nand friendship. The relationship between checking the trending topics and\nsense of belonging, however, is more puzzling. We speculate that because\ntrending topics on Twitter contain news from topics of large cultural in-\ngroups, such as politics or pop culture, users might have an increased sense\nof belonging while browsing them.\n\nThe relationship between Twitter use and polarization is more puzzling. One\nsurprising finding was that using social media for entertainment was related\nto within-person increases in polarization. While an explanation is not\nobvious, we speculate about the possible directions of this relationship. It\nis possible that when participants experience events that increase\npolarization, they go to social media to clear their minds. This is consistent\nwith the fact that most participants who said they went to Twitter for\nentertainment mostly scrolled down the feed (Fig. 5), supporting the idea that\nTwitter serves as a distraction. Another explanation is that people who use\nsocial media for entertainment may find satisfaction in engaging with divisive\ncontent. This might be similar to the way \u201ctrolls\u201d enjoy provoking others\nonline^63. Still, it was not evident that how people use Twitter impacts their\nlevel of polarization. Instead, we suggest that more systemic influences, such\nas the existence of echo-chambers (in which users self-select to groups with\nsimilar worldviews^2,5,64) contribute to increased polarization^65. This\nhypothesis is also consistent with the fact that most public content is\nproduced by a minority of users who are, on average, more polarized^34 and\nwith our finding that polarized users retweet more often.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that many of the effects of Twitter use\nare explained by psychological processes that happen within the same person\nand that they have practical significance in people\u2019s lives. There is an\nimportant caveat, however. Despite the aggregate effects having practical\nsignificance, they were heterogeneous among participants. This means, for\ninstance, that a significant number of participants experienced increased\nwell-being with increased Twitter use. Due to the high variability in the\neffects, we probed for individual differences that could moderate these\neffects but found no evidence that personality, age, or sex moderate these\neffects. It is possible that sex effects are more pronounced in samples of\nadolescents^66, so a more representative sample would not detect these\neffects. These findings suggest that individual factors might not be as\nrelevant for social media as previously thought^24 or that individual\ndifferences other than the ones measured in our study moderate these\nrelationships.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis study advances previous research on the psychological effects of Twitter\nuse by employing a naturalistic intensive longitudinal design and a more\nrepresentative sample. Although our results for the within-person analyses\nsuggest that some processes happen at the intra-individual level, we cannot\ncompletely rule out the possibility of time-varying confounders (i.e., maybe\nwhen people are experiencing stressful events they both use Twitter more and\nhave worse moods) or establish the direction of the intra-individual\nrelationships (i.e., do I use Twitter when I am bored, or do I become bored\nwhen I am on Twitter?). Studies allowing for stronger causal inferences (e.g.,\nexperimental studies) are needed.\n\nIn trying to estimate precisely how much Twitter use influences psychological\nstates over time, we ended up analyzing the relationship between variables\nthat were a few hours apart. While understanding these close relationships is\na first step to estimating the impact of Twitter, it is plausible that they do\nnot extend to larger time periods (i.e., if I use Twitter for a month, how\nmuch does it affect me one year later?). While past studies have explored\nthese effects on platforms such as Facebook^30, ongoing research should\nexplore these relationships considering larger time windows on Twitter.\nFurthermore, future research should consider the potential impact of selection\nbiases. The participants in our sample consisted exclusively of active Twitter\nusers, which raises the possibility that those who experienced the most\nadverse effects from using Twitter may have already left the platform.\nConsequently, our findings might underestimate the negative influence of\nTwitter. Finally, while our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the\neffects of Twitter use, the comparative impact relative to other social media\nplatforms remains unexplored. Consequently, we suggest systematic reviews of\nvarious platforms as a valuable avenue for future research.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the effects of everyday Twitter\n(now X) use on well-being, emotions, sense of belonging, polarization, and\noutrage. Our findings demonstrate that a nuanced approach to the study of\nsocial media, for example, by categorizing the different affordances of the\nplatform and dividing the effects between and within persons, allows for a\nbetter understanding of how different uses explain the diverse experiences of\nsocial media. Our findings suggest that Twitter use is associated with both\npositive and negative effects, including decreased well-being, increased sense\nof belonging, polarization, outrage, and boredom. Certain behaviors and\nmotivations for Twitter use, such as scrolling down the feed and seeking\ninformation, contribute to these effects; however, we found no evidence that\nindividual differences explain the variability in the effects. These findings\nemphasize the importance of considering both individual differences and\nmomentary within-person changes over time when studying the psychological\neffects of Twitter use. They also indicate that future research ought to\nexplore other potential moderating factors and long-term impacts to guide\nhealthier social media engagement. Ultimately, understanding the complex\nrelationship between social media use and psychological well-being will\ncontribute to more informed decisions and healthier engagement with social\nmedia use.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets used in this study are available at osf.io/e8krz.\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe code is available at osf.io/e8krz.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
