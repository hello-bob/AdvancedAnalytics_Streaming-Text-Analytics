Polish Prime\nMinister Mateusz Morawiecki, Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy\nInfrastructure Anna \u0141ukaszewska-Trzeciakowska and U.S. Ambassador to Poland\nMark Brzezinski attended the signing ceremony in Warsaw.\n\nThe contract scope includes finalizing a site-specific design for three\nWestinghouse AP1000^\u00ae nuclear islands based on the most advanced Generation\nIII+ nuclear reactor available today; Turbine Island and Balance of Plant\ndesign work; and support for PEJ to prepare license application materials,\ntraining programs, and operations and maintenance procedures. The work\noutlined in the 18-month contract will begin immediately.\n\nFollowing the signing ceremony, from left: President of Bechtel\u2019s Nuclear,\nSecurity & Environmental global business unit John Howanitz; Westinghouse\nPresident and CEO Patrick Fragman; Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic\nEnergy Infrastructure Anna \u0141ukaszewska-Trzeciakowska; Polish Prime Minister\nMateusz Morawiecki; U.S. Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski; Assistant\nSecretary of Energy for International Affairs Andrew Light; President of the\nManagement Board of Polskie Elektrownie J\u0105drowe Mateusz Berger.\n\n\u201cOne week ago, Westinghouse and Bechtel, leaders of the American civil nuclear\npower sector, formed a consortium to design and build the first nuclear power\nplant under the Polish Nuclear Power Program. Two days later, Polskie\nElektrownie J\u0105drowe received a decision on environmental conditions for this\nproject in Pomerania. Today we witness signing a contract for the plant design\nand engineering. Consistent and timely implementation of the schedules\nassumed, but also the scope of the contract being executed today, confirm our\ndetermination to build the first nuclear power plant within the target\ntimeframe, in line with the budget, and with the optimum utilization of the\nPolish industry. Westinghouse and Bechtel are completing a sister project\nknown as Plant Vogtle in the American state of Georgia. Their combined\nexperience, lessons learned from the Vogtle project, optimizations implemented\non this basis, and the world's most advanced technological and engineering\nknow-how of Westinghouse and Bechtel are now being employed to fundamentally\nrebuild the Polish energy mix, provide a strong impulse to strengthen the\nPolish economy and train Polish technicians and engineers. The establishment\nof a nuclear culture in Poland means new opportunities for the whole country,\nwe want to introduce the best models,\u201d said Anna \u0141ukaszewska-Trzeciakowska,\nGovernment Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most significant steps forward to date in U.S.-Polish\ncivil nuclear cooperation. I commend the Polish government and the companies\ninvolved in the project for their focus in seeing this effort through to this\ncritical point,\u201d said Mark Brzezinski, U.S. Ambassador to Poland. \u201cThis is not\njust a commercial venture. Our hope is to support Poland as it becomes a hub\nfor civil nuclear technology deployment. Energy security is national security,\nand America\u2019s security is interdependent with Poland\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Energy has long looked forward to this day, achieving\nour biggest milestone yet for U.S.-Poland civil nuclear cooperation, years in\nthe making. This collaboration will stretch out for multiple decades, and\nprove to be a cornerstone of our enduring strategic and commercial\npartnership,\u201d said Andrew Light, Assistant Secretary of Energy for\nInternational Affairs at the Department of Energy. \u201cPoland will deploy the\nmost advanced and proven nuclear technology available today, that will provide\nclean, safe and reliable power, and create tens of thousands secure and\nsustainable energy jobs over multiple generations. This visionary project will\nfurther cement Poland as a premier center for advanced net zero energy\nsolutions which will protect our citizens from climate change while ensuring\nenergy independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are entering a watershed moment not only for our investment project, but\nalso for the entire energy transition process in Poland. Today's event\nconcludes the planning stage of the nuclear power plant and commences the\nexecution phase with relevant engineering work. In about 1.5 years, the signed\ncontract will result in the design/engineering documentation of the first\nnuclear power plant to be built in Pomerania,\u201d said Mateusz Berger, President\nof the Management Board of Polskie Elektrownie J\u0105drowe. \u201cThis moment is the\nculmination of very intensive work by many people from the Polish and U.S.\ngovernment administrations, as well as employees of PEJ, Westinghouse and\nBechtel, for which I would like to thank everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a transformational moment for Poland, for our partners, and for\nWestinghouse,\u201d said Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO. \u201cThe\nbreadth of the work we are performing here, as we create the foundations of a\nnuclear energy program where none existed before, will be a model for other\ncountries that seek decarbonization and energy security through safe, reliable\nnuclear energy. Poland is to be commended for showing the way forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoland\u2019s first nuclear power plant is a historic project, vital to the\ncountry\u2019s energy security and energy transition goals,\u201d said Craig Albert,\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer at Bechtel. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring\nBechtel\u2019s seven decades of global nuclear power expertise to this effort, and\nwe\u2019re proud to partner with PEJ, Westinghouse, and the thousands of local\nPolish construction workers and suppliers who will join together to make this\nproject a success.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s first AP1000^\u00ae nuclear reactor is anticipated to achieve commercial\noperation in 2033.\n\nThe AP1000 is the only operating Generation III+ reactor with fully passive\nsafety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MWe\non the market. In the U.S., at the Vogtle site in Georgia, one AP1000 unit is\nproducing power for the grid while a second unit recently completed its\ninitial fuel load with commercial operations likely later this year or\nearly-2024. Four AP1000 reactors are currently setting operational performance\nand availability records in China with six additional reactors under\nconstruction there. Earlier this year, Bulgaria selected the AP1000 technology\nfor its new reactor program and the technology is under consideration at\nmultiple other sites in Central and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, and in\nNorth America.\n\n## About Westinghouse\n\nWestinghouse Electric Company is shaping the future of carbon-free energy by\nproviding safe, innovative nuclear and other clean power technologies and\nservices globally.
