The researchers are looking for industrial partners and will work to make the device more efficient.\n\nResearchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) have built an electrical\ngenerator that consumes carbon dioxide, potentially opening the door to a new\nindustrial-scale carbon capture method.\n\nThe carbon-negative \"nano-generator\" is the work of Zhuyuan Wang and Xiwang\nZhang from UQ's Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation.\n\nIt pairs a poly amine gel already used to absorb CO2 with a thin \"skeleton\" of\nboron nitrate that's only a few atoms thick.\n\nThe prototype device generates electricity as it absorbs CO2.\n\nIt's the latter of those two results that have the researchers most excited.\n\nThe nano-generators have the potential to be a key component in a new form of\nindustrial carbon capture.\n\nHow does the nano-generator work?\n\nDr Wang believes, with further development, the technology can be scaled up to\nsignificantly reduce global CO2 emissions.\n\n\"We imagine two uses \u2013 one is we use the technology to directly integrate it\nto a commercial CO2 absorption plant so this can generate some electricity\nwhen absorbing CO2 to offset the cost,\" he said.\n\n\"We are very confident it can because nowadays CO2 absorption is not a\nlucrative business.\n\n\"Our technology can be used in these plants, we can largely reduce the energy\nconsumption and of course the capital costs, so make this business more\nsustainable and lucrative.\"\n\nA second application could be as a small, portable domestic unit consuming CO2\nfrom the immediate environment while creating enough electricity to power\nsmall devices or light bulbs.\n\nDr Wang said they have been working on the nano-generator for the past two\nyears, but more research was needed to make the chemical process more\nefficient.\n\nXiwang Zhang and Zhuyuan Wang have been working on the nano-generator for two\nyears.(Supplied: UQ)\n\n\"At present, we can harvest around 1 per cent of the total energy carried\nintrinsically by gas CO2 but, like other technologies, we will now work on\nimproving efficiency and reducing cost,\" Dr Wang said.\n\nProfessor Zhang, who is the director of the Dow Centre, said they would\ncontinue to develop the nano-generator through GETCO2, a research scheme run\nby one of the Australian Research Council's centres of excellence.\n\nDr Wang said they are also seeking industrial partners.\n\n## Existing carbon capture methods costly and inefficient\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is employed by the oil and gas industry as\none way to help offset greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Overhauling clean energy fund to include carbon capture and storage\n\nThe federal government has renewed plans to overhaul the Clean Energy Finance\nCorporation (CEFC) so it can invest in carbon capture and storage, promising\n$500 million of investment in emerging technology.\n\nRead more\n\nIt currently involves capturing CO2 at the site of production and then burying\nit deep underground where it becomes trapped in a porous rock layer.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said the majority of\ncarbon capture and storage projects around the world were not performing as\nwell as expected.\n\nThe institute said that while CCS had been around for decades, it was costly,\nthere were only about 30 active projects in the world and \"numerous projects\"\nhad been cancelled or failed.\n\nIt found that for Australian projects from 2016-17 to 2022-23, CCS injected 33\nper cent of emissions, which was collectively only 42 per cent of their carbon\ncapture targets.\n\nPosted 4h ago4 hours agoWed 17 Apr 2024 at 7:36pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Does carbon capture and storage work and can it help reduce emissions?\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Academic Research\n  * Australia\n  * Decarbonisation\n  * Global Warming\n  * Nanotechnology\n  * QLD\n  * St Lucia\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Stabbed Sydney bishop publicly forgives attacker and calls for calm\n\n  * ### 'Leave my hopes, dreams and country behind': Desperate HECS debtors brace for another large increase\n\n  * ### There's a baby drought in Australia.
