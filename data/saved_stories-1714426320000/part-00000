The big question is whether they will\nditch HashiCorp\u2019s new BUSL licensing scheme and go back to a true open-source\nmodel for products like Terraform and Vault, and I think it speaks to people\u2019s\nlack of a handle on what IBM is up to these days that a plausible sentiment is\n\u201chey, they might do it!\u201d\n\nThe main reaction from the community about HashiCorp spinning an increasingly\nnarrow set of options into a $6.4 billion exit is \u201cWelp ... good for them.\u201d\nAnd when a community says good for them, it\u2019s quite conspicuous what they\u2019re\nnot saying: good for us.\n\nBut I want to raise a different question today: how the heck did we get to\nthis point? Why was HashiCorp not snapped up long ago by a more viable cloud\nprovider? Specifically: why did they not get bought by Google Cloud?\n\nOn the surface it seems like a match made in heaven, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n  * Google Cloud is the number three cloud provider; a huge slice of their competitors\u2019 customers use and love HashiCorp products every day. Seems like a chance to steal some new fans.\n\n  * Google has historically cultivated a generous attitude toward open source. Hear those drums in the distance? That\u2019s the cursed board game of Kubernetes floating down the river towards you right now. I bet they wouldn\u2019t think twice about donating Terraform to the Linux Foundation, bringing the renegades at OpenTofu back into the fold.\n\n  * Google Cloud has a long history of making large strategic ops acquisitions (Stackdriver, Mandiant, Chronicle). Adding Vault and friends to their product portfolio would not be out of character for them.\n\n  * Google Cloud already treats Terraform pretty much as their default deployment option! (Technically they have a bespoke service called \u201cGoogle Cloud Deployment Manager\u201d, but it is deprecated in all but name and even GCP\u2019s own evangelists will tell you to just use Terraform instead.)\n\n  * I bet, if Google looked real hard under all the couch cushions, they could come up with 6.4 billion dollars.\n\nThese are all superficially compelling reasons to go out and buy HashiCorp.\n\nBut the reasons not to buy it are far more compelling\u2014and, I think, underscore\nwhat a tough spot HashiCorp was in, and why I\u2019m sure their reaction to signing\nthe LOI with IBM was a huge sigh of relief.\n\n###\n\nWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\n\nThis is the cynical reason. Google Cloud is grabbing close to 100% of the\nvalue of Terraform today from the OSS version. If they want a hosted Terraform\nservice, they can just build one themselves.\n\nAnd, in fact, that\u2019s exactly what they did. Last fall Google Cloud announced\nInfrastructure Manager, a service that slips managed Terraform deployments\nright into your existing Google Cloud CI/CD pipelines.\n\nI was at Google when this rolled out, and a product manager on the service\ntold me at the time that Infrastructure Manager really wasn\u2019t intended to\ncompete with HashiCorp Cloud Platform\u2014after all, it was a very Google Cloud-\nspecific solution designed to make Terraform feel like a seamless part of the\nGCP deployment experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re HashiCorp, of course, that\u2019s the last thing you want: for Terraform\nto become an invisible substrate of the cloud providers. I happen to know that\nHashiCorp was NOT happy about the release of Infrastructure Manager. But there\nwasn\u2019t much they could do other than change their license model.\n\n###\n\n$6.4 billion is just the beginning\n\nBut let\u2019s say Google buys HashiCorp anyway, just for the PR bump and the sales\ntalking points. That\u2019s when you realize that $6.4 billion is just the cover\ncharge, not the full tab.\n\nHashiCorp Cloud Platform (the hosted Terraform, Vault, etc that HC manages\nthemselves, their nominal secret sauce) runs on AWS today. So now you\u2019ve got\nto spend time and money on a huge migration, probably multiple years of\nplanning and work.\n\nAlso, to sell HashiCorp products into large enterprises you probably need to\nfund lots and lots and lots more enterprise support and solutions architects,\nthe competencies Google Cloud is persistently the worst at.\n\nOh yeah, plus\u2014you\u2019re already expending resources on the Google Cloud Terraform\nprovider. But now you\u2019re stuck having to support and co-maintain providers for\na pile of other partners, including your biggest competitors. You are\neffectively paying for AWS and Azure to use your $6.4 billion dollar toy for\nfree.\n\nIBM might be willing to take that deal if it means a snowball\u2019s chance of\nbeing taken seriously as a for-real cloud provider, but I don\u2019t think it\nreally makes sense for Google Cloud.\n\nWhich brings us to the existential question:\n\n###\n\nDo you really, really want to be in the \u201chybrid cloud deployment\u201d business?\n\nLike, what\u2019s the strategic value for Google Cloud in being the Terraform\nfairy? People with AWS footprints aren\u2019t going to use Google Cloud to manage\nstate for their deployments, that\u2019s just weird. Enormous companies have always\npreferred to roll their own infra platforms, meaning your real customers for\nmanaged Terraform, Consul, etc, are mostly mid-sized companies who have\nobnoxious price sensitivity. You\u2019re taking on all the responsibility of\nkeeping up with a notoriously fast-changing set of infrastructure tools while\ngetting very unclear revenue potential in return.\n\nHeck, I don\u2019t even think HashiCorp wanted to be in the hybrid cloud deployment\nbusiness. Their recent public filings make it clear that they couldn\u2019t figure\nout a SaaS business model and weren\u2019t confident in their ability to become a\nservices business.\n\nI think the only real argument for Google buying HashiCorp would come down to\nbrand value and OSS goodwill. And as they\u2019ve recently indicated by firing all\ntheir Python maintainers, hard-to-quantify efforts to improve the OSS commons\ndon\u2019t carry the weight at Google that they once did.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know for sure, but I think those are the big reasons HashiCorp was\nnever acquired by a major cloud provider.\n\nAnyway, HashiCorp eventually found a buyer that made sense, all these problems\nare IBM\u2019s problems now, and hopefully the people who built one of the most\ntruly remarkable and useful open-source software companies of all time can get\na well-deserved night\u2019s rest or two.\n\nIn all sincerity: good for them.\n\n##\n\nCartoon of the day\n\nI, too, have been through an acquisition.\n\n1\n\nI sometimes refer to them as \u201cIchabod Business Machines\u201d. Nobody gets me.\n\n### Subscribe to Good Tech Things\n\nBy Forrest Brazeal \u00b7 Launched 5 years ago\n\nCloud and tech commentary from Forrest Brazeal\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why didn't Google Cloud buy HashiCorp?\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nPlease fix the AWS Free Tier before somebody gets hurt\n\nLet engineers learn cloud without jeopardizing their personal well-being.\n\nMay 4, 2021 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Please fix the AWS Free Tier before somebody gets hurt\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n34\n\nWait, is cloud bad?\n\nI regret to inform you that there is discourse\n\nOct 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n51\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Wait, is cloud bad?\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n4\n\nThe greatest resume I've ever seen\n\nHe had zero cloud experience ... or did he?\n\nSep 30, 2021 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The greatest resume I've ever seen\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Forrest Brazeal\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
