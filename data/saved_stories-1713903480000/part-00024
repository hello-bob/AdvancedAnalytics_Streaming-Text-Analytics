It means we are currently not able to\nremotely identify faults in the street lighting system.\n\n\"The default mode for faults is that the lights stay on to ensure that roads\nare not left completely unlit and become a safety concern. There are a number\nof steps required to resolve the problem, and we are working through these as\nquickly as we can.\"\n\nEwens was also told that the issue was expected to be resolved by the end of\nnext week (May 3). That said, the council also thought its cyberattack would\nbe sorted out within a few days when it was first disclosed, so who knows how\nlong it will take for locals' circadian rhythms to get back on track.\n\n### Disaster handled\n\nDays after it became clear this early month that Leicester City Council\nwouldn't pay INC's ransom demands, even after it leaked a sample of sensitive\ncouncil data, the miscreants published the entirety of the files it stole,\namounting to a sizeable 1.3 TB.\n\n\"At 1.3 TB, this is a much larger batch of data than the 25 documents\npublished last week,\" said Richard Sword, the council's strategic director of\ncity development and neighborhoods.\n\n  * Ransomware gang did steal residents' confidential data, UK city council admits\n  * INC Ransom claims to be behind 'cyber incident' at UK city council\n  * UK council won't say whether two-week 'cyber incident' impacted resident data\n  * UK council yanks IT systems and phone lines offline following cyber ambush\n\n\"We are in the process of reviewing the data to see exactly what it consists\nof, and have notified the Information Commissioner of our actions.\n\n\"We have a duty to inform anyone considered at high risk as a result of data\nbreaches. Due to the amount of data published, we will be prioritizing people\nwho may come under this category.\n\n\"We realize this data breach will cause concern, and apologize for any\ndistress caused. We continue to work with Leicestershire Police and the\nNational Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) as part of this investigation.\"\n\nThe NCSC's official stance is to not pay ransoms, and for the council to\nresist even knowing the scale of data theft showed its commitment to avoid\nfunding the cybercrime ecosystem further.\n\nCISA, the NCSC's counterpart over in the US, also strongly advises against\npaying ransoms, but in both nations the rules aren't always followed.\n\nThe attack on Colonial Pipeline, for example, caused such disruption to the\nEast Coast that a ransom payment became necessary. More recently, Caesars\nEntertainment (allegedly) and UnitedHealth both paid ransoms following their\nrespective ransomware incidents, and the latter's CEO will testify before the\nHouse's Energy and Commerce Subcommittee next month to explain how the attack\nunfolded. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Ransomware\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Ransomware\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * NCSC\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Wannacry\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n16 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Ransomware\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Ransomware\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * NCSC\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Wannacry\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Mandiant: Orgs are detecting cybercriminals faster than ever\n\nThe 'big victory for the good guys' shouldn't be celebrated too much, though\n\nSecurity1 hr | 1\n\n#### Change Healthcare faces second ransomware dilemma weeks after ALPHV\nattack\n\nTheories abound over who's truly responsible\n\nSecurity15 days | 23\n\n#### Ransomware feared as IT 'issues' force Octapharma Plasma to close 150+\ncenters\n\nUpdated Source blames BlackSuit infection \u2013 as separately ISP Frontier\nconfirms cyberattack\n\nCyber-crime5 days | 9\n\n#### Getting on board with AI\n\nHow partnerships can provide the key to getting up and running with AI faster\nthan the competition\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Change Healthcare\u2019s ransomware attack costs edge toward $1B so far\n\nFirst glimpse at attack financials reveals huge pain\n\nCyber-crime7 days | 11\n\n#### 185K people's sensitive data in the pits after ransomware raid on Cherry\nHealth\n\nExtent of information seized will be a concern for those affected\n\nCyber-crime5 days | 6\n\n#### Ransomware gang did steal residents' confidential data, UK city council\nadmits\n\nINC Ransom emerges as a growing threat as some ex-LockBit/ALPHV affiliates get\nnew gigs\n\nCyber-crime19 days | 17\n\n#### UK businesses shockingly unaware of how to handle security threats\n\nMany decide to make no changes after detecting a breach\n\nCyber-crime14 days | 23\n\n#### Prolific phishing-made-easy emporium LabHost knocked offline in cyber-cop\nop\n\nFeature Police emit Spotify Wrapped-style videos to let crims know they're\nbeing hunted\n\nSecurity5 days | 13\n\n#### Cybercriminals threaten to leak all 5 million records from stolen\ndatabase of high-risk individuals\n\nIt\u2019s the second time the World-Check list has fallen into the wrong hands\n\nCyber-crime4 days | 21\n\n#### MGM says FTC can't possibly probe its ransomware downfall \u2013 watchdog\nchief Lina Khan was a guest at the time\n\nWhat a twist!\n\nCyber-crime7 days | 19\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity7 days | 29\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
