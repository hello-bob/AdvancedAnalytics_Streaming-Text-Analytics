All feedback is valuable, and we are working rapidly\nand with focus to improve the experience in a few key areas. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re\nshipping next:\n\nPriority areas \u2014 Our priorities are (1) improving battery life and thermal\nmanagement, (2) reducing response latency, and (3) fine tuning accuracy for a\nsmoother experience.\n\nOur first updates \u2014 Ai Pin and CosmOS are designed to improve and become more\nversatile over time with server side changes and over-the-air (OTA) software\nupdates. This week, we\u2019re rolling out Ai Mic accuracy improvements across user\nsupport, weather, notes, music, and Vision (Beta). These updates are in the\ncloud and are available to all Ai Pins immediately.\n\nOur first OTA update for Ai Pin adds video stabilization and improvements to\nthe contacts experience, and will begin rolling out to devices in the coming\nweeks. You'll need to make sure your Ai Pin is connected to Wi-Fi, has been\nunlocked, and left on your Charge Pad overnight in order to update.\n\nYou can view our change log for the latest updates and more information. And\nas always, you can join our Discord community here.\n\nStaying true to our mission \u2014 Our entire team is listening closely to your\nfeedback and is committed to building a future where AI-powered devices and\nexperiences integrate seamlessly into all of our lives. Now more than ever, we\nare determined to drive toward this future, and continue to evolve the\nplatform and customer experience - shipping quickly and transparently.\n\nPlease continue to share your thoughts and feedback! This is just the first\npage of the first chapter of an all-new product category and OS platform. We\nare energized to build and incorporate what we\u2019ve learned from your\nexperiences using Ai Pin. We\u2019ll frequently ship improvements, fixes, and some\nsurprises we think you\u2019ll enjoy.
