The option -R 0:localhost:8000 in\nthe command only implies that connections to the public URL given by pinggy\nare forwarded to your localhost:8000.\n\nNo other port than the one specified by you can be accessed by Pinggy or by\nanyone through the public URLs provided by Pinggy.\n\nYou can read more about the -R option of openssh client here. If you are using\na different ssh client, then refer to its documentation.\n\nIf the ssh command prompts you for a password you can just press enter (a\nblank password). Or you can type in something random and press enter.\n\nFor long running tunnels with auto-reconnect, generate an ssh key. In your\nterminal / command prompt run: ssh-keygen Press Enter key (Return key) till\nthe command finishes. After this the ssh command will no longer ask for a\npassword.\n\na.pinggy.io is routed to the Pinggy server nearest to your location. Currently\nwe have our servers in USA, Sweden, and Singapore.\n\nPinggy's free plan has a tunnel timeout of 60 minutes. If the tunnel is closed\nby you or reaches the time limit, starting a new tunnel will generate a new\nURL.\n\nTo obtain a permanent or persistent URL, or to use your own domain, you must\nsubscribe to Pinggy Pro.\n\nYes. Current versions of Windows, Mac, as well as almost all Linux\ndistributions come with openssh client pre-installed. Therefore Pinggy will\njust work out of the box.\n\nTo learn more about using Pinggy on Android read our blog post.\n\nYou can use TCP and TLS tunnels for free with Pinggy. Click on \"Advanced\nSettings\" on the top of the homepage, and select TCP.\n\nRead our guide on long running tunnels here.\n\nThe most common reason for this is that an existing tunnel with the same token\nis active.\n\nTerminate your existing tunnel with the same token. You can do so from the\nActive Tunnels option in the dashboard.\n\nYou can also use the Force option in the dashbaord.\n\nPinggy does read tunnel traffic for providing the Web Debugger feature.\n\nUse TLS tunnels for Zero trust mode, where Pinggy cannot read your data. In\nthis case your traffic is end-to-end encrypted.\n\nContact Us \u2022 Terms of Service \u2022 Privacy Policy \u2022 About Us\n\nCopyright\u00a9 Pinggy 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
