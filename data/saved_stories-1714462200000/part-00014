As of March, about 86% of working-age men were employed,\nand this cohort's employment rate has lagged behind many developed countries\nin recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nfound.\n\nAs such, many men are struggling to support themselves financially. And\nmental-health experts say the longer people are out of the workforce, the\nhigher the chances they'll experience mental-health challenges.\n\nHere are a few factors that could explain what's happening.\n\n## It could be about recessions\n\nSince the 1950s, whenever the US economy fell into a recession, men's\nemployment rate tended to suffer a longer-lasting blow.\n\nWhen the economy entered a recession in 1953, the share of prime-age men with\njobs dropped from 96% to 92.8% and never fully recovered to the prerecession\nlevel, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis pattern repeated in many of the recessions that followed. During the\nGreat Recession of 2008, the prime-age male employment rate fell from 88% to\n80.6% \u2014 and hasn't reached above 86.7% since. The pandemic recession may prove\nto be an exception: After falling to as low as 78% in 2020, men's employment\nrate has nearly recovered to its pre-pandemic level.\n\n\"In recent decades, declines in labor-force participation have tended to\naccompany recessions,\" Abigail Wozniak, an economist at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Minneapolis, told Business Insider. \"Participation dips and then does\nnot fully recover.\"\n\nWhy have recessions had such a lasting effect on working men? Even when the\neconomy recovers, some of the jobs that were lost never return \u2014 or pay as\nwell as they used to. Given that men have historically dominated the\nworkforce, they've borne the brunt of these job losses.\n\nWhy have recessions appeared to have such a lasting impact on working men?\nEven when the economy recovers, some occupations don't reach prior employment\nlevels \u2014 or pay as well as they used to. Given that men have historically\ndominated the workforce, they've borne the brunt of these impacts.\n\n\"If the opportunities available after a downturn pay less than the old\nopportunities, workers may decide not to work as much despite their lower\nincome,\" Wozniak said.\n\nAnd the longer someone is out of the workforce, the more disconnected from the\nworkforce they can become, research has found.\n\nThe strong employment-recovery rate after the pandemic recession could be due\nto the unique nature of this downturn \u2014 which tanked an otherwise healthy\neconomy. Some economists believe that increased federal COVID-19 spending\nallowed the economy to bounce back better this go-round.\n\nThe male unemployment rate is low when compared to past decades. But this\nmeasure doesn't account for men who have, for a multitude of reasons, stopped\nlooking for work altogether. It's these men who are responsible for America's\nmale employment decline.\n\nIn 1950, about 97% of prime-working-age men had a job or were actively looking\nfor work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of January, that\nfigure had fallen to roughly 89%.\n\n## Many men with disabilities aren't working\n\nIn 1960, roughly 455,000 workers collected Social Security disability\nbenefits. In 2022, more than 7.6 million people, including about 1.3 million\nmen between the ages of 25 and 54, collected disability benefits.\n\nSome of this can be attributed to a growing and aging population and the\nexpansion of these benefits over time. However, a challenging job market has\nalso played a role.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"What drives people to apply for disability is, in many cases, the repeated\nloss of work and inability to find new employment,\" David Autor, an economist\nwith the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told The Washington Post in\n2017. \"Many people who are applying would say, 'Look, I would like to work,\nbut no one would employ me.'\"\n\nIn 2023, about 44% of total men and women with a disability between the ages\nof 25 and 54 had a job, compared to roughly 83% of those without a disability,\naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which determines whether someone\nhas a disability through a series of questions.\n\nIn a 2022 analysis of Census data by the San Francisco Fed, nearly 40% of\nprime-working-age men cited disability or illness as the reason they weren't\nworking.\n\nIn more recent decades, addiction rates tied to the opioid epidemic have also\nsidelined some men from the workforce.\n\nIn recent years, the rise of remote work and historically high job openings\nhave helped more people with disabilities find employment. In 2023, nearly 23%\nof Americans with a disability were employed \u2014 the largest share on record\nsince data collection began in 2008, according to the BLS.\n\n## Other theories: Education, incarceration, and stay-at-home dads\n\nThere are other potential explanations for the decline of men in the\nworkforce, including the rising share of men attending graduate school and\nmore men working as stay-at-home dads or caring for elderly parents.\n\nChanging demand for jobs, driven in part by globalization and automation, has\nalso hurt the job prospects of many men, particularly those employed in the\nmanufacturing industry. More employers began seeking out candidates with\nhigher levels of education, which made it difficult for some men in the job\nmarket.\n\nWhat's more, men now account for less than half of college enrollees. Among\nAmericans 25 and older, the unemployment rate of people with only a high\nschool diploma is 3.9%, compared to 2.2% for those whose highest educational\nattainment is a bachelor's degree, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn recent years, some companies have become more open to hiring candidates who\ndon't have a college degree. There's also been job growth in industries that\nhistorically haven't required degrees, like manufacturing and food services.\nBut finding a job without a degree \u2014 and one that pays well \u2014 can still be a\nchallenge.\n\nIn 2016, the Harvard economist Jason Furman, then the chair of President\nBarack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, attributed the decline of prime-\nage working men largely to the \"reduction in the demand for unskilled labor\"\ndriven by technological change, adding that men without jobs tended not to\nhave a college education.\n\nAdditionally, he said most of these men weren't spending more time on\nchildcare than the average man and weren't relying on working women to pay the\nbills \u2014 suggesting they weren't stay-at-home dads, for instance.\n\nElise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told Business\nInsider that a stagnant minimum wage and falling unionization rates have\ncontributed to lower pay for some workers. The lower the pay, the less\nmotivated some people might be to take a job.\n\nSome more under-the-radar factors could also be playing a role.\n\nRising incarceration rates in recent decades could be making it difficult for\nsome men to find work once they return to society, Gould said. Incarcerated\nmen aren't counted in government labor-force statistics, but when they are\nreleased, their struggles to find work could depress the average male\nemployment rate.\n\nIn the past, many men opted for careers in the military, but there are fewer\nof these jobs than there used to be. In 1970, there were over 3 million full-\ntime federal government military employees \u2014 as of 2022, there were less than\n1.5 million.\n\n\"Post-World War II, we've seen pretty big declines since the late 60s and\nthroughout the 1990s in terms of federal employment in the military,\" Gould\nsaid.\n\nWhile the military is actively seeking recruits, it appears to be a less\nattractive path nowadays for many men \u2014 the Army, Navy, and Air Force have\nstruggled to meet recruitment goals.\n\nResearch by the Federal Reserve economist John M. Coglianese published in 2018\nfound that a rise of \"in-and-outs\" \u2014 men who temporarily leave the labor force\nbut ultimately return, was responsible for a large chunk of men's declining\nworking rates.\n\nAnd of course, some lucky prime-age men aren't working because they've had a\nlot of financial success and already retired.\n\nWith so many factors at play, it's difficult to tease out which issues may\naffect the number of men in the workforce the most \u2014 and what kind of policy\ndecisions could reverse the trend.\n\n\"I think that ideally, we would have jobs for everybody who wants one,\" Gould\nsaid.\n\nAre you a man between the ages of 25 and 54 who's not in the workforce?
