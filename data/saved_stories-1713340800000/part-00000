Why It\u2019s Better to Blitz\n\n## Bimodal Blitz\n\nFor those new to this blog, I'm learning the Polish language with an\nexperimental method called the Bimodal Blitz. It requires reading an entire\nbook in your target language in a day, or even a sitting, while listening to\nthe audiobook at the same time. Since March 13, I've \"blitzed\" 54 Polish books\nin 54 consecutive days. My goal is to blitz 100 in 100 days.\n\nDuring these almost two months, my Blitzathon has gained some attention, and\nalong with that, questions and misunderstandings have arisen. I'd like to\nquickly clear things up before I start blitzing my next Polish book.\n\nReading a text in your target language while listening to the audiobook\nversion certainly isn't new. What makes Bimodal Blitz different is the\nmethod's combination of speed, contextual inference, personalization,\nscalability, and the levers of flow.\n\nLet me briefly explain each of the five building blocks of Bimodal Blitz:\n\nSPEED\n\nBimodal Blitz emphasizes reading a book in a single day or even a sitting,\nwhile simultaneously listening to the audiobook performed by a professional\nnative-speaker of your target language. It's an intense, focused approach to\nmaximize exposure to the target language in the shortest time possible.\n\nCONTEXTUAL INFERENCE\n\nInstead of meticulously translating every unfamiliar word, Bimodal Blitz\nencourages learners to infer meanings based on context, voice inflections from\nthe audio, punctuation, and other cues. This maintains the flow of reading and\nlistening while developing crucial inferential skills. It also means leaving\nsome untranslated text for your subconscious mind to chew on later.\n\nOf course, translation is allowed, as much as one wants, as long as they get\nthe book finished that day.\n\nPERSONALIZATION\n\nBimodal Blitz allows learners to choose books that interest and entertain\nthem, regardless of their current reading level. Not only would it be nearly\nimpossible for an absolute beginner to find entertaining content with 98\npercent comprehensible input, but how is one to quickly expand their knowledge\nof their target language without being exposed to lots of new vocabulary?\n\nSCALABILITY\n\nIn the parlance of the Bimodal Blitz language learning method, to \"blitz\" a\nbook is to read a book in a single day or even a sitting, while simultaneously\nlistening to the audiobook. A \"Bimodal Blitzathon\" is where learners aim to\ncomplete 30 or more books. This scalability can lead to rapid progress in\nreading and listening comprehension and a greater understanding of the culture\nof your target language.\n\nLEVERS OF FLOW\n\nBy gradually increasing the audiobook speed and modifying other conditions\nI've tested (I'll reveal them soon), Bimodal Blitz challenges learners and\ninduces a flow state. This heightened focus and concentration can lead to more\nefficient language absorption and improved processing speed.\n\nIn summary, after blitzing 54 books in 54 days, I believe the Bimodal Blitz\nmethod can lead to faster progress and a deeper understanding of the target\nlanguage and its culture.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other questions popping up on various discussion forums I\nwish I had time to address now. I'll have to leave that for a future Q+A.\n\nJoin me on Goodreads (where it started) and on my Twitter/x feed. And for\nthose intrigued by the Bimodal Blitz method, I again encourage you to dive\ninto a book in your target language and experience the immersive world of\nbimodal reading and listening.\n\nP.S. A book on how to Bimodal Blitz will eventually be released explaining the\nmethod in detail. Subscribe to this blog for updates.\n\nYou just read issue #2 of Bimodal Blitz.
