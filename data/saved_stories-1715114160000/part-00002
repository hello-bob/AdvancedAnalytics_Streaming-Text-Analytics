The new\nOLED iPad Pro models will include the upgraded chip, which is focused on\nimproving performance for AI-related tasks in iPadOS.\n\nDuring an event on Tuesday, Apple focused heavily on the M4\u2019s AI capabilities.\nA new neural engine makes it \u201can outrageously powerful chip for AI,\u201d the\ncompany says, capable of 38 trillion operators per second (TOPS). It\u2019s\nsupposedly 60 times faster than the NPU of Apple\u2019s A11 chip, from 2017, but\nthat number still falls short of the Snapdragon X Elite\u2019s 45 TOPS. However,\nApple still claims the M4 can deliver the same performance as the latest PC\nchips with only a quarter of the power.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nThe M4 uses second-gen 3nm technology, and its 10-core CPU is configured with\nfour performance cores and six efficiency cores, making it 50 percent more\npowerful than the M2 inside the prior iPad Pro, according to Apple. The M4\u2019s\n10-core GPU also supports dynamic caching, mesh shading, and ray tracing, plus\na new display engine with four times the rendering speed compared to the M2.\n\nWhat Apple didn\u2019t mention is the M4\u2019s NPU core count. Apple\u2019s M-series chips\n(excluding the M1 and M2 Ultra) have had the same 16-core NPU count since the\nM1 debuted, but the NPU TOPS has increased incrementally every generation \u2014\nmeaning the NPU has gotten better at performing calculations quickly.\n\nThe increase from the M1 to the M2 was twice as large as the increase from the\nM2 to the M3, so it\u2019s interesting to see Apple take a much larger leap from\nthe M3\u2019s 18 TOPS to the new M4\u2019s 38 TOPS. However, the actual number of TOPS,\nas we\u2019ve pointed out before when Qualcomm announced the specs for its\nSnapdragon X Series, is arbitrary. It doesn\u2019t take the type of AI workloads\ninto account.\n\nApple\u2019s M4 announcement comes less than two weeks before Microsoft is holding\na special Windows and Surface AI event in Seattle on May 20th, where it\u2019s\nexpected to launch new Arm-powered hardware. Microsoft is confident Windows on\nArm could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air M3 laptops both in CPU performance\nand AI-accelerated tasks.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s confidence is largely thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s upcoming Snapdragon X\nElite processors, with Qualcomm promising up to 45 TOPS of NPU performance.\nApple says its new M4 chip will deliver 38 TOPS of NPU performance, so it will\nbe interesting to see how Apple\u2019s new chip compares to the Arm-powered Windows\nlaptops that are arriving this summer.\n\n### Related:\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week\n\n  2. ## These are the upcoming Sonos Ace wireless headphones\n\n  3. ## Apple\u2019s \u2018Let Loose\u2019 event live blog: iPads all the way down\n\n  4. ## Apple announces new iPad Pros with OLED displays and thinnest design ever\n\n  5. ## Republicans are pulling out all the stops to reverse EV adoption\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream Apple iPad event: all the news from Apple\u2019s \u2018Let\nLoose\u2019 reveal\n\n  * ### Apple quietly kills the old-school iPad and its headphone jack\n\nMay 7, 2024, 3:57 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Apple launches Final Cut Camera app to support multicam productions\n\nMay 7, 2024, 3:02 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Apple puts more \u2018Pro\u2019 in Final Cut and Logic Pro for the iPad\n\nMay 7, 2024, 3:01 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Hands-on with the new iPad Pro: yeah, it\u2019s really thin\n\nMay 7, 2024, 3:01 PM UTC\n\nSee all 15 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
