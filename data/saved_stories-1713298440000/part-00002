Scientists from the University of Bern in\nSwitzerland and the University of Arizona used numerical simulations to\ninvestigate the origins of Sputnik Planitia, the western teardrop-shaped part\nof Pluto's heart surface feature.\n\nAccording to their research, Pluto's early history was marked by a cataclysmic\nevent that formed Sputnik Planitia: a collision with a planetary body a little\nover 400 miles in diameter, roughly the size of Arizona from north to south.\nThe team\u2019s findings, published in Nature Astronomy, also suggest that the\ninner structure of Pluto is different from what was previously assumed,\nindicating that there is no subsurface ocean.\n\n\"The formation of Sputnik Planitia provides a critical window into the\nearliest periods of Pluto's history,\" said Adeene Denton, a planetary\nscientist at the UArizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory who co-authored the\npaper. \"By expanding our investigation to include more unusual formation\nscenarios, we've learned some totally new possibilities for Pluto's evolution,\nwhich could apply to other Kuiper Belt objects as well.\"\n\nA divided heart\n\nThe heart, also known as the Tombaugh Regio, captured the public's attention\nimmediately upon its discovery. But it also immediately caught the interest of\nscientists because it is covered in a high-albedo material that reflects more\nlight than its surroundings, creating its whiter color. However, the heart is\nnot composed of a single element. Sputnik Planitia covers an area of\napproximately 750 by 1,250 miles, equivalent to a quarter of Europe or the\nUnited States. What is striking, however, is that this region is roughly 2.5\nmiles lower in elevation than most of Pluto's surface.\n\nImage\n\nPluto's bright \"heart\" features prominently in this image taken by NASA's New\nHorizons space probe on July 14, 2015.\n\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research\nInstitute\n\n\"While the vast majority of Pluto's surface consists of methane ice and its\nderivatives covering a water-ice crust, the Planitia is predominantly filled\nwith nitrogen ice, which most likely accumulated quickly after the impact due\nto the lower altitude,\" said the lead author of the study, Harry Ballantyne, a\nresearch associate at Bern. The eastern part of the heart is also covered by a\nsimilar but much thinner layer of nitrogen ice, the origin of which is still\nunclear to scientists, but is probably related to Sputnik Planitia.\n\nAn oblique impact\n\nThe elongated shape of Sputnik Planitia and its location at the equator\nstrongly suggest that the impact was not a direct head-on collision but rather\nan oblique one, according to Martin Jutzi of the University of Bern, who\ninitiated the study. Like several others around the world, the team used\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation software to digitally re-create\nsuch impacts, varying both the composition of Pluto and its impactor, as well\nas the velocity and angle of the impactor. These simulations confirmed the\nscientists' suspicions about the oblique angle of impact and determined the\ncomposition of the impactor.\n\n\"Pluto's core is so cold that the rocks remained very hard and did not melt\ndespite the heat of the impact, and thanks to the angle of impact and the low\nvelocity, the core of the impactor did not sink into Pluto's core, but\nremained intact as a splat on it,\" Ballantyne said. This core strength and\nrelatively low velocity were key to the success of these simulations: Lower\nstrength would result in a very symmetrical leftover surface feature that does\nnot look like the teardrop shape observed by NASA's New Horizons probe during\nits fly-by of Pluto in 2015.\n\n\"We are used to thinking of planetary collisions as incredibly intense events\nwhere you can ignore the details except for things like energy, momentum and\ndensity,\" said Lunar and Planetary Laboratory professor and study co-author\nErik Asphaug, whose team has collaborated with its Swiss colleagues since\n2011, exploring the idea of planetary \"splats\" to explain, for instance,\nfeatures on the far side of Earth's moon. \"In the distant solar system,\nvelocities are so much slower than closer to the sun, and solid ice is strong,\nso you have to be much more precise in your calculations. That's where the fun\nstarts.\"\n\nNo subsurface ocean on Pluto\n\nThe current study sheds new light on Pluto's internal structure as well. In\nfact, a giant impact like the one simulated is much more likely to have\noccurred very early in Pluto's history than during more recent times. However,\nthis poses a problem: A giant depression like Sputnik Planitia is expected to\nslowly drift toward the pole of the dwarf planet over time due to the laws of\nphysics, since it is less massive than its surroundings. Yet it has remained\nnear the equator. The previous theorized explanation invoked a subsurface\nliquid water ocean, similar to several other planetary bodies in the outer\nsolar system. According to this hypothesis, Pluto's icy crust would be thinner\nin the Sputnik Planitia region, causing the ocean to bulge upward, and since\nliquid water is denser than ice, causing a mass surplus that induces migration\ntoward the equator.\n\nThe new study offers an alternative perspective, according to the authors,\npointing to simulations in which all of Pluto's primordial mantle is excavated\nby the impact, and as the impactor's core material splats onto Pluto's core,\nit creates a local mass excess that can explain the migration toward the\nequator without a subsurface ocean, or at most a very thin one.\n\nDenton, who already has embarked on a research project to estimate the speed\nof this migration, said this novel and creative origin hypothesis for Pluto's\nheart-shaped feature may lead to a better understanding of the dwarf planet's\norigin.\n\n### Topics\n\nScience & Technology\n\nSpace\n\n### Tags\n\nExperts\n\nExploration\n\nResearch\n\n### Resources for the Media\n\nVisit the Newsroom\n\nMedia Contact(s)\n\nDaniel Stolte\n\nScience Writer, University Communications\n\nstolte@arizona.edu\n\n520-626-4402\n\nResearch Contact(s)\n\nErik Asphaug\n\nLunar and Planetary Laboratory\n\nasphaug@arizona.edu\n\nAdeene Denton\n\nLunar and Planetary Laboratory\n\nadeened@arizona.edu\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n# How the moon turned itself inside out\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\n# Astronomers capture magnetic fields twirling around black hole\n\nJan. 24, 2024\n\n# Soaking up Sundance: UArizona film and television students take trip to\nstoried film festival\n\nMonday\n\n# How Pluto got its 'heart'\n\n#### UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA IN THE NEWS\n\nThe Conversation\n\nToday\n\nMore climate-warming methane leaks into the atmosphere than ever gets reported\n\u2013 here\u2019s how satellites can find the leaks and avoid wasting a valuable\nresource\n\nNewsweek\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nLake Mead's wate level is falling\n\nNPR\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nFlorida blocks heat protections for workers right before summer\n\nUSA Today\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nFact check: Conspiracy theory that moon didn't cause eclipse ignores basic\nscience\n\nForbes\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nWhite noise vs. brown noise \u2013 which can help me get better rest?\n\nCONTACT US SUBSCRIBE\n\nWe respectfully acknowledge the University of Arizona is on the land and\nterritories of Indigenous peoples.
