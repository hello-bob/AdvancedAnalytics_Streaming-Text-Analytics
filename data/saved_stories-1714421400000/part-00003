All rights reserved.\n\n### Sibylline.dev Crafting AI for the human journey\n\n# Introducing Jung, your AI powered personality analyst!\n\n29 Apr 2024\n\nHello. I\u2019m happy to announce the beta launch of my personality profiling and\nanalysis tool, Jung! Jung can take unstructured text and a contextual\ndirective and help you peer into the depths of someone\u2019s psyche, extracting\npersonality traits, subtext and hidden motivators. If you\u2019d like to know the\ndetails of the Jung API, head over to the API page. For now, I\u2019d like to focus\non some fun demonstrations to give you a sense of Jung\u2019s abilities.\n\nGiven that those of us in the United States are in an election year and\npolitics are delicious clickbait (sorry, not sorry), I thought I\u2019d start with\na comparison of the two men vying for the job of our fearless leader. That\u2019s\nright, we\u2019re going to dive into the minds of Donald Trump and Joe Biden to try\nand see how Jung could help a prospective voter who was undecided (do they\nstill exist?) pick the best candidate.\n\nTo perform this analysis, I started by collecting and bundling together text\nfrom multiple recent interviews to fill up my available context, so Jung would\nhave plenty to work with. If you\u2019d like to replicate this analysis you can go\nto the presidential project and select the three most recent interviews for\neach president.\n\nIn addition to taking text to analyze, Jung takes a subcommand that helps\nguide its analysis. Here is the subcommand used for these analyses:\n\n    \n    \n    These are transcripts of interviews with a presidential candate. Your subcommand is to contain your analysis to the person being interviewed and focus your analysis on being maximally informative to a potential voter who was undecided and wanted to get a deep understanding of what kind of person the interviewee is. Try to avoid being biased by preexisting knowledge of the subject and focus on the provided text.\n\nI want to preface this analysis by noting that I\u2019ve made many attempts to\ncontrol for ideological, social, racial and other biases in Jung. Jung\nconsiders issues from diverse perspectives (including both conservative and\nliberal) and you can see from the subcommand that it has been instructed to\navoid being biased by prior knowledge. To put in it plain English - I did my\nbest to give Donny a fair analysis without compromising the objectivity of the\nanalytical process.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s dive into the output of Jung. I\u2019ve placed\nBiden and Trump side by side for easy comparison:\n\nJung Analysis Results\n\n# Jung Analysis Results\n\n## Key Points\n\n### Joe Biden\n\n  * Expressed optimism about winning the 2020 election and doing well in 2022 midterms, attributing it to changes in polling and media landscape\n  * Believes democracy itself is at stake in the 2024 election, with Trump posing an existential threat if reelected. \"I really think, Bush -- I think what's at stake is -- is literally our democracy, not a joke.\"\n  * Touts economic progress for all Americans, especially African Americans, under his administration. Points to record low Black unemployment, increased Black wealth and businesses, expanded healthcare, reduced child poverty.\n  * Emphasizes the importance of every vote, especially from marginalized communities. \"Their vote is not as -- just as important. In a sense, it's more important.\"\n  * Highlights his civil rights background and efforts to make his administration diverse and representative. \"I promised if I got elected, I'd have an administration that looked like America.\"\n  * Says he's running for reelection primarily to prevent Trump from winning and undoing his accomplishments. \"Donald Trump. I know I can beat him, and I know he must be beaten.\"\n  * Warns Trump would cut Social Security, Medicare, and reverse drug pricing reforms that help seniors and disadvantaged groups. Frames it as an issue of tax fairness.\n\n## Notes\n\nPresident Biden comes across as deeply concerned about the state of American\ndemocracy and the potential consequences of a second Trump term. He portrays\nthe 2024 election in stark, existential terms as a choice between continued\nprogress, especially for marginalized groups, and a backslide into \"chaos,\ndivision, violence, MAGA extremism.\" Biden seems to draw moral conviction from\nhis civil rights background and belief in the untapped potential of African\nAmericans and other minorities who haven't been given an equal shot. He takes\nevident pride in the diversity of his administration and appointments. There's\na paternalistic streak in how he talks about delivering economic gains to\ndisadvantaged communities, but it appears to come from a place of genuine\nconcern. He emphasizes dignity, respect and expanding access to opportunity.\nHis decision to run again appears driven more by determination to stop Trump\nthan ambition for himself. He projects confidence that he's the Democrat best\npositioned to win, with little tolerance for other perspectives. Overall,\nBiden comes across as an old-school liberal motivated by a mix of do-gooder\ninstincts, Democratic partisanship, and alarm over the anti-democratic drift\nof the opposition. Amid political upheaval, he's betting voters will choose\nsteady progress over a \"radical\" rupture.\n\n## Traits\n\n### Openness\n\nMean: 0.1600, Std: 0.0490\n\n### Conscientiousness\n\nMean: 0.7800, Std: 0.0400\n\n### Extraversion\n\nMean: 0.5600, Std: 0.0490\n\n### Agreeableness\n\nMean: 0.6800, Std: 0.0600\n\n### Neuroticism\n\nMean: -0.4500, Std: 0.0500\n\n### Autonomy\n\nMean: 0.0700, Std: 0.0640\n\n### Altruism\n\nMean: 0.8600, Std: 0.0490| Jung Analysis Results\n\n# Jung Analysis Results\n\n## Key Points\n\n### Donald Trump\n\n  * Expressed skepticism about the COVID vaccine, saying \"If she doesn't want to take it, you know, it's a freedom thing\"\n  * Claimed credit for Operation Warp Speed and developing COVID vaccines in record time, saying it saved millions of lives worldwide\n  * Said the survival aspect of his presidency, dealing with investigations and impeachment, was tougher than actually running the country\n  * Criticized the withdrawal from Afghanistan as the \"worst in the history of our country\" and a tremendous embarrassment\n  * Claimed he threatened the Taliban leader that he would bomb their villages if they did anything to Americans in Afghanistan\n  * Blamed the Afghan military's quick collapse on the US \"bribing them to fight\" with high pay\n  * Insisted the border wall would have stopped migrant caravans and completing it was part of his withdrawal agreement\n  * Touted his strong relationship with China's Xi Jinping despite imposing tariffs, claiming China no longer respects the US under Biden\n  * Blamed high gas prices and inflation on Biden policies reversing his achievements in energy independence\n  * Alleged political persecution of Republicans and double standards in not investigating Hunter Biden's foreign business deals\n  * Criticized COVID restrictions on Americans while allowing illegal immigrants in without mandates\n  * Teased a 2024 presidential run, saying \"I think you'll be happy\" but campaign finance laws prevent him from announcing\n\n## Notes\n\nTrump's comments reveal a man still intensely focused on touting his record\nand criticizing his successor. He seems to view events primarily through the\nlens of how they reflect on him personally. There are strong themes of pride\nand ego - taking credit for COVID vaccines, Middle East deals, the wall, and\nenergy independence while pinning all negative developments on Biden reversing\nhis policies. He portrays himself as a strong leader who commanded respect\nfrom foreign leaders and the Taliban. At the same time, he expresses deep\nresentment over the investigations he faced, calling his \"survival\" against a\nsupposed witch hunt his biggest challenge as president. He alleges an unfair\ndouble standard in Republicans facing persecution while Hunter Biden's\ndealings go uninvestigated. On COVID, his views seem conflicted, wavering\nbetween touting the vaccines as a great achievement and supporting skeptics'\n\"freedom\" to refuse them. He criticizes restrictions on Americans while\nfaulting Biden for not imposing them on illegal immigrants. Throughout, he\nfocuses on projecting strength, respect and success while attacking opponents\nas weak, corrupt and incompetent. The teased 2024 run hints at his continued\nhunger for vindication. But the remarks often feel more self-serving and petty\nthan forward-looking or unifying.\n\n## Traits\n\n### Openness\n\nMean: -0.0800, Std: 0.2272\n\n### Conscientiousness\n\nMean: -0.1000, Std: 0.1732\n\n### Extraversion\n\nMean: 0.8600, Std: 0.1281\n\n### Agreeableness\n\nMean: -0.7900, Std: 0.1578\n\n### Neuroticism\n\nMean: 0.5200, Std: 0.1470\n\n### Autonomy\n\nMean: 0.8300, Std: 0.1487\n\n### Altruism\n\nMean: -0.5200, Std: 0.1833  \n---|---  \n  \nNot too shabby! Jung clocks both Biden and Trump well, which isn\u2019t that useful\nin this case since I think everyone knows what each of the candidates are\nabout, but it could be very useful in other circumstances such as hiring,\nmedical support systems, criminal justice and so forth where a decision maker\nmight lack sufficient time to make a nuanced decision considering all the\nevidence. With Jung\u2019s help, you can quickly gain psychological insights from\nlarge volumes of conversational text.\n\nNote that the traits listed here are the Big 5, with the addition of autonomy\nand altruism which are not adequately captured by the Big 5. Here are the\ndefinitions for reference:\n\n  * Autonomy: the individual\u2019s independence, self-determination, and willingness to make decisions based on personal judgment. Autonomous individuals are skeptical of authority and do not care about external expectations.\n  * Altruism: the individual\u2019s concern for the well-being of others, willingness to help, and tendency to prioritize the needs of others over their own. Altruistic individuals are generous, compassionate and selflessness in their actions and decisions.\n\nYou might also notice the red line on the charts doesn\u2019t exactly line up with\nthe listed mean. This is because the mean and standard deviation are from a\ngaussian approximation, the true underlying distribution is beta, and the\ncharts are using the mode, which is more meaningful for beta distrbutions with\nskew than the average. The guassian mean and deviation are provided because\nthey\u2019re easier to conceptualize but the beta distributions are correct.\nWorking with beta distributions also has the nice property that if you have\nJung analyze someone more than once, you can combine the results in a\nprincipled way just by summing the alpha and beta parameters for each trait.\n\nThose of you with a background in psychometrics might be used to seeing traits\non a 1-10 or 1-100 scale, and wonder why the traits are expressed in the [-1,\n1] range. This is because centering the neutral value at 0 reduces scale bias\ncaused by human (and, by extension, LLM) evaluation resulting from the skewed\ndistributions of graded schoolwork and product reviews.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, stay tuned because I plan to run a whole series of\ninteresting comparisons in the near future.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
