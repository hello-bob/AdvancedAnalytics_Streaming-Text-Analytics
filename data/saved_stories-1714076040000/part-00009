And it's likely to stay there, as the state will require that all\npassenger vehicles be electric by 2035. Obviously, that will require a grid\nthat's able to send a lot more electrons down its wiring and a likely shift in\nthe time of day that demand peaks.\n\nIs the grid ready? And if not, how much will it cost to get it there? Two\nresearchers at the University of California, Davis\u2014Yanning Li and Alan\nJenn\u2014have determined that nearly two-thirds of its feeder lines don't have the\ncapacity that will likely be needed for car charging. Updating to handle the\nrising demand might set its utilities back as much as 40 percent of the\nexisting grid's capital cost.\n\n## The lithium state\n\nLi and Jenn aren't the first to look at how well existing grids can handle\ngrowing electric vehicle sales; other research has found various ways that\ndifferent grids fall short. However, they have access to uniquely detailed\ndata relevant to California's ability to distribute electricity (they do not\nconcern themselves with generation). They have information on every\nsubstation, feeder line, and transformer that delivers electrons to customers\nof the state's three largest utilities, which collectively cover nearly 90\npercent of the state's population. In total, they know the capacity that can\nbe delivered through over 1,600 substations and 5,000 feeders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia has clear goals for its electric vehicles, and those are matched\nwith usage based on the California statewide travel demand model, which\naccounts for both trips and the purpose of those trips. These are used to\ndetermine how much charging will need to be done, as well as where that\ncharging will take place (home or a charging station). Details on that\ncharging comes from the utilities, charging station providers, and data logs.\n\nThey also project which households will purchase EVs based on socioeconomic\nfactors, scaled so that adoption matches the state's goals.\n\nCombined, all of this means that Li and Jenn can estimate where charging is\ntaking place and how much electricity will be needed per charge. They can then\ncompare that need to what the existing grid has the capacity to deliver.\n\nIt falls short, and things get worse very quickly. By 2025, only about 7\npercent of the feeders will experience periods of overload. By 2030, that\nfigure will grow to 27 percent, and by 2035\u2014only about a decade away\u2014about\nhalf of the feeders will be overloaded. Problems grow a bit more slowly after\nthat, with two-thirds of the feeders overloaded by 2045, a decade after all\ncars sold in California will be EVs. At that point, total electrical demand\nwill be close to twice the existing capacity.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n348\n\nJohn Timmer John is Ars Technica's science editor.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
