I work in an open office and my co-workers are so loud\n\nPublished Thu, Apr 18 20241:50 PM EDT\n\nErin McGoff, Contributor\n\nShare\n\nGetty Images | Gene Kim\n\nDear Work It Out,\n\nI work in an office where the same floor is shared by multiple teams that\ndon\u2019t work together, but work for the same parent company. I sit right next to\na team that has a totally different job than I do \u2014 the work we do doesn\u2019t\noverlap at all \u2014 and while I\u2019ve become friendly with a couple of people who\nsit near me, I don\u2019t interact with most of them at all other than saying hi in\nthe kitchen.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes the other team is super loud. There are a few\npeople whose voices carry all the time, and occasionally a group of them will\ncongregate in an open area not far from my desk for what seem like impromptu\nteam meetings or snacks. I spend a lot of time on the phone for my role, and\nsometimes I can\u2019t hear a meeting or client when this happens.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know most of them, it feels like asking them to quiet down would\nseem like scolding from an unrelated party, but it really disrupts my work.\nHow do I address this issue without making enemies of another team?\n\nQuiet, Please\n\n*\n\nDear QP,\n\nIn interpersonal dilemmas like this, you might feel anxious or confused about\nthe proper next step. That makes sense, because things like this aren\u2019t\ncovered in the employee handbook! And your co-workers aren\u2019t malicious.\nArguably the main problem here is the open office.\n\nStill, it\u2019s important to remember that you are at work to work, and if your\nenvironment hinders your productivity, that\u2019s something you \u2014 and your company\n\u2014 should care about.\n\nGiven all that, let\u2019s look at your options:\n\n## Option 1: Approach your manager or HR\n\nKick the ball to leadership and see what they think.\n\nBe careful not to make the issue emotional. Don\u2019t ruminate on how your\ncoworkers are inconsiderate or how you don\u2019t want to tattle on them or make\nenemies, but you are at the end of your rope.\n\nInstead, keep your focus on work. Let your higher-ups know that this issue is\naffecting your productivity and interrupting your meetings with clients. Let\nthem know that the quality of work is your top priority, and you need a space\nwhere you can perform your duties optimally.\n\nThe only issue with this approach? It requires top-down action, which might\nnot get the job done. It could come off as petty or passive-aggressive, and at\nthe end of the day, if HR doesn\u2019t act, it could be ineffective.\n\n## Option 2: Go directly to the source\n\nIf you\u2019re friendly enough with the group, go talk to them. Being direct is\nalmost always a great first move.\n\nYour coworkers aren\u2019t mind-readers. Maybe they think you love eavesdropping on\ntheir conversations!\n\nWaltz over to one of their desks and let them know the situation. \u201cHey, Jen!\nI\u2019m wondering if I can get your help. I\u2019ve been having a hard time taking\nclient calls when your team talks openly in the office near my desk. Do you\nthink you could start moving your meetings to the conference room?\u201d\n\nThe issue with this approach is that it\u2019s hard to change group dynamics for\none person\u2019s convenience. It sounds like this group has conversations\nthroughout the day and is generally social. Asking the group to change their\nhabits might stick for a week, but isn\u2019t a good long-term strategy.\n\n## Option 3: Focus on what you can control\u2014i.e., where you sit\n\nTry relocating your desk to a quieter area of the office or proactively\nrelocating when you need to take calls. If approval is needed, assertively\ncommunicate your needs to your supervisor. Just as you require essential tools\nlike a keyboard and mouse, a conducive workspace is vital.\n\nThis option is my favorite because it empowers you the most. While trying to\nattack the issue from the top down or directly are reasonable options, they\nboth rely on someone else taking action in order for change to occur. Option 3\nallows you to take purposeful action without having to wait on anyone else.\n\nRegardless of the route you choose to take, it\u2019s important you act quickly.\nLingering on the issue can breed resentment. Remember, expressing your needs\nin the workplace isn\u2019t selfish \u2014 it\u2019s in the company\u2019s best interest.\n\nSo take charge of your environment and pave the way for a more productive work\nsetting for yourself.\n\nErin McGoff is an NYC-based career expert, award-winning filmmaker, and\nfounder of AdviceWithErin, a media brand dedicated to democratizing access to\nquality, soft career and life advice.
