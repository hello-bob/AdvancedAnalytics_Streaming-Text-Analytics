But\n> that appeal quickly fades when one remembers that Musk owned 21.9% of Tesla\n> when the board approved his compensation plan. This ownership stake gave him\n> every incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth\u2014Musk stood\n> to gain over $10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization\n> increase. Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla, and he made that clear at\n> the outset of the process and throughout this litigation. Moreover, the\n> compensation plan was not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of\n> time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term. Swept up by the\n> rhetoric of \u201call upside,\u201d or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal,\n> the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even\n> necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\n\nBut the real issue is how the plan came about. The judge found that Musk was\nin control of Tesla and the board \u2013 leading to irregularities and how the plan\nwas put together and negotiated.\n\nThat\u2019s at the core of the judge decision and Tesla doesn\u2019t really address it\nin its new SEC proxy statement and this new website.\n\nThis is the only section that sort of addresses it:\n\nScreenshot\n\nHowever, the testimonies from the Tesla board members, Musk, and everyone\ninvolved, led the judge to believe the work from the board wasn\u2019t really\n\u201crobust\u201d.\n\nFor example, Todd Maron, a lawyer who represented Musk and formerly was his\ndivorce lawyer, became Tesla\u2019s general counsel when this plan was being\nnegotiated:\n\n> The process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan was deeply\n> flawed. Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on\n> Tesla\u2019s behalf. He had a 15-year relationship with the compensation\n> committee chair, Ira Ehrenpreis. The other compensation committee member\n> placed on the working group, Antonio Gracias, had business relationships\n> with Musk dating back over 20 years, as well as the sort of personal\n> relationship that had him vacationing with Musk\u2019s family on a regular basis.\n> The working group included management members who were beholden to Musk,\n> such as General Counsel Todd Maron who was Musk\u2019s former divorce attorney\n> and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition. In\n> fact, Maron was a primary gobetween Musk and the committee, and it is\n> unclear on whose side Maron viewed himself. Yet many of the documents cited\n> by the defendants as proof of a fair process were drafted by Maron.\n\nThat alone is a weird thing: having your divorce lawyer become your auto\ncompany\u2019s general counsel.\n\nThe judge also argued that the board didn\u2019t really negotiate the deal proposed\nby Musk. They made a few changes to align it with Tesla\u2019s internal goals, but\nthe judge believed the change couldn\u2019t be described as \u201cconcessions\u201d by Musk:\n\n> In this litigation, the defendants touted as concessions certain features of\n> the compensation plan\u2014a five-year holding period, an M&A adjustment, and a\n> 12- tranche structure that required Tesla to increase market capitalization\n> by $100 billion more than Musk had initially proposed to maximize\n> compensation under the plan. But the holding period was adopted in part to\n> increase the discount on the publicly disclosed grant price, the M&A\n> adjustment was industry standard, and the 12-tranche structure was reached\n> in an effort to translate Musk\u2019s fully-diluted-share proposal to the board\u2019s\n> preferred total-outstanding-shares metric. It is not accurate to refer to\n> these terms as concessions.\n\nTesla shareholders are going to vote on the plan again in June, along with the\nmove to Texas and the re-election of two board members, including Musk\u2019s\nbrother, Kimbal Musk.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\n## Top comment by TheMorningLine\n\nLiked by 35 people\n\nNot a shareholder anymore, but since Musk's decision to proceed with the\nCybertruck development instead of more mass-market models that fit Tesla's\ndirective to accelerate the transition to EVs, I've pretty much disagreed with\nhis decision-making, and that's continuing with prioritizing the robotaxi over\nthe Model 2. He's continued to vastly underestimate how challenging solving\nFSD is, and is now basically ensuring that the future of the company depends\non solving it. Even if they do solve it, then you need regulatory approval.\nIt's just a massive gamble, when they could have focused on the fundamentals\nof the business and work on these more challenging initiatives on the side.\n\nBetween that and all the other issues he's causing, it's time for new\nleadership. If I had skin in the game, I'd recommend not approving this and\nhoping for new leadership to take over. That's up to shareholders though. I\nstill want Tesla to succeed, but I don't think Musk is making decisions that\nallow it.\n\nView all comments\n\nBefore voting, Tesla shareholders should look at more than the proxy and\nTesla\u2019s new website.\n\nYou should really read the judge\u2019s decision, which includes excerpts from\ntestimonies from basically everyone involved. It does undoubtedly paint the\nmost accurate picture of how the plan came about \u2013 certainly more than the\nboard saying they met 15 times to discuss this plan.\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.
