Eisenhower.^[1] Known as \"Engine\nCharlie\",^[2] he was previously the president and chief executive officer of\nGeneral Motors. In the wake of the Korean War, he cut the defense budget\nsignificantly.\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\nWilson was born in Minerva, Ohio, the son of Thomas E. and Rosalind (n\u00e9e\nUnkefer) Wilson.^[3] After earning a degree in electrical engineering from the\nCarnegie Institute of Technology in 1909, he joined the Westinghouse Electric\nCompany in Pittsburgh, where eventually he supervised the engineering of\nautomobile electrical equipment, and during World War I, the development of\ndynamotors and radio generators for the Army and Navy. Wilson married Jessie\nAnn Curtis on September 11, 1912. They had five children.\n\n## General Motors career[edit]\n\nIn 1919, Wilson became chief engineer and sales manager of Remy Electric, a\nGeneral Motors subsidiary. By January 1941 he was the president of General\nMotors. During World War II, Wilson directed the company's huge defense\nproduction effort, which earned him a Medal for Merit in 1946.^[4] He was\nstill the CEO of General Motors when Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of\nDefense in January 1953.\n\n## Secretary of Defense[edit]\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\nWilson's nomination sparked a controversy that erupted during his confirmation\nhearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, based on his large share\nownership in General Motors. Reluctant to sell the stock, valued at the time\nat more than $2.5 million (or about $24 million in 2018), Wilson agreed to do\nso under committee pressure. During the hearings, when asked if he could make\na decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of\nGeneral Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. But he added that he could not\nconceive of such a situation \"because for years I thought what was good for\nour country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\" That statement has\nfrequently been misquoted as \"What's good for General Motors is good for the\ncountry.\" Although Wilson tried for years to correct the misquote, he was\nreported at the time of his retirement in 1957 to have accepted the popular\nimpression.^[5]\n\nWilson was finally confirmed as Secretary of Defense by a Senate vote of 77 to\n6 and began his duties in the Pentagon.\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\nBoth Wilson and Eisenhower entered office committed to reorganizing the US\nDepartment of Defense. They succeeded in securing from Congress approval in\nJune 1953 of Reorganization Plan No. 6, which made changes in OSD, the Joint\nChiefs of Staff, and the chain of command. Wilson welcomed the reorganization\nplan, which became effective on June 30, 1953, as facilitating more efficient\nmanagement of the Department of Defense. He considered the assistant\nsecretaries as his \"vice presidents\" and tried to manage the Pentagon like an\nindustrial corporation. Wilson took advantage of the reorganization to\ndecentralize administration, giving the service secretaries more\nresponsibility and importance. In his first annual report, he noted that the\nservice secretaries were his principal assistants; decentralizing operational\nresponsibility to them would make for effective exercise of civilian authority\nthroughout the Department of Defense. In July 1954, to complement the 1953\nreorganization, Wilson issued a directive to the JCS, the most important\nprovision of which stated that \"the Joint Staff work of each of the Chiefs of\nStaff shall take priority over all other duties,\" their tasks as chiefs of\nindividual services. The directive also clarified the role of the JCS chairman\nand his authority over the Joint Staff while making clear that assignment of\nmajor tasks to the Joint Staff was the prerogative of the full JCS.\n\nInternal reorganization was only one of several major changes during Wilson's\ntenure, the most important being the \"New Look\" defense concept. Eisenhower\nhad criticized Truman's policies during the 1952 campaign, arguing that they\nwere reactive rather than positive and that they forced the United States to\ncompete with the Soviet Union on the latter's terms. Eisenhower entered office\nwith strong convictions about the need to reorient the nation's security\npolicy by maintaining a staunch defense while decreasing government\nexpenditures and balancing the budget.\n\nThe president inaugurated planning for the New Look in July 1953 by asking the\nincoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General\nMatthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force\nchief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to\nprepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not\nrecommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October\n1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a\ngeneral war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally\npresented the New Look in his State of the Union message in January 1954, and\nWilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, he said\n(or as he sometimes phrased it, \"More bang for the buck\"). With new weapons\nand techniques and ready reserves of troops and material, the United States\ncould support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress\nwas willing to provide.\n\nThe major features of the New Look included greater reliance on nuclear\nweapons, using the advantage the United States had over the Soviet Union in\nsuch weapons; elevation of strategic air power, the major means to deliver\nnuclear weapons, to a more important position (not an expansion in the number\nof Air Force aircraft but rather development and production of better\nequipment); reductions of conventional ground forces, based both on reliance\non strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the expectation that US allies\nwould provide ground troops for their own defense; an expanded program of\ncontinental defense, which, along with strategic air power, would serve as a\nprincipal ingredient of the New Look's deterrence program; and modernization\nand enlargement of reserve forces, enhancing the military manpower base while\nreducing active duty forces.\n\nAlthough the Eisenhower administration generally adhered to the New Look\nthroughout Wilson's term, the policy remained controversial. Some critics\nmaintained that it made impossible the fighting of a limited non-nuclear war.\nThe Army and the Navy felt that the increased emphasis on air power and\nnuclear weapons represented a repudiation the concept of \"balanced forces\" in\nwhich individual service programs were balanced against overall requirements.\nImplicit in the policy was rejection of the idea that a general war or a\ncrisis with the USSR was imminent (to occur when the Soviets achieved\noffensive nuclear capability against the United States). Wilson pointed out\nfrequently that defense policy should be long-term and not based on short-term\nprojections of Soviet-American relations. \"Military expenditures,\" he\nobserved, \"must be adequate, but not so great that they will become an\nintolerable burden which will harm the social and economic fabric of our\ncountry. True security cannot be founded on arms and arms alone.\"\n\nWilson worked hard to reduce the defense budget, which meant some immediate\ncutbacks in fiscal year 1953 funds and a concerted effort to economize in\nsubsequent years. Total obligational authority approved by Congress during\nWilson's tenure decreased significantly at first and then began to creep back\nup, but it remained lower than the Truman administration's last budgets,\ninflated because of the Korean War. The TOA for FY 1953, Truman's final\nDefense budget, was $44.2 billion. TOA in subsequent fiscal years was: 1954,\n$30.4 billion; 1955, $33.7 billion; 1956, $33.06 billion; 1957, $39.7 billion;\nand 1958, $41.1 billion. Especially after 1954, when the Democratic Party\nregained control of Congress, the Wilson-Eisenhower effort to curb defense\nexpenditures provoked growing criticism. The Air Force, even though the New\nLook enhanced its role, opposed the decision to cut back from the Truman goal\nof 143 wings, and its congressional supporters tried repeatedly, sometimes\nsuccessfully, to appropriate more money for air power than the administration\nwanted. The other services, especially the Army, objected to force reductions\nordained by the New Look. Both General Ridgway, who retired as Army chief of\nstaff in June 1955, and his successor, General Maxwell D. Taylor, believed\nthat the Army was receiving too small a share of the military budget.\n\nIts standing threatened by the New Look, the Army questioned the wisdom of\nreliance on \"massive retaliation\" and strategic air power to the neglect of\nother force elements. Wilson reportedly observed that the United States \"can't\nafford to fight limited wars. We can only afford to fight a big war, and if\nthere is one, that is the kind it will be.\" However, by 1955 the Army and,\nlater that decade, the Navy, departed from their emphasis on preparation for\ntotal war by urging the need to prepare for limited war, non-global conflicts\nrestricted in geographical area, force size, and weapons although tactical\nnuclear weapons were not ruled out. Generals Ridgway and Taylor stressed the\nneed to have a variety of forces available and equipped to fight different\nkinds of war from a local non-nuclear war to a global strategic nuclear\nconflict. They rejected the notion that limited wars would occur only in less-\ndeveloped areas and argued that such conflicts might occur in NATO as well.\n\nThe Army received indirect support from such critics of massive retaliation as\nBernard Brodie, William W. Kaufmann, and Henry A. Kissinger, who noted that\nthe United States and the Soviet Union had or were acquiring the power to\ndestroy each other with strategic nuclear weapons, thus precluding their\nrational use in response to a limited attack. Taylor, concluding that the\nSoviet Union and the United States had achieved mutual nuclear deterrence,\nbelieved that limited-war forces would play an active role in future conflicts\nand that atomic retaliatory forces would play a passive role. The Army moved\ninto missile and space programs in an effort to preserve for itself a part in\nplanning for and fighting a nuclear war, but in the late 1950s, it continued\nto push for adoption of a new national security policy acknowledging the\nprimacy of limited war. While the Eisenhower administration did not adopt the\nArmy's position, by the time that Wilson left office, it had accepted both the\nneed to prepare for limited war and the idea that deterrence of a direct\nattack on US interests required \"sufficient,\" rather than \"superior,\"\nretaliatory capability.\n\nIncreased competition among the services resulting from the New Look compelled\nWilson to deal with the perennially troublesome question of service roles and\nmissions, complicated by the introduction of new weapons, especially missiles.\nHe noted in his semi-annual report at the end of FY 1956 that the services,\nwhich had eight categories of guided missiles available for various tasks,\ncould not agree on their respective roles and missions in relation to these\nand other planned missile systems. Also at issue were aircraft types for the\nindividual services and Air Force tactical support for the Army. To address\nthose and other nagging questions, Wilson issued two important documents. The\nformer, a memorandum to members of the Armed Forces Policy Council on November\n26, 1956, dealt with five points of contention. First, Wilson limited the Army\nto small aircraft with specifically defined functions within combat zones. On\nthe matter of airlift adequacy, which the Army questioned, the secretary\ndeclared current Air Force practices acceptable. As to air defense, the Army\nreceived responsibility for point defense of specified geographical areas,\nvital installations, and cities; the Air Force became responsible for area\ndefense and the interception of enemy attacks away from individual vital\ninstallations; and the Navy could maintain ship-based air defense weapon\nsystems. Wilson assigned to the Air Force primary responsibility for tactical\nsupport for the Army, although the Army could use surface-to-surface missiles\nfor close support of its field operations. Finally, the secretary gave the Air\nForce sole authority to operate land-based intermediate-range ballistic\nmissile (IRBM) systems and the Navy the same responsibility for ship-based\nIRBMs. He enjoined the Army from planning operational employment of missiles\nwith ranges beyond 200 miles (320 km).\n\nOn March 18, 1957, Wilson issued a directive to clarify his earlier decisions\non the Army-Air Force use of aircraft for tactical purposes. He made no major\nchanges from the previous division of responsibility but provided a more\ndetailed and specific listing of those functional areas for which the Army\ncould procure its own aircraft and those for which it would rely on the Air\nForce.\n\nAlthough Wilson found it necessary to clarify service roles and missions, he\ndid not press for extensive further unification of the armed forces. He\nestablished in February 1956 an office of special assistant to the Secretary\nof Defense for guided missiles but made few other changes after implementation\nof Reorganization Plan No. 6 in 1953. When asked in 1957 about persistent\ndemands for further unification, Wilson responded, \"It's an oversimplification\nin the false hope that you could thus wash out the problems if you put the\npeople all in the same uniform and that then they wouldn't disagree over what\nshould be done. Of course, they would.\"\n\nWilson, a folksy, honest, and outspoken man, sometimes got into trouble\nbecause of casual remarks. In January 1957, for example, he referred to\nenlistees in the National Guard during the Korean War as \"draft dodgers.\" That\ncaused a storm of protest and even brought a rebuke from Eisenhower, who said\nhe thought Wilson had made \"a very... unwise statement, without stopping to\nthink what it meant.\" On another occasion, Wilson jokingly referred to the\nWhite House as a \"dung hill,\" generating further controversy.\n\nWilson indicated his intention to retire from office shortly after the start\nof the second Eisenhower term and left on October 8, 1957. Eisenhower noted\nwhen Wilson stepped down that under him, \"the strength of our security forces\nhas not only been maintained but has been significantly increased\" and that he\nhad managed the Defense Department \"in a manner consistent with the\nrequirements of a strong, healthy national economy.\"^[6]\n\nOn October 9, 1957, Eisenhower presented Wilson with the Medal of Freedom.\n\n## Human experimentation[edit]\n\nWhile serving as Secretary of Defense, Wilson enacted stronger rules against\nhuman medical experimentation. The 1953 Wilson Memo led the armed services to\nadopt the Nuremberg Code. Patients would have to provide written, informed\nconsent.\n\nWilson wrote, \"By reason of the basic medical responsibility in connection\nwith the development of defense of all types against atomic, biological and/or\nchemical warfare agents, Armed Services personnel and/or civilians on duty at\ninstallations engaged in such research shall be permitted to actively\nparticipate in all phases of the program.\"^[7]\n\nJonathan Moreno and Susan Lederer wrote in a 1996 issue of the Kennedy\nInstitute of Ethics Journal that the Wilson Memo remained classified until\n1975, limiting its availability to researchers. They found the Air Force and\nArmy tried to implement the rules but found spotty compliance in actual\nPentagon research.^[citation needed]\n\n## 'Dynamic Programming'[edit]\n\nMathematician Richard Bellman states in his biography that Wilson disliked the\nword \"research\" and recounts in his biography his origin of the term \"dynamic\nprogramming\"--\n\n\u201cI spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name\nfor multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the\nname, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for\nmathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named\nWilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear\nand hatred of the word research. I\u2019m not using the term lightly; I\u2019m using it\nprecisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent\nif people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt,\nthen, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the\nAir Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I\nfelt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact\nthat I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title,\nwhat name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in\ndecision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various\nreasons. I decided therefore to use the word \u201cprogramming\u201d. I wanted to get\nacross the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-\nvarying. I thought, let\u2019s kill two birds with one stone. Let\u2019s take a word\nthat has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical\nphysical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and\nthat it\u2019s impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try\nthinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning.\nIt\u2019s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was\nsomething not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella\nfor my activities.\u201d^[8]\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\nAfter he left the Pentagon, Wilson returned to Michigan, where he devoted his\ntime to business and family affairs. He died in Norwood, Louisiana, and was\ninterred at the Acacia Park Cemetery, a Masonic cemetery in Beverly Hills,\nMichigan, a suburb of Detroit.\n\n## Nickname[edit]\n\nCharles Erwin Wilson should not be confused with Charles Edward Wilson, who\nwas the CEO of General Electric and served President Truman as the director of\nthe Office of Defense Mobilization. The two were respectively nicknamed\n\"Engine Charlie\"^[9] and \"Electric Charlie\" so that they could be more easily\ndistinguished.\n\n## References[edit]\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Charles Erwin Wilson.\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to Charles Erwin Wilson.\n\n  1. ^ \"Charles E.
