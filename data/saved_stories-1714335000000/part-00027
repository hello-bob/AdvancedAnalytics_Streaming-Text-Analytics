We'd\ntaken three cheap plastic plant pots and dug two of them into the ground, and\nstood the third surrounded by plants. When then lined them with rocks and\nfilled them with water, rocks and native pond plants.\n\nWe were hopeful wildlife would come but, at the same time, apprehensive that \u2013\nin the midst of a biodiversity crisis \u2013 nothing would find its way to our\nlittle oases. Then, just one week later, we noticed spiders and insects had\nbegun to visit. Ants were crawling about the edge. Hover flies, bumblebees and\nladybirds flittered nearby.\n\nBen Andrew\n\nLarge red damselflies can live in garden ponds smaller than than one square\nmetre (Credit: Ben Andrew)\n\n\"Ponds are absolute biodiversity hotspots \u2013 in terms of both the range and\ndensity of species that use them. After you fill a hole in the garden with\nwater, wildlife will come \u2013 very, very quickly. It's astonishing how quickly\nit comes,\" says Adrian Thomas, an expert on gardening for wildlife at the\nRoyal Society for the Protection of Birds and author of book Gardening for\nWildlife.\n\nPonds, he says, offer a mix of habitat types. \"Within a pond you have cool\nbits, open water, shallow bits, the margins around the outside. You get this\necological principle known as the edge effect, where different habitats butt\nup against each other. It might be easy to think that you've got just two\nhabitats \u2013 pond and not pond \u2013 but actually, you've got all these interlocking\nmicrohabitats.\" The result, he says, is a \"diversity of life that so is much\ngreater than in any other part of the garden\".\n\nSpecies to look out for could include the common frog, smooth newt, water\nbeetles, diving beetles, dragonfly nymphs and caddisfly larvae. Not to mention\nbirds and bats. However, for the amphibians particularly, we might have to be\nlucky. Worldwide, the situation is dire. A 2023 report, compiled by more than\n100 scientists, found that global amphibian populations are deteriorating,\nwith over 40% at risk of extinction in the coming decades. This is the highest\nof any major animal group on the conservation Red List, with disease, climate\nchange and habitat destruction driving their decline.\n\nSign up to Future Earth\n\nSign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and\nhopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Ponds support more\nbiodiversity than larger waterbodies, even rivers and lakes. They are home to\ntwo-thirds of all freshwater species, and provide vital services for\npollinators, birds, bats and other mammals too. Even a small body of water\nlike a pot or bucket could soon attract wildlife and, according to the\nFreshwater Habitats Trust, creating new ponds is one of the \"simplest and most\neffective ways to protect freshwater wildlife\". Read more about how wildlife\nfinds garden ponds in this article by Chris Baraniuk.\n\nOur gardens are not isolated islands, but a sprawling network of green spaces.\nIf we add ponds into the mix, we can create blue corridors that connect pond\nto pond, lake to lake, and river to river \u2013 all the way to the edge of the\nocean.\n\nTake my own garden in Gloucestershire, not far from the wooded banks of the\nRiver Wye or from the tidal mudflats of the River Severn. Imagine the network\nof waterways if each garden between these rivers had a pond.\n\nTop tips for making your own mini pond\n\n\u2022 Fill your pond with rain water, as tap water often has high levels of\ndissolved nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\n\u2022 There's no need to top up with water, even in dry periods, as some animals\nlike newts can benefit from varying water levels.\n\n\u2022 Make sure there is a shallow edge so that creatures can crawl in and out of\nthe water.\n\n\u2022 Don't add fish. They will likely gobble up any invertebrates or tadpoles.\n\n\u2022 Choose plenty of native pond plants, to avoid the spread of non-native\ninvasive plant species.\n\n\u2022 Don't take frogspawn from elsewhere to add to your pond as this may spread\ndisease.\n\n\u2022 Consider removing solid fencing around your garden, which can hamper\nmovement of some species.\n\n\u2022 Be patient. \"A pond takes time to develop,\" says Thomas, \"to settle itself,\nto grow plants and wildlife, to come to nature's balance.\"\n\n\"Ponds they are one of the earliest habitat types on the planet,\" says Naomi\nEwald, technical director at the Freshwater Habitat Trust, a non-profit in the\nUK. \"Darwin even hypothesised that life began in a pond. We are talking about\na habitat that's been here forever, and life has evolved over millions of\nyears to live in those environments. From the tiniest algae and the smallest\nlife \u2013 most of which we haven't even begun to identify \u2013 to insects and\nplants, and then all those higher animals on top. You can find almost every\nsingle taxonomic group in a pond.\"\n\nNetworks of ponds \u2013 or \"pondscapes\" \u2013 are crucial for biodiversity. These\nsmall water bodies can be permanent or seasonal, natural or man-made, and\nprovide habitats for many endemic, threatened or rare species. In Europe\nalone, ponds have been found to support up to 70% of regional freshwater\nspecies.\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022 How to turn your garden into a carbon sink\n\n\u2022 How does wildlife find garden ponds\n\n\u2022 The doctors prescribing blue therapy\n\nPonds can provide predator-free environments, as well as refuge from disease\nand invasive species. They also boost pollination and allow nutrients to flow\nto adjacent ecosystems. Ponds also act as \"stepping-stone habitats\", providing\nconnectivity between freshwater sites, and enabling the dispersal of species\nacross the landscape.\n\nWhile cities spread as urban populations burgeon, the negative impact of\nurbanisation on biodiversity can be buffered by these blue corridors, says one\n2021 study, preventing biodiversity loss and reducing the risk of local\nextinctions. The researchers found that to preserve biodiversity in urban\nponds, combining blue with green spaces could enhance this connectivity.\n\nFrom the tiniest algae to insects and plants, you can find almost every single\ntaxonomic group in a pond \u2013 Naomi Ewald\n\n\"There's huge potential,\" says Ewald. \"I've only got a small garden and live\nin a very urban area. I've got container ponds in my back garden \u2013 which are\njust teeming with life. They've got dragonflies, water beetles, snails. They\nare an oasis of wildlife in the urban environment.\" If people create homes for\nwildlife in their gardens, she says, \"they will be playing a very active role\nin bringing back that freshwater landscape\" \u2013 and wildlife will arrive.\n\nFreshwater Habitats Trust\n\n3,000 years ago wetlands dotted the landscape (Credit: Freshwater Habitats\nTrust)\n\nUrban ponds allow movement of wildlife throughout the urban matrix. The bigger\nthe better, says one recent study, but small is better than none. In fact,\nresearch shows small water bodies attract as many small species as larger\nwater bodies do, and garden water sources \"present a significant conservation\nopportunity\" when it comes to urban wildlife.\n\nSo, even if the only outdoor space you have is a window box, you can make your\nown mini pond that, within weeks, could be full of life and part of the wider\n\"pondscape\".\n\nPonds come with other benefits too, including water purification, flood\nmitigation, and even climate regulation. Although ponds can act as both carbon\nsinks and sources, they have been found to hold up to 30 times more carbon in\ntheir sediments than other habitat types \u2013 including peatlands, woodlands and\ngrasslands \u2013 and can store higher concentrations of greenhouse gases such as\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) than larger lakes and oceans.\n\nBut ponds are in trouble. Due to their small size ponds are particularly\nvulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, pollution and\nhabitat degradation.\n\n\"Go back 3,000 years and the landscape would have been dotted with natural\nponds \u2013 peat bogs, flood plains, oxbow lakes...\" says Thomas. \"Today, the\nponds you might encounter are often garden ponds, farm ponds, fishing ponds,\nor moats around castles. So many of the ponds in existence today are human in\norigin.\"\n\nCarbon Count\n\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital\nemissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\nFind out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nAround 1000BC, before our ancestors began draining the land, at least a\nquarter of Britain was wetlands. The US, too, used to be covered in marshes,\nponds and bogs. When Europeans arrived on the continent in the early 17th\nCentury, what was to become the United States of America had around 221\nmillion acres of wetlands.\n\nBy the 1980s this had more than halved. Numbers of ponds worldwide, too, are\ndwindling. In the past century, at least 50% of ponds in both the UK and\nEurope have disappeared from the landscape. And in some regions including the\nNetherlands, Switzerland and Germany, only 10% of ponds remain. This loss of\nnatural ponds, and the associated decline of landscape connectivity, is\nresulting in \"profound negative consequences\" for biodiversity.\n\nBilly Latham\n\nWithin three weeks multiple species had moved into our mini ponds, including\n\"Froggo\" the common frog (Credit: Billy Latham)\n\nBack in our garden, we were visiting our mini ponds daily, excited to see what\nmight have made its home there. We practiced patience \u2013 as Thomas advised \u2013\nwhich was difficult as at first the ponds grew thick with algae. But then, in\njust a few days, the waters cleared again. In week two, we were somewhat\nsurprised to find aquatic life \u2013 water fleas and mosquito larvae darting about\nunder the surface.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon of week three, I heard squeals of delight and my\nchildren came sprinting in from the garden unable to contain their excitement.\nThey had found a fully grown common frog, which they affectionately named\n\"Froggo\". Now, we are on tenterhooks, waiting to see if we get any frogspawn.\n\nOur mini-pond journey has been a magical experience. These tiny universes,\nteeming with life within just a short space of time, are a source of joy and\nwonder \u2013 and I for one feel privileged to witness the biodiversity boost that\ncomes with just a simple pot of water.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to\nyour inbox twice a week.\n\nFuture Planet\n\nEarth\n\nClimate\n\nEnvironment\n\nWater\n\nWildlife\n\nAnimal\n\nFeatures\n\nRelated\n\n## Can bird flu be stopped?\n\n2 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n## The scavengers stalking the world's cities\n\n4 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n## The insects that can digest plastic as food\n\n4 days ago\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## An insider's guide to the best sushi in Tokyo\n\nSushi book author, reviewer and guide Yukari Sakamoto shares her picks of the\nfive best sushi restaurants in the Japanese capital.\n\n1 hr ago\n\nTravel\n\n6 hrs ago\n\n## Why we continue to embrace analogue tech\n\nDigital technology's quickness and convenience ought to have buried its\nanalogue counterparts.
