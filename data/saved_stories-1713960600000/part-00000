REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) -International Business Machines is nearing a deal to buy cloud\nsoftware provider HashiCorp, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nHashicorp's stock surged 24%, giving it a market value of $6.1 billion, after\nthe Wall Street Journal first reported the talks.\n\nUnder CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has focused on acquisitions to build out its\ncloud offerings. The boom in generative artificial intelligence has increased\nthe attractiveness of cloud software as it helps process vast amounts of data.\n\nCalifornia-based HashiCorp allows customers to establish and manage their\ninfrastructures on the cloud. The company's annual revenue jumped 22.5% to\n$583.1 million for the year ended Jan. 31, beating analysts' average estimate\nat the time, according to LSEG data.\n\nA deal for HashiCorp could be finalised in the coming days, but it is still\npossible that the talks may not result in a transaction, according to the WSJ\nreport.\n\nHashiCorp declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nIBM completed nine acquisitions in 2023, including a deal for technology\nspend-management platform Apptio from Vista Equity Partners for $4.6 billion.\n\nStarPicks\n\n## Study at one of the world\u2019s elite business schools\n\nThe company's 2018 acquisition of software company Red Hat for $34 billion,\nincluding debt, remains its biggest buyout till date.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and\nSriraj Kalluvila)\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a subscriber?
