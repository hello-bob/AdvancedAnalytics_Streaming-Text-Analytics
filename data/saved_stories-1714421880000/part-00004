Phreak, phreaker, or phone phreak are names used for and by\nindividuals who participate in phreaking.\n\nThe term first referred to groups who had reverse engineered the system of\ntones used to route long-distance calls. By re-creating these tones, phreaks\ncould switch calls from the phone handset, allowing free calls to be made\naround the world. To ease the creation of these tones, electronic tone\ngenerators known as blue boxes became a staple of the phreaker community. This\ncommunity included future Apple Inc. cofounders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\nThe blue box era came to an end with the ever-increasing use of computerized\nphone systems which allowed telecommunication companies to discontinue the use\nof in-band signaling for call routing purposes. Instead, dialing information\nwas sent on a separate channel which was inaccessible to the telecom customer.\nBy the 1980s, most of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in the US\nand Western Europe had adopted the SS7 system which uses out-of-band signaling\nfor call control (and which is still in use to this day). Phreaking has since\nbecome closely linked with computer hacking.^[2]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nPhreaking began in the 1960s when it was discovered that certain whistles\ncould replicate the 2600 Hz pitch used in phone signalling systems in the\nUnited States.^[3] Phone phreaks experimented with dialing around the\ntelephone network to understand how the phone system worked, engaging in\nactivities such as listening to the pattern of tones to figure out how calls\nwere routed, reading obscure telephone company technical journals (often\nobtained through dumpster diving),^[3] social engineering, building electronic\ndevices called blue boxes, black boxes, and red boxes to help them explore the\nnetwork and make free phone calls, hanging out on early conference call\ncircuits and \"loop arounds\" to communicate with one another and writing their\nown newsletters to spread information. Phreaking was especially prevalent in\nuniversities,^[3] where it began spreading much like computer hacking would in\nthe following decades.\n\nBefore 1984, long-distance telephone calls were a premium item in the United\nStates, with strict regulations. In some locations, calling across the street\ncounted as long distance.^[4] To report that a phone call was long-distance\nmeant an elevated importance because the calling party is paying by the minute\nto speak to the called party.\n\nSome phreaking consists of techniques to evade long-distance charges, which is\ncriminalized as \"toll fraud\".^[5] In 1990, the pager cloning technique arose\nand was used by law enforcement.^[6]\n\nIn the UK the situation was rather different due to the difference in\ntechnology between the American and British systems, the main difference being\nthe absence of tone dialing and signaling, particularly in the 1950s and\n1960s.\n\nThe tone system in the United States has been almost entirely replaced, but in\nsome countries, in addition to new systems, the tone system is still\navailable, for example in Italy.\n\n### Switch hook and tone dialer[edit]\n\nPossibly one of the first phreaking methods was switch-hooking, which allows\nplacing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled\nby a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It\nis done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close\nthe subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial.\nEven most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be\nbackward compatible with old subscriber hardware.^[7]\n\nBy rapidly clicking the hook for a variable number of times at roughly 5 to 10\nclicks per second, separated by intervals of roughly one second, the caller\ncan dial numbers as if they were using the rotary dial. The pulse counter in\nthe exchange counts the pulses or clicks and interprets them in two possible\nways. Depending on continent and country, one click with a following interval\ncan be either \"one\" or \"zero\" and subsequent clicks before the interval are\nadditively counted. This renders ten consecutive clicks being either \"zero\" or\n\"nine\", respectively. Some exchanges allow using additional clicks for special\ncontrols, but numbers 0-9 now fall in one of these two standards. One special\ncode, \"flash\", is a very short single click, possible but hard to simulate.\nBack in the day of rotary dial, technically identical phone sets were marketed\nin multiple areas of the world, only with plugs matched by country and the\ndials being bezeled with the local standard numbers.^[citation needed]\n\nSuch key-locked telephones, if wired to a modern DTMF capable exchange, can\nalso be exploited by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by\nmodern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized\nworldwide. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the\nexchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-\nhooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF\ncontrolled services that can not be used with rotary dial.\n\n### 2600 hertz[edit]\n\nMain article: 2600 hertz\n\nThe origins of phone phreaking trace back at least to AT&T's implementation of\nfully automatic switches. These switches used tone dialing, a form of in-band\nsignaling, and included some tones which were for internal telephone company\nuse.^[citation needed] One internal-use tone is a tone of 2600 Hz which causes\na telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line,\nwhich can be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international calls.\nAt that time, long-distance calls were more expensive than local calls.^[8]\n\nThe tone was discovered in approximately 1957,^[8] by Joe Engressia, a blind\nseven-year-old boy. Engressia had perfect pitch, and discovered that whistling\nthe fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2637.02 Hz) would stop a dialed\nphone recording. Unaware of what he had done, Engressia called the phone\ncompany and asked why the recordings had stopped. Joe Engressia is considered\nto be the father of phreaking.^[9]\n\nOther early phreaks, such as \"Bill from New York\" (William \"Bill\" Acker\n1953-2015), began to develop a rudimentary understanding of how phone networks\nworked. Bill discovered that a recorder he owned could also play the tone at\n2600 Hz with the same effect. John Draper discovered through his friendship\nwith Engressia that the free whistles given out in Cap'n Crunch cereal boxes\nalso produced a 2600 Hz tone when blown (providing his nickname, \"Captain\nCrunch\"). This allows control of phone systems that work on single frequency\n(SF) controls. One can sound a long whistle to reset the line, followed by\ngroups of whistles (a short tone for a \"1\", two for a \"2\", etc.) to dial\nnumbers.^[10]^[11]\n\n### Multi frequency[edit]\n\nMain article: Multi-frequency signaling\n\nWhile single-frequency worked on certain phone routes, the most common\nsignaling on the then long-distance network was multi-frequency (MF) controls.\nThe slang term for these tones and their use was \"Marty Freeman\". The specific\nfrequencies required were unknown to the general public until 1954, when the\nBell System published the information in the Bell System Technical Journal in\nan article describing the methods and frequencies used for inter-office\nsignalling. The journal was intended for the company's engineers; however, it\nfound its way to various college campuses across the United States. With this\none article, the Bell System accidentally gave away the \"keys to the kingdom\",\nand the intricacies of the phone system were at the disposal of people with a\nknowledge of electronics.^[12]\n\nThe second generation of phreaks arose at this time, including New Yorkers\n\"Evan Doorbell\", \"Ben Decibel\" and Neil R. Bell and Californians Mark Bernay,\nChris Bernay, and \"Alan from Canada\". Each conducted their own independent\nexploration and experimentation of the telephone network, initially on an\nindividual basis, and later within groups as they discovered each other in\ntheir travels. \"Evan Doorbell\", \"Ben\" and \"Neil\" formed a group of phreaks,\nknown as \"Group Bell\". Bernay initiated a similar group named the \"Mark Bernay\nSociety\". Both Bernay and Evan received fame amongst today's phone phreakers\nfor internet publications of their collection of telephone exploration\nrecordings. These recordings, conducted in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s\nare available at Mark's website Phone Trips.^[13]\n\n### Blue boxes[edit]\n\nBlue box\n\nMain article: Blue box\n\nIn October 1971, phreaking was introduced to the masses when Esquire magazine\npublished a story called \"Secrets of the Little Blue Box\"^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17]\nby Ron Rosenbaum. This article featured Engressia and John Draper prominently,\nsynonymising their names with phreaking. The article also attracted the\ninterest of other soon-to-be phreaks, such as Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs,\nwho went on to found Apple Computer.^[18]^[19]\n\n1971 also saw the beginnings of YIPL (Youth International Party Line), a\npublication started by Abbie Hoffman and Al Bell to provide information to\nYippies on how to \"beat the man\", mostly involving telephones. In the first\nissue of YIPL, writers included a \"shout-out\" to all of the phreakers who\nprovided technological information for the newsletter: \"We at YIPL would like\nto offer thanks to all you phreaks out there.\"^[20] In the last issue, YIPL\nstated:\n\n> YIPL believes that education alone cannot affect the System, but education\n> can be an invaluable tool for those willing to use it. Specifically, YIPL\n> will show you why something must be done immediately in regard, of course,\n> to the improper control of the communication in this country by none other\n> than bell telephone company.^[20]\n\nIn 1973, Al Bell would move YIPL over and start TAP (Technological American\nParty).^[21]\n\nAl Bell was denied opening a bank account under the name of Technological\nAmerican Party, since he was not a political party, so he changed the name to\nTechnological Assistance Program to get a bank account.^[22]\n\nTAP developed into a major source for subversive technical information among\nphreaks and hackers all over the world.^[according to whom?] TAP ran from 1973\nto 1984, with Al Bell handing over the magazine to \"Tom Edison\" in the late\n1970s. TAP ended publication in 1984 due mostly to a break-in and arson at Tom\nEdison's residence in 1983.^[23] Cheshire Catalyst then took over running the\nmagazine for its final (1984) year.\n\nA controversially suppressed article \"Regulating the Phone Company In Your\nHome\"^[24] in Ramparts magazine (June 1972) increased interest in phreaking.\nThis article published simple schematic plans of a \"black box\" used to make\nfree long-distance phone calls, and included a very short parts list that\ncould be used to construct one. AT&T forced Ramparts to pull all copies from\nshelves, but not before numerous copies were sold and many regular subscribers\nreceived them.^[25]\n\n## Phone hacking[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(July 2014) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nIn the 1980s, the revolution of the personal computer and the popularity of\ncomputer bulletin board systems (BBSes) (accessed via modem) created an influx\nof tech-savvy users. These BBSes became popular for computer hackers and\nothers interested in the technology, and served as a medium for previously\nscattered independent phone phreaks to share their discoveries and\nexperiments. This not only led to unprecedented collaboration between phone\nphreaks, but also spread the notion of phreaking to others who took it upon\nthemselves to study, experiment with, or exploit the telephone system. This\nwas also at a time when the telephone company was a popular subject of\ndiscussion in the US, as the monopoly of AT&T Corporation was forced into\ndivestiture. During this time, exploration of telephone networks diminished,\nand phreaking focused more on toll fraud. Computer hackers began to use\nphreaking methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging to\nbusinesses, which they could exploit later. Groups then formed around the BBS\nhacker/phreaking (H/P) community such as the famous Masters of Deception\n(Phiber Optik) and Legion of Doom (Erik Bloodaxe) groups. In 1985, an\nunderground e-zine called Phrack (a combination of the words phreak and hack)\nbegan circulation among BBSes, and focused on hacking, phreaking, and other\nrelated technological subjects.^[26]\n\nIn the early 1990s, groups like Masters of Deception and Legion of Doom were\nshut down by the US Secret Service's Operation Sundevil. Phreaking as a\nsubculture saw a brief dispersion in fear of criminal prosecution in the\n1990s, before the popularity of the internet initiated a reemergence of\nphreaking as a subculture in the US and spread phreaking to international\nlevels.^[citation needed]\n\n### Toll fraud[edit]\n\nThe 1984 AT&T breakup gave rise to many small companies intent on competing in\nthe long-distance market. These included the then-fledgling Sprint and MCI,\nboth of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, there was\nno way to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&T\ncompanies. Customers of these small long-distance operations would be required\nto dial a local access number, enter their calling card number, and finally\nenter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the\nrelatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies\nkept the calling card numbers short \u2013 usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a\nhuge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer.\n\n6-digit calling card numbers only offer 1 million combinations. 7-digit\nnumbers offer just 10 million. If a company had 10,000 customers, a person\nattempting to \"guess\" a card number would have a good chance of doing so\ncorrectly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries\nfor a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough for people to do\nmanually, computers made the task far easier.^[27]^[28] \"Code hack\" programs\nwere developed for computers with modems. The modems would dial the long-\ndistance access number, enter a random calling card number (of the proper\nnumber of digits), and attempt to complete a call to a computer bulletin board\nsystem (BBS). If the computer connected successfully to the BBS, it proved\nthat it had found a working card number, and it saved that number to disk. If\nit did not connect to the BBS in a specified amount of time (usually 30 or 60\nseconds), it would hang up and try a different code. Using this method, code\nhacking programs would turn up hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of\nworking calling card numbers per day. These would subsequently be shared\namongst fellow phreakers.\n\nThere was no way for these small phone companies to identify the culprits of\nthese hacks. They had no access to local phone company records of calls into\ntheir access numbers, and even if they had access, obtaining such records\nwould be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some\nadvancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the\nproblem did not completely disappear until most long-distance companies were\nable to offer standard 1+ dialing without the use of an access number.\n\n### Diverters[edit]\n\nAnother method of obtaining free phone calls involves the use of \"diverters\".\nCall forwarding was not an available feature for many business phone lines in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, so they were forced to buy equipment that\ncould do the job manually between two phone lines. When the business would\nclose, they would program the call diverting equipment to answer all calls,\npick up another phone line, call their answering service, and bridge the two\nlines together. This gave the appearance to the caller that they were directly\nforwarded to the company's answering service. The switching equipment would\ntypically reset the line after the call had hung up and timed out back to dial\ntone, so the caller could simply wait after the answering service had\ndisconnected, and would eventually get a usable dial tone from the second\nline. Phreakers recognized the opportunity this provided, and they would spend\nhours manually dialing businesses after hours, attempting to identify faulty\ndiverters. Once a phreaker had access to one of these lines, they could use it\nfor one of many purposes. In addition to completing phone calls anywhere in\nthe world at the businesses' expense, they could also dial 1-900 phone\nsex/entertainment numbers, as well as use the line to harass their enemies\nwithout fear of being traced. Victimized small businesses were usually\nrequired to foot the bill for the long-distance calls, as it was their own\nprivate equipment (not phone company security flaws) that allowed such fraud\nto occur. By 1993, call forwarding was offered to nearly every business line\nsubscriber, making these diverters obsolete. As a result, hackers stopped\nsearching for the few remaining ones, and this method of toll fraud died. Many\n(different type) of diverters still exist and are actively \"phreaked\" in the\nUnited States as of 2020. It is rare to find a diverter solely used for\nAnswering Service forwarding anymore, but the many other types such as phone-\ncompany test numbers and remote PBX DISAs are still used as\ndiverters.^[citation needed]\n\n### Voice mail boxes and bridges[edit]\n\nBefore the BBS era of the 1980s phone phreaking was more of a solitary venture\nas it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another.^[citation needed]\nIn addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discover voice mail boxes\nand party lines as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. They\nusually appropriate unused boxes that are part of business or cellular phone\nsystems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system is discovered, word would spread\naround the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the\nsystem. They use these systems as a \"home base\" for communication with one\nanother until the rightful owners discover the intrusion and wipe them off.\nVoice mailboxes also provide a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to\none another as home phone numbers and personal cellular numbers would allow\nthe phreak's identity (and home address) to be discovered. This is especially\nimportant given that phone phreaks are breaking the law.\n\nPhreakers also use \"bridges\" to communicate live with one another. The term\n\"bridge\" originally referred to a group of telephone company test lines that\nwere bridged together giving the effect of a party-line. Eventually, all\nparty-lines, whether bridges or not, came to be known as bridges if primarily\npopulated by hackers and/or phreakers.\n\nThe popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better\nawareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice\nof stealing voice mailboxes less popular. To this day bridges are still very\npopular with phreakers yet, with the advent of VoIP, the use of telephone\ncompany-owned bridges has decreased slightly in favor of phreaker-owned\nconferences.\n\n### End of multi-frequency in the United States[edit]\n\nThe end of multi-frequency (MF) phreaking in the lower 48 United States\noccurred on June 15, 2006, when the last exchange in the contiguous United\nStates to use a \"phreakable\" MF-signalled trunk replaced the aging (yet still\nwell kept) N2 carrier with a T1 carrier. This exchange, located in Wawina\nTownship, Minnesota, was run by the Northern Telephone Company of\nMinnesota.^[29]\n\n### From 2010 to present[edit]\n\nRecent notable instances of phreaking involve hacking of VOIP systems. In\n2011, the government of the Philippines and the FBI arrested four hackers for\nphone phreaking through PBX hacking.^[30] In 2015, Pakistani officials\narrested a prominent phreaker who had amassed more than $50 million from PBX\nhacking activities.^[31]\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\nThis article may contain irrelevant references to popular culture.
