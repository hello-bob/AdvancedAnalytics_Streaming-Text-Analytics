Welcome to this week's Indiniche newsletter. Each week, I\nfeature tips and stories from successful self-made founders, share insights on\nbuilding great products, talk about growing your business, and showcase\nessential tools to help you build and scale better.\n\nIf you've found this newsletter helpful, please spread the word to your\nfriends and consider subscribing if you haven't yet\n\nWelcome to the inaugural edition of the indieniche newsletter! Thank you for\njoining us on this journey. This week, we shine a spotlight on a remarkable\nsuccess story: Loom.\n\nLoom, the brainchild of vinay, shahed and Joe, is a video communication tool\nthat captured the attention of many, eventually being acquired by Atlassian in\n2023 for a staggering $975 million.\n\nMy admiration for Loom dates back to its early days, long before the Atlassian\nacquisition. I've been an avid user, integrating it into my daily routine for\ntasks ranging from creating video walkthroughs of product features to sharing\nuser feedback with my team and fostering collaboration among teammates.\n\nRecently, I stumbled upon a tweet by the CEO reflecting on the company's\njourney. It struck a chord with me, prompting me to extract some valuable\nlessons that we can all apply to our own endeavors. Here are some key\ntakeaways that can enrich your product development journey...\n\n####\n\nPerfection Isn't Found at the Start\n\nThe journey of Loom exemplifies that there's rarely a perfect idea at the\noutset. In fact, they initially explored six different concepts before\nsettling on their path. Loom began its journey as a user-testing marketplace\nnamed Open Test. However, they soon realized that true validation and\nevolution come from listening to users over time.\n\n####\n\nYou Need to Pivot Quickly During Development\n\nLoom's founders swiftly recognized that for their user testing marketplace,\ncompanies were less interested in expert opinions and more focused on direct\nuser feedback. This realization was a pivotal moment.\n\n####\n\nFocus on Building a Great Product; Revenue Will Follow\n\nDuring their initial seven months, Loom generated a mere $600. However, they\nprioritized product refinement over chasing investments. This strategy taught\nthem the value of focusing on the product's quality.\n\n####\n\nIterate and Understand User Behaviour\n\nTo gather feedback, Loom cold-emailed 300 founders to use their Chrome\nextension. Unexpectedly, a research team at Harvard used Loom to summarise\ninsights from seven feedback videos, revealing unanticipated uses of the\nproduct\n\n####\n\nTiming Is Crucial\n\nLoom's emergence coincided with the rise of remote work, a period when\ncompanies prioritized collaboration tools. Recognizing this demand was pivotal\nto their success.\n\n####\n\nA Great Product Attracts Users\n\nAfter achieving product-market fit, Loom gained over 3,000 signups following\ntheir launch on Product Hunt, a significant leap from their previous user\nbase.\n\n####\n\nIntense Focus and Some Luck Are Essential\n\nLimit distractions while building, and focus on the product rather than\ninvestor meetings, and meet-ups that distract you from building, there is also\na shared amount of good luck needed in building.\n\nYou can find the link to the original tweet here, Thanks for reading through,\n\nReply to this email with your best product tip from Loom, I\u2019d love to hear\nfrom you .\n\n##\n\nIndie Tip of the Week\n\nThe indie tip of this week features how to find users who are facing your\nproduct problem on Reddit. This can help you get your first set of users\n\nI found this wonderful tip while browsing Reddit and it works like a charm\n\nOpen Google search and write a single keyword your product is popularly\nassociated with and put a double colon at the front alongside the Reddit\nwebsite\n\n(Product keyword: Reddit.com)\n\n##\n\nIndie product of the week\n\nCheck out rapidforms built by sidi jeddou.\n\nRapidforms simplifies form creation with stylish, embeddable forms. What sets\nit apart is its lifetime pricing of $199, a refreshing alternative to\nsubscription models like Typeform, Tallyforms, and co. Plus, its user-friendly\ninterface and advanced style editor make it a standout choice.
