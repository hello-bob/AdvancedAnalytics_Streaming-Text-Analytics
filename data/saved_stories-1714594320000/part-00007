This villa, near the town of Nola in southwestern Italy's\nCampania region, was found beneath a more recent, but still ancient building\nfrom the 2nd century.\n\nSpecific findings at the site, buried by multiple eruptions of Mount Vesuvius,\nsuggest it might have been the home of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus\n(Octavian), the founding emperor of the Roman Empire, as they coincide with\ncontemporary writings by known Roman writers Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio\nCassius.\n\nThis excavation is also significant as it was previously thought that only\nareas to the south of Vesuvius, famously the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii\nand Herculaneum, were heavily damaged, but this villa is located in the valley\nof Somma Vesuviana to the north.\n\nIn 1929, a farmer discovered, by accident, part of an abandoned building\nburied in a field. Archaeologists set to work excavating the site to reveal an\nextravagant villa that strongly hinted at being the residence of Augustus.\nHowever, the financial condition at that time impeded further exploration of\nthe site.\n\nThis situation changed in 2002 when the University of Tokyo began an\ninterdisciplinary project, in collaboration with local archaeologists, to\nfully excavate the villa and learn about this potentially significant area.\nSince then, many Roman objects, beautiful marble statues\u2014including two pieces\nfit enough to be displayed in a museum\u2014a huge building with various rooms,\nwall paintings, stucco reliefs and mosaics have been revealed.\n\nAn archaeologist stands next to a pillar, showing the magnitude of the ancient\ndwelling.

Credit: 2024 Institute for Advanced Global Studies CC-BY-ND\n\nSugiyama and his team revealed significant destruction in the northern area of\nMount Vesuvius, including damage from lava flows and pyroclastic surges, the\nbig explosions you see people running from in movies about volcanoes.\n\nAt the site of the villa during the 2002 excavations, volcanologists in the\nteam revealed the upper levels of the building were constructed by the mid-\nsecond century, and that the villa was built upon some of the partially\nobscured structures that came before it.\n\nThis finding indicates the resilience and rebuilding efforts of the people\nfollowing the disaster of A.D. 79 in the area of Somma Vesuviana, unlike\nPompeii, where the thick layers of volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows left the\ncity abandoned for many centuries.\n\n\"This kind of investigation is important for several reasons,\" said Sugiyama.\n\"Not only does it connect physical evidence with Augustus, who is mainly known\nthrough historic writings, but it also tells us about the local economy and\nsociety in that region at that time, which may have been more prosperous and\nsignificant than was previously thought.\n\n\"Learning about how ancient people recovered from disasters could inform how\nwe plan for such things today. It's challenging to carry out this kind of\narchaeology due to the heavy machinery needed to dig down to 15 meters and\nmove large boulders, and of course funding can often be an issue.\"\n\nProvided by University of Tokyo\n\nCitation: Did Vesuvius bury the home of the first Roman emperor?
