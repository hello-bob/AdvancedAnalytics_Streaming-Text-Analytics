It integrates with Apache DevLake to organize and aggregate\ndata from deployment and project management tooling like Gitlab, GitHub, Jira,\nand Jenkins. OpenDORA extracts meaningful insights from this data through its\nAPI, and renders dashboards within Backstage that provide insights on the\nteams' performance.\n\n## What are DORA metrics?\n\nDORA, short for DevOps Research and Assessment, is a research program that\nbegan in 2013 investigating ways to measure and improve software delivery,\noperations, team, and organizational performance. The program has collected\ndata from thousands of professionals and publishes findings in annual reports.\n\nThe key 4 DORA metrics are:\n\n  * Deployment frequency\n  * Lead time to changes\n  * Change failure rate\n  * Mean time to recovery\n\nToday, DORA metrics are widely accepted as a framework to determine stability\nand velocity of software teams. They provide a benchmark for determining the\nmaturity of software teams, helping set a path towards high performance.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nOpenDORA has largely a pluggable architecture, with some opinionated tooling\nchoices that we can talk about at length. Ingestor scripts running on schedule\nfetch data from external tools (Gitlab, Jira, etc) and push them to DevLake.\nThe devlake-go API exposes this data and provides endpoints to retrieve it\nfrom DevLake. The backstage-plugin utilizes this API and renders the results\non the Backstage frontend. This is a React plugin based on Material UI.\n\nThe resulting dashboard as rendered within Backstage:\n\nBelow is a description of the main components of this repo.\n\n### backstage-plugin\n\nThis is a Backstage plugin setup used to develop the frontend plugin.\n\nMore details\n\n### devlake-go\n\nThis contains the docker image and configuration scripts to setup DevLake to\nproperly ingest the DORA metrics from a GitLab repo and group them according\nto Backstage groups.\n\nMore details\n\n### dora-api-mock\n\nThis is a basic Spring application used to provide a mock for the DORA API\nmetric datapoints. This can be used to develop the frontend plugin without\nneeding to setup the local backend API.\n\nMore details\n\n## Setup\n\nGoto Plugin setup documentation and follow the steps to install and setup the\nplugin in your Backstage environment.\n\n## Contributor Guide\n\nThe OpenDORA team are looking for feedback and contributions. We encourage you\nto try out the Backstage plugin or other parts of the solution. Please create\nan issue on GitHub or reach out to us at opendora@devoteam.com.\n\nWe also accept pull requests for the code and documentation. Kindly use the\ndiscussions in the issue, and please read the contribution guidelines page.\n\n# DORA Plugin Development Environment\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n  * Docker Runtime\n  * Docker Compose\n\n## Configuring the Environment\n\n### Running the Dev Environment\n\nOpenDORA contains an initial Docker Compose with the services needed to test\nthe metrics in the dev's local environment.\n\n  * Make sure you have copied the .env.dist to .env. The .env is in .gitignore because it contains secrets and custom configuration\n\n    \n    \n    cp .env.dist .env\n\n  * Run the Docker environment with Docker Compose v2.*\n\n    \n    \n    docker compose --profile dev up -d\n\nIt may take some time for all the containers to be available. Healthchecks to\nmonitor this are not available right now.\n\n  * When using the development profile. There won't be a Devlake available to manage. Instead, It will use a mock-api to create responses. If you want to test Opendora with a Devlake instance, use the test profile.\n\n    \n    \n    docker compose --profile test up -d\n\n  * A Grafana container is also available in case you want to access the default dashboards delivered with Apache DevLake.\n\nTo start it, run the below:\n\n    \n    \n    docker compose --profile dashboard up -d\n\nAfter that, the services will be accessible on the below:\n\n  * DevLake Configuration UI: http://localhost:4000\n  * Grafana Dashboards (if started with profile dashboard): http://localhost:3002 (initial credential: admin/admin)\n\nFor more information about Docker Compose, check their official documentation:\nDocker Compose\n\n### Apache DevLake\n\nBefore running the Dev Environment, some minor configurations needs to be\nperformed. This development environment already provides default values for\nthe majority of them but at least an encryption key\n(DEVLAKE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET) needs to be provided.\n\nTo generate one, run the below:\n\n    \n    \n    openssl rand -base64 2000 | tr -dc 'A-Z' | fold -w 128 | head -n 1\n\nIt can be configured globally, and it will be picked up by the docker compose,\nor it can be added to the .env file.\n\nSome environment variables can be customised. The list below has all of them\nas well as their default values:\n\nVariable Name| Default Value  \n---|---  \nDEVLAKE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET  \nDEVLAKE_MYSQL_USER| merico  \nDEVLAKE_MYSQL_PASSWORD| merico  \nDEVLAKE_MYSQL_CONNECTION_URL|\nmysql://merico:merico@mysql:3306/lake?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True  \nDEVLAKE_ADMIN_USER| devlake  \nDEVLAKE_ADMIN_PASSWORD| merico  \n  \nFor more information on how to configure Apache DevLake with docker compose,\ncheck their official reference: Launch DevLake with Docker Compose.\n\nAlso, make sure to check DevLake's Configuration documentation to correctly\nconfigure the connection, data scope, etc. For the DORA metrics, the most\nimportant part is the transformations, so make sure to configure it\naccordingly (job names) for the metrics to be properly calculated.\n\n## About\n\nTeam performance insights for your organization.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\n### Security policy\n\nSecurity policy\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n37 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n3 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n4 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 5\n\nv0.4.0 Latest\n\nApr 8, 2024\n\n\\+ 4 releases\n\n## Packages 3\n\n  * opendora/opendora-api\n  * opendora/open-dora-helm-chart\n  * open-dora-backstage-plugin\n\n## Contributors 9\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 61.4%\n  * TypeScript 26.8%\n  * Java 4.5%\n  * Makefile 2.6%\n  * Dockerfile 1.7%\n  * Smarty 1.4%\n  * Other 1.6%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
