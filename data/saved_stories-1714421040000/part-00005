But first, a little\nbackground to lead into the story.\n\n##\n\nUsenet\n\nIn the 90s, before eBay, a common way to sell things online was to do a Usenet\nauction. For those that don\u2019t know, Usenet was one of the original parts of\nthe internet that predated the World Wide Web (which is what most refer to as\nthe internet today). Usenet was essentially a giant message board, with\nvarious groups using syntax similar to today\u2019s domain names. For example,\nthere were many Atari-related groups within comp.sys.atari, such as\ncomp.sys.atari.8bit and comp.sys.atari.st. Atari 2600 game stuff could be\nfound in a slightly different area: alt.atari.2600. If you were into BASIC,\nyou might have liked alt.lang.basic.\n\nAnyway, there were groups for just about any topic. Google Groups use to\nprovide access to Usenet, but that shut down recently. I have not accessed\nUsenet in 25 years, so I don\u2019t know much about it these days. My understanding\nis that it is not used much and its usages might be less than legal, but it is\nstill around.\n\nI did stumble across UsenetArchives.com which seems to have archives of many\nareas. Here are the two main Atari ones:\n\ncomp.sys.atari.st archive\n\ncomp.sys.atari.8bit archive\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to read through some of the posts from the early days of the\nST to see what sort of things were being discussed. I didn\u2019t see a way to\nreally search things, though.\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to Usenet auctions.\n\nGoto 10: The Newsletter for Atari Enthusiasts is a reader-supported\npublication.

A Usenet auction was essentially a usenet\npost with a list of items you were selling. In my case, I would buy Atari-\nrelated things at flea markets (cartridge games, mostly) and list them in a\nUsenet post. There would be starting bids next to each item.\n\nPeople would then email bids to you. Typically once a day you would review all\nthe emails, sort out the high bids for each item and then do another Usenet\nauction post the next day. An auction would go for about a week as I recall.\n\nYes, this was all as tedious as it sounds. But it worked. When the auction\nended, each winning bidder would be notified via email of their total with\nshipping and then they would have to send the money by mailing a check. This\nwas all incredibly time consuming and took forever. It took a few days for the\nchecks to start arriving, then you had to take them to the bank (waiting in\nline), there were no ATM deposits that I recall back then. After that was the\npacking and delivery to the post office, which also required waiting in line\nas online shipping labels were not a thing back then either. Looking back, it\nhardly seems to have been worth it.\n\n> Essentially eBay was founded as a way to simplify Usenet auctions. Although\n> eBay started in 1995, I didn\u2019t start using it until 1998 and it definitely\n> made things much, much easier.\n\nShare\n\nI didn\u2019t do a lot of Usenet auctions. It was more of a minor side-hustle back\nthen. But I remember showing my Dad how I did them and he got hooked. He would\ngo to garage and yard sales in his area and buy up anything that was related\nto retro computers and video games to resell. He would then spend hours and\nhours creating Usenet auctions to sell stuff.\n\nWhat my Dad found in his office was a letter he had mailed to someone that had\nwon one of his auctions for a label for the Berzerk Atari 2600 cartridge. Here\nis the opening paragraph:\n\n> Hi.\n>\n> You are now the proud owner of a new BERZERK label. It was printed on Kodak\n> Picture paper instead of the self-sticking Avery Ink Jet label paper. This\n> means that it will have to be glued onto the cart, however, the picture is\n> of a much higher quality and sharpness. I tried to be very careful when\n> cutting out the labels, but some of them may need some more trimming\n> depending on your tastes. I had a loads of fun hours doing them and hope\n> that you will have as many fun hours talking about them. Enjoy and please\n> let me know if you have any questions concerning the new Berzerk label.\n>\n> For your reading pleasure, I've included a 'BERZERK' original storyline\n> authored by me and I hope you enjoy it, as much as I did making it up. While\n> reading it, you will see mention of many 2600 games in the text, none of\n> which should be shown more than once. See if you can find all of the over 50\n> games that are mentioned in the story. Please note that for the sake of the\n> story, I have had to make some of the Game names take on a plural form. Take\n> care and have fun during the Holidays, but most important, have a very safe\n> and happy Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n>\n> Larry\n\nMy Dad does not recall specifics about this or when it was actually sent, but\nthe header at the top of the printout shows this file path:\n\n> d:\\download\\text\\berzerk-lab-storyline\n\nWith that header, I\u2019m fairly confident this was written in around 1996-1998.\nBecause that path has a filename that is longer than 8 characters it could not\nhave been an Atari ST path. That means it had to have been done during the\nperiod of time when he was using a Windows computer. I also think this was not\nthe result of an eBay auction, but that is more of a gut feeling at this\npoint.\n\nI will post the full Berzerk story written by my Dad in part 2 on Monday.\n\nGoto 10: The Newsletter for Atari Enthusiasts is a reader-supported\npublication.
