Cameras flashed. Politicians celebrated a purported economic\nvictory: an upstart Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer, VinFast (NASDAQ:\n$VFS), was building a factory in North Carolina.\n\nVinFast pledged to bring $4 billion in investment and 7,500 new jobs to\nChatham County over the plant\u2019s first five years. In return, local and state\ngovernments, as well as a nonprofit, agreed to provide incentives of $1.2\nbillion.\n\n\u201cThis VinFast factory will create thousands of good-paying jobs in our state,\u201d\nsaid Roy Cooper, North Carolina\u2019s governor, at the groundbreaking last July.\nWhen VinFast first announced plans for the factory, back in March 2022,\nPresident Biden tweeted about it, calling the company\u2019s decision to\nmanufacture electric vehicles in North Carolina \u201cthe latest example of my\neconomic strategy at work.\u201d\n\nMore than two years later, little progress is visible at the roughly\n1,800-acre site beyond partial foundation work. When a Hunterbrook Media\nreporter visited the site on two weekdays in February, no construction workers\nwere present.\n\n\u201cWe continue to make progress on our proposed North Carolina manufacturing\nsite,\u201d a VinFast spokesperson told Hunterbrook Media, saying the company\u2019s\nplan \u201cremains to complete principal construction on the site before the end of\n2025.\u201d When the project was first announced, it was slated to open this year.\n\nIn a statement to the Raleigh News & Observer published last week, a county\nspokesperson said that, at the moment, \u201cno construction is being done.\u201d\nShortly after the News & Observer\u2019s article was published, detailing the lack\nof progress at the site with the help of drone imagery, VinFast filed a new\nconstruction plan with Chatham County.\n\nAn EV plant 300 miles southwest tells a different story. A few months after\nVinFast\u2019s North Carolina factory was announced, Hyundai began building a $7.6\nbillion facility in Ellabell, Georgia.\n\nAt that site, steel beams cover the 2,900 acres. Some structures \u201chave roofs\nand floors, and exterior wall panels have begun to go up,\u201d according to the\nAP. Both companies originally planned for their facilities to be up and\nrunning in 2025 \u2014 but Hyundai\u2019s timeline has been accelerated. VinFast\u2019s,\nmeanwhile, has been pushed back.\n\nTimelapse of satellite imagery: Hyundai facility on left; VinFast facility on\nright\n\nSince entering the competitive global electric-vehicle market in early 2023,\nVinFast has issued a steady stream of ambitious announcements. Besides the\nNorth Carolina factory, it has announced a $2 billion plant in India and a\n$2.1 billion investment to establish a presence in Indonesia.\n\nBut after a months-long Hunterbrook Media investigation spanning satellite\nimagery, AIS data, trade records, and on-the-ground reporting in multiple U.S.\nstates and multiple continents, it\u2019s unclear who is going to buy the cars \u2014\nand how VinFast is going to pay for these expansions.\n\nVinFast\u2019s central manufacturing facility in Hai Phong, which boasts annual\nproduction capacity of 300,000 cars, delivered fewer than 35,000 automobiles\nlast year, just 12% of capacity and short of its target of 50,000.\n\nMore than 70% of those deliveries were to other companies owned by VinFast\u2019s\nChief Executive Pham Nhat Vuong, according to SEC filings that were reported\non by Reuters earlier this month. They accounted for more than 90% of\nVinfast\u2019s total sales revenues. VinFast reported total revenues of $1.1\nbillion from vehicle sales in 2023. It said it received $839 million in\nrevenues from sales of vehicles delivered to GSM, and approximately 14% of\ntotal revenues of EV sales (or $154 million) from sales to customers applying\nVinFast vouchers provided by Vinhomes.\n\nThe new plant in North Carolina would be able to produce an additional 150,000\nvehicles. To date, VinFast has shipped 3,118 cars to the US. Hunterbrook Media\nwas able to track the activity of VinFast\u2019s dedicated roll-on roll-off (RO/RO)\ntransport vessel, the Silver Queen, utilizing both AIS and overhead imagery.\nThe Silver Queen made three voyages to North America, delivering 999 VF8s to\nthe U.S. on its first voyage in December of 2022, 1098 VF8s to the U.S. and\n781 to Canada in May of 2023, and a final delivery of 1021 VF8s to the U.S. in\nNovember 2023. After completing this final delivery, the Silver Queen resumed\nnormal operations, plying the waters of the Western Pacific. Hunterbrook Media\nwas able to confirm that since the November 2023 delivery, the Silver Queen\ndid not make another port call in Vinfast\u2019s export hub, Haiphong, nor did it\nreturn to a US port. Of those, only 265 had been sold as of December,\naccording to EV registration data, leading VinFast to offer what Tom\nMcParland, an auto blogger, called a \u201cdeath spiral of discounts\u201d in a column\nfor Jalopnik, an industry publication.\n\nEarlier this year, VinFast revealed global reservations of its two signature\nvehicles \u2014 which are non-binding for the customer and can be refunded \u2014 had\nbeen scaled down to about 14,700 from about 65,000.\n\nVinFast\u2019s struggles have come as its vehicles have received abysmal reviews\nfrom international press. A VinFast critic in Vietnam, meanwhile, has been\narrested \u2014 and negative posts about the company seem to have disappeared from\nthe internet entirely, including a YouTube video featuring a field full of\nvehicles gathering dirt that VinFast had sold to a related party.\n\nHunterbrook Media\u2019s review of satellite imagery showed that many of these\nvehicles had been stored in the field for months.\n\nThe company is also up against a difficult environment for the entire electric\nvehicle sector. Demand in the U.S. slowed substantially, while globally China\nhas been aggressively exporting EVs at low prices.\n\nIndustry leader Tesla (NASDAQ: $TSLA) reported disappointing earnings and has\nseen its stock drop about 40% since the start of the year. Legacy automakers\nlike Ford (NYSE: $F) have slowed down their transition away from internal\ncombustion engines. Many new entrants are struggling, such as once-hyped\nFisker Inc. (formerly NYSE: $FSR, delisted in March), which is reportedly\nflirting with bankruptcy, and Rivian (NASDAQ: $RIVN), which is pausing the\nconstruction of a new facility.\n\nVinFast has also seen its share price plummet. \u201cThe EV market has absolutely\ntaken a dive,\u201d says McParland, who in addition to writing for Jalopnik runs an\nauto consulting business highlighted by the New York Times. \u201cIf Ford is\nstruggling to sell EVs, and everybody knows Ford, what chance does this\nVietnamese automaker have?\u201d\n\nIn the weeks following the North Carolina groundbreaking, VinFast used a\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) to list on Nasdaq with a $23\nbillion valuation. Its stock initially soared, with the company at one point\nreaching a $200 billion market capitalization, larger than Boeing. But its\nvalue has since declined by over 95%.\n\nInstead of slowing down and reassessing its plans like its peers, VinFast has\npromised to double down.\n\nThe company has said it will deliver 100,000 vehicles worldwide in 2024, more\nthan double its 2023 sales, while expanding to 50 countries. VinFast has said\nit expects to sell 750,000 cars annually by 2026, with the help of its North\nCarolina factory.\n\n## Most VinFast cars sold to taxi and real estate companies owned by its\nparent company Vingroup or CEO\n\nVinFast founder Pham Nhat Vuong, 55, became Vietnam\u2019s first billionaire in\n2013 as a successful real estate developer. Vuong\u2019s conglomerate, Vingroup,\nhas since expanded across sectors, from education to healthcare, becoming a\nhousehold name in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2017, Vingroup entered the auto industry \u2014 and in the years since, the\ncompany and its CEO have reportedly dedicated more than $11 billion to\nbuilding VinFast. After going through several chief executives, Vuong named\nhimself VinFast\u2019s fourth CEO in three years in January.\n\nTwo of VinFast\u2019s largest customers are owned by Vuong or Vingroup: electric\ntaxi company Green and Smart Mobility (GSM) and real estate company Vinhomes.\n\nGSM, which is 95% owned by Vuong, was responsible for the majority of\nVinFast\u2019s sales last year, an arrangement that has received scrutiny. Until\nthe recent investigation by Reuters, however, VinFast\u2019s relationship with\nVinhomes had received almost no attention \u2014 despite EV sales to VinHome\ncustomers accounting for approximately 14% of 2023 EV revenue, according to a\nMarch SEC filing.\n\nVinhomes said on its website that it had given away 1,000 VinFast cars for\nfree to new homeowners. Vinhomes also offered its customers five years of free\ntaxi service through GSM.\n\nScreenshot of a Facebook post offering a Vinhomes deal; identifying\ninformation has been cropped out.\n\nIn a press release, VinFast said it saw \u201cstrong revenue growth\u201d last year,\nwith a 374% increase in total EV sales from 2022. But the sales increase to\nbuyers other than companies owned by Vuong is only around 33% \u2014 off a small\nbase, according to Hunterbrook Media\u2019s calculations based on security\ndisclosures. VinFast said total sales in 2023 of 34,855 were a 374% increase\nfrom 2022, which means about 7,353 EVs were delivered in 2022. In 2023, about\n9,759 cars were delivered to unrelated third parties, based on its claim that\n72% of total car sales were to related parties.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company reported a total of 9,689 EV\ndeliveries \u2014 a decrease of 28% from the previous quarter. More than half those\ndeliveries were to other Vingroup companies.\n\n## Hunterbrook Media research suggests VinFast has significantly\nunderperformed sales estimates in the United States and Europe\n\nVinFast has had a harder time selling cars outside of Vietnam.\n\nOut of the 3,118 EVs the company shipped to the U.S. last year, only 265\nVinFast vehicle registrations \u2014 a common proxy for estimating car sales \u2014 were\nrecorded across the U.S. in 2023, according to an S&P report. The state of\nCalifornia\u2019s database reports 445 VinFast vehicle registrations \u2014 but\nclarifies their database does not \u201cidentify a vehicle registration as a \u2018new\nvehicle sold,\u2019\u201d suggesting they may also include leased vehicles.\n\nIn February 2024, Hunterbrook Media visited the California port terminal where\nVinFast\u2019s cars have been offloaded in the United States. Hundreds of vehicles\nremained parked there, months after the last shipment arrived. Long-term\nstorage by the ocean risks corrosion and paint wear. There have been no new\nshipments since, according to AIS data.\n\nSource: Hunterbrook Media\n\nVinFast appears to be behind its schedule outside the U.S. as well.\n\nIn 2023, Canada was the only country outside of Vietnam and the U.S. where\nVinFast reported sales, with a total of $24.2 million in revenue. The company\nhas delayed its expansion to Europe \u2014 where it made its first shipment earlier\nthis year, despite having announced plans to deliver 3,000 vehicles to the\ncontinent in 2023. VinFast appears to be well short of its target number of\nshowrooms as well. The company said it would have 30 showrooms in California\nalone by the end of 2022; only 17 are open across the United States as of\nApril. In Europe, VinFast said it planned to establish 50 retail outlets\nacross Germany, France, and the Netherlands, but has so far only opened 13.\n\n## Auto trade reviewers pan VinFast and expert says the rollout was rushed \u2014\nas the company offered the \u201ccheapest lease in America\u201d to boost demand\n\nVinFast has received disastrous reviews of its EVs from the American\nautomotive media.\n\nMotortrend titled their review \u201c2023 VinFast VF8 First Drive: Return to\nSender,\u201d Road & Track, \u201cFirst Drive: The 2023 VinFast VF8 Is Unacceptable,\u201d\nand Inside EVs, \u201c2023 VinFast VF8 City Edition First Drive Review: Yikes.\u201d\nReported problems ranged from \u201cflaky turn signals\u201d to \u201csuspension that induces\nnausea,\u201d according to a Jalopnik round up.\n\nVinfast had taken unorthodox steps to win favor from the auto press. Before\nits initial wave of bad reviews, VinFast offered $100 in prepaid debit cards\nto journalists in the United States testing out the vehicles. Matt Farah, an\nauto podcaster, says he was offered an expenses-paid trip to Vietnam to visit\nthe company\u2019s headquarters, plus $10,000 for his time.\n\nFarah\u2019s response? \u201cOf course not, that sounds fucking shady,\u201d he said.\n\nTu Le, Founder and Managing Director of the consultancy firm Sino Auto\nInsights, told Hunterbrook Media that delivering vehicles to the United States\nbefore they had been tested more comprehensively was part of a chain of\ncritical errors VinFast made in its expansion to the United States.\n\n\u201cTrying to sell the first set of EVs they\u2019d ever built from the Hai Phong\nfactory before they could dial in the quality and reliability was a major\nmistake,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThey\u2019d invited a gaggle of journos to Vietnam\nto visit and test drive their vehicles. Most journos were not impressed. That\nshould\u2019ve been an indication that they should slow down and get things right.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people spending $50K on something want to trust the brand, especially\nwhen families and children are involved,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the initial criticism, VinFast has said it has made several improvements\nto its vehicles, earning the company marginally better reviews.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, VinFast has also swiftly and proactively refined its\nmanufacturing processes to prevent the recurrence of similar issues in the\nfuture,\u201d the company said in a statement to Hunterbrook Media. \u201cAs a\nrelatively new brand, we highly value market feedback and suggestions, and we\nare fully committed to delivering exceptional products and services.\u201d\n\nVinFast also cited its first quarter increase in sales in the U.S. \u2014 but did\nnot mention that in January, the company began offering steep discounts.\n\nAccording to a lease offer received by a Hunterbrook Media reporter during a\nvisit to VinFast\u2019s recently opened dealership in Apex, N.C., the discounts\namounted to more than $20,000 off list prices, including a $7,500 rebate to\ncompensate for the fact that VinFast cars don\u2019t qualify for federal EV tax\nincentives. The VF8, VinFast\u2019s electric SUV-crossover, was being leased for\n$249 per month. The VF8 also comes in a Plus model, which was being leased for\n$299 per month, according to the lease offers obtained by Hunterbook Media.\nThe lease deal, which was originally intended to last until Feb. 29, 2024, was\nextended in North Carolina until all 2023 models are sold from the dealership.\nThe dealership officially sold out of its 2023 models \u2014 around 50 vehicles \u2014\nin early April, according to a salesman. The new lease offer for the VF8 is\n$429 per month for the Eco and $579 per month for the Plus model, according to\nthe dealership\u2019s website. According to a lease offer given to Hunterbrook\nMedia, a VF8 Eco would cost about $2,200 down for a 36-month lease at 10,000\nmiles per year. That means the lease offer includes a $15,488 discount being\nswallowed by VinFast, plus a $7,500 rebate to make up for the fact that\nVinFast doesn\u2019t qualify for EV tax incentives. The implied value of the\nvehicle after the car is leased is listed at $19,352. The North Carolina\ndealership, which opened Dec. 28, 2023, says it has leased at least 38 cars\nvia the discount.\n\nBased on a review of 500 lease deals, this made the VF8 the \u201ccheapest lease in\nAmerica,\u201d according to a Jalopnik write-up of the automotive research company\nCarsDirect\u2019s report.\n\n## Criticism of VinFast appears to be monitored and suppressed in Vietnam amid\nalleged arrests, a burning car, and lots filled with VinFast vehicles\ncollecting dust\n\nIn 2021, VinFast reported a customer to the police for making what it said\nwere \u201cuntrue\u201d comments on YouTube. That video was later deleted.\n\nIn December 2023, Sonnie Tran, a blogger in Vietnam who had been critical of\nVinFast, was detained and allegedly interrogated for 35 hours by law\nenforcement. His phone and computer were reportedly seized before his release.\n\nIn January, numerous local outlets in Vietnam reported on a VinFast internal\ncombustion vehicle on fire outside a courthouse in Hanoi. Within hours, these\narticles appear to have been pulled from the Vietnamese websites \u2014 although\nfootage of the vehicle fire has survived on other social media sites.\nHunterbrook Media had seen these articles when they were live \u2014 then the links\nstopped working.\n\nA screenshot of a Google result for an article that is no longer accessible.\n\nThat same month, a Vietnamese blogger posted a video on YouTube of a giant\nfield in Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, a small city near Hanoi, filled with hundreds of blue\nVinFast vehicles that appeared to belong to GSM. Weeds lined the wheels, as\nthe cars collected dust.\n\nScreenshots of the YouTube video taken by Hunterbrook Media before it\ndisappeared.\n\nWithin days of the video being posted to YouTube, it was taken offline \u2014 and\nno longer accessible to the public.\n\nBut Hunterbrook Media \u2014 with help from the Bellingcat geolocation community \u2014\ntracked down the location featured in the missing video. Hunterbrook Media\u2019s\nresearch found that this was one of multiple sites where vehicles sold to GSM\nappear to have been parked for months at a time.\n\nAs of Feb. 11, 2023, 210 GSM taxis were parked in the complex. They had been\nin the area since at least December, satellite imagery showed.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Airbus DS 2024\n\nHunterbrook Media also found the location of another GSM lot along the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed\nMinh \u2013 Long Th\u00e0nh \u2013 D\u1ea7u Gi\u00e2y Expressway, based on comments in a VinFast\nsubreddit. Satellite imagery of the location shows a lot filled with upwards\nof 480 GSM-owned VinFast vehicles as of December 2023.\n\nSource: \u00a9CNES 2023, Distribution Airbus DS\n\nHunterbrook Media confirmed the lot was filled with GSM vehicles three times\nin the past six months.\n\n## From \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d: VinFast\u2019s parent company, Vingroup, struggles\nto raise capital as Vietnamese government tightens scrutiny of conglomerates\n\nDespite VinFast\u2019s poor sales, the company has been described as having \u201cnearly\nunlimited resources\u201d due to its backing from Pham and Vingroup Joint Stock\nCo., one of the largest conglomerates in Vietnam.\n\nVinFast also has repeatedly assured its investors of Vingroup\u2019s financial\ncommitments to the company, amid VinFast\u2019s losses and difficulties in raising\nsignificant capital from third-party investors. Even the initial public\noffering \u2013 VinFast\u2019s debut to public markets \u2013 barely raised the minimum $30\nmillion that VinFast\u2019s SPAC partner Black Spade had agreed to, because the\nvast majority of investors cashed out ahead of the merger, according to\nBloomberg. In 2023, VinFast announced a subscription agreement of up to $1\nbillion with an investor named Yorkville Advisors, but only drew $30 million\nfrom the facility, according the VinFast\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call. (See: Link\nto document in Hunterbrook Media\u2019s public share drive.) ^ But Vingroup\u2019s\nfinances might be finite.\n\nIn 2023, amid negative cash flows and stagnating profits, Vingroup took on an\nadditional $1.6 billion in borrowings. Vingroup reported a total of $4.74\nbillion (115,658,072 million VND) in drawdown of loans from credit facilities,\nof which $3.18 billion (77,620,096 million VND) was used to repay existing\nloans, resulting in a $1.6 billion net increase in loan balance. These figures\nwere converted from the Vietnamese dong (VND) to U.S. dollars using the\nDecember 31, 2023, exchange rate of 0.000041 USD/VND. At the same time, profit\nfrom property sales \u2014 by far Vingroup\u2019s largest revenue-generating segment \u2014\nflatlined, despite a 44% jump in revenues last year that dominated headlines.\n\nSource: Vingroup Earnings Statements\n\nIn August 2023, Vingroup\u2019s bond offering to the Vietnamese public, aimed at\nraising funds for VinFast \u2014 at a record-high coupon rate of 14.5% to 15% \u2014\nonly managed to raise 35% of its subscription target, $28 million. The coupon\nrate exceeds the rates on all other bonds issued by VinFast or Vingroup on\nVinFast\u2019s behalf that were disclosed by VinFast in SEC filings, which range\nfrom 4% to 14.5%. As of the end of 2023, Vingroup\u2019s average borrowing cost was\n10.6%.\n\nAt the same time, the Vietnamese government is tightening regulations on\ncorporate bonds and tasking banks with resolving bad debts, potentially adding\nfurther strains on Vingroup\u2019s efforts to raise capital for Vingroup for its\ncarmaking subsidiary.\n\nThe Vietnamese government, meanwhile, is also doubling down on a corruption\ncrackdown that has been dubbed the \u201cblazing furnace.\u201d Over the last two years,\nthe government has made numerous high-profile arrests of the country\u2019s\nwealthiest individuals \u2014 some of whom headed major companies, especially in\nreal estate.\n\nIn early April, Trinh Van Quyet, a real estate tycoon who often vied with\nVuong for the title of the richest man in Vietnam, was indicted on stock\nmanipulation charges.\n\nAfter Trinh\u2019s initial arrest two years earlier, his FLC Group was forced to\nrestructure and refocus on its core business in real estate, giving up its\nshares in an airline business \u2014 a pet project of Trinh\u2019s that remained\nunprofitable and has cut most of its flight routes amid bankruptcy concerns \u2014\nto recover funds for its debtors.\n\nLe Hong Hiep, a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program of the ISEAS-\nYusof Ishak Institute, told Hunterbrook Media he believes Vuong is safe from\nthis campaign.\n\nThe Vietnamese government\u2019s backing of VinFast \u2014 at least initially \u2014 suggests\nits interest in seeing the company succeed. And it\u2019s widely known that\nVinhomes has received preferential treatment from the government over the\nyears.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be targeted because ... they are the darling of\nVietnam,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government provides support for them and if they\nwanted to target Vingroup, they would have done so earlier.\u201d\n\nHiep, however, is skeptical that the Vietnamese government would ever step in\nto support VinFast financially.\n\n\u201cThere has been no case in which the government has bailed out a private\ncompany,\u201d said Hiep. \u201cThey have bailed out state-owned companies, but no\nprivate company.\u201d\n\nTu Le, the auto industry analyst, said he \u201ccan see VinFast raising some\ncapital to keep going, but not enough to resolve all the issues they currently\nhave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of Vinfast\u2019s main challenges currently,\u201d he added, \u201cis that if people\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be around, they will avoid your product.\u201d\n\nMcParland compared VinFast to another auto company that has failed to meet\nexpectations: Fisker, the EV upstart that at one point had a market cap of\nover $6 billion valuation but was delisted from the NYSE earlier this year.\n\n\u201cYes, [Fisker] was a small niche brand, but amongst folks who were plugged\ninto luxury EVs and wanted something a little different than a Tesla or\nwhatever, it was an interesting alternative. People would at least consider\nFisker,\u201d McParland said. \u201cWhereas I don\u2019t know of anybody that would even\nremotely consider a VinFast.\u201d\n\nBlake Spendley joined Hunterbrook from the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA),\nwhere he led investigations as a Research Specialist for the Marine Corps and\nUS Navy.
