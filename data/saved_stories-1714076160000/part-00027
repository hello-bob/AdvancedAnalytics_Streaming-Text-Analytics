The\nlarval form of wax moths, these pale wriggling grubs feed on the wax that bees\nuse to make their honeycomb. For beekeepers, the pests are something to\nswiftly get rid of without a second thought.\n\nBut in 2017 molecular biologist Federica Bertocchini, who at the time was\nresearching the embryonic development of vertebrates at the Spanish National\nResearch Council, stumbled on a potentially game-changing discovery about\nthese creatures.\n\nBertocchini, an amateur beekeeper, threw some of the waxworms in a plastic bag\nafter cleaning her hive, and left them alone. A short time later, she noticed\nthe worms had started producing small holes in the plastic, which begun\ndegrading as soon as it touched the worms' mouths.\n\n\"It was a real eureka moment \u2013 it was brilliant,\" Bertocchini says about the\ninitial discovery and the realisation of what it meant. \"It was the beginning\nof the story. The beginning of the research project, of everything.\"\n\nThe worms were doing something that we as humans find remarkably difficult to\ndo: break down plastic. (Read about the human effort to break plastic down\nthrough \"chemical recycling\".) Not only that, but the worms appeared to be\ndigesting the plastic as though it was food.\n\nWatch the video below from BBC Earth Science to see the worms at work.\n\nBertocchini and her fellow researchers began collecting the liquid excreted\nfrom the worms' mouths. They found this \"saliva\" contained two critical\nenzymes, Ceres and Demeter \u2013 named after the Roman and Greek goddesses of\nagriculture, respectively \u2013 which were able to oxidise the polyethylene in the\nplastic, essentially breaking down that material on contact.\n\nPlastic planet\n\nToday, 400 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced globally every year.\n\nOf that, 19 to 23 million tonnes (about 2,000 garbage trucks' worth) seeps\ninto aquatic ecosystems, where much of it is colonised by microorganisms or\neaten by animals.\n\nPlastics take anywhere from several decades to centuries to fully break down.\n\nLetting these worms loose in a plastic-polluted environment could be dangerous\nto ecosystems, especially given their ability to destroy bees' hives, as\nBertocchini notes. But she's hopeful that the enzymes these worms produce\ncould help tackle the world's plastic pollution crisis.\n\nBertocchini is now chief technology officer at bioresearch startup\nPlasticentropy France, working with a team to study the viability of scaling\nup these enzymes for widespread use in degrading plastic.\n\n\"The big-picture goal is to be able to apply these enzymes to the plastic\nwaste,\" says Bertocchini. \"I really want this discovery and technology to be\ndeveloped and transformed into a solution that we could use globally.\"\n\nPromising enzymes could be found in a number of different organisms. Some\nfungi and bacteria are known to digest plastics, but it is much rarer in\ncomplex animals. In 2022, another invertebrate was discovered to have a taste\nfor plastic \u2013 the \"superworm\" Zophobas morio, which can put on weight from a\ndiet of polystyrene.\n\nMore like this:\n\n  * Visualising the Great Pacific Garbage Patch\n  * The world's first 'infinite' plastic\n  * A neglected protein-rich 'superfood'\n\nNumerous global measures will be needed to reduce our reliance on and\nconsumption of plastic. To this end, many countries have pledged to help\nreduce single-use plastic production and use, and a global plastics treaty is\nexpected in late 2024.\n\nBut if enzymes like these can eventually be mass-produced to break down\nplastic, there could perhaps also be a role to play by the tiny critters that\nfirst munched their way out of Bertocchini's plastic bag.\n\nIf you haven't already, check out the video above from BBC Earth Science's\nPlanet Fix to learn more about how worms, bacteria and enzymes can digest\nplastic.\n\n\\--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to\nthe Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked\nselection of features and insights.\n\nEarth\n\nFeatures\n\nFuture Planet\n\nInsect\n\nPlastics\n\nPollution\n\nScience\n\nRelated\n\n## The scavengers stalking the world's cities\n\n1 day ago\n\nFuture\n\n## There's no need to shower every day \u2013 here's why\n\n1 day ago\n\nCulture\n\n## Is China sinking under its concrete boom?\n\n2 days ago\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n30 mins ago\n\n## The 1980 song that prophesied the end of apartheid\n\nReleased during a grim period in its country's history, the groundbreaking\ncrossover hit Paradise Road by black female group Joy promised \"better days\"\nfor South Africa.\n\n30 mins ago\n\nCulture\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## The stunning Tuscan town even Italians don't know\n\nThe winner of this year's national \"Borgo dei Borghi\" competition blends its\nmedieval past with an eye-catching contemporary art scene and wandering\nrobots.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n5 hrs ago\n\n## Why societies become more vulnerable over time\n\nPre-modern states and civilisations became more prone to collapse as time\npassed \u2013 a pattern that holds lessons for today's ageing global powers.\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nFuture\n\n22 hrs ago\n\n## Paris's most authentic and delicious bistros\n\nFrom classic steak frites at Bistrot Paul Bert to French onion soup at La\nPoule au Pot, these seven diehard favourites will never go out of fashion.\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n1 day ago\n\n## The return of the US' sandcastle championships\n\nFor three days in April, thousands of people descend on tiny Port Aransas,\nTexas, from all over the world when it becomes the epicentre of the sand-\nsculpting universe.\n\n1 day ago\n\nTravel\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
