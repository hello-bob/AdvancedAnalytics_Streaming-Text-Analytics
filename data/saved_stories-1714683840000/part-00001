SIGN UP HERE>\n\nFor nearly 10 years, WhatsApp\u2019s chat messages have been end-to-end encrypted,\nmeaning they can\u2019t be read by anyone except the sender and the receiver.\nDrawing on an open-source encryption system developed by Signal, WhatsApp\nbegan the move shortly after it was acquired by Facebook in 2014. For the most\npart, its encryption has been running quietly in the background ever since.\nThere have been legal challenges, but for the world\u2019s largest source of end-\nto-end encrypted communications, the past decade has been remarkably drama-\nfree.\n\nBut WhatsApp is currently in the middle of its biggest legal challenge yet \u2014\nand it\u2019s a serious one. IT rules passed by India in 2021 require services like\nWhatsApp to maintain \u201ctraceability\u201d for all messages, allowing authorities to\nfollow forwarded messages to the \u201cfirst originator\u201d of the text.\n\nIn a Delhi High Court proceeding last Thursday, WhatsApp said it would be\nforced to leave the country if the court required traceability, as doing so\nwould mean breaking end-to-end encryption. It\u2019s a common stance for encrypted\nchat services generally, and WhatsApp has made this threat before \u2014 most\nnotably in a protracted legal fight in Brazil that resulted in intermittent\nbans. But as the Indian government expands its powers over online speech, the\nthreat of a full-scale ban is closer than it\u2019s been in years.\n\n> \u201cThere is no way to predict which message a government would want to\n> investigate in the future\u201d\n\nThe traceability requirement has been the subject of ongoing legal challenges\nsince it was first instituted, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation\ndescribing it as \u201ca threat to expression and privacy online.\u201d There are also\npractical concerns about how such a system would deal with screenshots or\nslight modifications, raising the real possibility that full compliance is\nsimply impossible.\n\nWhatsApp has already taken some measures to deal with harmful messages,\ninstituting limits on message-forwarding and strengthening systems for\nreporting spam or misinformation. But the current system can only deal with\nmessages as they\u2019re reported by users, essentially blocking copies of a\nmessage one at a time.\n\nLike what you're reading? Sign up to our newsletter featuring the latest on\nU.S. tech giants and their impact outside the West.\n\nTracing the copies back to their source would require building a new layer of\nsurveillance into WhatsApp. \u201cThere is no way to predict which message a\ngovernment would want to investigate in the future,\u201d the company wrote in a\nblog post in 2021. \u201cTo comply, messaging services would have to keep giant\ndatabases of every message you send, or add a permanent identity stamp \u2014 like\na fingerprint \u2014 to private messages with friends, family, colleagues, doctors,\nand businesses.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the courts will respond to WhatsApp\u2019s ultimatum, but\nthey\u2019ll have to take it seriously. WhatsApp is used by more than half a\nbillion people in India \u2014 not just as a chat app, but as a doctor\u2019s office, a\ncampaigning tool, and the backbone of countless small businesses and service\njobs. There\u2019s no clear competitor to fill its shoes, so if the app is shut\ndown in India, much of the digital infrastructure of the nation would simply\ndisappear. Being forced out of the country would be bad for WhatsApp, but it\nwould be disastrous for everyday Indians.\n\nReached for comment, a Meta representative emphasized WhatsApp\u2019s central role\nin India\u2019s digital economy. \u201cWe remain committed to safeguarding the privacy\nof our users which is integral to India\u2019s digital growth and progress,\u201d the\ncompany said in a statement.\n\nWhatsApp seems likely to win this battle \u2014 but local privacy advocates are\nstill worried about the larger war. Indian researcher Srinivas Kodali, who\nworks with a range of open-internet projects, told me the bigger challenge\nwill come when the Digital India bill is taken up after the election. If the\nBJP does well in the elections, Kodali says a stronger traceability\nrequirement is likely to be bundled into the bill \u2014 and WhatsApp may end up\nfighting the same battle again in six months.\n\nThis essay was originally published in our Exporter newsletter.
