But what if there were a fundamentally different, and possibly more\nefficient way? A way that\u2019s more flexible and fault-tolerant? A way that only\nneeds a tiny fraction of the power to run? Neuromorphic computing, which aims\nto mimic the human brain in processors, represents that promise. In this\narticle, we\u2019ll explore the pros, cons, and use cases for this fascinating\ntechnology. And we\u2019ll seek a level-headed answer to the question, is\nneuromorphic computing the future of AI?\n\n## What Exactly Is Neuromorphic Computing?\n\nPut simply, neuromorphic computers try to mimic the human brain both in\nstructure and in function. They are physical processors packed with artificial\nneurons and synapses that imitate how a real brain learns. But what exactly\ndoes that mean? And how is that different from neural networks run on our\ncurrent hardware?\n\n### How does neuromorphic computing work?\n\nThink of traditional computing with CPUs as a single-lane superhighway.\nInformation travels in neat packets (data bits), following specific routes\n(algorithms) to reach their destination (output). CPUs excel at this\norganized, sequential processing. But they struggle with large, messy datasets\nthat require constant adaptation.\n\nGPUs, which are the backbone of modern AI, are like an upgraded multi-lane\nhighway. Each lane is a bit slower than the single-lane superhighway, but this\none\u2019s built for parallel processing. It handles vast amounts of data by\ndividing it into smaller streams, processing them simultaneously, and then\nreassembling the final result. This is much more efficient for specific tasks\nlike deep learning, but still relies on predefined algorithms.\n\nContinuing this analogy, neuromorphic chips would be a bustling cityscape.\nInformation flows through a network of interconnected streets (connections\nbetween artificial neurons). These \u201cneurons\u201d are not simple on/off switches\nlike in traditional CPUs. They mimic biological neurons, sending electrical\npulses (spikes) whose strength determines the message. Connections between\nneurons are also constantly updating, mimicking the brain\u2019s learning process.\nIn theory, these chips can handle complex data in real time, learn in\nunpredictable environments, and use much less energy.\n\n### Neuromorphic computing vs neural networks\n\nNB: While they share many of the same terms, neuromorphic computers should not\nbe confused with the neural networks used in deep learning. Deep learning is a\nsoftware algorithm mainly still run on traditional hardware, while\nneuromorphic computing is a fundamentally new approach to both hardware and\nsoftware.\n\nAlso, deep learning usually relies on backpropagation, an error-correction\nmethod, to learn. On the other hand, neuromorphic systems focus on\nbiologically-inspired learning rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity\n(STDP). This represents a completely new learning paradigm than the\npredominant one we use in AI today.\n\n### How does one actually make a neuromorphic chip?\n\nWhile early neuromorphic systems used silicon, current research focuses on\nnovel materials. Memristors, for example, could be the missing link.\nMemristors were theorized in 1971 as a hypothetical fourth fundamental circuit\nelement alongside resistors, capacitors, and inductors. However, it wasn\u2019t\nuntil 2008 that HP Labs demonstrated a working physical example.\n\nA memristor\u2019s key feature is that its electrical resistance isn\u2019t fixed. It\nchanges depending on the voltage that has passed through it, essentially\n\u201cremembering\u201d past states. This mimics the way synaptic connections in our\nbrains strengthen or weaken based on activity.\n\nThese phase change neurons store states in response to neuronal inputs.\nCredit: IBM Research\n\nMemristors often have a sandwich-like structure: a thin layer of an active\nmaterial (e.g. a metal oxide like titanium dioxide) placed between two metal\nelectrodes. Under an applied voltage, oxygen vacancies (missing oxygen atoms)\ndrift within the active material. This movement changes the resistance,\nproviding the memory effect.\n\nMemristors are key to neuromorphic computing for several reasons. They can be\nminiaturized to extremely small sizes, allowing for dense neural networks on a\nsingle chip. They can also store and process data at the same location (within\nthe memristor itself). This offers a huge potential speed-up over traditional\ncomputers where data shuttles between memory and processor. Last but not\nleast, memristors conserve energy, ideal for low-powered edge devices.\n\n## Advantages of Neuromorphic Computing\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned some of the advantages, but let\u2019s get to the heart of\nthe matter. Why is neuromorphic computing potentially better than current AI\napproaches? When and where would we want to use a neuromorphic chip, and why?\n\n### The von Neumann Bottleneck\n\nTraditional computers are based on the von Neumann architecture. They have\nseparate processing units (CPUs or GPUs) and memory units. Data needs to be\nconstantly shuttled back and forth between them, creating a bottleneck that\nlimits performance and efficiency. Think of it like a busy chef constantly\nrunning back and forth to the pantry to retrieve ingredients while trying to\ncook a complex meal.\n\nCredit: Opportunities for neuromorphic computing algorithms and applications\n\nUnlike von Neumann systems, neuromorphic chips try to integrate processing and\nmemory within the same architecture. This eliminates the data transfer\nbottleneck and allows for more efficient information flow. This is also how\nour brains naturally work\u2014we don\u2019t have separate memory and processing\ncenters. Instead, information flows seamlessly within a network of neurons.\n\n### Spiking Neural Networks: Beyond 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s\n\nTraditional computers and most AI models rely on a binary communication\nsystem: 0s and 1s. In contrast, the core neuromorphic information processing\nunit is called a spiking neural network (SNN). SNNs communicate with\nelectrical pulses called \u201cspikes.\u201d Think of the neurons in our brains\u2014they\ndon\u2019t just send on/off signals. They fire electrical pulses whose timing and\nfrequency carry information. SNNs mimic this approach.\n\nSpiking neural networks fire signals when they detect specific events. Credit:\nHPCS\n\nSpiking communication requires much less energy than constantly transmitting\nbinary data. In addition, SNNs can encode information not just in the presence\nof a spike, but also in its timing relative to other spikes. This allows them\nto potentially process temporal patterns more efficiently than traditional AI.\nBy incorporating spiking mechanisms, SNNs become closer to how biological\nbrains actually work.\n\n### Key Advantages of Neuromorphic Systems\n\n\u201cNon-von Neumann\u201d architectures, combined with SNNs, have several key\ntheoretical advantages:\n\n  1. Extreme Energy Efficiency: In-memory processing and spiking event-driven nature dramatically reduce power consumption compared to von Neumann architectures.\n  2. Faster Real-Time Processing: Eliminating data transfer bottlenecks and leveraging efficient spiking communication enable faster processing for real-time tasks.\n  3. Potential for New Learning Paradigms: Biologically-inspired learning mechanisms within SNNs offer the potential for more flexible and efficient learning compared to traditional AI models.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s unlikely that neuromorphic computers would ever fully replace\ntraditional computers. Just as with quantum computers, neuromorphic chips will\nbe especially useful for certain problems\u2014and less so for others. Generally,\nneuromorphic benefits increase as the problem complexity and number of sensors\ngrow.\n\n### Applications of Neuromorphic Computing\n\nHere are a few examples of where neuromorphic chips can shine:\n\nComputer Vision in Robotics\n\nCurrent robots often have a dedicated CPU/GPU for image processing and a\nseparate unit for decision-making. A neuromorphic chip could combine low-power\nreal-time vision with on-chip learning, enabling (1) adaptive navigation in\nunpredictable environments like construction sites or during disaster relief\nand (2) object recognition without massive training datasets, ideal for\nflexible manufacturing tasks.\n\nNeuromorphic chips are ideal for machine vision, edge AI, and smart cities.\nCredit: Alexander/Adobe.\n\nSensor Fusion for Wearable Health Devices\n\nWearables generate many noisy data streams (heart rate, motion, skin\ntemperature). Small neuromorphic chips could (1) learn an individual\u2019s\nbaseline patterns, enabling highly personalized health monitoring and (2)\ndetect subtle changes invisible to rule-based algorithms, potentially spotting\nillnesses earlier.\n\nAdaptive Control for Prosthetics\n\nNeuromorphic systems could analyze muscle signals or even tap into neural\nactivity, allowing for (1) finer, more intuitive control of prosthetic limbs\nwithout extensive re-calibration and (2) prosthetics that learn and adjust to\na user\u2019s movement patterns over time.\n\nLow-Energy, AI-Powered Edge Computing\n\nNeuromorphic chips will also shine in edge devices that need to make complex\ndecisions\u2014e.g. autonomous vehicles. They\u2019d be able to provide the \u201csmarts\u201d\nwhile (1) not requiring cloud connectivity, making them reliable in remote\nenvironments or disaster zones and (2) using a fraction of the power of\ntoday\u2019s chips, extending battery life substantially.\n\nThese examples aren\u2019t science fiction. They use existing sensors and\nalgorithms\u2014but would be simply more efficient or responsive with a\nneuromorphic chip. And as the technology matures, their huge efficiency gains\nwill make neuromorphic chips attractive for an ever broader range of AI\napplications\n\n## Disadvantages of Neuromorphic Computing\n\nNeuromorphic computing is a young field, and there are still many hurdles to\novercome, from engineering to measurement.\n\n### Technical, Engineering, and Scaling Challenges\n\nIt\u2019s no easy feat translating neuroscience to engineering. Our understanding\nof the human brain is still evolving, and we still can\u2019t perfectly replicate\nits functions. Traditional silicon transistors cannot efficiently mimic the\ncomplex behavior of biological neurons, so researchers are still exploring\nalternatives like memristors.\n\nEven manufacturing these chips at scale is still incredibly tough. Managing\npower delivery and heat dissipation at larger scales is a complex engineering\nproblem. Today\u2019s largest neuromorphic chips (like Intel\u2019s Loihi 2) have around\n1 million neurons. This is a far cry from the estimated 86 billion neurons in\nthe human brain.\n\n### Programming Paradigm Shift: Synchronous to Asynchronous\n\nEven if we were to build full-scale neuromorphic hardware, it wouldn\u2019t be\nplug-and-play. Most traditional algorithms are designed for synchronous\nsystems (CPUs/GPUs), where instructions are executed sequentially in a clock-\ndriven manner. However, neuromorphic systems are inherently asynchronous.\nNeurons fire only when stimulated by input signals or based on internal\ndynamics.\n\nThis requires algorithms that can handle event-driven, spiking data. For\nexample, a traditional deep learning algorithm analyzes an image pixel by\npixel. Computations follow a precise sequence that we program from the outset.\nEven a GPU follows that sequence\u2014it just runs many sequential threads in\nparallel. But a neuromorphic algorithm would process the image purely\nasynchronously. Different neurons would fire based on the patterns they\ndetect, independently and at their own pace.\n\n### Lack of Apples-to-Apples Performance Benchmarks\n\nTraditional computing has established benchmarks like FLOPS (floating-point\noperations per second) or frames per second in graphics. But the neuromorphic\nworld still lacks standardized ways to measure and compare performance. For\nexample, neuromorphic chips are not just about raw speed\u2014energy savings is\nanother key metric and reason for using them.\n\nThis lack of standardized benchmarks creates somewhat of a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d\nproblem. Without clear metrics, it\u2019s difficult to assess progress. But without\nprovably superior performance, it\u2019s harder to secure R&D funding, and in\nturn\u2014adoption.\n\n## So Is Neuromorphic Computing the Future of AI?\n\nNeuromorphic computing offers tantalizing promises \u2013 extreme energy\nefficiency, adaptive learning, and tackling real-world sensory data in ways\nthat challenge traditional AI. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that we\u2019re\nstill in the very early stages of this technology. Manufacturing, programming,\nand benchmarking challenges all stand in the way of widespread adoption.\n\nOne bridge between the present and the future might be the development of\nhybrid systems. These combine traditional with neuromorphic chips, allowing\neach to play to its strengths. Neuromorphic cores could handle specific tasks\nrequiring low-power, real-time processing, like smart city sensors or self-\ndriving cars. Meanwhile, traditional CPUs or GPUs would still manage overall\nsystem control. As neuromorphic technology matures, the balance within these\nhybrid systems could shift.\n\nCredit: Guido Perscheid/Center for Deep Tech Innovation\n\nThe ultimate question is whether neuromorphic computing can play a role in the\npursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Some researchers believe AGI\nis achievable with current paradigms, and it\u2019s just a matter of scaling up\nexisting models. They point to recent advances in generative AI that have\nforced us to rethink what we assumed about human creativity.\n\nStill, other AI researchers don\u2019t think current methods are enough. For\nexample, some theories suggest true sentience is inseparable from the body and\nthe environment. Current AI operates on abstract data models, while our brains\nevolved in the context of physical action and sensory perception. This argues\nfor hardware specialized in handling real-world, noisy sensory data in real\ntime\u2014i.e. neuromorphic computing.\n\nRegardless, neuromorphic AI will likely complement, rather than replace the AI\napproaches we have today. This is an extremely exciting field to watch, and\nplenty of startups are already pushing its boundaries. Whether neuromorphic\ncomputing ends up being a key puzzle piece for AGI\u2014or \u201cmerely\u201d used in niche\ncases like edge AI\u2014it\u2019s very worth keeping a close eye on.\n\n#### Read Next\n\nThese 6 Neuromorphic Computing Startups Could Change AI Forever\n\nThe State of Artificial Intelligence 2024: AI Index Report\n\nTop 10 Generative AI Applications: Engines of Creation\n\nGenerative AI Explained: Giving a Voice to Machines\n\nArtificial Intelligence Explained: Can We Outsource the Brain?\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n  1.
