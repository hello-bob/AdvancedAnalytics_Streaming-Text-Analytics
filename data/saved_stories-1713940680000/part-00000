DOI: 10.1111/maps.14164\n\nIntensive new nano-analysis of the Winchcombe meteorite has revealed how it\nwas affected by water and repeatedly smashed apart and reassembled on the\njourney it took through space before landing in an English sheep field in\n2021.\n\nResearchers from dozens of institutions in the UK, Europe, Australia, and the\nU.S. collaborated on the research. Together, they subjected mineral grains in\nfragments of the Winchcombe meteorite to a diverse range of cutting-edge\nanalytical techniques.\n\nTheir work, which was conducted on a scale more typically reserved for\ninvestigating samples returned to Earth by multibillion-dollar space missions,\nhas given them unparalleled insight into the history of the Winchcombe\nmeteorite in the process.\n\nTheir analysis has helped them roll back the clock to the meteorite's earliest\ndays as an ice-bearing dry rock, then trace its transformation through the\nmelting of the ice into a ball of mud which was broken apart and rebuilt over\nand over again.\n\nThe Winchcombe meteorite is an unusually well-preserved example of a group of\nspace rocks called CM carbonaceous chondrites, which were formed during the\nearliest periods of the solar system. They carry minerals altered by the\npresence of water on their parent asteroid.\n\nAnalysis of those minerals within the Winchcombe meteorite will help\nscientists unravel the answers to questions around the processes which formed\nour solar system, including the possible origins of the Earth's water.\n\nUnlike most meteorites, which can lie undiscovered for months or years after\nentering the Earth's atmosphere, the Winchcombe meteorite was recovered within\nhours of hitting the ground. Members of the public, citizen scientists and the\namateur meteorite enthusiast community recognized that rocks had hit the\nground and helped scientists to identify the location of samples, aiding their\nrecovery.\n\nThe speed of its recovery helped prevent it from being further altered by\nexposure to the Earth's atmosphere, offering scientists a rare opportunity to\nlearn more about CM chondrites by scrutinizing it down to the atomic level.\n\nIn a paper published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science,\nresearchers describe how they explored the complex breccia of the Winchombe\nmeteorite.\n\nA breccia is rock formed from chunks of other rocks cemented together in a\nstructure called a cataclastic matrix. The team's analysis carried out using\nsophisticated techniques including transmission electron microscopy, electron\nbackscatter diffraction, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and\natom probe tomography, showed that the Winchcombe breccia contains eight\ndistinct types of CM chondrite rocks.\n\nThe team found that each type of rock has been altered to different degrees by\nthe presence of water, not just between the types of rocks but also,\nsurprisingly, within them. The team found many examples of unaltered mineral\ngrains next to completely altered ones, even down to the nano-scale. For\ncomparison, a human hair is around 75,000 nanometers thick.\n\nThe team suggests that the likely explanation for the jumbled nature of the\ndifferent types of rocks and their extreme variation in aqueous alteration is\nthat the Winchcombe asteroid was repeatedly smashed into pieces by impacts\nwith other asteroids before being pulled back together.\n\nAnother significant finding of the analysis is the unexpectedly high\nproportion of carbonate minerals like aragonite, calcite, and dolomite, along\nwith minerals that have subsequently replaced carbonates, in the samples the\nteam analyzed.\n\nThis suggests that the Winchcombe meteorite was more carbon-rich than\npreviously thought and likely accumulated abundant frozen CO_2 before it\nmelted to form the carbonate minerals the team observed. The team's analysis\ncould help explain the large carbonate veins that have been observed on the\nsurface of the Asteroid Bennu by NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Luke Daly of the University of Glasgow, who is also\nthe lead author of the paper. Dr. Daly also led the search party which\nrecovered the largest fragment of the Winchcombe meteorite after it was\nspotted as a fireball streaking across the skies over Gloucestershire on\nFebruary 28th, 2021.\n\nDr. Daly said, \"We were fascinated to uncover just how fragmented the breccia\nwas within the Winchcombe sample we analyzed. If you imagine the Winchcombe\nmeteorite as a jigsaw, what we saw in the analysis was as if each of the\njigsaw pieces themselves had also been cut into smaller pieces, and then\njumbled in a bag filled with fragments of seven other jigsaws.\n\n\"However, what we've uncovered in trying to unjumble the jigsaws through our\nanalyses is new insight into the very fine detail of how the rock was altered\nby water in space. It also gives us a clearer idea of how it must have been\nbattered by impacts and reformed again and again over the course of its\nlifetime since it swirled together out of the solar nebula, billions of years\nago.\"\n\nDr. Leon Hicks from the University of Leicester and co-author of the study\nsaid, \"This level of analysis of the Winchcombe meteorite is virtually\nunprecedented for materials that weren't directly returned to Earth from space\nmissions, like moon rocks from the Apollo program or samples from the Ryugu\nasteroid collected by the Hayabusa 2 probe.\"\n\nPaper co-author Dr. Martin Suttle from the Open University said, \"The speed\nwhich the fragments of Winchcombe were recovered left us with some pristine\nsamples for analysis, from the centimeter scale all the way down to individual\natoms within the rocks. Each grain is a tiny time capsule that, taken\ntogether, helps us build a remarkably clear view into the formation, re-\nformation, and alteration that occurred over the course of millions of years.\"\n\nDr. Diane Johnson from Cranfield University, a co-author of the paper, added,\n\"Research like this helps us understand the earliest part the formation of our\nsolar system in a way that just isn't possible without detailed analysis of\nmaterials that were right there in space as it happened. The Winchcombe\nmeteorite is a remarkable piece of space history and I'm pleased to have been\npart of the team that has helped tell this new story.\"\n\nMore information: Luke Daly et al, Brecciation at the grain scale within the\nlithologies of the Winchcombe Mighei\u2010like carbonaceous chondrite, Meteoritics\n& Planetary Science (2024).
