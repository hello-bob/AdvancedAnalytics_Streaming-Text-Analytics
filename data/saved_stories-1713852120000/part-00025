It's becoming more and\nmore easy to see a break in the enchantment that once existed online with\neveryone once before... People are becoming more an more angry in comments on\nTwitter (X), TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram towards each other, and\ncomplaining that no one is seeing their posts, while corporate leadership for\nthese platforms appears to be completely tone deaf to all of the growing\ndissent, while they launch new features that do nothing to change the root\ncause of this growing disappointment with software and tools they have used\nevery day for years out of their life. It's pretty easy to see the underlying\nthread that no one wants to disrupt the revenue streams, as social media is\nnow at the very root of influence on our world economy and public\nconsciousness...\n\nSince the old days, where Friendster and Myspace (oh how we miss thee)\nstarted, they promised that we'd meet new people, and get to share our music\nand art, which looking back at it all was clunky, but still worked better than\nediting ear-worm-worthy clips of our music into tons of video content every\nday, making sure our photos are cut to weird arbitrary dimensions and spelling\nwas right so that or posts don't totally embarrass us well after they're\nposted. We're required now to spend hours in being cordial and accommodating\nto the wild assortment of comments we get on social apps rather than working\non our product, while also engaging with others (as if it's a full time job)\nwhile we don't receive one red cent from the platforms we do it upon in most\ncases... That's right, MOST of the the real people posting TV and radio\nquality content rarely get paid, and if they do, it's small drops in the\nbucket compared to the money that platforms generate off of all that sweet\ncrowdsourced free struggle labor... It's a whole other story, but if you're\nshocked by that, the next 2 paragraphs, Boy I tell you what!\n\n\"Should a company run a service for free?\" may be the main argument presented\nby philosophers on the matter, but to logical people that know how these\nplatforms started as free hubs of activity until dependency set in, it is\nfairly easy to see that the same methods commonly used in drug dealing were\nleveraged to create dependency on social platforms, and that alone raises\nserious questions of representational integrity of many major platforms that\ncan't easily be covered with fluffy wool.\n\nAt the time of publication of this doc, Instagram reportedly made over ~32\nbillion dollars in 2021, primarily from ad revenue, and estimates say that\nthat revenue is growing. I made zero dollars off running my Instagram page,\nbut I sure posted a lot that year while averaging 100 views or less per post\non the platform with hundreds of millions of users... YouTube as well is\nreported to have made over 28 billion dollars in 2021 as well -- One could\nhardly say these companies are struggling to function and deliver quality\nexperiences to their content creators citing those profits. Dunkin Donuts\n(purely for contrast) employs many employees and makes a lot of customers very\nhappy with annual revenue being reportedly well under $3 billion each year so\nfar cited running over 18000 distribution points in approximately 60 countries\nworldwide... SOURCE: https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122 ... c-monopoly\n\nIf Dunkin Donut's revenue was that of YouTube even, at 28 billion annually,\nThe entire world would be shoulders deep in wonderful coffee and even donuts\nwithout figuring out how to earn mysterious likes in order to help everyone's\nenjoyment of the services they provide... If likes were real donuts of all\nshapes and sizes that too our allergies and taste preferences into\nconsiderations of course, just imagine how we could get rid of all this\nfrustration with social media altogether! Great.. All of a sudden I'm craving\na donut, so I'll wrap this up shortly :/\n\nDeep revelations come when real comparisons of how the social media machine\noperates in truth, as most of the time, these companies operate mysteriously\nand in secret, as only the designers and engineers of code truly know how it\nworks... I write about it all a lot these days, because social platforms\ndominate public attention now more than ever in almost every aspect of doing\nbusiness.\n\nThe process of deploying these large-scale software-driven platforms is pretty\nmuch all handled now by private companies that regularly face little auditing,\nregulation, and oversight by official (government) bodies because the\nplatforms, code, and content are often too obscured and vast to quantify and\nevaluate. Just as an example (but a completely made up example mind you) if\nyou had a team of only 10 aviation administration inspectors assigned to\nBoeing, even if they were the best at what they do, inspecting every plane\nthat Boeing puts out before they can fly would hit a brick wall, especially if\neach plane takes 6-8 months to build in plants scattered all around the\nworld... It's safe to say that oversight, safety, and quality slips when there\nare very few accountable inspectors, as Boeing reportedly put out 528\ncommercial aircraft, 157 military aircraft, 5 satellites in 2023. SOURCE TO\nMAKE THIS EDITORIAL LOOK MORE STATISTICALLY DRIVEN (even though it's really\nnot): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing\n\nFootnote, I gave up on trying to creating a meaningful math-driven example,\nbut the only official inspectors of how social media operates to this point\nhas been the FCC, DOJ, and Congress pretty much, and I read an article that a\n(to remain unnamed) Congress member was thinking about returning to college to\nget a degree on how the internet works, so that's goin places...\n(congratulations are in order for keeping up with the Internet, I'm sure, It's\nonly been around since 1983...>:/)\n\nFor real comparison's sake though, an estimate of GDP for the entire country\nof Jamaica last year was just under $18 billion dollars... A lot less than\nwhat YouTube (~$28B), Meta (~$117B), and less than half of what TikTok (~$40B)\nmade in 2022... I'm sure many people will tell you that visiting Jamaica has\nmade them happier than social media did last year, if there were Donuts and\ncoffee served on the plane, I'm sure, for me at least, it likely would have\nbeen an overload in terms of a sensory experience. If we employed absolutely\neveryone on the island of Jamaica to create a social app for tourism, food,\nbeach life, and entertainment, I'd personally be the first to sign up\nhonestly... I have no association with Jamaican tourism or government, so\nthat's just a personal and non-profit statement)\n\nWhen you consider what is really going on in our world today, how many\nchildren are depressed to the point of withdrawal and even suicide, how mass\ncasualty and criminal incidents are often filmed and posted online by\nperpetrators and spectators, how the quality of products and services have\nbeen negatively impacted and diminished by scams and cost cutting, how social\n(human) communication seems to be dwindling while brash personalities and\nnarcissistic egos are on the rise, how scams and disinformation are dominating\na lot of online interactions now (often bleeding into and affecting our real\nlives), how it's becoming harder and harder to grow your business without\nhaving a major marketing budget while evangelizing a platforms and process\nthat can pull the rug from under you at any time, along with a laundry list of\nother concerns generated by the way the modern web works -- The least we could\ndo now is begin to ask some real (no-gaslight) questions:\n\nWhere the insane amounts of profits are going, and what's being returned in\nvalue to platform users?\n\nif it's fair that we're being charged to post our own IP on deeply controlled\ncommunity apps for them to sample it into AI products that they in turn sell\nus access to?\n\nIs it good for our mental health and success to see ads for air fryers,\nwhatever Elon is doing each second, and jokes about OJ passing away (and 2,000\nother related stories about his legacy) scattered into an infinite scrolling\npage of everyone's hot take on the matter in the same place we go to for\ntimely news and to post our own important hot takes on OJ's life and legacy,\ncreative works we've made, funny memes about life, and business plans?\n\nShould the requirement for everyone (even those not making a profit from\nposting) being able to post anything online, that actually gets seen by anyone\nelse, be to pay a monthly for a blue (verified) check mark or ads?\n\nHow are people posting vital clips from TV shows on TikTok, yet I constantly\nget my videos blocked just for adding music I personally made to them?\n\nAre each of us actively contributing towards our own personal undermining and\nsocial downfall by clicking like on endless Katt Williams/Shannon Sharpe/Joe\nRogan interview clips, clearly bootlegged content from YouTube reposted to\nTikTok, All the original ancient blurry memes copied from Break.Com\nEbaumsWorld already over-reposted everywhere 2 million times, ads for glitter-\nvinyl wrapping & detailing your expensive SUV, and brutal police car chase\nvideos?\n\nShould we have some sort of qualification test for Congress people on whether\nthey understand how the Internet works, how the internet can become really bad\nwithout proper regulation, and perhaps also ban enrichment of trading shares\nof social media and news companies amongst them (at least)?\n\nWith the decline in utility of social platforms for individuals trying to\ncreate business growth while the cost of success and threats to owning your IP\nand posts on social media continues to quickly rise and be gamified, is it\ntime to focus more on running and updating your own independent web site? You\nknow, like back when you didn't have to spend the entire day on the Internet?\n\nWhen we log on to (and participate in) closed communities, our discourse is\ncontrolled without us truly knowing how. the complaints can easily be\nmoderated away, the most popular trends now can often be curated to serve the\nprofit of whichever platform you're on at the moment, although I try not to\npraise this one too much, despite having record viewership this year to which\nI'm very thankful for... The Internet prior to proliferation and conquer by\ngiant social platforms (to which the most dominant ones have converted now\nfrom free use to paid use) if you can remember it was vibrant,\nindividualistic, a bit more polite overall, and a lot more fostering of great\nideas and business growth, it was originally a bacon for creating wealth\nopportunity and for informational accuracy and accountability... As we've\nprogressed into the hellscape of \"Low opportunity ad-driven no-choice-but-spam\nmonopoly-run Internet\" (serious description just added for sensationalist and\ncomedic impact there).\n\nIf you hear anyone only speaking super positively about social tech these\ndays, perhaps be wary -- They may either be an investor, a trust fund\ninheriting child of a tech exec, an oil money heir, or even a guy that can\nturn a $44Billion dollar vital public communication tool into his own personal\npersonal idea pad that you need to pay to compete to write on the last page\nof.\n\nI think it's long overdue for us to have more discussions about how our\ncurrent \"social networks\" have turned tides towards not really helping us to\nwork & grow as individuals, while (adding insult to injury) charging us to\nwork for primarily for their closed-circuit (A witty CircuitBored.Com\nreference isn't it?) benefit... This current model is Social NetWorking that\nis likely Socially NotWorking for the majority.\n\nMoe @RUFFANDTUFF Our Sound Is Unlike Anything Else.
