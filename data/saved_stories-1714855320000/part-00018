This comes just days after another\nofficial warned Congress that this \"indiscriminate\" weapon, details about\nwhich first emerged publicly earlier this year, could be capable of rendering\nlow Earth orbit completely unusable for a prolonged period of time.\n\nMallory Stewart, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Deterrence,\nand Stability, discussed Russia\u2019s nuclear anti-satellite weapon developments\nin new detail today in a fireside chat that the Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted.\n\n\"The United States is extremely concerned that Russia may be considering the\nincorporation of nuclear weapons into its counterspace programs based on\ninformation we deem credible,\" Stewart said. \"The United States has been aware\nof Russia's pursuit of this sort of capability dating back years, but only\nrecently have we been able to make a more precise assessment of their\nprogress.\"\n\nStewart stressed at multiple times during the conversation that the U.S.\ngovernment has not assessed that Russia has \"deployed\" this capability in any\nway, and that American officials are actively trying to discourage that from\nhappening.\n\nHowever, the Assistant Secretary of State did indicate that something is in\nspace now as part of the development of this new nuclear anti-satellite\nweapon.\n\n\"Russia has publicly claimed that their satellite is for scientific purposes,\"\nStewart said \"However, the orbit is in a region not used by any other\nspacecraft. That in itself was somewhat unusual. And the orbit is a region of\nhigher radiation than normal, lower earth orbits, but not high enough of a\nradiation environment to allow accelerated testing of electronics as Russia\nhas described the purpose to be.\"\n\nStewart did not name the satellite in question or elaborate on its claimed\npurpose. Putting some kind of testbed in orbit before deploying an actual\nspace-based weapon system, especially one involving a nuclear weapon system,\nwould make good sense. This would be even more prudent if the orbit passes\nthrough areas where there is increased radiation risks, the Van Allen belts,\nsomething we will come back to later.\n\nStewart speaking at the CSIS event earlier today. CSIS\n\nThe Assistant Secretary of State did provide some additional context about the\nanti-satellite capability that Russia is using that platform, at least in\npart, to help develop.\n\n\"We aren't talking about a weapon that can be used to attack humans or cause\nstructural damage on Earth,\" according to Stewart. \"Instead... our analysts\nassess that detonation [of a nuclear device] in a particular placement in\norbit of a magnitude and location would render lower Earth orbit unusable for\na certain amount of time.\" Low Earth Orbit (LEO) refers to a band of space\nthat measures roughly 100 miles to 1,200 miles above the earth, and which is\nhighly congested. Many capabilities that are highly important to society exist\nin this orbital realm.\n\nIn talking about the projected anti-satellite weapon\u2019s capabilities, Stewart\nalso referenced remarks from Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy\nJohn Plumb earlier this week. Plumb discussed this same topic at a hearing\nbefore members of the House Armed Services Committee on May 1. There, he\nanswered questions on a written statement to Congress regarding the Department\nof Defense's 2025 Fiscal Year budget request.\n\n\"The concept that we are concerned about is Russia developing and \u2014 if we are\nunable to convince them otherwise \u2014 to ultimately fly a nuclear weapon in\nspace,\" Plumb said earlier in the week. This concerns an \"indiscriminate\nweapon [that] doesn't have national boundaries, [and] doesn't determine\nbetween military satellites, civilian satellites or commercial satellites,\"\nPlumb said.\n\nWhen pressed by Representative Mike Turner (R-Ohio), who chairs the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on the impact that detonating such\na weapon in space could have, Plumb indicated that coming to a definitive\nconclusion remains challenging. However, he did note that \"satellites that\naren't hardened against nuclear detonation space, which is most satellites,\ncould be damaged [and] affected... Some would be caught in an immediate blast\nwhich... would not be able to survive the flux of that, and then others could\nbe damaged over time.\"\n\nHere, Plumb referred to the impact of 'nuclear pumping' in the aforementioned\nVan Allen Belts \u2014 high energy radiation particles that form two belts that\nsurround the Earth like donuts. Nuclear pumping refers to a phenomenon where\nnuclear radiation lingers in the LEO environment.\n\nA cross-section of the Van Allen belts.

As he noted in his\nwritten testimony, Plumb stipulated that this would seriously threaten \"all\nsatellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to\nthe vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural,\ncommercial, and national security services we all depend upon.\"\n\nOn the developmental status of Russia's nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon,\nPlumb said that specific details could only be discussed in closed session. He\ndid note that the threat isn't \"imminent in the way that we should have to\nworry about it right now.\" \"But,\" he added, \"we are concerned about it...\n[both] the Department [of Defense] and the entire [Biden] administration, and\nI know this Congress is taking this deadly seriously.\"\n\nWhile further details on the progress on the weapon, beyond Mallory and\nPlumb's recent comments, aren't available outside of the classified realm,\nthere have been recent indications that Russia is actively pursuing such a\ncapability. In late April, Russia vetoed a United Nations (U.N.) Security\nCouncil resolution, proposed by the U.S. and Japan. Said resolution directed\nmembers to uphold Article 4 of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which Russia\nsigned 56 years ago, forbidding countries from placing nuclear weapons in\norbit or on celestial bodies. The treaty also prohibits countries from\ndeveloping nuclear weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction, for use in\norbit.\n\nVICTOR HABBICK VISIONS via Getty Images\n\nThe White House condemned Russia's decision to veto the resolution at the\ntime, constituting the first public confirmation by the U.S. government that\nRussia's new anti-satellite weapon is nuclear-armed. Previously, this had only\nbeen attributed to anonymous official sources.\n\nIn a statement released on April 24, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\nsaid that \"the United States assesses that Russia is developing a new\nsatellite carrying a nuclear device. We have heard President Putin say\npublicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space.\nIf that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this resolution.\"\n\nRussia has since circulated its own U.N. resolution on the matter of space-\nbased nuclear weapons that not only calls for preventing such weapons from\nbeing deployed in space, but also stopping \u201cthe threat or use of force in\nouter space\" for \"all time.\u201d\n\nThe matter of Russia's vetoing of the resolution will be deliberated on in the\nU.N. General Assembly on May 6, Stewart said today, which will be open to all\nU.N. member nations. The U.S. has also been leveraging its diplomatic\nresources to bolster international opposition to Russia's decision, she\nconfirmed, having already consulted with U.N. members China and India.\n\n\"I think the international response [to the existence of the weapon] should be\noutreach,\" Stewart said, \"because it affects everyone right, every single\ncountry is indiscriminate in its potential effect. So it's much different than\nefforts to hold us at risk limited to just the U.S. and our partners [and]\nallies. It would affect everyone including China and India, and Russia's own\nsatellites. So it's extraordinarily destabilizing, and I think the\ninternational community needs to reflect that concern.\"\n\nThat being said, the existence of Russia's nuclear anti-satellite weapon is\nconcerning to the U.S. government and military for a host of reasons. Space\nrepresents an absolutely critical domain and is essential for the day-to-day\nfunctioning of the U.S. military. Moreover, it has in place various programs\nfor developing distributed space-based capabilities, supporting early warning\nand missile-defense type missions, as well as intelligence-gathering and\nsurveillance, communications and data-sharing, where satellite use is key. The\nUnited States' advantage in space is clearly something adversaries are seeking\nto negate, potentially at great cost.\n\nThis painting, the very first commissioned for the U.S. Space Force, depicts a\nfictitious reusable space place intercepting a hostile 'killer satellite'\nthreatening another American asset in orbit. U.S. Space Force\n\nAlready, adversaries such as Russia and China have developed various anti-\nsatellite weapons, including direct ascent interceptors, 'killer satellites,'\nelectronic warfare jammers, and lasers. The collective threat posed by these\nadversarial capabilities has been previously described as \"extremely\nconcerning\" by the U.S. Space Force's top officer Gen. Chance Saltzman. In\nresponse, the U.S. armed forces have explored the use of different commercial\noptions, including systems like SpaceX's Starlink, for conducting future\noperations via distributed satellite constellations.\n\nAnd while U.S. adversaries look for new ways to target massive constellations\nof smaller satellites in LEO, it's possible that deploying nuclear weapons in\nthat region \u2014 as dangerous a prospect as this would be for all space users \u2014\nmay look increasingly attractive to other countries aside from just Russia.\n\nDARPA\n\nBeyond the military aspect, once again, the loss of low earth orbit would be\nhugely impactful to life on Earth. The economic damage that such a weapon\ncould do is hard to even quantify. Replacing space-based capabilities after\nthe radiation cleared would take a very long time and LEO may be so cluttered\nwith space junk at that point that it may not be reliably inhabitable at all\nfor much longer than how long damaging radiation would persist.\n\nThe entire idea of this weapon is very troublesome and the use of it could set\nhumanity back significantly for a long time.\n\nIf anything else, these new revelations about Russia's nuclear anti-satellite\nweapon underscore just how real a battlefield space is becoming.\n\nContact the authors: oliver@thewarzone.com, joe@twz.com\n\nAmericasAnti-Satellite CapabilitiesAround The GlobeRussian Space ProgramU.S.\nHomeland\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
