It is not usable in its current state.\n\n  * The source code has been modified by Microsoft -- even after the publication this week -- reducing the historical value of the code.\n\n  * Also Microsoft claims to have lost some source code.\n\nYeah. You read that first bullet point right. It does not compile. I'll walk\nyou through the details (including a step-by-step guide for how you can fail\nto compile MS-DOS 4.0 yourself).\n\nBut, first, a little backstory.\n\nFull article at Lunduke.Locals.com\n\n> You can read this full article \u2014 for free \u2014 over at the main site for The\n> Lunduke Journal (Lunduke.Locals.com).
