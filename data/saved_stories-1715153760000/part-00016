P = pattern. t = time. V = voxel side length.\n\nMarch 30, 2024 \u2014 Given a box with side S, over a certain timespan t, with\nminimum voxel resolution V, how many unique concepts C are needed to describe\nall the patterns (repeated phenomena) P that occur in the box?\n\n*\n\nAs the size of the cube increases, the number of concepts needed increases. An\nincreasing cube size captures more phenomena. You need more concepts for a box\ncontaining the earth than for a thimble containing a pebble.\n\nAs your voxel size--the smallest unit of measurement--decreases, the number of\nconcepts needed increases.\n\nAs your time horizon increases, the number of concepts needed increases, as\npatterns combine to produce novel patterns in combinatorial ways, and some\npatterns only unfold over a certain period of time. Although, past a certain\namount of time, maybe everything just repeats again.\n\nIn fact, it seems likely that the number of concepts C would grow sigmoidally\nwith each of these factors.\n\n*\n\nWhy are there any patterns at all? Why isn't the number of concepts zero? Why\ndoesn't every box just contain randomness? There could be infinite random\nuniverses, but this one, for sure, contains patterns.\n\n*\n\nWhat is a pattern? A pattern is something accurately simulatable by a\nfunction. A concept is a function with inputs and outputs that simulates a\npattern.\n\nA concept could be embodied in different ways: by software, by an analog\ncomputer, by an integrated circuit, by neurons, et cetera.\n\nIf all you had in your box was a rock, you could have a concept of\n\"persistence\", which is that a rock is persistent in that it will still be\nthere even as you increase the time. Input rock to persistence and persistence\noutputs rock.\n\nBrains are pattern simulators, and symbolic concepts are a way for these\nsimulators to communicate simulations.\n\n*\n\nYou can classify patterns into natural patterns and man-made patterns.\n\nMitosis is a natural pattern.\n\nWheels are a simple man-made pattern and cars are a man-made pattern made up\nof many, many man-made patterns.\n\n*\n\nScience is the process of gathering data, searching that data for patterns,\nmostly natural, and tagging those patterns with concepts.\n\nIt's fairly easy to tag new man-made patterns with concepts. There are max\neight billion agents generating these (much less, in practice), and we can tag\nthem as we create them.\n\nFor natural patterns, however, nature developed an astronomically large number\nof patterns before humans even evolved. So early scientists had quite a\nbacklog to work through.\n\nIn the beginning of science, there were natural patterns to be tagged\neverywhere--a lot of low hanging fruit.\n\nUntagged natural patterns may have become rarer.\n\nThe box at the element size is well described. Scientists have identified all\nthe natural elements and the only new ones are man-made.\n\n*\n\nIf you put a box around the earth, what percentage of nature's patterns have\nbeen tagged?\n\nAre we 50% done? Are we 1% done? Are we 0.0001% of the way there?\n\nAre we something like 45% of the way there, with greatly diminishing returns,\napproaching some hard limit of knowability?\n\nOr will there be a point where we've successfully uncovered all the useful\npatterns here on earth?\n\n*\n\nBoth nature and man are constantly creating new patterns combinatorically.\n\nHow many new microbes does nature invent everyday?\n\nWho is inventing more patterns nowadays on earth: nature or man?\n\nHow has that race changed over time?\n\nWhat about if you extend your box to contain the whole universe?\n\n*\n\nIf you put a box around our universe, what were the first patterns in it?\n\nHow is it that a box can contain patterns that evolve to be able to simulate\nthe very box they are in?\n\n*\n\nA decreasing voxel size allows for identifying concepts that can generate\npredictions impossible with a higher voxel size, but also increases the number\nof untagged patterns.\n\n*\n\nSomething being unpredictable after much effort means it is either truly\nunpredictable or just that the true pattern has not been found yet.\n\nThat might be because:\n\n  * The box is too small.\n  * The box is misplaced.\n  * The voxels are too big.\n  * The right measures are unknown (measures are concepts too!).\n  * The measurements are not being taken enough over time.\n\n*\n\nIt does seem like the process of finding the right formula is not so hard,\nonce the right data has been collected.\n\n*\n\nWe often have a lot of misconcepts.\n\nA misconcept is a concept that doesn't really explain a pattern.\n\nMaybe it is correlated with some parts of a pattern, but it is very lacking\ncompared to some concepts that are far more reliable.\n\nYou could also call these bullshit concepts.\n\n*\n\nIf you put a box around a bunch of bricks, we seem to have a pretty good\nhandle on all the useful concepts.\n\nPut it around a human brain though, and we still have a long way to go.\n\nAlthough, if you think about the progress made in neuroscience in the last 50\nyears, you can imagine we might possibly get very far in the next 50, if\ndiminishing returns aren't too strong.\n\n*\n\nCan we make empirical claims about how many concepts C can we expect to\ndescribe patterns P given a box of size S, voxel size V, over time T?\n\nPerhaps it is possible to use Wikipedia to do such a thing.\n\nMaybe if you plotted that we would see the general relationship between these\nthings.\n\nWhy might answering this question be useful?\n\nIf we consider an encyclopedia E to contain all the useful concepts C in a\nbox, then we might be able to make predictions about how complete our\nunderstanding of a topic is, regardless of the domain, by taking simple\nmeasurements of E alongside S, V, and T.\n\n\u2042\n\n# Notes\n\n  * Sorry if you were expecting some quantified answers, as I haven't done that hard empirical work, yet. This post is early explorations of trying to think of what science is from first principles. Scientists and engineers and craftsmen have done absolutely amazing things in so many fields, but I'm very interested in an area where science has so far failed, and I try to think of possible root causes of that failure. In those situations, it might just be a matter of time (waiting for technologies to decrease voxel size, or take previously impossible measurements).\n  * If you are interested in the concept of the evolution of patterns in nature, I recommend checking out assembly theory.\n  * This great new post by Stephen Wolfram explores similar ideas.\n\ntreeNotationFinalReport.html \u00b7 boxMethod.html \u00b7 openMindedness.html\n\nView source\n\nBuilt with Scroll v84.8.1\n\n", "frontpage": false}
