Markdown Oxide does not\naim to fully replace Obsidian; it serves to provide a feature-rich and\nadvanced note-taking experience. Obsidian remains a terrific front-end for\nyour linked markdown notes. Also, in terms of features, Markdown Oxide and\nObsidian are quite alligned.\n\nMarkdown Oxide's features are implemented in the form of a language server\naiming to be fully compatible with your favorite text editor and its\necosystem. Read on to learn what Markdown Oxide provides and how to install\nand configure it.\n\n## Installation\n\n(if you want to skip to the features, click here)\n\n### Neovim\n\n  1. Given Neovim access to the binary.\n\n     * Mason.nvim (from hosted binary)\n     * Nix Unstable: pkgs.markdown-oxide\n  2. Modify your Neovim Configuration\n\n### VSCode\n\nInstall the vscode extension (called Markdown Oxide). As for how the extension\nuses uses the language server, there are two options\n\n  1. Recommended: the extension will download the server's binary and use that\n\n  2. The extension will use markdown-oxide from path. To install to your path, there are the following methods for VSCode:\n\n     * Nix Unstable: pkgs.markdown-oxide\n\n### Zed\n\nMarkdown Oxide is available as an extension titled Markdown Oxide. Similarly\nto VSCode, there are two methods for this extension to access the language\nserver\n\n  1. Recommended: the extension will download the server's binary and use that\n\n  2. The extension will use markdown-oxide from path. To install to your path, there are the following methods for Zed:\n\n     * Nix Unstable: pkgs.markdown-oxide\n\nNote\n\nZed does not implement some of the language server protocol that this LS uses.\nNamely, unindexed block completions do not work at all. There are also other\nissues with the language server unique to Zed (such as completions being\nunexpectedly hidden). Over time, these issues will be resolved; for now, Zed\nprovides an interesting exhibition for a potential (beautiful + fast) note-\ntaking experience provided by markdown oxide\n\n### Helix\n\nFor Helix, all you must do is install the language server's binary to your\npath. The following installation methods are available:\n\n  * Nix Unstable: pkgs.markdown-oxide\n\nNote\n\nThere are some major issues with markdown oxide on helix as it does not fully\nimplement the language server protocol. Most obtrusive is that helix does not\nimplement is_incomplete for completions, and since completion filtering and\nsorting happens on the server (for performance), you must manually re-request\ncompletions after typing (one method I have found is to exit and re-enter\ninsert mode)\n\n## Linking Syntax\n\nThe linking syntax is that of Obsidian's and can be found here\nhttps://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links\n\nGenerally, this is [[relativeFilePath(#heading)?(|display text)?]] e.g.\n[[articles/markdown oxide#Features|Markdown Oxide Features]] to link to a\nheading in Markdown Oxide.md file in the articles folder or [[Obsidian]] for\nthe Obsidian.md file in the root folder. Markdown oxide also supports markdown\nlinks\n\n## Features\n\nNote\n\nTo interact with a file as a referenceable (for getting references, renaming,\nhover-view, ...), put your cursor/pointer anywhere on the markdown fide where\nthere is not another referenceable (heading, tag, ...).\n\n### Completions\n\n  * Subheading completions in the form [[file#heading#subheading]] from https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+heading+in+a+note (Note: right now you can link to subheadings through [[file#subheading]])\n  * Headings in the current file\n  * Metadata completions\n  * Dataview completions\n  * Metadata tag completions\n  * ```query``` code block completions\n  * Semantic Search unindexed block completions\n  * Contextual linking completions using vector database\n\n### References\n\nNote\n\nI strongly recommend using Lspsaga for references for two reasons. First\nbecause this LS sorts references by the date their files were modified and\nunlike vim.lsp.buf.references() and Telescope lsp_references, Lspsaga finder\nmaintains this sorting order. Second it also allows you to edit the references\nin place, similar to Logseq\n\n### Hover\n\nmarkdown-oxide provides a preview of the text for an item (if there is any) as\nwell as a snapshot of the backlinks to the item (if applicable). You can hover\nover both references and referenceables -- hover over headings and links to\nheadings; as well as files and links to files.\n\nIn the hover, several backlines to the referenceable are listed, ordered by\ndate modified.\n\nNote\n\nI write most of the content for a note not in the note itself, but in\nbacklinks to the note; I also write in notes at times. Assuming content is\nboth in backlinks and in written text, hover packages text and backlinks\ntogether to give a true preview of a referenceable.\n\n### Code Actions\n\n  * Link suggestions (by text match or other)\n  * Refactoring: Move headers or selections to a new file\n  * Link an unlinked reference\n  * Link all unlinked references to a referenceable\n\n### Diagnostics\n\n  * Unresolved reference\n  * Unlinked reference\n\n### Symbols\n\n  * File symbols: Headings and subheadings\n  * Workspace headings: everything linkable: files, headings, tags, ... Like a good search feature\n  * Lists and indented lists\n\n### Rename\n\n### Daily Notes\n\nDaily Note completions relative to the current date\n\n## Config\n\nMarkdown-Oxide supports several configuration options. All can be specified in\na ~/.config/moxide/settings.toml or .moxide.toml file and moxide tries to\nimport some settings (daily notes formatting) from Obsidian directly. Here are\nthe options with the defaults\n\n    \n    \n    # Leave blank to try to import from Obsidian Daily Notes # Formatting from https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html dailynote = \"%Y-%m-%d\" # this is akin to YYYY-MM-DD from Obsidian # Fuzzy match file headings in completions heading_completions = true # Set true if you title your notes by the first heading # Right now, if true this will cause completing a file link in the markdown style # to insert the name of the first heading in the display text area # [](file) -> [first heading of file.md](file) # If false, [](file) -> [](file) (for example) title_headings = true # Show diagnostics for unresolved links; note that even if this is turned off, # special semantic tokens will be sent for the unresolved links, allowing you # to visually identify unresolved links unresolved_diagnostics = true semantic_tokens = true # Resolve tags in code blocks tags_in_codeblocks = true # Resolve references in code blocks references_in_codeblocks = true\n\n## Alternatives\n\nI love open-source and all open-source authors!! I also believe healthy\ncompetition is good! Markdown-Oxide is competing with some alternatives, and I\nwant to make it the best at its job!!\n\nHere are the alternatives (open source authors are welcome to make PRs to add\ntheir projects here!)\n\n  * https://github.com/gw31415/obsidian-lsp: I have been in discussions with the author; The author doesn't have time to maintain the project. Also, I, of course, love the idea, but the current LS doesn't provide many obsidian-specific features yet.\n  * https://github.com/WhiskeyJack96/logseqlsp: This is a cool project and a great inspiration for Logseq support (which is upcoming). status: it doesn't seem that it is maintained and it (obviously) does not provide support for all of the obsidian syntax\n  * The og https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman: I used this for a while, but it is not obsidian specific and didn't act well with my vault. Additionally, the block completions in markdown-oxide allow for a fuzzy/grep search of the entire vault to generate the completions; I don't think Markman has any features like this; (this is a feature that Logseq signified for PKM; the concept that anything is linkable is quite powerful)\n\n## \\---The--bottom--line--------------------------------------------------\n\nListen. I really like Vim motions. I also really love low-latency terminal\nediting. I very much so also like my Neovim LSP plugins, keymappings, and\nconfig. But Wow! I also like using Obsidian and Logseq. Can't I just have it\nall??? Can't I be whisked away by the flow of Neovim while also experiencing\nthe beauty of Obsidian???? Can't I detail my tasks on the CLI while viewing\nthem in Logseq????? Well, I thought I could; now for us all, there is\nmarkdown-oxide (which is still very pre-beta fyi)\n\n## About\n\nLet's record your consciousness! Bring your own text editor!
