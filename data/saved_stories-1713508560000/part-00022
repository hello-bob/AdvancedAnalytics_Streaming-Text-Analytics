The New York Times reported that neural data is\nincreasingly being collected and sold nationwide. And after a market analysis\nshowed that investments in neurotechnology leapt by 60 percent globally from\n2019 to 2020\u2014and were valued at $30 billion in 2021\u2014Big Tech companies have\nsignificantly intensified plans to develop their own products to rake in\npotentially billions.\n\nFor instance, in 2023, Meta demoed a wristband with a neural interface used to\ncontrol its smart glasses and unveiled an AI system that could be used to\ndecode the mind. In January, Elon Musk announced that Neuralink implanted its\nfirst brain chip in a human that can be used to control a device with their\nthoughts. And just last month, Apple Insider reported that \"Apple is working\non technology that could turn the Apple Vision Pro into a brainwave reader to\nimprove mental health, assist with training and workouts, and help with\nmindfulness.\"\n\nMany technologies collect neural data for a variety of purposes, The Times\nreported. The tech has gone from inspiring medical uses leading to\nbreakthrough treatments to personal uses like monitoring brain activity to\nhelp people meditate or interpreting brain signals to try to help users find\nbetter matches on dating apps. But not every user understands exactly how\ntheir neural data may otherwise be used.\n\nColorado's law requires tech companies to gain consent to collect neural data\nand to be more transparent about how such data is used. Additionally, it must\nbe easy for people to access, delete, or correct any neural data gathered that\ncould be used\u2014either on its own or in combination with other personal\ndata\u2014\"for identification purposes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies must also provide paths for users to opt out of the sale of their\nneural data or use of their data in targeted advertising. \"Tracking a person's\nbrain activity in real time\" could give Big Tech the ultimate tool for\ntargeted ads by theoretically offering \"a more reliable, more precise, and\npersonalized representation of an ad\u2019s effectiveness,\" Undark reported.\n\nThrough neurotechnologies, companies \"have access to the records of the users\u2019\nbrain activity\u2014the electrical signals underlying our thoughts, feelings, and\nintentions,\" NYT reported, but until now, they've gone largely unregulated in\nthe US.\n\nIn Colorado, Democratic State Representative Cathy Kipp pushed for the privacy\nlaw updates by introducing a bill after a member of the board of directors of\nthe Colorado Medical Society, Sean Pauzauskie, told her about loopholes in\nstate laws.\n\nPauzauskie has since become medical director of The Neurorights Foundation, a\ncharitable organization dedicated to promoting ethical neurotechnology\ninnovation while protecting human rights. The Times noted that advancements in\nneurotechnology have helped paralyzed patients communicate through computers,\nwhich are widely viewed as important medical breakthroughs that critically\nrely on tech-monitoring brainwaves.\n\nKipp's bill warned that neural data \"can reveal intimate information about\nindividuals, including health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive\nfunction\" but \"outside of medical settings\" can \"operate without regulation or\ndata protection standards.\"\n\n\u201cThe things that people can do with this technology are great,\u201d Kipp told NYT.\n\u201cBut we just think that there should be some guardrails in place for people\nwho aren\u2019t intending to have their thoughts read and their biological data\nused.\u201d\n\nKipp told NYT that her concern in passing Colorado's law was ensuring that\nnobody's brain activity was being monitored without consent. In a report,\nNeurorights has warned that companies seem to have lax stances when it comes\nto sharing neural data.\n\nNeurorights surveyed privacy policies and user agreements of 30 consumer\nneurotechnology companies, finding that all but one company had access to\nneural data and two-thirds of companies were sharing neural data with third\nparties. Two companies implied they are selling data. Only one company\nrestricted access to neural data, and four companies clearly stated they do\nnot sell neural data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Hurdles to federal brainwave data protection\n\nCurrently, similar legislation is advancing in California and has been\nintroduced in Minnesota, but while Colorado's bill passed unanimously, there\nhas been some notable opposition that could stop the country from embracing\nColorado's privacy standards.\n\nSome opposition comes from academic researchers. According to a co-sponsor of\nColorado's bill, Republican State Representative Mark Baisley, private\nuniversities fiercely opposed the law because it potentially limited their\n\"ability to train students who are using 'the tools of the trade in neural\ndiagnostics and research' purely for research and teaching purposes,\" NYT\nreported.\n\nOther opponents include tech companies. TechNet, which represents companies\nlike Apple, OpenAI, and Meta, pushed for changes in a parallel Colorado bill.\nTechNet won a battle to update the bill text to include language \"focusing the\nlaw on regulating brain data used to identify individuals,\" NYT reported, but\nlost a battle to ditch \"very broad\" language relating to data generated by \u201can\nindividual\u2019s body or bodily functions,\u201d which Colorado's law now includes.\n\nThe ACLU raised concerns about limiting the law to only cover data that can be\nused to identify individuals, which Colorado's law currently does, instead\nrecommending policy that restricts all biometric data collection, retention,\nstorage, and use. In Colorado, this limitation means that companies that don't\nspecifically collect brainwave data for identification purposes\u2014but for other\npurposes such as decoding someone's thoughts or feelings\u2014won't be impacted by\nthe law.\n\nBut although it's maybe not a perfect privacy law, it's still progress,\nNeurorights co-founder Jared Genser told NYT.\n\n\"Given that previously neural data from consumers wasn\u2019t protected at all\nunder the Colorado Privacy Act, to now have it labeled sensitive personal\ninformation with equivalent protections as biometric data is a major step\nforward,\u201d Genser said.\n\nNeurorights is hoping that Colorado's law will inspire federal lawmakers to\ntake similar action soon.\n\nIn a post on X, Neurorights celebrated Colorado's law passing, \"declaring\nColorado the first place in world to legally define and protect neural data as\nsensitive.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n30\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
