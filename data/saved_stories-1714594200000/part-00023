Can you tell me why this darn\nprinter of mine won't work?\u201d\n\nQ: Why did you build this?\n\nWe're (Dvir Segev and Tal Hoffman) a couple of software engineers. Which\nautomatically makes our whole family think we also love doing tech support. So\nrather than focusing on building our startup, we were often finding ourselves\npicking up annoying phone calls to help them with technical issues.\n\nAnd while we love our family, those context switches are really annoying.\n\nWe thought, 'Why not get others to help our parents for us? Heck, we'd even\npay for it.' So, that's exactly what we did.\n\nQ: How it works?\n\nWe're building a network of tech-savvy people standing by 24/7 to answer every\ntech support issue. Your parents send us a message (SMS, WhatsApp or Email for\nthe time being), and we'll get our helpers to call them back immediately and\nhelp. These on-demand helpers get paid for their assistance, so it's easy for\nthem to make extra cash whenever they're free to help. You can become one as\nwell!\n\nQ: Why should my parents trust strangers?\n\nWe thoroughly vet each individual. Plus, we're currently developing a review\nsystem where users can submit reviews and rank helpers, allowing everyone to\nmake informed decisions before choosing assistance.\n\nQ: But, won't GenAI ultimately solve this?\n\nUltimately, it's about the personal touch and trust. While we are planning to\nutilize GenAI to enhance the platform (e.g., by transcribing past sessions so\nyou can always revisit them), we believe that, much like why your parents just\nwon't use Google, simply implementing GenAI won't completely solve the problem\nfor either of you.\n\nQ: How much does it cost?\n\nWe charge $5 for every call. $4 goes to the helper and we take the remaining\n$1.\n\nQ: How do you charge me and know my family phone numbers, etc.?\n\nThe first time you use Leo, we'll ask for your credit card info, the phone\nnumbers to support (e.g: yours or your parents), etc. After that, we know who\nyou are and everything's on autopilot.\n\nQ: How do you guarantee that my credit card number is safe and secure?\n\nWe will send you a Stripe-powered link that you can click to enter your credit\ncard number. We do not store your credit card number. All payment processing\nis handled by Stripe.\n\nQ: I want to sell my tech support services as well!\n\nGreat! Fill this form and we'll get back to you ASAP.\n\nQ: Who's Leo?\n\nDvir's beloved dog.\n\nEmail this address to get started:\n\nstart@askleo.io Send \"START\" to get started\n\nLeo is a service provided by Mellow Software, Inc.\n\nReach out at hello@askleo.io.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
