According to a recent Cornell study, over the last\nfour decades, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, net farm income decreased\nby 66%.\n\nFarmers in developed countries can often rely on big datasets and risk\nmanagement tools to help reduce the impacts of extreme heat on their yield and\nincome. But in developing countries, data is scarce, and it is often difficult\nto accurately measure crop yield.\n\nIn a paper appearing in Environmental Research Letters, the scientists suggest\nusing satellite photos to remotely measure solar-induced chlorophyll\nfluorescence (SIF) as a way of assessing and predicting crop yield. Using\nsample fields of corn in the U.S. and wheat in India, the scientists have hit\nupon an approach that should, in principle, work universally for any crop,\naccording to Ying Sun, a co-author and associate professor of soil and crop\nsciences in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS).\n\nChlorophyll fluorescence is the reddish light re-emitted by photosynthetic\ntissues and organisms, she said, a measurement that serves as a proxy of\nphotosynthetic energy conversion in plants.\n\n\"It won't tell you how many ears of corn are in a field,\" she said, \"but step\none is to model photosynthesis from fluorescence. Crop yield depends on\nphotosynthesis. Here we have a mechanistic model, which is very important.\"\n\nCo-author Chris Barrett, the Stephen B. and Janice G. Ashley Professor of\nApplied Economics and Management in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied\nEconomics and Management, and in the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public\nPolicy, suggests this approach could be valuable for forecasting and\ntargeting: for making policy decisions, establishing crop insurance and even\nforecasting areas of poverty.\n\nThis strategy takes advantage of the growing availability of satellite data\nand is cheaper to use and faster to access than other yield-prediction\nmethods, he said.\n\n\"That's why I see this as promising. I can imagine this being helpful in\npredicting poverty at a village-level scale in rural areas where a lot of the\neconomy is driven by agriculture,\" he said. \"Those are places we have had a\nhard time collecting data and where things can change very quickly. If we're\ntrying to take scarce resources and redirect them where they are going to have\nthe biggest impact, this could be helpful.\"\n\nThis tool could be employed to help food assistance organizations and\nnongovernmental agencies be more fleet of foot in providing aid, Barrett said.\n\nSun said she and her colleagues are working on further research that would\nallow this kind of tool in the future to be used in real time to allow farmers\nto react, adjusting things like soil amendments or irrigation strategies to\nimprove a current harvest's health and productivity.\n\nIn the U.S., the Department of Agriculture and other institutions provide\nenormous amounts of harvest data. Increasingly, machine learning models are\nbeing employed to make predictions, said lead author Oz Kira, of Ben-Gurion\nUniversity of the Negev in Israel, and formerly a post-doc in Sun's lab, but\nthese models presuppose similar environmental condition.\n\nKira suggests using chlorophyll fluorescence satellite data will allow for\nchanging conditions.\n\n\"If growing conditions change, it's possible that predictions aren't\napplicable,\" Kira said. \"In our case, we are not basing our models on prior\nobservation. This can take climate change into account.\"\n\nThe study's co-authors include Jiaming Wen, Ph.D.; Jimei Han, a postdoctoral\nresearcher in Sun's lab; Andrew McDonald, associate professor in the School of\nIntegrative Plant Science and the Department of Global Development (CALS);\nAriel Ortiz-Bobea, associate professor of applied economics and policy (Dyson\nand Brooks School); and Yanyan Liu, adjunct professor (Dyson).\n\nMore information: Oz Kira et al, A scalable crop yield estimation framework\nbased on remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\nEnvironmental Research Letters (2024).
