They should\n> reward the first quarter and the hundredth.\n\nBushnell came up with the concept based on his experience with his first game\nComputer Space in 1971. Its controls were based on four otherwise equivalent-\nlooking buttons but with different functions, and Bushnell found that this had\nconfused players that were trying to learn the game due to their lack of\nfamiliarity with these types of controls. Bushnell kept this in mind in\ndesigning their future games, such as in Pong and Asteroids, to keep the\ncontrols simple and easy to grasp while maintaining a challenging\ngameplay.^[2]^[3] The concept is also similar to a philosophy developed by\nGeorge Parker, the founder of board game publisher Parker Brothers. Parker had\nsaid that \"Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough\nfor most people to understand. Finally, each game should be so sturdy that it\ncould be played time and again, without wearing out.\"^[1]\n\nThis principle is also referred to with the sentence \"easy to learn, hard [or\nalmost impossible] to master\",^[4] which has been adopted by Blizzard\nEntertainment as a motto and design principle.^[1]^[5]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Learning curve\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Bogost, Ian (April 2, 2009). \"Persuasive Games: Familiarity, Habituation, and Catchiness\".
