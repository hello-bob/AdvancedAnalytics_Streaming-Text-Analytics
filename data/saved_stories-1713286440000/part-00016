We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence\nmodeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of\nMega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces\nmultiple technical components to improve its capability and stability,\nincluding complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization\nlayer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual\nconfiguration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon\nachieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion\nparameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss\nof 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).
