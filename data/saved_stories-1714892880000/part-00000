It\u2019s how we\nsign up for accounts, get notifications, and communicate with a wide range of\nentities online. Critics of email rightfully point out that email suffers from\na significant number of flaws that make it less than ideal, but that doesn\u2019t\nchange the current reality. In light of that reality, I believe that an\nencrypted email provider is a must-have for everyone in today\u2019s age of rampant\ndata breaches, insider threats, warrantless police access, and targeted\nadvertising. If I can get access to your emails, I can get a range of\nsensitive information including where you bank (to craft more convincing\nphishing attacks), information about pets (I get notifications each year from\nthe vet for my cats\u2019 annual checkups), calendar reminders, news announcements\nfrom family, support tickets from services you use, and more. In a worse case\nscenario, if I get access to the account itself, it\u2019s trivial to simply issue\npassword reset requests for nearly any of those accounts, have it to sent to\nsaid compromised email account, and gain access to a wide number of other\naccounts you use \u2013 from banking to shopping and more \u2013 for any number of\nreasons. So this week, let\u2019s look into the top encrypted email providers The\nNew Oil recommends and their features to help decide which one is right for\nyou.\n\nBefore I offer my suggestions, I should take a moment to explain how I define\n\u201csecure\u201d email since marketing can mean basically anything. \u201cSecure email,\u201d to\nme, means an email provider who enforces zero-knowledge encryption; that is to\nsay a provider who cannot access your emails as they're sitting in your inbox.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply pinky promise to respect your privacy. If they can\naccess your data, so can an attacker who gains access whether a cybercriminal,\na crooked employee, or a government with a court order. Likewise, services\nshould apply that encryption automatically wherever possible. The onus should\nnot be upon the users for you to go generate your own PGP keys (or whatever\nsecurity protocol the provider is built upon) and apply it yourself. I also\nexpect the clients (aka apps) of the service to be source available so that\nqualified, interested parties can verify that everything is implemented\ncorrectly and doing what it claims to. Security is important and easy to mess\nup. Readers can see my full list of criteria here.\n\nNotes: This list is in alphabetical order. It also contains affiliate links\nthat will help support us if you choose to use one of these services, however\nstandard links are also provided for those who are uncomfortable with\naffiliate links.\n\n## Proton\n\nNon-Affiliate Link\n\nImage courtesy of Proton\n\nProton is by far the biggest name in the privacy space, particularly when it\ncomes to email and VPN, though in recent years they\u2019ve begun to roll out a\nfull suite of products like cloud storage, a calendar, and a password manager.\nProton is aiming to become a user-friendly all-in-one suite, a great\nreplacement for Google or Apple geared toward mainstream users. Of course,\nthere is something to be said for not putting all your eggs in one basket, but\nfor those who prefer the ecosystem approach to their services, Proton is a\npowerful service. In addition, Proton is compatible with PGP, meaning that\nother PGP users can initiate a secure conversation with you even if they\u2019re\nnot Proton users (though you will have to dig through the settings to find\nyour public key first). Proton offers a free tier you can use to test it out\nif you so choose.\n\nThe main drawback of Proton \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 is feature parity. Proton\noperates under the philosophy of \u201cif something is usable, why wait to publish\nit?\u201d As such, they are notorious for publishing apps that \u2013 while functional \u2013\nare still missing a number of features and need fine-tuning. On the plus side,\nthis allows them to prioritize much-wanted features thanks to the immediate\nfeedback from the community. On the other hand, this often results in\nsituations where a feature in the iPhone app is missing from the Android app\n(or vice versa) or a Windows app is available while Mac and Linux are still in\nbeta (if available at all).\n\n## Tuta\n\nImage courtesy of Tuta\n\nTuta \u2013 formerly Tutanota \u2013 is Proton\u2019s main competitor, and unlike many\ncompetitors in the tech space they do actually set themselves apart quite\nconsiderably. Tuta is based out of Germany and currently offers a calendar in\naddition to their email. On the user-facing end, Tuta users will notice a much\nmore consistent user experience across the board compared to Proton: all the\napps should more or less have the same features regardless of your operating\nsystem. Behind the scenes, Tuta is not based on PGP (you can see more details\nhere for technical readers). The advantage of Tuta's encryption implementation\nis that it protects more metadata than traditional PGP, such as the email\nsubject line. The drawback, however, means that only other Tuta users can\ninitiate an end-to-end encrypted conversation with you.\n\nProton and Tuta are the two most popular encrypted email providers, and with\ngood cause. They check all the boxes and users really can\u2019t go wrong with\neither. Originally I was hoping to list three or four more options, but out of\nall the other popular choices in the privacy community, I couldn't find any\nthat were zero-knowledge by default (and had open registration). That's\nunfortunate because privacy and security aren\u2019t always black and white. I hate\ngiving users only two choices of provider. Unfortunately, at this time, Proton\nand Tuta are the most user-friendly, reputable, and trustworthy services I can\nrecommend to mainstream readers. That's not to say that there aren't other\nservices that are trustworthy, but they may require additional setup or come\nwith caveats that make me uncomfortable to recommend them to my target\naudience.\n\nA common criticism of encrypted email among hardcore privacy enthusiasts is\nthat very few people use it, and therefore a copy of your correspondence is\nstill accessible with the provider of whoever you\u2019re speaking to. While\ntechnically correct, I personally think this is a poor excuse. Having one weak\nspot in your armor is preferable to having two (or simply not wearing armor\naltogether). When you ask these same people for a solution, the response is\ninvariably along the lines of \u201cpeople should be using something like Signal\ninstead.\u201d While that would be nice, my bank isn\u2019t going to Signal me\nnotifications. Or my veterinarian, or a job interview, or a receipt for an\nonline purchase, and so on. At least, not any time soon. I have a longstanding\nchallenge to show me the person who functions in modern western society \u2013 has\na job, pays bills, has a social life, etc \u2013 without email (truly without\nemail, not \u201cmy grandpa never uses it, my grandma handles it for him.\u201d That\u2019s\nlike arguing that Joe Biden isn\u2019t on Twitter because he doesn\u2019t personally\ncraft and post tweets.) To date, nobody has produced such a person. Like it or\nnot, email is a critical component of modern digital life. Perhaps that will\nchange someday, and if it does I\u2019ll be quite happy to revise my stance. But\nfor now, it\u2019s a necessary evil and therefore one we should endeavor to protect\naccordingly. If you\u2019re not using an encrypted email provider, I strongly to\nencourage you to start immediately. There are plenty of other great providers\nout there for more advanced users who want different features, but for most\nmainstream users one of the choices on this list will be a great place to\nstart. Until something better comes along, email is a critical part of your\ndigital identity and should be protected accordingly.\n\n(Note: the original draft of this blog post recommended Startpage as an\nhonorable mention.
