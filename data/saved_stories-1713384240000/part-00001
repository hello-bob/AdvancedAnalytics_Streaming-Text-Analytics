This will allow block direction alignment without needing to\ncreate a flex or grid layout.\n\nCelebration: This web feature is now available in all three major browser\nengines, and becomes Baseline Newly Available as of April 16, 2024.\n\nBrowser Support\n\n  * 123\n  * 123\n  * 125\n  * 17.4\n\nThe once impossible task of centering an item vertically was made easier by\nflexbox and grid, along with the align-content property. However, it did\ninvolve creating a flex or grid layout for no other reason than to do this\nalignment. The property was specified for block layout, and in the past few\nmonths all three major engines have shipped the feature.\n\nWith align-content available for block layout, you can achieve vertical\nalignment without needing to create a flex or grid layout for the property to\nwork. No additional properties are needed as the item remains a block item,\nthe only change is to the alignment.\n\nThe align-content property centers the heading vertically within a block\ncontainer.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.
