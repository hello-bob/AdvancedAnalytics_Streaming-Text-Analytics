The study found that abnormal neuronal activities\npost-injury lead to excessive breakdown of triglycerides in fat tissue,\nreleasing harmful compounds into organs like the liver.\n\nBy administering gabapentin, a nerve pain medication, researchers successfully\nprevented these metabolic effects in animal models. This discovery could pave\nthe way for new treatments that mitigate the secondary health issues caused by\nspinal injuries.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The study identifies a link between spinal cord injuries and metabolic dysfunctions due to abnormal neuronal activity affecting fat tissue.\n  2. Gabapentin was effective in normalizing metabolic functions in mice by inhibiting problematic neural proteins and preventing the excessive breakdown of fats.\n  3. Despite its benefits, gabapentin induced insulin resistance, prompting researchers to adjust dosing strategies to retain therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects.\n\nSource: Ohio State University\n\nConditions such as diabetes, heart attack and vascular diseases commonly\ndiagnosed in people with spinal cord injuries can be traced to abnormal post-\ninjury neuronal activity that causes abdominal fat tissue compounds to leak\nand pool in the liver and other organs, a new animal study has found.\n\nAfter discovering the connection between dysregulated neuron function and the\nbreakdown of triglycerides in fat tissue in mice, researchers found that a\nshort course of the drug gabapentin, commonly prescribed for nerve pain,\nprevented the damaging metabolic effects of the spinal cord injury.\n\nResults also showed an increase in blood flow in fat tissue and recruitment of\nimmune cells to the environment. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nGabapentin inhibits a neural protein that, after the nervous system is\ndamaged, becomes overactive and causes communication problems \u2013 in this case,\naffecting sensory neurons and the abdominal fat tissue to which they\u2019re\nsending signals.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is maladaptive reorganization of the sensory system that\ncauses the fat to undergo changes, initiating a chain of reactions \u2013\ntriglycerides start breaking down into glycerol and free fatty acids that are\nreleased in circulation and taken up by the liver, the heart, the muscles, and\naccumulating, setting up conditions for insulin resistance,\u201d said senior\nauthor Andrea Tedeschi, assistant professor of neuroscience in The Ohio State\nUniversity College of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThrough administration of gabapentin, we were able to normalize metabolic\nfunction.\u201d\n\nThe study is published today (April 24, 2024) in Cell Reports Medicine.\n\nPrevious research has found that cardiometabolic diseases are among the\nleading causes of death in people who have experienced a spinal cord injury.\n\nThese often chronic disorders can be related to dysfunction in visceral white\nfat (or adipose tissue), which has a complex metabolic role of storing energy\nand releasing fatty acids as needed for fuel, but also helping keep blood\nsugar levels at an even keel.\n\nEarlier investigations of these diseases in people with neuronal damage have\nfocused on adipose tissue function and the role of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem \u2013 nerve activity known for its \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, but also a\nregulator of adipose tissue that surrounds the abdominal organs.\n\nInstead, Debasish Roy \u2013 a postdoctoral researcher in the Tedeschi lab and\nfirst author on the paper \u2013 decided to focus on sensory neurons in this\ncontext. Tedeschi and colleagues have previously shown that a neuronal\nreceptor protein called alpha2delta1 is overexpressed after spinal cord\ninjury, and its increased activation interferes with post-injury function of\naxons, the long, slender extensions of nerve cell bodies that transmit\nmessages.\n\nIn this new work, researchers first observed how sensory neurons connect to\nadipose tissue under healthy conditions, and created a spinal cord injury\nmouse model that affected only those neurons \u2013 without interrupting the\nsympathetic nervous system.\n\nExperiments revealed a cascade of abnormal activity within seven days after\nthe injury in neurons \u2013 though only in their communication function, not their\nregrowth or structure \u2013 and in visceral fat tissue.\n\nExpression of the alpha2delta1 receptor in sensory neurons increased as they\nover-secreted a neuropeptide called CGRP, all while communicating through\nsynaptic transmission to the fat tissue \u2013 which, in a state of dysregulation,\ndrove up levels of a receptor protein that engaged with the CGRP.\n\n\u201cThese are quite rapid changes. As soon as we disrupt sensory processing as a\nresult of spinal cord injury, we see changes in the fat,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cA\nvicious cycle is established \u2013 it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re pressing the gas pedal\nso your car can run out of gas but someone else continues to refill the tank,\nso it never runs out.\u201d\n\nThe result is the spillover of free fatty acids and glycerol from fat tissue,\na process called lipolysis, that has gone out of control. Results also showed\nan increase in blood flow in fat tissue and recruitment of immune cells to the\nenvironment.\n\n\u201cThe fat is responding to the presence of CGRP, and it\u2019s activating\nlipolysis,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cCGRP is also a potent vasodilator, and we saw\nincreased vascularization of the fat \u2013 new blood vessels forming as a result\nof the spinal cord injury. And the recruitment of monocytes can help set up a\nchronic pro-inflammatory state.\u201d\n\nSilencing the genes that encode the alpha2delta1 receptor restored the fat\ntissue to normal function, indicating that gabapentin \u2013 which targets\nalpha2delta1 and its partner, alpha2delta2 \u2013 was a good treatment candidate.\n\nTedeschi\u2019s lab has previously shown in animal studies that gabapentin helped\nrestore limb function after spinal cord injury and boosted functional recovery\nafter stroke.\n\nBut in these experiments, Roy discovered something tricky about gabapentin:\nThe drug prevented changes in abdominal fat tissue and lowered CGRP in the\nblood \u2013 and in turn prevented spillover of fatty acids into the liver a month\nlater, establishing normal metabolic conditions. But paradoxically, the mice\ndeveloped insulin resistance \u2013 a known side effect of gabapentin.\n\nThe team changed drug delivery tactics, starting with a high dose and tapering\noff \u2013 and stopping after four weeks.\n\n\u201cThis way, we were able to normalize metabolism to a condition much more\nsimilar to control mice,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThis suggests that as we discontinue\nadministration of the drug, we retain beneficial action and prevent spillover\nof lipids in the liver. That was really exciting.\u201d\n\nFinally, researchers examined how genes known to regulate white fat tissue\nwere affected by targeting alpha2delta1 genetically or with gabapentin, and\nfound both of these interventions after spinal cord injury suppress genes\nresponsible for disrupting metabolic functions.\n\nTedeschi said the combined findings suggest starting gabapentin treatment\nearly after a spinal cord injury may protect against detrimental conditions\ninvolving fat tissue that lead to cardiometabolic disease \u2013 and could enable\ndiscontinuing the drug while retaining its benefits and lowering the risk for\nside effects.\n\nFunding: This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of\nNeurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institutes of Health, and\nby the Chronic Brain Injury program at Ohio State.\n\nCo-authors, all from Ohio State, were Elliot Dion, Jesse Sepeda, Juan Peng,\nSai Rishik Lingam, Kristy Townsend, Andrew Sas and Wenjing Sun.\n\n## About this spinal cord injury and metabolism research news\n\nAuthor: Emily Caldwell Source: Ohio State University Contact: Emily Caldwell \u2013\nOhio State University Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access. \u201c\u03b12\u03b41-mediated maladaptive sensory plasticity\ndisrupts adipose tissue homeostasis following spinal cord injury\u201d by Andrea\nTedeschi et al. Cell Reports Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\n\u03b12\u03b41-mediated maladaptive sensory plasticity disrupts adipose tissue\nhomeostasis following spinal cord injury\n\n## Highlights\n\n  * SCI exacerbates lipolysis in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT)\n  * SCI leads to increased \u03b12\u03b41 expression in CGRP-positive DRG neurons innervating eWAT\n  * Cacna2d1 conditional deletion in DRG neurons normalizes eWAT lipolysis after SCI\n  * \u03b12\u03b41 blockade via gabapentin administration normalizes eWAT lipolysis after SCI\n\n## Summary\n\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) increases the risk of cardiometabolic disorders,\nincluding hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Not only does\nSCI lead to pathological expansion of adipose tissue, but it also leads to\nectopic lipid accumulation in organs integral to glucose and insulin\nmetabolism. The pathophysiological changes that underlie adipose tissue\ndysfunction after SCI are unknown.\n\nHere, we find that SCI exacerbates lipolysis in epididymal white adipose\ntissue (eWAT).\n\nWhereas expression of the \u03b12\u03b41 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels\nincreases in calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive dorsal root ganglia\nneurons that project to eWAT, conditional deletion of the gene encoding \u03b12\u03b41\nin these neurons normalizes eWAT lipolysis after SCI.\n\nFurthermore, \u03b12\u03b41 pharmacological blockade through systemic administration of\ngabapentin also normalizes eWAT lipolysis after SCI, preventing ectopic lipid\naccumulation in the liver.\n\nThus, our study provides insight into molecular causes of maladaptive sensory\nprocessing in eWAT, facilitating the development of strategies to reduce\nmetabolic and cardiovascular complications after SCI.\n\nTags\n\nbrain researchmetabolic\ndisordersmetabolismneurobiologyNeurologyNeuroscienceOhio State\nUniversitySCIspinal cord injury\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
