It found sea spray levels were\nhundreds of thousands times higher than levels in the water.\n\nThe contaminated spray likely affects groundwater, surface water, vegetation,\nand agricultural products near coastlines that are far from industrial sources\nof PFAS, said Ian Cousins, a Stockholm University researcher and the study\u2019s\nlead author.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that the ocean can be an important source [of PFAS air\nemissions],\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt is definitely impacting the coastline.\u201d\n\nEPA has limited six \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 in drinking water \u2013 but there are\n15,000\n\nRead more\n\nPFAS are a class of 15,000 chemicals used across dozens of industries to make\nproducts resistant to water, stains and heat. Though the compounds are highly\neffective, they are also linked to cancer, kidney disease, birth defects,\ndecreased immunity, liver problems and a range of other serious diseases.\n\nThey are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down\nand are highly mobile once in the environment, so they continuously move\nthrough the ground, water and air. PFAS have been detected in all corners of\nthe globe, from penguin eggs in Antarctica to polar bears in the Arctic.\n\nThe Stockholm researchers several years ago found that PFAS from ocean waves\ncrashing are released into the air around shorelines, then can travel\nthousands of kilometers through the atmosphere before the chemicals return to\nland.\n\nThe new research looked at levels in the sea spray as waves crash by testing\nocean samples between Southampton in the UK and Chile. The chemicals\u2019 levels\nwere higher in the northern hemisphere in general because it is more\nindustrialized and there is not much mixing of water across the equator,\nCousins said.\n\nIt is unclear what the findings mean for human exposure. Inhalation of PFAS is\nan issue, but how much of the chemicals are breathed in, and air\nconcentrations further from the waves, is still unknown.\n\nPrevious non-peer-reviewed research has found a correlation between higher\nPFAS levels in vegetation samples and proximity to the ocean, Cousin said, and\nhis team is undertaking a similar study.\n\nHe said that the results showed how the chemicals are powerful surfactants\nthat concentrate on the surface of water, which helps explain why they move\nfrom the ocean to the air and atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe thought PFAS were going to go into the ocean and would disappear, but they\ncycle around and come back to land, and this could continue for a long time\ninto the future,\u201d he said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * PFAS\n  * Pollution\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
