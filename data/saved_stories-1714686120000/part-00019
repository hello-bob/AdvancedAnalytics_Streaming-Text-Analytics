I ended up seeing a number of job listings specifically for CIAM\nengineering. There were lots of repeats and recruiters shopping the same job,\nbut it still was interesting.\n\nI just did the search right now, and you can see a few:\n\n###\n\nJob Search Stats\n\nNow, LinkedIn job search is problematic. I get repeat listings, you can\u2019t tell\nif something is a direct hire or a recruiter casting a wide net, and the\nmatching algorithm offers up a grab bag. But let\u2019s take a look at these 24\nlistings, which I reviewed manually.\n\n  * 8 were duplicates. These were either the same organization posting multiple times or recruiters copy/pasting job requirements.\n\n  * Of the unique 16 jobs:\n\n    * 7 were for Okta (primarily, other identity stores were mentioned)\n\n    * 3 were for Forgerock\n\n    * 3 were for homegrown systems\n\n    * 2 were for Ping or PingOne\n\n  * Only 5 of the unique 16 jobs had a salary range.\n\n    * $100,000 was the minimum\n\n    * $270,000 was the maximum\n\n    * $188,280 was the average\n\n    * $151,500 was the median\n\n  * Of the unique 16 jobs, 9 were for consulting firms or recruiting firms. 7 were direct hires.\n\nWhile this is not a large dataset, this is indicative of the wide range of\nexperience and technologies that all qualify as CIAM engineers. The titles\nranged widely too.\n\nMost of these jobs involved implementation of existing identity store\nplatforms, but there are also jobs for homegrown systems or where the systems\nweren\u2019t specified.\n\n###\n\nOpenAI Is Hiring\n\nAn interesting one, not found on LinkedIn, is for OpenAI, where they are\nseeking a Senior Software Engineer, Identity Platform.\n\nThe requirements include:\n\n> Interest or experience with protocols such as OAuth 2.0, SAML, SCIM, and\n> OpenID Connect.\n>\n> Have industry experience with projects such as Hydra or Auth0, and languages\n> such as Python or Golang.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a lot more.\n\nBut be aware, they\u2019ve had this req open for at least four months (here\u2019s the\nfirst I heard about it) so they either:\n\n  * have too high a bar (they want to know \u201cWhat is your most significant technical achievement?\u201d as part of the application process)\n\n  * aren\u2019t serious about hiring or\n\n  * can\u2019t find the talent they need in SF (it is onsite there)\n\nOpenAI is currently paying Auth0 for auth (though probably not, as this\nTwitter user joked, $12T a year).\n\n###\n\nConclusion\n\nFinally, the fact that CIAM engineer turns up any results in job sites\nindicates there\u2019s demand for this skill set.\n\nPretty cool for a technology that didn\u2019t really exist 15 years ago.\n\nDan\n\n### Subscribe to CIAM Weekly\n\nBy Dan Moore \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nCustomer Identity and access management news and analysis.\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Jobs In CIAM\n\nciamweekly.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dan Moore\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
