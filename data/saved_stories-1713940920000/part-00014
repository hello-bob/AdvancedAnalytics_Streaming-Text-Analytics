As part of Google\u2019s Q1 2024 report, we will include the following\nupdate about the timeline for phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in the\nApril 26th report:\n\n> We are providing an update on the plan for third-party cookie deprecation on\n> Chrome.\n>\n> We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling\n> divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will\n> continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem. It's also critical\n> that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results\n> from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide\n> by the end of June. Given both of these significant considerations, we will\n> not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4.\n>\n> We remain committed to engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to\n> conclude that process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we\n> envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next\n> year.\n\nOnce published, you will be able to view both Google and the CMA\u2019s full\nreports here.\n\nTags:\n\n  * Privacy Sandbox for the Web\n  * Announcements\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
