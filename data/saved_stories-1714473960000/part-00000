Today, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's\niPadOS as a \"gatekeeper,\" meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the\nsame regulations as the iPhone.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nApple announces sweeping EU App Store policy changes\u2014including sideloading\n\nThe EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in\nSeptember 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the\nApp Store were all gatekeepers.\n\n\"Apple now has six months to ensure full compliance of iPadOS with the DMA\nobligations,\" reads the EU's blog post about the change.\n\nApple technically split the iPad's operating system from the iPhone's in 2019\nwhen it began calling its tablet operating system \"iPadOS\" instead of iOS. But\npractically speaking, little separates the two operating systems under the\nhood. Both iOS and iPadOS share the same software build numbers, they're\nupdated in lockstep (with rare exceptions), and most importantly for DMA\ncompliance purposes, they pull software from the same locked-down App Store\nwith the same Apple-imposed restrictions in place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApps distributed through alternate app stores or third-party websites will\nhave to abide by many of Apple's rules and will still generally be limited to\nusing Apple's public APIs. However, the ability to use alternate app stores\nand browser engines on the iPad's large screen (and the desktop-class M-series\nchips) could make the tablets better laptop replacements by allowing them to\ndo more of the things that Mac users can do on their systems.\n\nThough Apple has made multiple changes to iOS in the EU to comply with the\nDMA, EU regulators are already investigating Apple (as well as Google and\nMeta) for \"non-compliance.\" Depending on the results of that investigation,\nthe EU may require Apple to make more changes to the way it allows third-party\napps to be installed in iOS and to the way that third-party developers are\nallowed to advertise non-Apple app store and payment options. Any changes that\nApple makes to iOS to comply with the investigation's findings will presumably\ntrickle down to the iPad as well.\n\nOf course, none of this directly affects US-based iPhone or iPad users, whose\ndevices remain restricted to Apple's app stores and the WebKit browsing\nengine. That said, we have seen some recent App Store rule changes that have\narguably trickled down from Apple's attempts to comply with the DMA, most\nnotably policy changes that have allowed (some, not all) retro game console\nemulators into the App Store for the first time.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n124\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
