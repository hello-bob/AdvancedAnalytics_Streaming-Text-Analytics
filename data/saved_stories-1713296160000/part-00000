People have made these sites before and they will make them\nagain and as people in the comments note, it will have next to no effect. One\nof the reasons for that is a variant on how IPv6 has often had low user\nbenefits.\n\nAs a practical matter, almost all servers that people want to be generally\naccessible need to be accessible via IPv4, because there are still a lot of\nplaces and people that are IPv4 only (including us, for various reasons). And\nas the inverse version of this, practically everyone needs to be able to talk\nto public servers that are IPv4 only, even if this requires 6-to-4 carrier\ngrade NAT somewhere in the network. So people operating generally accessible\npublic servers can almost never go IPv6 only, and since they have to have to\nbe reachable through IPv4 and approximately everyone can talk to them over\nIPv4, adding IPv6 support has only a moderate benefit. Maybe some people can\navoid going through carrier grade NAT; maybe some people will get to feel\nnicer.\n\n(You can choose to operate a website or a service as IPv6 only, but in that\ncase you're cutting off a potentially significant amount of your general\naudience. This is not something that many site and service operators are\nenthusiastic about. Being IPv4 only has much less effects on your audience.\nThis is related to how IPv6 mostly benefits new people on the Internet, not\nincumbents. Of course IPv6 only can make sense if your target audience is\nnarrower and you happen to know that they all have working IPv6.)\n\nWhen you have a service feature that is merely nice instead of essential and\nwhich potentially involves some significant engineering complexity, is it any\nsurprise that many organizations put it rather far down their priority list?\nIn my view, it's basically what one would expect from both an engineering and\nbusiness perspective.\n\n(In my view the corollary to this is that general server side IPv6 adoption\ncould be best helped by some combination of making it easier to add IPv6 and\nmaking it more useful to have IPv6. Unfortunately a whole raft of historical\ndecisions make it hard to do much about the former, cf.)\n\n(2 comments.)\n\nWritten on 15 April 2024.\n\n| \u00ab| (Probably) forcing Git to never prompt for authentication  \n---|---  \n  \nThese are my WanderingThoughts (About the blog)\n\nFull index of entries Recent comments\n\nThis is part of CSpace, and is written by ChrisSiebenmann.
