It can also be helpful for\nfinding missed opportunities, as you can interact with your product in real-\ntime and then look back at all the events you hit -- or didn't!\n\n  * Product analytics\n\n### Langfuse integration for LLM insights\n\nMarketing Team\n\nWe've teamed up with Langfuse to track metrics for LLM applications. Langfuse\nis an open source solution for monitoring LLM applications. It tracks metrics\nsuch as model costs, latency, token usage, and more.\n\nCombining your Langfuse and PostHog data makes it easy to answer questions\nlike:\n\n    * What are my LLM costs by customer, model, and in total?\n    * How many of my users are interacting with my LLM features?\n    * Are there generation latency spikes?\n\nTo get started, view our docs on how to add the Langfuse PostHog integration.\n\n  * HogQL\n\n### All insights rebuilt in editable HogQL\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe'd previously rebuilt our Trends insights to be powered by HogQL, but now\nwe've gone a step further. All existing insight types have now been completely\nrebuilt too.\n\nAs well as bug fixes and speed improvements, this rebuild also means you can\nnow directly edit the SQL behind any insight. Dig deeply into your data and\nbuild more complex queries than ever before!\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### Voting for new PostHog features now available\n\nWebsite & Docs Team\n\nOur Webs & Docs team has pushed a number of big changes to the site as we\ncontinue to invest in our community tooling. This week, they've updated our\npublic roadmap so that you can now vote on upcoming features!\n\nVotes won't be the only thing we consider when planning our future projects,\nobviously. But we will be keeping a close eye on what features you want to\nsee.\n\nPlus, we've created a new WIP page so you can see when we do start work on new\nfeatures. You can subscribe to projects there for updates, as well as\nrequesting early access to private betas.\n\n  * HogQL\n\n### HogQL autocomplete added\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe've made HogQL a lot easier to use with the addition of autocomplete. You\ncan now start building your query and we'll automatically chime in with\nelements we think will be helpful.\n\nHogQL, for the uninitiated, is a wrapper around ClickHouse SQL. We've got a\nfew unique tweaks in there for efficiency and efficacy, but it is very\naccessible to anyone with existing knowledge of SQL.\n\nAnd now it's even more accessible!\n\nTry it out\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### PostHog becomes a DigitalOcean Hatch partner\n\nMarketing Team\n\nWe've teamed up with DigitalOcean and joined their Hatch program for startups,\nmeaning that eligible teams in the PostHog for Startups program can now claim\nan additional $25,000 of DigitalOcean infra credit in addition to the usual\nbenefits.\n\nAs a reminder, those usual benefits include $50,000 of PostHog credit, some\namazing gifts from our merch store, and an exclusive monthly newsletter with\nadvice for founders.\n\nTeams need to be less than two years old and have raised less than $5M in\nfunding to qualify, but if that's you then you can sign up today!\n\n  * Pricing & billing\n\n### Introducing the Teams plan: Get more features without having to \u201ctalk to\nsales\u201d\n\nGrowth Team\n\nWe've introduced a new pricing option which makes some advanced features\navailable to everyone. It\u2019s called Teams, and it's ideal for orgs which need\nenterprise features but also want the flexibility of a self-serve monthly\nplan. As always, you can see a breakdown of all plans on your billing page.\n\nWe think the Teams plan will be especially useful for any organizations that\nneed more teams-oriented features like project permissions and SSO or 2FA\nenforcement.\n\nIn addition to advanced security features, Teams also gives you collaboration\nto help teams work together more effectively, like dashboard tags. You\u2019ll also\nget priority customer support through the app.\n\nSome of these features were previously available on other plans, but we don\u2019t\nwant to take away features you were already. So, if you already use PostHog\nyou\u2019ll retain access to most features, including project permissions,\ndashboard tags and text cards. You\u2019ll also keep 2FA enforcement if you\u2019ve\nenabled it previously.\n\nAudit logs have moved wholly to the Teams plan, however, as they\u2019re a security\nand compliance feature \u2014 useful for businesses of a certain size, but not\nreally needed for early-stage orgs.\n\nWe think Teams improves PostHog by making advanced features and an enterprise-\nlevel support experience more widely available and flexible, but as always\nwe\u2019d love to hear your feedback.\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Client-side capture rate limiting added\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've added some new rate limiting systems to help to protect our users,\nourselves, and (more importantly) our users, from abnormal client behaviour.\nThat could mean anything from an accidental loop in the code, to someone\nrunning some strange scripts in the browser, to a bug.\n\nThis new rate limiting -- the details of which we're being deliberately coy\nabout -- is relaxed enough that it should only trigger in one of these\ninfinite loop or DDOS scenarios, but as always let us know if you have any\nfeedback.\n\n  * People & properties\n\n### Cohort creation improved\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nFeature success has made two small, but mightily important quality-of-life\nimprovements for when you create new cohorts.\n\nThe first is simply that we now tell you very clearly at the top of the page\nwhen your cohort was last calculated, so you can judge how accurate it is.\nCohorts are still normally recalculated every 24 hours, so we added that\ninformation too.\n\nThe second update is that now, when you specify an event, you can also add\nfilters and custom dates directly within the cohort creation. It's another\nsmall tweak which should hopefully greatly improve the speed at which you\nbuild cohorts.\n\n  * A/B testing\n\n### A/B testing UI improved\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nWe've just upgraded the UI for A/B testing significantly, making it easier to\nparse results and plan your experiments.\n\nImprovements include a better layout for results and some more actionable\ntooltips to help you setup tests for the best possible results. We're planning\nfurther improvements to come too, and even have a survey running on the A/B\ntest creation page to collect your ideas and feedback. Let us know what you\nthink!\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Overrides for replay sampling added\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've added a new option which enables you to override any replay sampling\nrules you've set up, so you can have greater control of which sessions you\nrecord.\n\nWhy would you want to override a rule you've already set? So you can, for\nexample, ensure that you always record sessions from certain users or groups!\n\nSampling overrides are especially useful if you want to use sampling to keep\ncosts down but also want to make sure you have a close eye on particularly\nvaluable users. Check the docs for more information on how to set it up.\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### Enterprise Mode launches\n\nWebsite & Docs Team\n\nEnterprise mode focuses on features over benefits, uses big words that make us\nseem smart, drives enterprise value by capturing leads, and delivers an\nindustry-leading whitepaper strategy to drive stakeholder alignment and\ncapital growth.\n\nHappy April fools!\n\n  * ### React Native v3 and Node v4 are now GA\n\nReplay Team\n\nManoel continues his slew of SDK updates, this time improving both our React\nNative v3 and Node v4 SDKs up to general availability.\n\nThis update actually includes a lot of smaller improvements, so we recommend\nchecking the React Native or Node repo changelogs for detailed updates.\n\n  * Product analytics\n\n### HogQL-powered insights\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe've rewritten all our insights in HogQL and are releasing them, starting\nwith trends.\n\nThis makes insights faster, more reliable, and enables advanced customization.\n\n## Mar\n\n2024\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Session replay support added for Flutter Web\n\nReplay Team\n\nSupposedly we've had session replay on Flutter Web environments for a while,\nbut it was actually a little broken due to a bug in RRWeb.\n\nWell, now we've fixed the bug.\n\nThat means session replay is now back and working as you'd expect on Flutter\nWeb environments. Enjoy!\n\n  * Feature flags\n\n### Customizable feature flag timeouts added\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nFollowing an incident earlier this month which briefly took down feature\nflags, we've added a new customizable timeout option for our Go, Ruby, Python,\nJS, React, and Node SDKs.\n\nBy default, flags will now timeout after 3 seconds, except for React-native\nwhich timesout at 10 seconds.\n\nYou can check the docs for info on how to customize timeout configs if needed,\nbut we think the defaults will suffice and help prevent future incidents.\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Window visibility support added for session replays\n\nReplay Team\n\nAre you someone who generally keeps a dozen different windows open at once and\nis constantly bouncing between them? You'd probably get on well with several\nof our engineers.\n\nYou'll also probably appreciate that we've added visibility support to session\nreplay, meaning that replay logs will automatically capture when a window is\nhidden (e.g. minimized out of view) or visible (e.g. maximised into view).\n\nCapturing window visibility is useful if you're interested in how often users\nmay be referring from one window to another, or other aspects of site\nusability. Give it a go!\n\n  * Product analytics\n\n### Exports now available as .xlsx (Excel format)\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nSometimes a .csv isn't enough. Sometimes you need a .xlsx for Microsoft Excel.\nAnd now you can get it when exporting from PostHog!\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Improved session replay filters and ordering\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe made it easier to apply common filters to session replays by adding the\nability to select any person property to act as a quick filter. You can then\ntoggle filters more easily and we'll persist your selections on a per user\nbasis.\n\nWe think this change will be broadly useful for everyone, as there are common\nfilters which teams tend to use a lot - such as country, email, or browser.\n\nWe've also introduced a new ordering option so that you can sort filtered\nrecordings according to their duration or number of console errors. Very handy\nfor finding problematic recordings quickly!\n\n  * People & properties\n\n### Exports side panel now in private beta\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe've launched a new closed beta which adds an export panel to the sidebar.\nThis isn't available to most users as it's still in the early stages, but we\nwanted to give you a sneak peek.\n\nCurrently, when you start an export it can take a while to prepare. It's\ninconvenient to just wait on the same page, so moving this to the sidebar lets\nyou continue with other work. When your export is ready the sidepanel will\nautomatically open and show you all your available and historic exports. This\nis per-user, not per-team.\n\nIf you've got other ideas for how we can improve exports, let us know in the\ncommunity!\n\n  * Events & actions\n\n### Autocapture now supports cut and copy events\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've seen a few feature requests which said it would be useful if we\nautocaptured when users cut or copy text on a page. So, we built it.\n\nThere were some nuances to how we approached this. Some users wanted to\ncollect events whenever text was selected on a page, for example, but we found\nthis to be far too noisy in testing.\n\nOur hope is that capturing the cut and copy events directly solves the problem\nat its root without noticeably increasing your event volume.\n\n## Feb\n\n2024\n\n  * Dashboards\n\n### Smarter tile sizing for dashboards\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe've updated many different tile types so that they now take up less space\nand are generally more flexible to resize on dashboards. Now you can have more\naesthetically pleasing dashboards!\n\nWe'd like to thank Oliver for letting us know this was an issue.\n\n  * People & properties\n\n### User agent detection improved\n\nReplay Team\n\nFollowing some reports that this wasn't working correctly for a user who had\nswitched providers, we've improved user agent detection to give more reliable\ninfo about which users are on desktop vs. mobile.\n\nIn addition to improving the matching for OS and devices we've also added\nmatching for WatchOS systems too.\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### PostHog site badges released\n\nWebsite & Docs Team\n\nAll aboard the PostHog badgewagon!\n\nWe've released a series of new site badges you can add to the footer of your\nsite, so everyone know you're using PostHog to build better products. It's\nlike being in a secret club, except open source.\n\n  * A/B testing\n\n### Graphs and significance calculation added for secondary metrics\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nYou've been able to add secondary metrics to A/B experiments in PostHog for a\nwhile, but we've now added much better reporting around them.\n\nThe new graphs and significance calculations will help you determine if there\nare knock-on effects to your experiments away from the primary metric.\n\nFor example, you may test a change to your sign-up flow to improve conversion\nas a primary metric, but you may also need to know about impact to activation\nas a secondary metric. Now you can understand both easily!\n\n  * Events & actions\n\n### PostHog Cloud SQL access\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nTo fully support our users on PostHog Cloud, we're working on a feature to\nallow direct SQL access to PostHog data, so that users may query it directly.\n\n  * Toolbar\n\n### Toolbar bundle size reduced by 61%\n\nReplay Team\n\nA few weeks ago Paul noticed that our toolbar was 2.2 MB of Javascript,\napproximately 500 kb of which was just syntax highlighting and formatting code\nthe feature would never use. You can see what that looks above.\n\nSo, Paul rolled up his sleeves, and set out to fix the issue. And...voila!\n\nThe new and improved toolbar.js is -61% smaller than before, dropping 1.37 MB\ndown to a little over 800 kb.\n\nLaunch the toolbar\n\n  * SDKs\n\n### Flutter gets support for multivariant flags and flag payloads\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've updated our Flutter SDK to v4.0.0, adding support for both multivariant\nflags and feature flag payloads.\n\nMultivariate flags are helpful because they enable a flag to return a key\ninstead of just true or false - which makes them useful for testing or\ndeploying complex changes where multiple variations are needed.\n\nPayloads, meanwhile, enable you to send additional information to your app\nwhen a flag is matched. This makes them useful for triggering simple changes,\nsuch as displaying a pop-up or notification.\n\nTry it out\n\n  * ### Path cleaning added to web analytics\n\nWeb Analytics Team\n\nThe web analytics beta continues to improve with new features such as path\ncleaning rules, which alias URLs together to make results more digestible.\n\nIf you're in the beta you can customize your path cleaning rules within your\nproduct analytics settings. Each rule is composed of an alias and a regex\npattern, so that any URL which matches the pattern is replaced with the alias.\n\nOur experience is that path cleaning is incredibly useful for reducing complex\ncommon URLs in web analytics, but try the beta for yourself and let us know\nwhat you think!\n\nJoin the beta\n\n  * SDKs\n\n### Session-based analytics added to iOS SDK\n\nReplay Team\n\nThe latest version of our iOS SDK, v3.1.0, will now automatically set\n$session_id, enabling the ability to do session-based analytics.\n\nWith $session_id set automatically it's now possible to delve into metrics\nsuch as the time a user spends on a page, or their average session duration.\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Recordings added to groups view\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've added a new Recordings tab to the Groups view within the People tool, so\nyou can effortlessly see all available recordings from a particular group.\n\nYou can use group analytics in a number of ways, but it is typically most\nuseful for B2B teams who want to collect multiple users into a single group\nthat represents an organization. That's how we use it at PostHog, anyway!\n\nTry it out\n\n  * Feature flags\n\n### Relative data operators added to feature flags\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nWe've added relative data operators to PostHog feature flags, meaning we now\ndefault to the correct operator type when needed.\n\nThis means that if you start targeting a feature flag by subscription_date,\nfor example, we'll automatically switch the operator type to a date format.\n\nTry it out\n\n  * ### Mobile analytics template added\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe've done a lot of work around mobile analytics recently, including updating\nour Android and iOS SDKs, so we felt it was about time we added a dedicated\ndashboard template for them too. You'll need to use either our React Native,\niOS, Android, or Flutter SDKs to use this template.\n\nThe mobile analytics template contains a selection of mobile-focused metrics,\nincluding overviews of your most common OS, device, app version, and more.\nIt's a great way to get an overview of your app adoption!\n\nTry it out\n\n  * More\n\n### PostHog becomes HIPAA compliant\n\nSales & CS Team\n\nWe're happy to announce that PostHog is now HIPAA compliant and offering\nBusiness Associate Agreements (BAAs) for teams on a PostHog Enterprise plan.\n\nEnterprise plans are an add-on for PostHog plan which cost $450 per month and\ninclude SAML and SSO enforcement, dedicated support, advanced permissioning,\nand other features for large orgs.\n\nHIPAA - or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, if you\nwant to be fancy - is a US legislation which applies mostly to healthcare\nproviders. It isn't something most teams need to concern themselves with, but\nnow those who do can get in touch with us to find out more!\n\nContact us\n\n  * ### Canvas capture added to session replays\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've now rolled canvas recording out as an opt-in feature available to all\nusers. This enables you to capture canvas elements within your session\nreplays.\n\nIt's important to note that there is currently no way to mask canvas elements,\nmeaning you may unintentionally capture personal information or PII.\n\nFor this reason, canvas capture is disabled by default and must be enabled via\nyour project options page.\n\nEnable canvas capture\n\n  * Product analytics\n\n### More informative error messages added\n\nProduct Analytics Team\n\nWe hope you haven't ever seen the error message above, but if you have then we\nhave good news: we've made it much more informative.\n\nThis error usually occurs either because a query was running for too long, or\nbecause a memory limit was hit. Both issues are generally caused by a query\nhaving an excessively large scope.\n\nIn either case, we'll now tell you exactly what the error was and give you\nsome prompts on how to fix it. Of course, you can still raise a support\nrequest if needed!\n\n  * SDKs\n\n### New Android and iOS SDKs released\n\nReplay Team\n\nAfter a short beta period, we've now released our Android and iOS SDKs into\ngeneral availability, making them available for all users as version 3.0.0.\n\nThese SDKs are a complete rework of the old, legacy versions and are more\nefficient than they were previously. The Android SDK has been rewritten in\nKotlin, while the iOS SDK is rewritten in Swift.\n\nBoth SDKs offer all the same features of the legacy versions, as well as some\nnew functionality such as feature flag payload support. The iOS SDK also\nsupports WatchOS and macOS for teams with products on those platforms.\n\nCheck the docs\n\n  * ### React Native SDK now supports macOS target\n\nReplay Team\n\nManoel continues to plug away at improving our React Native SDK and has now\nadded support for the macOS target in addition to his previous work.\n\nThere are still some things to be aware of when using the React Native SDK\nhowever, so be sure to check the docs for more information.\n\nCheck the docs\n\n## Jan\n\n2024\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Server timing reporting added to player inspector\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe now report server timings in the session replay player inspector, enabling\nyou to see information about the request-response cycle.\n\nIn the image above, for example, you can see that we spent 442ms waiting for\nthe first byte, 350ms of which was spent on gather_query_parts.\n\nServer timings like this are helpful for going deep into performance issues\nand discovering where delays occur, so you know where to focus performance\nimprovements.\n\nTry it out\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Browser network status reporting added to replays\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've increased the amount of information session replay is able to capture\nabout the network status of a user. You can now see the browser's reported\nnetwork status while watching a replay.\n\nThis is typically going to be helpful if you're trying to debug or investigate\ncertain types of error which a user may report as a result of losing their\nconnection. Previously we wouldn't explicitly identify their offline status,\nwhich could have caused confusion - but now we do!\n\nTry it out\n\n  * ### PostHog Flutter SDK now supports macOS\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe have updated our Flutter SDK to support the macOS target, which it didn't\npreviously. This is important if you use Flutter to deploy across multiple\nplatforms - previously it wouldn't install at all.\n\nThanks to Manoel for work on this, though he believes the SDK should speak for\nitself in place of a longer update.\n\n  * Configuration\n\n### React Native SDK now supports web target\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe have updated our React Native SDK to version 2.10.2, adding support for the\nReact Native Web target. Previously if you used the React Native SDK to deploy\nto web, it wouldn't work and would throw errors. Now it works seamlessly!\n\nThanks to Manoel for work on this SDK, who (still) believes the SDK should\nspeak for itself.\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### Severity selector added to in-app support\n\nSales & CS Team\n\nWe're making a lot of improvements to the way we provide support at the\nmoment. This includes publishing new FAQs to the forums, adding an automated\nCSAT email for closed tickets, and a new severity checker for the in-app\nsupport.\n\nThe severity checker will help us triage tickets by giving you the ability to\nself-select how critical the support enquiry is.\n\nIs it a feature request or piece of feedback that isn't totally urgent? Or is\nit a critical security issue that we need to solve today? We hope it's not the\nlatter.\n\nRequest support\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Network payload capture launched\n\nReplay Team\n\nEarlier this month we announced the first public beta of 2024, which enabled\nyou to capture network requests and response payloads in session replay. Now,\nit's out of beta and available for everyone!\n\nNetwork payload capture builds on top of the network calls and performance\ndata we already capture using PerformanceObserver, making it easier for you to\nunderstand performance issues and debug errors. Enable it in your Project\nSettings!\n\nEnable payload capture\n\n  * ### Capture network requests and responses in session replay\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe already capture network calls that are made and their performance data\nusing the browsers' built-in PerformanceObserver. Adding capture of requests,\nresponses, and status codes would allow our users to more thoroughly\nunderstand the behaviour of their applications.\n\n  * ### Feature flag scheduling released\n\nFeature Success Team\n\nWe've added the ability to schedule feature flags properties in PostHog,\nmeaning you can now enable, disable, or change the rollout conditions of a\nflag automatically.\n\nScheduled flag changes are especially useful if your release schedules fall\noutside of normal working hours, or if you work with remote teams in other\ntimezones. They're also useful for coordinating product launches in line with\nmarketing activities or announcements.\n\nYou can even add multiple scheduled changes to a single flag, which is handy\nif you want to organize staggered rollouts.\n\nSchedule some flags\n\n  * ### In-app status indicator added\n\nInfrastructure Team\n\nWe try our best to make PostHog as stable and reliable as possible but, to\nquote our handbook, \"Incidents are going to happen.\"\n\nWhen they do, we want to be as transparent and communicative as possible -\nthat's why we've added a in-app status indicator to the overflow menu in the\nsidebar. You can click it to go to our full status page for more information.\n\nWe hope you'll never need to check on the system status, and that the icon\nwill never be anything other than green, but...well, the handbook is usually\nright.\n\nCheck our status\n\n  * ### Project-based routing added\n\nInfrastructure Team\n\nWe have, after more than a year of planning and distractions, added project-\nbased routing into both US and EU environments. Your project ID is now always\nstored in the URL.\n\nThis is a major benefit for teams who have multiple PostHog projects set up\nbecause it makes links properly shareable with colleagues. You'll no longer\nget lost if you click a link from one project while logged in to a different\nproject.\n\n  * Pricing & billing\n\n### Data pipeline add-on launched\n\nGrowth Team\n\nIn order to better reflect the growing scope of our export functionality, and\nto give you more control over your bill, we've split batch exports out into\ntheir own add-on product: data pipelines.\n\nIf you're an existing user then we've automatically enabled the add-on to\navoid disruptions for your product. Your bill won't increase as a result\nbecause of the way we've balanced the pricing for both the add-on and product\nanalytics.\n\nIf you're a new user you'll need to enable the add-on from your billing page.\nAs always, pricing is based on usage.\n\nWe originally included export functionality as part of product analytics\nbecause it made it easier to get started with both features. However, that\nalso meant we were more expensive for users who didn't use exports. Our hope\nis that splitting exports into an add-on will give you more control over how\nyou use PostHog.\n\nView billing\n\n  * Session replay\n\n### Network payload capture beta launched\n\nReplay Team\n\nWe've already released the first public beta of 2024, which is now accessible\nvia the feature previews menu in PostHog.\n\nNetwork payload capture is a beta for session replay which, as the title\nsuggests, adds the ability to capture network request and response payload and\nheaders.

Now, a bit more than three-and-a-half years\nlater, and the standards body and its members are gearing up to release a\nfaster generation of DDR5 memory, which is being laid out in the newly updated\nJESD79-JC5 specification. The latest iteration of the DDR5 spec defines\nofficial DDR timing specifications up to 8800 MT/s, as well as adding some new\nfeatures when it comes to security.\n\nDiving in, the new specification outlines settings for memory chips (on all\ntypes of memory modules) with data transfer rates up to 8800 MT/s (AKA\nDDR5-8800). This suggests that all members of the JESD79 committee that sets\nthe specs for DDR5 \u2014 including memory chip makers and memory controller\ndesigners \u2014 agree that DDR5-8800 is a viable extension of the DDR5\nspecification both from performance and cost point of view. Meanwhile, the\naddition of higher speed bins is perhaps enabled by another JEDEC feature\nintroduced in this latest specification, which is the Self-Refresh Exit Clock\nSync for I/O training optimization.\n\nJEDEC DDR5-A Specifications  \n---  \nAnandTech| Data Rate MT/s| CAS Latency (cycles)| Absolute Latency (ns)| Peak\nBW GB/s  \nDDR5-3200| A| 3200| 22| 22| 22| 13.75| 25.6  \nDDR5-3600| A| 3600| 26| 26| 26| 14.44| 28.8  \nDDR5-4000| A| 4000| 28| 28| 28| 14| 32  \nDDR5-4400| A| 4400| 32| 32| 32| 14.55| 35.2  \nDDR5-4800| A| 4800| 34| 34| 34| 14.17| 38.4  \nDDR5-5200| A| 5200| 38| 38| 38| 14.62| 41.6  \nDDR5-5600| A| 5600| 40| 40| 40| 14.29| 44.8  \nDDR5-6000| A| 6000| 42| 42| 42| 14| 48  \nDDR5-6400| A| 6400| 46| 46| 46| 14.38| 51.2  \nDDR5-6800| A| 6800| 48| 48| 48| 14.12| 54.4  \nDDR5-7200| A| 7200| 52| 52| 52| 14.44| 57.6  \nDDR5-7600| A| 7600| 54| 54| 54| 14.21| 60.8  \nDDR5-8000| A| 8000| 56| 56| 56| 14| 64.0  \nDDR5-8400| A| 8400| 60| 60| 60| 14.29| 67.2  \nDDR5-8800| A| 8800| 62| 62| 62| 14.09| 70.4  \n  \nWhen it comes to the JEDEC standard for DDR5-8800, it sets relatively loose\ntimings of CL62 62-62 for A-grade devices and CL78 77-77 for lower-end C-grade\nICs. Unfortunately, the laws of physics driving DRAM cells have not improved\nmuch over the last couple of years (or decades, for that matter), so memory\nchips still must operate with similar absolute latencies, driving up the\nrelative CAS latency. In this case 14ns remains the gold standard, with CAS\nlatencies at the new speeds being set to hold absolute latencies around that\nmark. But in exchange for systems willing to wait a bit longer (in terms of\ncycles) for a result, the new spec improves the standard's peak memory\nbandwidth by 37.5%.\n\nThis of course is just the timings set in the JEDEC specification, which is\nprimarily of concern for server vendors. So we'll have to see just how much\nharder consumer memory manufacturers can push things for their XMP/EXPO-\nprofiled memory. Extreme overclockers are already hitting speeds as high as\n11,240 MT/s with current-generation DRAM chips and CPUs, so there may be some\nmore headroom to play with in the next generation.\n\nMeanwhile, on the security front, the updated spec makes a couple of changes\nthat have been put in place seemingly to address rowhammer-style exploits. The\nbig item here is Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC), which true to its name,\nenables DDR5 to keep a count of how often a row has been activated. Using this\ninformation, memory controllers can then determine if a memory row has been\nexcessively activated and is at risk of having its bits flipped, at which\npoint they can back off to let the row properly refresh and the data re-\nstabilize.\n\nNotably here, the JEDEC press release doesn't use the rowhammer name at any\npoint (unfortunately, we haven't been able to see the specification itself).\nBut based on the description alone, this is clearly intended to thwart\nrowhammer attacks, since these normally operate by forcing a bit flip between\nrefreshes through a large number of activations.\n\nDigging a bit deeper, PRAC seems to be based on a recent Intel patent, Perfect\nRow Hammer Tracking with Multiple Count Increments (US20220121398A1), which\ndescribes a very similar mechanism under the name \"Perfect row hammer\ntracking\" (PRHT). Notably, the Intel paper calls out that this technique has a\nperformance cost associated with it because it increases the overall row cycle\ntime. Ultimately, as the vulnerability underpinning rowhammer is a matter of\nphysics (cell density) rather than logic, it's not too surprising to see that\nany mitigation of it comes with a cost.\n\nThe updated DDR5 specification also depreciates support for Partial Array Self\nRefresh (PASR) within the standard, citing security concerns. PASR is\nprimarily aimed at power efficiency for mobile memory to begin with, and as a\nrefresh-related technology, presumably overlaps some with rowhammer \u2013 be it a\nmeans to attack memory, or an obstruction to defending against rowhammer.\nEither way, with mobile devices increasingly moving to low-power optimized\nLPDDR technologies anyhow, the depreciation of PASR does not immediately look\nlike a major concern for consumer devices.\n\nSource: JEDEC\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 1 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### DougMcC - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nGotta get your rowhammer AI protection in asap.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders for Silencing Black\nHistory\n\nDecades after the Little Rock Nine, students at Central High School are still\nfighting for anti-racist education.\n\nBy\n\n    Mike Ludwig ,\n    Truthout\n\nPublished\n\n    April 21, 2024\n\nThe front entrance of Little Rock Historic Central High School, which was the\nsite of a successful integration campaign by nine Black students in 1957, in\nLittle Rock, Arkansas.Joe Sohm / Visions of America / Universal Images Group /\nGetty Images\n\nCentral High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, is perhaps best known for the\n\u201cLittle Rock Nine,\u201d the first Black students to walk through the school\u2019s\ngrand front doors. The year was 1957, three years after the Supreme Court\ndeclared racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional, and the gears\nof change were grinding to a halt.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, the\nschool board in Little Rock eventually volunteered to desegregate, a process\nthat faced fierce backlash from white residents. Prior to what should have\nbeen the nine Black teenagers\u2019 first day in class, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus\nordered the state\u2019s National Guard to block their entrance. A couple days\nlater, a judge ordered the state to let the teens attend class, but the\nNational Guard was joined by an angry mob of white residents who blocked the\nway.\n\nThe Little Rock Nine would eventually prevail, although not without plenty of\nbullying by their white peers. President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the\nNational Guard and sent U.S. Army troops to the scene, allowing the students\nto finally attend class. The nine students became civil rights icons, and\nimages of the white mob and guardsmen blocking the entrance to Little Rock\nCentral High are some of the most recognizable of the era.\n\nToday, two-thirds of students at the top performing high school are Black.\nHowever, if Central High teachers and students were to draw parallels between\nLittle Rock Nine and the current effort by Arkansas Republicans to censor\ndiscussions of race and Black history in schools, they would likely run afoul\nof a controversial state law that civil rights attorneys argue is a blatant\nviolation of free speech rights, according to a landmark lawsuit recently\nfiled against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state education officials.\n\nFiled on behalf of the NAACP and teachers, students and parents at Central\nHigh School, the lawsuit challenges a controversial section of the LEARNS Act,\na new law championed by Sanders to promote school privatization and ban what\nshe has called \u201cleft-wing indoctrination\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in public\nschools. Similar anti-education initiatives popped up in red states across the\ncountry after intentionally manufactured disinformation about critical race\ntheory (CRT) and schoolhouse diversity initiatives went viral on the right.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nRacial Justice\n\n## Decades of Racial Bias Preceded College Board\u2019s AP Black History Course\nChanges\n\nThe College Board still seems to feel comfortable disappearing the Black\neducational experience.\n\nBy\n\n    Ngakiya Camara ,\n    Truthout\n\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nCRT is a college-level field of ideas and study about institutional racism\nthat is not taught in K-12 public schools. However, the right used CRT as a\ncatchall term for anti-racist education as Republicans attempted to harness\nwhite backlash to uprisings for racial justice in 2020, an effort Governor\nSanders helped to engineer as one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s many\npress secretaries.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be there\u2019s a movement afoot around the country to restrict not\nonly [Advanced Placement] courses in African American studies, but almost any\nother thing that you can like think of, that might lead to students developing\na more thorough understanding of what\u2019s truly going on around them,\u201d Little\nRock Nine member Terrance Roberts told local media in September.\n\nThe LEARNS Act does not include an accurate or clear definition of \u201ccritical\nrace theory,\u201d and Arkansas Republicans are on record struggling to pin one\ndown. Due to the law\u2019s vague language, educators are now limiting discussions\non topics ranging from affirmative action to Jim Crow laws and even the Little\nRock Nine, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAnything that explores the historical suffering of Black people in the United\nStates is suspect, including one student\u2019s upcoming presentation on the legacy\nof slave codes in the antebellum South. Sadie Belle, a Central High student,\nwill be examining whether the legacy of slave codes still has an impact today.\n\n\u201cSadie Belle will be examining whether the codes enacted to further the\nsubjugation of Black people in America, even after the Civil War, continue to\nsystematically perpetuate injustices today,\u201d the lawsuit states, before\nquoting from the LEARNS Act: \u201cIt is unclear if, by doing so, Sadie Belle has\n\u2018purposely or otherwise, promote[d] teaching that would indoctrinate students\nwith [prohibited] ideologies\u2019 because her analysis and conclusion is one that\ncould be perceived as one supported by CRT.\u201d\n\nTeachers could face sanctions and potentially lose their education license for\nviolating the law, which also repealed longstanding employment protections for\nschoolteachers. The law unconstitutionally chills speech in a way that\nunfairly targets Black students, teachers and their ideas, according to the\nlawsuit.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Education\u2019s website says the LEARNS Act prohibits\nclassroom instruction that would conflict with civil rights law by encouraging\ndiscrimination, including \u201cindoctrination\u201d into \u201ccritical race theory.\u201d\nHowever, experts have repeatedly debunked the idea that CRT promotes\ndiscrimination against white people or anyone else, although the idea of\n\u201canti-white discrimination\u201d remains popular on the right. The department\u2019s\nwebsite does not offer a definition of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d and a\nspokesperson did not provide one in response to an inquiry from Truthout.\n\nIt all started the day Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders took office in early 2023.\nSanders, a political scion who gained fame working for Trump, quickly issued\nan executive order declaring that CRT does not belong in schools and teachers\nshould not indoctrinate students. Critics pointed out that there was no\nevidence of either occurring in Arkansas schools and chalked the order up to a\npolitical stunt in line with the 1776 Commission, the Trump administration\u2019s\ndebunked study of United States history that was meant to counter the 1619\nProject, the New York Times award-winning series that put Black people and\nslavery at the center of the story.\n\nThen came the LEARNS Act, which also set up a voucher system for students\nwishing to attend private schools that opponents say is clearly meant to\nfunnel public funds toward religious institutions and threatens to starve out\npublic schools in Arkansas. To implement the law, the Arkansas Department of\nEducation purged the state\u2019s recommended social studies materials for teachers\nof \u201chard-fought achievements won by African Americans\u201d because they include\nthe context of generations of suffering under Jim Crow and slavery, according\nto the lawsuit.\n\nA protest over the LEARNS Act broke out at Little Rock Central High as Sanders\nsigned the bill in March 2023, and the action drew national news coverage and\nsupport from the Little Rock Nine. Secretary Oliva, who was handpicked by\nGovernor Sanders, was dispatched to observe the school\u2019s Advanced Placement\n(AP) African American studies class taught by Ruthie Walls.\n\nWalls was named \u201cTeacher of the Year\u201d the previous school year and is a\nplaintiff in the lawsuit. A day after notifying the school, Oliva showed up to\nobserve her teaching an AP African American Studies class, which had been\napproved by the state as a pilot five months earlier, according to the\nlawsuit. Toward the end of class, Walls paused her instruction to give Oliva a\ncopy of the curriculum.\n\nShortly after, the principal of Central High told Walls that Oliva was \u201cvery\ncomplimentary\u201d of her instruction and said that \u201cshe\u2019s really teaching African\nAmerican history, and I don\u2019t have a problem with that,\u201d according to the\nlawsuit.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit claims that the anti-CRT provision of the LEARNS Act is\npreventing a majority-Black group of students at Central High School from\nearning credits in AP African American Studies, which would typically provide\nhigh school students with a chance to earn credit toward a college degree.\nState officials say the AP class is still a pilot program and is approved for\nthe next school year, but this offers little consolation to graduating\nseniors.\n\nThe lawsuit claims AP African American Studies was piloted at Central High\nduring the 2022-2023 school year without incident, and six schools requested\nto offer the class in 2023-2024. Three days before the school year began, the\nArkansas Department of Education abruptly \u201crevoked\u201d approval for the class,\naccording to the lawsuit. After making a series of bureaucratic excuses\ninvolving the College Board, which administers AP classes nationally,\nofficials singled out AP African American Studies for allegedly putting\nteachers at risk of violating the anti-CRT provision. Course materials would\nneed to be reviewed to ensure no violations of the LEARNS Act.\n\nSecretary Oliva was soon publicly defending the move only about five months\nafter Central High students walked out in protest of Sanders signing the\nLEARNS Act. Sanders would make her own appearance on Fox News to defend the\ndecision to remove AP African American Studies from state\u2019s approved list of\ncourses, where she railed against the \u201cpropaganda leftist agenda\u201d that is\nteaching kids to \u201chate America.\u201d During her inauguration speech in January\n2023, Sanders claimed public school teachers were \u201cbrainwashing\u201d students.\n\nIn a statement to Truthout, Oliva said AP African American Studies was still\nbeing piloted in 2023, and the department advised the six schools that the\nclass can count toward high school credits this year after officials confirmed\nthat course materials do not violate state law. He said the lawsuit \u201cfalsely\naccuses\u201d his department of not allowing students to participate in the pilot\nprogram and receiving benefits from the class.\n\n\u201cAfter discussions, College Board updated course framework and assured it does\nnot violate Arkansas law,\u201d Oliva said. \u201cThe department approved the course for\nthe 24-25 school year and will continue to work with districts to ensure\ncourses offered to students do not violate Arkansas state law.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are asking a federal judge to issue an injunction blocking the\nanti-CRT section of the LEARNS Act. Oral arguments are scheduled for April 30.\n\nColton Gilbert, the debate coach at Central High, said in a recent legal\nfiling that the anti-CRT provision makes his job of helping students defend\npositions on controversial topics virtually impossible.\n\n\u201cEvery day I walk into class and think to myself: is today\u2019s conversation the\none that will get me fired?\u201d Gilbert said.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
