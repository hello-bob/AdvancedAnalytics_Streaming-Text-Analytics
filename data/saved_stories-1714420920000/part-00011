Fujian may enter service with\nthe Chinese Navy by 2026.\n\nAlex Luck 29 Apr 2024\n\nUpdate: Against initial reporting in this article Fujian currently remains\nstationary in the Yangtze River Delta off her original berth. The rationale\nfor this remains speculative and the beginning of a proper trial therefore is\nto be confirmed. This article will be updated with further information as it\nbecomes available.\n\nFujian today, April 29, vacated her moorings at Jiangnan on Changxing Island\nin the Yangtze River Delta under her own power, as evidenced from social media\nimagery. The anticipated first sea trial represents a significant milestone on\ngetting China\u2019s first supercarrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults\nready for service. The carrier moved out of berth assisted by several tugboats\nas covered in moving footage circulated on Chinese social media and on \u201cX\u201d,\nformerly Twitter.\n\nAircraft Carrier Fujian pulling out of her berth at Jiangnan, aided by\ntugboats. Image taken as still from footage shared via \u201cX\u201d.\n\nImagery of Fujian previously showed the carrier testing her engines around\nApril 21. The observation created some anticipation that the ship would sail\nout on the occasion of the anniversary for the Chinese Navy on April 23. That\nday historically marks the inception of the East China Military Region Navy,\ntypically shortened to \u201cEast China Navy\u201d, as announced by Zhang Aiping in\nApril 1949 during the Chinese Civil War. The Central Military Commission in\n1989 officially designated the date and event to mark the founding of PLAN.\nThat date however went by with Fujian remaining at berth, perhaps illustrating\nthat PLAN is more concerned with sticking to technical schedules over symbolic\ngestures.\n\nFujian at her launch on June 17, 2022.

Image Chinese state media.\n\nThe journey so far\n\nThe sea trial represents the most recent milestone in a development now\nspanning six years since the first sighting of a \u201csuperblock\u201d hull module for\nthe future aircraft carrier at Jiangnan back around July 2018. The first\nconstruction phase for Fujian consisted of assembling superblocks into larger\nhull segments at a bespoke new facility on Changxing Island, for a duration of\ntwo years. Around May 2020 the builder moved these segments into a proper\ndrydock for final assembly of the carrier itself. Construction continued at\nbrisk pace for another two years until the carrier launched on June 17, 2022,\namidst much fanfare and formal reports providing additional detail via Chinese\nstate media.\n\nJiangnan module assembly facility undertaking the early construction of\naircraft carrier Fujian, before the yard moved super-modules into drydock for\nfinal assembly. Image via Chinese social media.\n\nThe roughly two year intervals from module construction to drydock final\nassembly to the first sea trial now are notable, though likely a coincidence\nmore than a serious intention. It is worth recalling also that construction of\nthe ship, like other Chinese naval building programs was likely affected to\nsome extend by the COVID pandemic, which had a dramatic impact on the Chinese\neconomy and society.\n\nAbout Aircraft Carrier Fujian\n\nAircraft carrier Fujian takes her name from the eponymous Chinese province in\nsoutheast China. The territory, home to over 40 million people, is located\ndirectly opposite Taiwan, a fact that inevitably carries a political message\ngiven Beijings relationship to the island country the Communist Party\nconsiders a renegade province and firmly claims as part of the Chinese nation.\nThe carrier also uses hull number 18, following from the two previous aircraft\ncarriers Liaoning (16) and Shandong (17).\n\nFujian in a touched up overhead image, recent date. Note flight deck markings\napplied and several aircraft mockups including KJ-600 visible on deck. Image\nvia Chinese social media.\n\nChinese official sources are traditionally opaque on technical details of new\nmilitary developments. The People\u2019s Daily, the official state media of the\nCentral Committee, at the time of launch specified the size of Fujian as\nexceeding 80,000 tons. The report also confirmed that the carrier uses\nelectromagnetic catapults and arrestor gear, a detail already widely assumed\nto be the case by the PLAN watching community. The Global Times tabloid\nfurthermore speculated that the carrier would see service with PLAN within two\nto three years. This schedule however appears optimistic given the\nunprecedented nature of this development.\n\nNotional specifications of Fujian\n\nMultiple other specifications and technical characteristics are evident from\nimagery. Basic measurements for the hull are a length of approximately 316\nmetres, a beam across the flight deck of 72 metres average and 76 metres at\nthe widest point. Hull beam at waterline level is around 39 metres. The\ncarrier features two aircraft elevators, three catapults and four arrestor\nwires. Self defence armament consists of multiple launchers for the HQ-10\nshort range surface to air missile system and additionally several H/PJ-11 30\nmm autocannons featuring a distinct new rectangular panel radar for target\nacquisition.\n\nFujian at Jiangnan in a recent image. Note fitted CIWS and the distinct panels\non island housing radar and other sensors. Image via Chinese social media.\n\nThe island is located between the elevators, housing the smokestack and a\nmulti-level bridge for navigation, flight control and further operational\nstaffing. Notably the island in contrast to the two Kuznetsov-type carriers\ndoes not feature a rearward facing flight control space or any windows at the\nstern aspect at all. The tower also houses new large radar arrays of the AESA-\ntype in addition to further communications and ESM-gear, several hidden behind\nsmaller flat panels on the superstructure.\n\nThe propulsion of Fujian continues to use a steam turbine-setup somewhat\ncomparable to preceding Chinese aircraft carriers. Early speculation on\nnuclear propulsion for the ship has not borne out to be accurate.\n\nJ-35 prototype flying overhead. Image via Chinese social media.\n\nAir group to include two fighter types and fixed wing AEWC\n\nThe air group for this new carrier remains somewhat notional. A few aspects\nappear certain, based on various aircraft types currently undergoing\ndevelopment and testing. Additionally the sighting of several mockups onboard\nFujian provides further clues. For her primary fighter group the carrier will\nlikely use the J-15B, a Flanker-family variant designed for catapult assisted\nlaunch. In addition the Fujian will also embark the next generation fighter\ndesignated J-35. Both types have already seen their mockups moved around on\nthe flightdeck of the carrier. Conceivably the J-15D electronic warfare\nvariant will also see use, based on recent imagery.\n\nThe new KJ-600 fixed wing AEWC-aircraft is destined to become an important\nasset for the carrier. The type will fulfill a role similar to the E-2 Hawkeye\non American carriers and French carrier Charles de Gaulle. An interesting\nrecent addition among mockups appearing at Jiangnan is the JL-10 advanced\ntrainer. Speculation about the JL-10 adding a carrier-capable variant\ncirculated among the PLA-watching community for several years. Observations\nincluded sightings of mockups, models and prototypes.\n\nZ-20F ASW helicopter. One Z-20J utility helicopter is also visible rear left.\nThe Z-20 is based on the Sikorsky S-70C. China acquired 24 airframes before\nthe country became subject to Western embargoes. Image source Chinese social\nmedia.\n\nIn terms of helicopters Fujian will likely receive similar types or variants\nof models already operational on Liaoning and Shandong. This includes the\nZ-8/18 family of utility and ASW-helicopters. Fujian will likely also add both\nutility and ASW-variants of the newer Z-20 medium helicopter. Until Z-20\narrives in numbers, the new carrier may also use the lighter Z-9, similar to\nLiaoning and Shandong. The total number of aircraft Fujian is capable of\ncarrying remains unknown. Any figures given in discussions are therefore\nhighly speculative.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFujian will now likely undergo a lengthy period of trials and testing that may\nlast for well over a year. The preceding carrier Shandong commissioned in\nDecember 2019, following her first sea trial in May 2018. Owing to more\ncomplex requirements for a catapult-equipped supercarrier, this period is\nlikely going to be longer for Fujian. While the carrier can conceivably join\nservice with PLAN in 2025, the required schedule likely remains too ambitious.\n\nFinally, there is understandably intense speculation in the PLA-interested\ncommunity regarding future Chinese aircraft carriers. As of April 2024 no\nvisual sighting in publicly available imagery supports the notion of further\ncarriers undergoing advanced assembly. Nevertheless, considering timescales\ninvolving such an effort we can reasonably assume a next generation project is\nunderway. Such a step may include a repeat build of the Fujian-design.\nAlternatively a new design, notionally dubbed Type 004, may see construction\nnext. With Jiangnan in Shanghai and Dalian in the eponymous city in Liaoning\nProvince China operates two shipyards capable of constructing large aircraft\ncarriers. Which yard is going to construct the next hull in line therefore\nremains to be seen.\n\nAircraft Carrier China Chinese Navy Type 003 2024-04-29\n\nTags Aircraft Carrier China Chinese Navy Type 003\n\nFacebook Twitter Stumble linkedin Pinterest More\n\n### Authors\n\nPosted by : Alex Luck\n\nAlex Luck is a freelance writer & analyst, with a focus on German military\nmodernization, NATO and naval programs worldwide, particularly with the\nChinese Navy (PLAN).
