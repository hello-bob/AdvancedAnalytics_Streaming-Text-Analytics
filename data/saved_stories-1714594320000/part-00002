While\nnuclear, wind, and solar energy are well-established alternatives to fossil\nfuels, hydrogen energy is emerging as a potent contender that also does not\ngenerate carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cHydrogen is an important vector in the energy transition towards carbon\nneutrality,\u201d Lifeng Liu, a professor at the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory\nin China, explained in an email. \u201cIt [could not] only be used to decarbonize\nthe transportation sector, [...] taking advantage of hydrogen fuel cells, but\nalso finds a wider range of applications in hard-to-abate industries like\nsteel making, synthesis of ammonia/methanol, metal refining, and others,\nhelping in net-zero emissions in these sectors.\u201d\n\nHowever, no matter how clean this energy is, traditional methods of producing\nhydrogen through coal gasification and steam reforming are environmentally\nharmful, which has significantly undermined its potential.\n\n## Hydrogen fuel from electrolysis\n\nFortunately, hydrogen can be produced from pure water, whose molecules are\nmade up of oxygen and hydrogen, in a much more environmentally friendly way\nthrough the process of electrolysis.\n\nIt involves bringing water into contact with a positively charged electrode,\ncalled an anode, where uncharged water molecules are broken down into ions and\nelectrons. These components then travel through different paths to a\nnegatively charged electrode known as a cathode, where, among other by-\nproducts, they form pure hydrogen.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy-driven water electrolysis has now been generally accepted to\nbe a promising approach to \u2018green\u2019 hydrogen production, and many \u2018renewable +\nwater electrolysis\u2019 projects are in the pipeline in many countries,\u201d explained\nLiu. \u201cHowever, the shortage of freshwater may become a bottleneck of large-\nscale deployment of water electrolysers in the near future, especially in\nAfrica where the EU is planning to deploy 40 GW water electrolysers by 2030.\u201d\n\nThis shortcoming prompted Liu and his colleagues to look for alternatives. In\ntheir study published in Advanced Functional Materials, the team proposed a\nnew method for producing hydrogen from seawater, which accounts for\napproximately 96.5% of all water reserves on the planet.\n\n## Water, water everywhere...\n\nThe challenge is seawater contains significant amounts of compounds called\npotassium hydroxide and sodium chloride. These also participate in the\nelectrolysis process, increasing energy consumption, but do not result in the\nproduction of pure hydrogen, while leading to the corrosion of the\nelectrolyzer\u2019s components.\n\nTo overcome these hurdles, Liu and the team proposed mixing seawater with\nhydrazine, a molecule made up of nitrogen and hydrogen, which is known to\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of hydrogen generation. They also coated\nthe electrodes with a foil made of platinum and tellurium, which acts as a\ncatalyst in electrolysis, facilitating its progress without participating in a\nchemical reaction.\n\nThe electrolysis device showed promising results: It maintained catalysis at a\nmuch lower voltage between the electrodes than conventional seawater catalysis\nrequires, minimizing unwanted side reactions, increasing the reliability of\nthe electrolyzer, and preventing corrosion.\n\nMoreover, the new device generated more energy than it consumed, making\nhydrogen production self-sustaining.\n\n\u201cThe most important findings in our study is that through rational design,\nseawater electrolysis can take place spontaneously, namely, be self-powered,\u201d\nexplained Liu. \u201cThis means if one has seawater and, then she/he can produce\nhydrogen out of seawater using the devices we proposed without external input\nof electricity!\n\n\u201cOur devices can help substantially reduce the energy consumption of water\nelectrolysis, thereby showing significant potential for lowering the hydrogen\nproduction cost. In addition, our devices allow for operation at low current\ndensities, enabling larger operational flexibility of electrolysers, which is\ncurrently also a technical hurdle in real-world operation.\u201d\n\n## Promising, but further improvements needed\n\nDespite these impressive results, the researchers admit that their\nelectrolysis method has shortcomings, and scientists still have to overcome\nmany fundamental difficulties to achieve truly clean hydrogen production with\nit.\n\n\u201cWe still need to use platinum [metal] to catalyze the cathodic and anodic\nreactions,\u201d Liu explained. \u201cIn addition to cost, platinum mining is\nenvironmentally problematic. \u201cWe will aim to develop non-[platinum] based\ncatalysts in the future to lower the cost and reduce the dependence on this\nscarce [metal].\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, the use of hydrazine oxidation reactions is the key to reducing\nenergy consumption of electrolysis,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cHowever, hydrazine is highly toxic and their large-scale usage for water\nelectrolysis may pose some risks to the environment and operators. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for an alternative molecule to substitute hydrazine.\u201d\n\nReference: Zhipeng Yu, et al., Self-Powered Hydrogen Production From Seawater\nEnabled by Trifunctional Exfoliated PtTe Nanosheet Catalysts, Advanced\nFunctional Materials (2024).
