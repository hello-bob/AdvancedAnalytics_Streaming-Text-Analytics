That news comes in the form of a new e-print\nauthored by Yilei Chen, \u201cQuantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems\u201c, which has\nroiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated\nby experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (and to be clear, I am not\none!) but if it holds up, it\u2019s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for\nthe applied cryptography community.\n\nRather than elaborate at length, here\u2019s quick set of five bullet-points giving\nthe background.\n\n(1) Cryptographers like to build modern public-key encryption schemes on top\nof mathematical problems that are believed to be \u201chard\u201d. In practice, we need\nproblems with a specific structure: we can construct efficient solutions for\nthose who hold a secret key, or \u201ctrapdoor\u201d, and yet also admit no efficient\nsolution for folks who don\u2019t. While many problems have been considered (and\noften discarded), most schemes we use today are based on three problems:\nfactoring (the RSA cryptosystem), discrete logarithm (Diffie-Hellman, DSA) and\nelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (EC-Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA etc.)\n\n(2) While we would like to believe our favorite problems are fundamentally\n\u201chard\u201d, we know this isn\u2019t really true. Researchers have devised algorithms\nthat solve all of these problems quite efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time)\n\u2014 provided someone figures out how to build a quantum computer powerful enough\nto run the attack algorithms. Fortunately such a computer has not yet been\nbuilt!\n\n(3) Even though quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to break our\npublic-key crypto, the mere threat of future quantum attacks has inspired\nindustry, government and academia to join forces Fellowship-of-the-Ring-style\nin order to tackle the problem right now. This isn\u2019t merely about future-\nproofing our systems: even if quantum computers take decades to build, future\nquantum computers could break encrypted messages we send today!\n\n(4) One conspicuous outcome of this fellowship is NIST\u2019s Post-Quantum\nCryptography (PQC) competition: this was an open competition designed to\nstandardize \u201cpost-quantum\u201d cryptographic schemes. Critically, these schemes\nmust be based on different mathematical problems \u2014 most notably, problems that\ndon\u2019t seem to admit efficient quantum solutions.\n\n(5) Within this new set of schemes, the most popular class of schemes are\nbased on problems related to mathematical objects called lattices. NIST-\napproved schemes based on lattice problems include Kyber and Dilithium (which\nI wrote about recently.) Lattice problems are also the basis of several\nefficient fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes.\n\nThis background sets up the new result.\n\nChen\u2019s (not yet peer-reviewed) preprint claims a new quantum algorithm that\nsolves the \u201cshortest independent vector problem\u201d (SIVP, as well as GapSVP) in\nlattices with specific parameters. If it holds up, the result could (with\nnumerous important caveats) allow future quantum computers to break schemes\nthat depend on the hardness of specific instances of these problems. The good\nnews here is that the vulnerable parameters are very specific: Chen\u2019s\nalgorithm does not immediately apply to the recently-standardized NIST\nalgorithms such as Kyber or Dilithium. Moreover, the exact concrete complexity\nof the algorithm is not instantly clear: it may turn out to be impractical to\nrun, even if quantum computers become available.\n\nBut there is a saying in our field that attacks only get better. If Chen\u2019s\nresult can be improved upon, then quantum algorithms could render obsolete an\nentire generation of \u201cpost-quantum\u201d lattice-based schemes, forcing\ncryptographers and industry back to the drawing board.\n\nIn other words, both a great technical result \u2014 and possibly a mild disaster.\n\nAs previously mentioned: I am neither an expert in lattice-based cryptography\nnor quantum computing. The folks who are those things are very busy trying to\nvalidate the writeup. For those searching for the latest developments, here\u2019s\na nice writeup by Nigel Smart that doesn\u2019t tackle the correctness of the\nquantum algorithm (see updates at the bottom), but does talk about the\npossible implications for FHE and PQC schemes (TL;DR: bad for some FHE\nschemes, but really depends on the concrete details of the algorithm\u2019s running\ntime.) And here\u2019s another brief note on a \u201cbug\u201d that was found in the paper,\nthat seems to have been quickly addressed by the author.\n\nUp until this week I had intended to write another long wonky post about\ncomplexity theory, lattices, and what it all meant for applied cryptography.\nBut now I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I hold onto that one, for just a little\nbit longer.\n\n### Related\n\nIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine)April 11, 2012In\n\"quantum\"\n\nFour theories on the cryptography of Star TrekJuly 24, 2012In \"noodling\"\n\nA riddle wrapped in a curveOctober 22, 2015In \"ECC\"\n\n  * Tagged\n  * Cryptography\n  * cybersecurity\n  * innovation\n  * quantum-computing\n  * technology\n\nMatthew Green I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University.\nI've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks,\npayment systems and digital content protection platforms.
