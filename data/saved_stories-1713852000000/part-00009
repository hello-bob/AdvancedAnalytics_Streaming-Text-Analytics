(Capt. H.\nHowey/Army)\n\nThe Army will begin conducting a cognitive assessment for a baseline\nmeasurement of brain health to measure the effects of any future trauma for\nall new soldiers at basic training and cadets before they are commissioned.\n\nSecretary of the Army Christine Wormuth referenced the new program, which will\nbegin in June, during budget testimony before the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee on Thursday.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked Wormuth what the service was doing to measure\nsoldiers\u2019 brain health following exposures to blasts citing the case of Sgt.\n1st Class Robert Card, an Army reservist who killed 18 people in a mass\nshooting in Lewistown, Maine in October.\n\nCard served as an instructor at an Army hand grenade training range. An\nautopsy of his brain showed evidence of Traumatic Brain Injury, an injury\nlinked with concussions and blast exposure.\n\n\u201cWe had a tragedy here in Lewiston, Maine last year and it turns out the\nfellow was a munitions test instructor, he experienced blast after blast after\nblast,\u201d King said. \u201cAnalysis of his brain indicated it was severely damaged.\u201d\n\nWormuth told the senator that the Army would begin cognitive assessments of\nall new soldiers entering basic training in June.\n\nLt. Col. Randy Ready, spokesman for the Army\u2019s Center for Initial Military\nTraining, told Army Times the service will use the Automated\nNeuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) tool.\n\n\u201cAll new soldiers going through basic training or One Unit Station Training\n(OSUT) will take the ANAM,\u201d Ready wrote in an email response.\n\nThe ANAM assessment tool has been used on soldiers to measure pre- and post-\ndeployment cognitive function since 2008.\n\nA soldier from the 501st Area Support Medical Company is shown patterned\nsquares during the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric. (Army)\n\nIt\u2019s a computer-based assessment that takes about 20 minutes to complete and\nrecords neurological activity, such as attention, concentration, reaction\ntime, memory, processing speed, and decision-making.\n\nThe assessment is used to collect baseline information on performance that can\nbe used by medical professionals if the individual later has an injury\naffecting attention, memory or thinking ability, according to Army program\ndescription information.\n\nIn one section, users observe a picture on a screen for three seconds before\nit disappears. Then two pictures display on the screen and the user picks\nwhich one matches the previous image, according to an Army release.\n\nIn another section, a sequence is shown and the user must then determine the\nmissing item in a subsequent sequence.\n\nThe results are not compared to other individuals\u2019 results and are protected\nhealth information, which becomes part of a soldier\u2019s permanent medical\nrecord, according to program information.\n\n\u201cIf a service member or civilian is exposed to a concussive event, like an\nexplosion, motor vehicle accident or serious fall, resulting in trauma to the\nhead, their health care provider can request the ANAM data which can be used\nto measure differences,\u201d Donald R. Thomas, a health systems specialist who\noversaw assessments, said in a 2018 release.\n\nTesting will begin at the four Army training centers located at Fort Jackson,\nSouth Carolina; Fort Moore, Georgia; Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; and Fort\nSill, Oklahoma in June.\n\nThe Army has approximately 101,700 trainees who go through basic training and\nOSUT annually.\n\nA U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesman confirmed to Army Times that testing will\nbegin for their cadets in June. A U.S. Military Academy at West Point\nspokeswoman said the assessments will be in place before the 2024-2025\nacademic school year.\n\nThe cadet command is on track to commission about 5,300 new second lieutenants\nthis year. West Point brings in about 1,200 new cadets annually, officials\nsaid.\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced on April 11 called the Blast Overpressure Safety\nAct would require all military branches to conduct a baseline cognitive\nassessment before recruits begin entry-level training.\n\nService members would then be tested at least once every three years, after\ndeployment and when they begin out-processing from military service.\n\nAll troops would have a log for Traumatic Brain Injury diagnoses and blast\nexposure incidents, which mandates the services collect concussive-related\ninjuries and any discharges that result from brain injuries.\n\nThe bill also calls on the services to lower the risk of blast exposure by\nrevising high-risk training and operations and modifying weapons systems.\n\nWormuth also told Congress that the Army is looking at additional protective\nequipment, especially for instructors who are routinely exposed to blast\npressure.\n\n\u201cWe are looking into wearable gauges that would allow us to continually track\nwhat soldiers are being exposed to,\u201d Wormuth said.\n\nBrain trauma researchers visit soldiers from Wisconsin National Guard in April\n2024 during training to discuss a planned study to measure blast exposure\neffects among soldiers. (Staff Sgt. Kati Volkman/Army)\n\nOn April 9, a team of Wisconsin National Guard surgeons and civilian\nresearchers, including Dr. Walter Carr with the Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch, visited soldiers with the 120th Field Artillery Battalion and 105th\nCavalry Squadron during training at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, according to an\nArmy release.\n\nCarr works at the institute\u2019s Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience,\nBlast Induced Neurotrauma Branch.\n\nHis team observed the weapons firing to determine how they would be able to\nmeasure blast exposure and evaluate its effects on soldiers during routine\ntraining for a planned study.\n\nAbout Todd South\n\nTodd South has written about crime, courts, government and the military for\nmultiple publications since 2004 and was named a 2014 Pulitzer finalist for a\nco-written project on witness intimidation.
