A Reuters investigation found that the company grew from an\neducational startup to a hack-for-hire powerhouse that stole secrets from\nexecutives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the\nglobe. Appin alumni went on to form other firms that are still active.\n\nChuck Randall was on the verge of unveiling an ambitious real estate deal he\nhoped would give his small Native American tribe a bigger cut of a potentially\nlucrative casino project.\n\nA well-timed leak derailed it all.\n\nIn July of 2012, printed excerpts from Randall\u2019s private emails were hand-\ndistributed across the Shinnecock Nation\u2019s square-mile reservation, a wooded\npeninsula hanging off the South Fork of Long Island.\n\nThe five-page pamphlets detailed secret negotiations between Randall, his\ntribal government allies and outside investors to wrest some of the profits\nfrom the tribe\u2019s then-partner in the gambling deal.\n\nThey sparked an uproar. The pamphlets claimed Randall\u2019s plan would sell out\nthe tribe\u2019s \u201cLANDS, RESOURCES, and FUTURE REVENUES.\u201d Within days, four of\nRandall\u2019s allies were voted out of tribal government. Randall, who held no\nformal position with the tribe, was ordered to cease acting on its behalf.\n\nAmid the upheaval, the Shinnecocks\u2019 casino hopes faded. \u201cWe lost the biggest\neconomic opportunity that has come to the tribe in forever,\u201d Randall told\nReuters. \u201cMy emails were weaponized.\u201d\n\nThe scandal that roiled the Shinnecocks barely registered beyond the\nreservation. But it was part of a phenomenon that has drawn interest from law\nenforcement and intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nRandall\u2019s inbox was breached by a New Delhi-based information technology firm\nnamed Appin, whose sudden interference in the matters of a faraway tribe was\npart of a sprawling cyber-mercenary operation that extended across the world,\na Reuters investigation found.\n\nThe Indian company hacked on an industrial scale, stealing data from political\nleaders, international executives, prominent attorneys and more. By the time\nof the Shinnecock scandal, Appin was a premier provider of cyberespionage\nservices for private investigators working on behalf of big business, law\nfirms and wealthy clients.\n\nUnauthorized access to computer systems is a crime worldwide, including in\nIndia. Yet at least 17 pitch documents prepared for prospective business\npartners and reviewed by Reuters advertised Appin\u2019s prowess in activities such\nas \u201ccyber spying,\u201d \u201cemail monitoring,\u201d \u201ccyber warfare\u201d and \u201csocial\nengineering,\u201d security lingo for manipulating people into revealing sensitive\ninformation. In one 2010 presentation, the company explicitly bragged about\nhacking businessmen on behalf of corporate clients.\n\nReuters previously named Appin in a story about Indian cyber mercenaries\npublished last year. Other media outlets \u2013 including The New Yorker, Paris-\nbased Intelligence Online, Swiss investigative program Rundschau and tech\ncompanies such as Alphabet-owned Google\u2013 have also reported on the firm\u2019s\nactivities.\n\nThis report paints the clearest picture yet of how Appin operated, detailing\nthe world-spanning extent of its business, and international law enforcement\u2019s\nabortive efforts to get a handle on it.\n\nRun by a pair of brothers, Rajat and Anuj Khare, the company began as a small\nIndian educational startup. It went on to train a generation of spies for hire\nthat are still in business today.\n\nSeveral cyber defense training organizations in India carry the Appin name,\nthe legacy of an old franchise model. But there\u2019s no suggestion that those\nfirms are involved in hacking.\n\nRajat Khare\u2019s U.S. representative, the law firm Clare Locke, rejected any\nassociation between its client and the cyber-mercenary business. It said Khare\n\u201chas never operated or supported, and certainly did not create, any illegal\n\u2018hack for hire\u2019 industry in India or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn a series of letters sent to Reuters over the past year, Clare Locke said\nthat \u201cMr. Khare has dedicated much of his career to the fields of information\ntechnology security \u2013 that is, cyber-defense and the prevention of illicit\nhacking.\u201d\n\nClare Locke said that, under Khare\u2019s tenure, Appin specialized in training\nthousands of students in cybersecurity, robotics and artificial intelligence,\n\u201cnever in illicit hacking.\u201d The lawyers said Khare left Appin, in part,\nbecause rogue actors were operating under the company\u2019s brand, and he wanted\n\u201cto avoid the appearance of associations with people who were misusing the\nAppin name.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers described media articles tying Khare to hacking as \u201cfalse\u201d or\n\u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d As for the 2010 Appin presentation boasting of hacking\nservices, they said Khare had never seen it before. \u201cThe document is a forgery\nor was doctored,\u201d they said.\n\nClare Locke added that Khare could not be held responsible for Appin employees\nwho went on to work as mercenary hackers, saying that doing so \u201cwould be akin\nto holding Harvard University responsible for the terrorist bombings carried\nout by its former student Ted Kaczynski,\u201d referring to the former math prodigy\nknown as the \u201cUnabomber.\u201d\n\nA lawyer acting for Rajat\u2019s brother, Anuj, said his client\u2019s position was the\nsame as the one laid out by Clare Locke.\n\nThis report on Appin draws on thousands of company emails as well as financial\nrecords, presentations, photos and instant messages from the firm. Reporters\nalso reviewed case files from American, Norwegian, Dominican and Swiss law\nenforcement, and interviewed dozens of former Appin employees and hundreds of\nvictims of India-based hackers. Reuters gathered the material \u2013 which spans\n2005 until earlier this year \u2013 from ex-employees, clients and security\nprofessionals who\u2019ve studied the company.\n\nReuters verified the authenticity of the Appin communications with 15 people,\nincluding private investigators who commissioned hacks and ex-Appin hackers\nthemselves. The news agency also asked U.S. cybersecurity firm SentinelOne to\nreview the material for signs that it had been digitally altered. The firm\nsaid it found none.\n\n\u201cWe assess the emails to be accurately represented and verifiably associated\nwith the Appin organization,\u201d SentinelOne researcher Tom Hegel said.\n\nThough Khare\u2019s lawyers say Appin \u201cfocused on teaching cybersecurity and cyber-\ndefense,\u201d company communications seen by Reuters detailed the creation of an\narsenal of hacking tools, including malicious code and websites. Hegel and two\nother U.S.-based researchers \u2013 one from cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the other\nfrom Symantec \u2013 all working independently, were able to match that\ninfrastructure to publicly known cyberespionage campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt all lines up perfectly,\u201d Hegel said.\n\nOver the last decade, Google saw hackers linked to Appin target tens of\nthousands of email accounts on its service alone, according to Shane Huntley,\nwho leads the California company\u2019s cyber threat intelligence team.\n\n\u201cThese groups worked very high volumes, to the point that we actually had to\nexpand our systems and procedures to work out how to track them,\u201d Huntley\nsaid.\n\nThe original Appin has now largely disappeared from public view, but its\nimpact is still felt today. Copycat firms led by Appin alumni continue to\ntarget thousands, according to court records and cybersecurity industry\nreporting.\n\n\u201cThey were groundbreaking,\u201d Google\u2019s Huntley said. \u201cIf you look at the\ncompanies at the moment who are picking up the baton, many of them are led by\nex-employees\u201d of Appin.\n\n### My Commando\n\nPrivate eyes have been hiring hackers to do their dirty work since the dawn of\nthe internet. Former clients say Appin\u2019s central innovation was turning the\ncloak-and-dagger market into something more like an e-commerce platform for\nspy services.\n\nThe mercenaries marketed a digital dashboard with a menu of options for\nbreaking into inboxes, including sending fake, booby-trapped job\nopportunities, bogus bribe offers and risqu\u00e9 messages with subject lines like\n\u201cMy Sister\u2019s Hot Friend.\u201d\n\nCustomers would log in to a discreet site \u2013 once dubbed \u201cMy Commando\u201d \u2013 and\nask Appin to break into emails, computers or phones. Users could follow the\nspies\u2019 progress as if they were tracking a delivery, eventually receiving\ninstructions to download their victim\u2019s data from digital dead drops,\naccording to logs of the system reviewed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt was the best-organized system that I have ever seen,\u201d said Jochi G\u00f3mez, a\nformer news publisher in the Dominican Republic. G\u00f3mez told Reuters that in\n2011 he paid Appin $5,000 to $10,000 a month to spy on the Caribbean nation\u2019s\nelite and mine the material for stories for his now-defunct digital newspaper,\nEl Siglo 21.\n\nOne of Appin\u2019s selling points was a project management tool once called \u201cMy\nCommando.\u201d\n\nAppin told customers it used the tool to tailor its hacking attempts, enticing\ntargets with bogus business proposals, fake interview requests or porn.\n\nSome booby-trapped emails were elaborate deceptions, like this message created\nin the name of a non-existent journalist.\n\nOthers relied on sex appeal, like this message promising photos of a woman\ntaking off a traditional Indian dress.\n\nTargets who clicked would soon have their emails stolen by Appin \u2013 and read by\nthe hackers\u2019 clients.\n\nReuters reviewed more than a year\u2019s worth of activity from Appin\u2019s \u201cMy\nCommando\u201d system. The logs showed that G\u00f3mez was one of 70 clients, mostly\nprivate investigators, from the United States, Britain, Switzerland and beyond\nwho sought Appin\u2019s help in hacking hundreds of targets.\n\nSome of these marks were high-society figures, including a top New York art\ndealer and a French diamond heiress, according to the logs. Others were less\nprominent, like a New Jersey landscape architect suspected of having an\naffair.\n\nSeveral detectives used the service frequently, among them Israeli private eye\nAviram Halevi, who tasked the spies with going after at least three dozen\npeople via the system.\n\n\u201cThere is a returning customer who needs the following addresses cracked\nASAP,\u201d the logs show Halevi telling the hackers in August 2011.\n\nReuters previously reported that Halevi, a former lieutenant colonel in the\nIsraeli Defense Forces, hired Appin to spy on a litigant in a lawsuit in\nIsrael on behalf of a client on the opposing side of the case. Halevi did not\nrespond to questions about his ties to the hackers.\n\nAnother big user of My Commando was Israeli private detective Tamir Mor, who\nused the service around the same time to order hacks on more than 40 targets,\nthe logs show. Among them were the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and\nMalaysian politician Mohamed Azmin Ali.\n\n\u201cPlease get me result ASAP!!!\u201d Mor wrote on the My Commando chat feature after\nproviding Appin with details about two members of Berezovsky\u2019s legal team in\nDecember 2011, the logs show.\n\nReuters could not establish Mor\u2019s motives for targeting Berezovsky and Azmin,\nwhether he succeeded in hacking either of them, or on whose behalf he was\nworking. Mor did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAzmin, a former cabinet minister, was a prominent opposition leader at the\ntime of the hack attempts. He and his former party didn\u2019t respond to messages\nseeking comment.\n\nThe order to hack Berezovsky came while the tycoon was in the middle of a\nBritish court battle against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich over the sale of\na Russian oil company. The multibillion dollar case ended in a decisive defeat\nfor Berezovsky. The 67-year-old was found dead at his suburban English home\nthe following year.\n\nMark Hastings, one of the Berezovsky lawyers mentioned in the My Commando\nlogs, said he was not aware that he had been in Appin\u2019s crosshairs, but that\nhe was \u201cnot entirely surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an open secret that lawyers are often targeted by hackers in major\ncommercial litigations,\u201d said Hastings, now with the London firm Quillon Law.\n\nAbramovich\u2019s representatives said the tycoon had no dealings with or knowledge\nof Mor or Appin, and that he had never engaged with hackers or hacked material\nof any kind.\n\nMany of Appin\u2019s clients signed into My Commando using their real names. A\nprolific customer who didn\u2019t was someone using the alias \u201cJim H.\u201d\n\nJim H assigned the Appin hackers more than 30 targets in 2011 and 2012,\nincluding a Rwandan dissident and the wife of another wealthy Russian who was\nin the middle of a divorce, the logs show.\n\nAmong Jim H\u2019s most sensitive requests: hacking Kristi Rogers, wife of\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, then-Chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence\nCommittee. The Michigan Republican served in Congress from 2001 until his\nretirement in 2015; he\u2019s currently running for U.S. Senate.\n\nBack in 2012, Kristi Rogers was an executive at Aegis, a London-based security\ncompany. Jim H told the hackers that Aegis competed with his client, another\nsecurity contractor called Global Security, an apparent reference to Virginia-\nbased Global Integrated Security.\n\nCracking Rogers\u2019 corporate email was a \u201ctop priority,\u201d Jim H told the hackers.\nHe claimed that her company was trying to undermine Global\u2019s bid for a $480\nmillion U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contract to provide security for\nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction.\n\nJim H said he needed dirt on Aegis to sully its reputation, and he suggested a\nway to trick Rogers into opening a malicious link.\n\n\u201cYou could send an invitation to an event organised by the Rotary Club or a\ngala dinner,\u201d he wrote, according to the logs.\n\nShortly thereafter, Appin reported back that it had successfully broken into\nAegis\u2019 network.\n\nReuters could not verify whether Rogers\u2019 account was ultimately compromised.\nGlobal eventually won the contract.\n\nRogers, who left Aegis in late 2012, told Reuters she was outraged to learn of\nthe hacking operation.\n\n\u201cIt gives me goosebumps right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt angers me that people are so\ncavalier with other people\u2019s reputations and their lives.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to determine Jim H\u2019s identity or whether he was telling the\ntruth when he said Global was his client. Messages sent to Jim H\u2019s old email\naccount were returned as undeliverable.\n\nGlobal Integrated Security\u2019s website is inoperative, and corporate records\nshow its Virginia branch is inactive. Damian Perl, the founder of Britain\u2019s\nGlobal Strategies Group \u2013 Global Integrated Security\u2019s former parent company \u2013\n\u201cvehemently\u201d denies any allegations of wrongdoing, his family office said in a\nstatement.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that Aegis had protested Global\u2019s\ncontract, but said it could offer no further comment. Canadian security\ncompany GardaWorld, which acquired Aegis in 2015, said it had no information\non the incident.\n\nThe My Commando logs also shine new light on the Shinnecock casino scandal. In\nJanuary 2012, a New York private eye named Steven Santarpia ordered the hack\nof tribal member Chuck Randall, whose leaked emails sparked chaos.\n\nWithin days, an Appin hacker reported to Santarpia that he had hit pay dirt,\naccording to the logs: \u201cWe got success in investigating Chuck@shinnecock.org.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Santarpia replied.\n\nSantarpia didn\u2019t respond to repeated messages sent by Reuters over several\nmonths, and he declined comment when a reporter approached him outside his\nLong Island home.\n\nOperations like Jim H\u2019s or Santarpia\u2019s were aimed at only three or four email\naccounts at a time. But Appin had greater capabilities.\n\nG\u00f3mez, the Dominican publisher, ordered break-in attempts aimed at the email\naccounts of more than 200 high-profile Dominicans, the logs show. Among them\nwas an account belonging to then-President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, a frequent target\nof G\u00f3mez\u2019s reporting.\n\nG\u00f3mez\u2019s hacking requests preceded several stories alleging government\ncorruption that his paper published before it was raided by Dominican\nauthorities in February 2012. G\u00f3mez eventually shut it down amidst mounting\nofficial scrutiny of the hacking.\n\n\u201cI was very active in requesting emails,\u201d he told Reuters, adding that those\ndays are firmly \u201cin my past.\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nLawyers for Rajat Khare said he \u201cdoes not know\u201d G\u00f3mez, Santarpia, Mor or\nHalevi and \u201chas no knowledge\u201d of the My Commando dashboard \u201cor anything\nsimilar.\u201d\n\nThe ability to target heads of state was an improbable amount of power for a\ncompany that only a few years earlier had been teaching college kids to code.\n\n### Approaching infinity\n\nRajat Khare was a 20-year-old computer science major when he and his friends\ncame up with the idea for Appin over chicken pizza at a Domino\u2019s in New Delhi.\n\nIt was December 2003. Khare had joined his high school buddies to catch up and\nbemoan the state of India\u2019s universities, which they thought weren\u2019t preparing\nstudents for the professional world. When one suggested organizing technology\ntraining workshops to supplement undergraduates\u2019 education, people present at\nthe meal said Khare jumped on the idea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give the students what they want,\u201d he quoted himself telling the group\nin a book on entrepreneurship he co-wrote years later. \u201cLet\u2019s start something\nthat will not only change their lives, but our lives too ... forever.\u201d\n\nAfter the Domino\u2019s meeting, Khare and his friends came up with the name Appin\n\u2013 short for \u201cApproaching infinity\u201d \u2013 and launched their first classes on\ncomputer programming.\n\nIt was the right idea at the right time. India\u2019s IT outsourcing boom had\ncreated voracious demand for tech talent. Appin franchises would soon sprout\nacross India, offering not just programming lessons but also courses on\nrobotics and cybersecurity, nicknamed \u201cethical hacking.\u201d\n\nBy 2005, the company had an office in western New Delhi. Rajat had been joined\nby his older brother, Anuj, a motivational speaker who returned to India after\na stint running a startup in Texas. As other members of the Domino\u2019s group\nstepped away, the Khare brothers took charge of the fast-growing firm.\n\nThe cybersecurity classes proved especially popular. By 2007, Appin opened a\ndigital security consultancy helping Indian organizations protect themselves\nonline, according to a draft pitch deck intended for potential investors.\n\nThat soon drew the attention of Indian government officials who were still\nfeeling their way through intelligence work in the internet age. To help the\nofficials break into computers and emails, Appin set up a team of hackers out\nof a subsidiary called Appin Software Security Pvt. Ltd., also known as the\nAppin Security Group, according to a former executive, company communications,\nan ex-senior Indian intelligence figure and promotional documents seen by\nReuters.\n\nThe spying was a secret within the wider company. Some early Appin employees\nsigned nondisclosure agreements before being shipped off to military-\ncontrolled safe houses where they worked out of sight from their colleagues,\naccording to another former executive familiar with the matter and three\nhackers who spent time in the safe houses.\n\nOne of the hackers recalled being only 22 years old when he broke into the\ninboxes of Khalistani separatists \u2013 Sikh militants fighting to carve an\nindependent homeland out of India\u2019s Punjab province \u2013 and delivering the trove\nto his handlers.\n\n\u201cIt was the experience of a lifetime,\u201d he said, recalling how proud he was to\nbe contributing to India\u2019s national security.\n\nOne of Appin\u2019s primary targets was Pakistan, according to interviews with\nformer insiders, company emails, and stolen passwords and key logs of\nPakistani officials reviewed by Reuters. The hackers created fake dating\nwebsites designed to ensnare Pakistani military officers, two of the insiders\nsaid.\n\nAnother early mission, dubbed Operation Rainbow, involved penetrating Chinese\nmilitary computers and stealing information about missiles and radar,\naccording to an undated Appin memo. The memo said the company\u2019s hackers\ncompromised several Chinese officials; Reuters was unable to confirm the\nalleged intrusions independently.\n\nThose early operations led to more contracts.\n\nSoon Appin was working with the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW), India\u2019s\nexternal intelligence service; and the Intelligence Bureau, the country\u2019s\ndomestic spy agency, according to the two former executives, one former Appin\nhacker and a former senior Indian intelligence official.\n\nDetailed messages from Reuters seeking comment from the Intelligence Bureau\nand RAW, sent via India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs and its Cabinet\nSecretariat, respectively, were not returned. India\u2019s Ministry of Defense did\nnot return messages about the hacking. The Pakistani foreign affairs ministry\ndid not return messages. China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that it\nwas unaware of the hacking activity.\n\nBy 2008, Appin was claiming it offered a \u201cone stop interception solution\u201d for\ngovernment clients, according to one company presentation.\n\nCompany executives marketed software for the analysis of call record data\u2013 the\nwho, what, when of phone calls monitored by spy agencies and law enforcement \u2013\nand discussed the importation of Israeli cell phone interception devices,\nAppin emails show.\n\nIn 2009, Appin boasted to prospective customers that it was serving India\u2019s\nmilitary, its Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Central Bureau of\nInvestigation (CBI), an Indian agency roughly equivalent to America\u2019s Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI), emails show.\n\nAppin\u2019s solutions \u201care being used by various elite intelligence agencies in\ngovernment to monitor hostile people,\u201d one pitch claimed.\n\nThe CBI and Ministry of Home Affairs didn\u2019t return detailed messages seeking\ncomment.\n\nCompany revenues in the fiscal year ending in 2009 were estimated at nearly $1\nmillion, with profit after tax pegged at about $170,000, according to the\ndraft pitch deck aimed at potential investors. The deck projected that figure\nwould multiply almost tenfold over the next 36 months.\n\nBut Appin had hit a speed bump. The two former executives, one of the former\nhackers, and the former Indian intelligence official said the company earned\nextra money by quietly taking material it hacked for one Indian agency and\nreselling it to another. This double dipping was eventually discovered, the\npeople said, and several enraged spy agency clients canceled their contracts\nwith Appin.\n\nWith intelligence work drying up, Appin pivoted to the private sector, the\nsources said.\n\n### \u2018Fucking with the wrong people\u2019\n\nThe influx of Western clients brought new revenue \u2013 and new risk.\n\nAmerican and Swiss law enforcement documents, including emails and\ninvestigative reports reviewed by Reuters, reveal how Appin got caught hacking\nas it fulfilled its customers\u2019 orders.\n\nAn early example was the compromise of prominent Zurich-based communications\nconsultant Peter Hargitay, who had served as an advisor to Australia\u2019s\nfootball federation. He and his filmmaker son Stevie detected the intrusion\nand filed a Swiss criminal complaint.\n\nWithin weeks, an expert they hired traced the hack to a server near the Zurich\nairport, according to the law enforcement documents. Billing records tied to\nthe server listed Rajat Khare as the client.\n\nFather and son had come off a failed bid to bring the 2022 FIFA World Cup to\nAustralia and were in no mood to let the hack slide, according to emails\nprovided by an independent source.\n\nIn a March 2012 message to his father, Stevie said he had spoken on the phone\nwith an Appin employee who was clearly rattled by the exchange. \u201cI told him in\nno uncertain terms that they are fucking with the wrong people,\u201d Stevie wrote.\n\nRajat Khare called Stevie the same day to try to smooth things over, saying he\n\u201cwants to cooperate \u2018100%,\u2019\u201d Stevie wrote. The emails show that an Appin\nemployee later told Stevie the hack was ordered by a U.S. private\ninvestigator; contact fell off as the Hargitays pushed for more information\nabout who was ultimately behind the spying.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who his client was,\u201d Peter Hargitay said.\n\nKhare\u2019s lawyers told Reuters he \u201cdoes not know\u201d the Hargitays.\n\nA few months later, Appin was implicated in another incident, this time in\nIndia. Cybersecurity consultant K. K. Mookhey told a conference near New Delhi\nthat he had tied an attempted hack against one of his clients to the firm. In\na report published in 2013, Mookhey wrote that the link to Appin was \u201cnot\nconcrete.\u201d But he told Reuters he had been \u201covercautious\u201d in choosing those\nwords and that the evidence, including Appin documentation inadvertently left\non the hackers\u2019 servers, made it obvious they were involved.\n\n\u201cThe link was actually pretty clear,\u201d he said.\n\nAppin\u2019s name had popped up earlier that year in Norway. In February 2013,\ntechnicians at telecommunications company Telenor discovered that hackers had\nstolen as many as 66,000 emails from the company\u2019s chief executive, two\npersonal assistants and a senior lawyer at the firm, according to Norwegian\nlaw enforcement documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThree months later, Oslo-based cybersecurity firm Norman Shark \u2013 which had\nlaunched its own independent investigation into the Telenor hack \u2013 publicly\nlinked the intrusion to Appin.\n\nNorman Shark stopped short of directly blaming the company, saying only that\n\u201cthere seems to be some connection\u201d between Appin and the Telenor hackers. One\nof the report\u2019s coauthors, security researcher Jonathan Camp, told Reuters\nthat Norman Shark had softened the report\u2019s language to avoid legal trouble.\nCamp said he and his colleagues privately were confident that Appin was behind\nthe hacking, citing an unusually large number of digital clues pointing to the\ncompany, including multiple malicious websites registered under the Appin\nname.\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt in our minds,\u201d he said.\n\nCalifornia-based tech firm Broadcom, which absorbed Norman Shark following a\nseries of acquisitions, did not respond to requests seeking comment. Telenor\nconfirmed it had been the victim of \u201cindustrial espionage,\u201d which it reported\nto police at the time. It declined further comment. The motive behind the\nhacking has never been made public.\n\nAppin denied all wrongdoing in the wake of Camp\u2019s report, and the Khares\u2019\nlawyers still insist the research didn\u2019t implicate the company. Nevertheless,\nAppin came under increasing scrutiny in the years that followed.\n\nNorway was one of at least four countries \u2013 along with the United States,\nSwitzerland and the Dominican Republic \u2013 that had opened investigations into\nAppin. Some began comparing notes.\n\nIn an undated written exchange reviewed by Reuters, FBI official Dan Brady\ntold Swiss prosecutor Sandra Schweingruber that U.S. officials looking into\nthe hack of the Shinnecock tribe on Long Island had \u201caccumulated a fair amount\nof data identifying other victims.\u201d\n\nSchweingruber declined to comment for this story. Reuters was unable to reach\nBrady. The FBI declined to answer a list of questions about its investigation\ninto Appin.\n\nIn his note to Schweingruber, Brady said \u201cthe link in our respective cases is\nthat I believe we have the same ultimate perpetrator.\u201d\n\nThen he added, in parentheses: \u201cAppin.\u201d\n\n### Lost leads, lasting pain\n\nThe multinational investigations into Appin each carried on for years before\npetering out.\n\nJochi G\u00f3mez, the Dominican newspaper publisher, was formally accused of\nworking with Rajat Khare to hack emails following the 2012 raid on his\npublication.\n\nBut the case never went to trial; it was quashed on procedural grounds in\n2013, a decision reaffirmed by the country\u2019s highest court the following year.\nDominican prosecutors described Khare as a member of G\u00f3mez\u2019s \u201cinternational\ncriminal network.\u201d But one of the judges involved dismissed the idea as a\n\u201ctheory.\u201d Khare was never charged in the matter.\n\nDominican judiciary officials didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment about the\ncase.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters a decade later, G\u00f3mez acknowledged hiring Khare for\nsurveillance, saying he had been hunting for evidence of corruption.\n\n\u201cI did it for journalism,\u201d G\u00f3mez said. \u201cIs it lawful or not? That\u2019s another\nstory.\u201d\n\nNorway\u2019s investigation into the Telenor hack led to four internet protocol\naddresses in New Delhi, according to the law enforcement files reviewed by\nReuters. In an undated email sent to the FBI, the Swiss prosecutor\nSchweingruber said the Norwegians had gone further still. \u201cTheir investigation\nleads also to Appin,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThat inquiry similarly ran aground. A spokesperson for Norway\u2019s National\nCriminal Investigation Service confirmed to Reuters that the case was closed\nin June 2016 \u201ctaking into consideration the chances of obtaining further\nevidence and information through further investigation.\u201d\n\nSwiss authorities also implicated Appin in the case of PR consultant Peter\nHargitay, according to the files.\n\nIn her email to the FBI, Schweingruber said the Swiss investigation \u2013\nnicknamed \u201cTandoori\u201d \u2013 had found that \u201cthe Indian company Appin Security Group\nas well as their CEO Rajat Khare are involved in this case.\u201d\n\nYet the files show Swiss authorities rebuffed the Hargitays\u2019 request to have\nKhare quizzed about the hack. In a message to the Hargitays sent in September\n2020, Schweingruber\u2019s successor, Anna Carter, said she was discontinuing the\ncase \u201cdue to the lack of further promising investigative approaches.\u201d\n\nSwiss prosecutors confirmed that the investigation was closed, but wouldn\u2019t\nelaborate. Peter Hargitay told Reuters that the prosecutors\u2019 decision \u201cremains\na mystery to us to this day.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. cybercrime prosecutor Mark Califano told Reuters that cracking\ninternational hacking cases is \u201creally very hard.\u201d But he said it was still\n\u201cvery disconcerting\u201d that Appin\u2019s hackers were \u201cso successful in evading law\nenforcement despite apparently significant effort to try to track them down \u2013\nand some very good evidence.\u201d\n\nRajat Khare\u2019s lawyers said their client had never been charged with hacking\n\u201cby any police, investigative, regulatory, or charging authority.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to establish whether Appin was ever investigated in its\nnative India.\n\nK. K. Mookhey, the cybersecurity consultant whose client was targeted by\nAppin, said he alerted India\u2019s cyber response agency, CERT-In, in 2013, but\nnever heard back. CERT-In did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRajat Khare has come to the attention of the Indian government on a separate\nmatter: A 2021 complaint filed with the country\u2019s Central Bureau of\nInvestigation accused Khare of being one of at least eight people who\nembezzled roughly 8.06 billion rupees ($97 million) lent to the Indian\neducation company Educomp, where he had previously served as a director. There\nis no indication that the case is related to hacking.\n\nThe complaint was filed by a senior official at the country\u2019s biggest lender,\nthe State Bank of India. Reuters could not determine the case\u2019s status. The\nState Bank, the CBI and Educomp did not respond to requests for comment.\nKhare\u2019s lawyers said he had been \u201ccleared\u201d by Educomp\u2019s management. They\ndidn\u2019t provide evidence and said they could not offer details on the CBI\nprobe.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have known about Appin\u2019s capabilities for more than\na decade, according to three former American security officials and law\nenforcement documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA), which spies on foreigners for the U.S.\ngovernment, began surveilling the company after watching it hack \u201chigh value\u201d\nPakistani officials around 2009, one of the sources said. An NSA spokesperson\ndeclined to comment.\n\nAnother former U.S. security official said Rajat Khare was of such interest\nthat the FBI tracked his travel and communications. The law enforcement case\nfiles also show that the FBI told its Swiss counterparts that it had \u201ca\nconfidential human source who has the capacity to report on Appin Security\nmatters.\u201d\n\nRajat Khare\u2019s lawyers said the notion that he had been investigated by the FBI\nor any other such law enforcement body was \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nThe bureau\u2019s investigation into the Appin hack that sparked turmoil within the\nShinnecock Nation did yield two convictions.\n\nThe first came in 2016, when a Shinnecock tribal official named Karen Hunter\npleaded guilty at a federal court in the Long Island town of Islip to\nunlawfully accessing the email account of her fellow Shinnecock tribal member\nChuck Randall.\n\nThe court filings, which were partially sealed, show that Hunter got\nprobation. It was not until several years later that Steven Santarpia, the\nprivate eye, said he had been hired by Hunter to carry out the job.\n\nSantarpia was the second to be convicted. He received probation from the same\ncourt in Islip in 2020 after pleading guilty to a single count of computer\nhacking, saying in an affidavit reviewed by Reuters that he hired Appin to\ncarry out the email heist. Most of the filings in that case, which mask his\nidentity, remain secret. No public mention of Appin was made in either his or\nHunter\u2019s prosecution.\n\nHunter did not return repeated messages from Reuters seeking comment. A\nreporter who visited Shinnecock Nation territory in an effort to interview her\nwas intercepted by the tribe\u2019s chairman, Bryan Polite, and ordered off the\nreservation. Polite said in an email that the tribe\u2019s governing body was not\ninterested in commenting.\n\nRandall said he was baffled by the U.S. government\u2019s lack of action against\nAppin.\n\n\u201cYou can do this from across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe penalties and the laws\nhave to catch up.\u201d\n\n### \u2018Godfather for all hackers\u2019\n\nAppin\u2019s legacy still lingers more than a decade after the Shinnecock hack.\n\nIts web presence faded in the months following the publication of the Norman\nShark report in 2013, internet archives show. Eight former employees say their\nold managers told them to delete references to Appin from their public\nprofiles.\n\nIts former holding company, Appin Technology, changed its name three times,\nfinally settling on Sunkissed Organic Farms in 2017, records filed with\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of Corporate Affairs show. Its subsidiaries also underwent\nrebrandings: Appin Software Security, the arm which billed private eyes for\nthe hacking work, became Adaptive Control Security Global Corporate, or ACSG,\nin 2015.\n\nRajat Khare\u2019s lawyers say he left Appin Technology in December 2012, a move\nthat \u201cofficially and immediately separated him from all Appin entities.\u201d They\nproduced two letters they said showed those resignations.\n\nYet Khare\u2019s signature is on several Appin corporate filings dating to 2013 and\n2014; and shareholder data shows he maintained a stake in Appin Technology for\nseveral years past 2012. According to Indian corporate records, Khare \u2013 who is\nnow a Switzerland-based investor \u2013 resigned as director of the company once\nknown as Appin Technology only in 2016.\n\nHis family still controlled the companies as recently as last year. Rajat\u2019s\nbrother, Anuj, and their father, Vijay Kumar, are majority owners of Sunkissed\nOrganic Farms, which in turn owns ACSG and at least two other firms founded\nunder the Appin name, according to the latest available financial data\ndisclosed to the corporate affairs ministry.\n\nIn an exchange of messages over WhatsApp this week, ACSG company secretary\nDeepak Kumar confirmed that his firm was once known as Appin and described\nRajat Khare as the corporate group\u2019s \u201cowner.\u201d The following day, he said he\nwould no longer reply to questions.\n\nAnuj Khare\u2019s lawyer, Kumar & Kumar Advocates, said questions about his\nclient\u2019s financial dealings were \u201cnot relevant.\u201d The Khare brothers\u2019 father,\nVijay Kumar, did not return repeated messages seeking comment.\n\nOn its website, ACSG describes itself as a critical infrastructure protection\ncompany that caters to government clients. Employee resumes posted to job\nsites say the company carries out \u201clawful interception\u201d and \u201coffensive\nsecurity,\u201d industry terms for digital surveillance work.\n\nMore than 50 current and former ACSG employees reached by Reuters either did\nnot respond or declined to comment, saying their work was confidential.\n\nReuters found at least half a dozen other hack-for-hire firms in India that\nhave adopted Appin\u2019s business model of serving private investigators and\ncorporate lawyers. Some have run into trouble with American tech companies or\nbeen named in U.S. lawsuits.\n\nLast year, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms identified CyberRoot\nRisk Advisory, a firm created by Appin alumni, as a mercenary spy company that\nused bogus accounts to trick people into clicking malicious links.\n\nIn October 2022, CyberRoot and BellTroX InfoTech Services, another firm\nfounded by a former Appin employee, were accused of hacking former Wall Street\nJournal reporter Jay Solomon and one of his key sources, according to lawsuits\nfiled last year by each of the men in federal court, one in Washington, the\nother in New York. Solomon later settled his Washington case on undisclosed\nterms; the New York lawsuit filed by his source is ongoing.\n\nIn June 2022, Google researchers linked hack-for-hire activity to another\nIndian company named Rebsec Solutions, which Google said \u201copenly advertises\ncorporate espionage.\u201d\n\nRebsec\u2019s founder, Vishavdeep Singh, told Reuters he had worked for Appin and\nBellTroX but was never involved in hacking, and that Rebsec merely taught\ncybersecurity courses.\n\nCyberRoot said in a public statement issued last year that it \u201chas never\nengaged in illegal activities.\u201d It declined further comment. Attempts to reach\nBellTroX\u2019s founder, Sumit Gupta, have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn his last known interview, speaking with Reuters in 2020, Gupta claimed he\nwas not personally involved in cyberespionage. But he did acknowledge the\noutsized role that his former employer played in shaping the industry.\n\n\u201cAppin is the godfather for all the hackers,\u201d he said.\n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://ddosecrets.com/index.php?title=Appin_Uncensored&oldid=2992\"\n\nCategory:\n\n  * Greenhouse Project\n\n  * This page was last edited on 17 January 2024, at 18:35.\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * About Distributed Denial of Secrets\n  * Disclaimers\n\nX\n\nDDoSecrets is the most important and most active public library of hacked and\nleaked datasets in the world today, but we're completely out of money.
