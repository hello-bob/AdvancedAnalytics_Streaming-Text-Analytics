Model builders argue their use of the material is fair.\n\nIn a letter to science and technology minister Michelle Donelan, the House of\nLords Select Committee on Communications and Digital said the government's\nrecord on copyright is \"inadequate and deteriorating.\"\n\n\"The issues with copyright are manifesting right now and problematic business\nmodels are fast becoming entrenched and normalised. It is worth exploring\nwhether these trends suggest a few larger publishers will obtain some\nlicensing deals while a longer tail of smaller outlets lose out,\" the letter\nsaid.\n\n\"Government's reticence to take meaningful action amounts to a de facto\nendorsement of tech firms' practices. That reflects poorly on this\nGovernment's commitment to British businesses, fair play and the equal\napplication of the law,\" it said.\n\nThe committee contrasted the government's approach to copyright and AI with\nits mission on AI safety: it has backed a new AI Safety Institute with high-\nlevel attention from the prime minister and \u00a3400 million funding.\n\n\"On copyright, the Government has set up and subsequently disbanded a failed\nseries of roundtables led by the Intellectual Property Office. The commitment\nto ministerial engagement is helpful but the next steps have been left\nunclear. While well-intentioned, this is simply not enough,\" the letter said.\n\nThe missive follows a committee report [PDF] that said tech firms were using\ncopyrighted material without permission and \"reaping vast financial rewards.\"\n\n\"The current legal framework is failing to ensure these outcomes occur and the\nGovernment has a duty to act. It cannot sit on its hands for the next decade\nand hope the courts will provide an answer,\" the report said.\n\nIn its response, the government said the UK had \"world-leading protections for\ncopyright and intellectual property.\"\n\nIn the AI Regulation White Paper consultation, the government said the\nIntellectual Property Office would engage stakeholders on copyright and AI as\npart of a working group aiming to agree a voluntary code.\n\n\"However, many of the issues relating to copyright and AI are challenging and\nthe working group was not able to reach a consensus,\" the response said.\n\n  * More big city newspapers drag Microsoft, OpenAI hard in copyright lawsuit\n  * Ex-Amazon exec claims she was asked to ignore copyright law in race to AI\n  * MPs ask: Why is it so freakin' hard to get AI giants to pay copyright holders?\n  * US House mulls forcing AI makers to reveal use of copyrighted training data\n\nThe committee said the government's response reflected poorly on its\n\"commitment to British businesses, fair play and the equal application of the\nlaw.\"\n\nDevelopers of LLMs are in the crosshairs of legal action for alleged breaches\nof copyright. Earlier this week, eight American newspapers launched legal\naction to sue Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming the tech duo unlawfully used the\npublishers' copyrighted articles to train AI models. Microsoft and OpenAI were\nsued last year by the New York Times on similar grounds.\n\nBefore a Lords committee hearing last year, Dan Conway, CEO of the UK's\nPublishers Association, said LLMs were infringing copyrighted content on an\n\"absolutely massive scale.\"\n\n\"We know this in the publishing industry because of the Books3 database which\nlists 120,000 pirated book titles, which we know have been ingested by large\nlanguage models,\" he said. \"We know that the content is being ingested on an\nabsolutely massive scale by large language models. LLMs do infringe copyright\nat multiple parts of the process in terms of when they collect this\ninformation, how they store this information, and how they how they handle it.\nThe copyright law is being broken on a massive scale.\"\n\nOwen Larter, director of public policy at Microsoft's Office of Responsible\nAI, said: \"It's really important to understand that you need to train these\nlarge language models on large data sets if you're going to get them to\nperform effectively, if you're going to allow them to be safe and secure ...\nThere are also some competition issues [in making sure] that training of large\nmodels is available to everyone. If you go too far down a path where it's very\nhard to obtain data to train models, then all of a sudden, the ability to do\nso will only be the preserve of very large companies.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Copyright\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Copyright\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Microsoft\n  * OpenAI\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * Copilot\n  * DCMS\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * GCHQ\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * HMRC\n  * HoloLens\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Large Language Model\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * NCSC\n  * .NET\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NHS\n  * NLP\n  * Office 365\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * RPA\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * Software License\n  * SQL Server\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Government\n  * Self-driving Car\n  * United Kingdom\n\n#### More about\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Copyright\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Copyright\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Microsoft\n  * OpenAI\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * Copilot\n  * DCMS\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * GCHQ\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * HMRC\n  * HoloLens\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Large Language Model\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * NCSC\n  * .NET\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NHS\n  * NLP\n  * Office 365\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * RPA\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * Software License\n  * SQL Server\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Government\n  * Self-driving Car\n  * United Kingdom\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### More big city newspapers drag Microsoft, OpenAI hard in copyright lawsuit\n\nPublishers want ChatGPT models destroyed after ML tech trained 'unlawfully' on\narticles\n\nAI + ML3 days | 16\n\n#### Microsoft's FOMO after seeing Google AI drove investment in OpenAI\n\nHistorical email in antitrust case shows execs 'very, very worried' about\ncapability gaps\n\nAI + ML2 days | 1\n\n#### What's up with Alphabet and Microsoft lately?
