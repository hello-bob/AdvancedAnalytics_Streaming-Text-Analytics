In this study, we have\nexplored the potential of extracting decay heat from HLW, taking advantage of\nrecent advances in the technologies to utilize low-temperature geothermal\nresources for the co-generation of electricity and heat. Given that geothermal\nenergy entails extracting heat from natural radioactivity within the Earth, we\nmay consider that our approach is to augment it with an anthropogenic\ngeothermal source. Our study\u2014for the first time\u2014introduces a conceptual model\nof a binary-cycle geothermal system powered by the heat produced by HLW.\nTOUGHREACT V3.32 software was used to model the heat transfer resulting from\nradioactive decay to the surrounding geological media. Our results demonstrate\nthe feasibility of employing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to generate\napproximately 108 kWe per HLW canister 30 years after emplacement and a heat\npump system to produce 81 kWth of high-potential heat per canister for HVAC\npurposes within the same timeframe. The proposed facility has the potential to\nproduce carbon-free power while ensuring the safe disposal of radioactive\nwaste and removing the bottleneck in the sustainable use of nuclear energy.\n\nKeywords:\n\nspent nuclear fuel; high-level nuclear waste repository; low-temperature heat\nrecovery\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nNuclear power generation produces high-level radioactive waste (HLW)\u2014spent\nnuclear fuel and vitrified waste from reprocessing\u2014that includes fission\nproducts and actinides [1]. Among the countries that use nuclear technology to\ngenerate electricity, there has been substantial progress in the safe\nmanagement and disposal strategies of HLW, including the development of deep\ngeological repositories [2]. To date, most research and development efforts\nfor disposal have been focused on studying the evolution of the disposal site\nconditions and engineered barrier systems (EBS), such as premature canister\ncorrosion and alterations in the physicochemical properties of clay formations\n[3,4].\n\nOne of the challenges of handling and storing HLW is decay heat [1], the heat\nreleased from radioactive decay. Decay heat decreases over time depending on\nthe types and amount of radionuclides in the waste. The elevated temperature\nmay alter the properties of the EBS by accelerating the corrosion of the waste\ncanisters and the degradation of bentonite used as a backfill material and by\naffecting the hydrological and geochemical properties of host rocks [5,6].\nThus, the maximum allowable temperature is an important design variable for a\ngeological repository because it determines the intermediate storage time, as\nwell as the spacing of canister emplacements [1].\n\nOne unexplored option (to the authors\u2019 knowledge) is to utilize HLW as a heat\nsource during the first several decades of canister emplacement. A significant\namount of heat released due to radioactive decay can be converted to electric\npower using binary cycle technology [7,8]. Geothermal energy is the energy\nobtained from the Earth\u2019s internal heat, which is in fact generated by the\nradioactive decay of isotopes in Earth\u2019s core, mantle, and crust [9]. The\nradioactive waste can be considered an anthropogenic geothermal source and\nsuitable repository designs can be developed with built-in heat exchangers in\nproximity to the canisters. As the generated heat is continuously extracted by\nthe heat exchangers, the thermal\u2013hydrological\u2013mechanical\u2013chemical (THMC)\nproperties of the formation containing the canister could be controlled and\nmonitored for a considerable amount of time.\n\nIn the existing literature, Westinghouse proposed a design that utilizes decay\nheat from nuclear fuel stored in spent fuel pools (SFPs) to power emergency\ncooling systems based on thermoelectric modules and waste heat engines [10].\nThese systems were intended to convert decay heat into electricity and drive\nturbines with a vaporized working fluid. While Westinghouse\u2019s innovation in\nutilizing SFP decay heat was patented, it has not been used in real-world\napplications. In addition, there have not been any research studies that have\nexplored the utilization of decay heat in storage or disposal settings.\n\nGeothermal energy for domestic use has been developing rapidly in recent\nyears, providing stable carbon-free electricity and supplying heating,\nventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [7]. Geothermal resources are\nclassified (with reference to their temperature) as low, medium, and high-\ntemperature resources. Traditionally, geothermal energy was only considered\nfor high temperatures (exceeding 150 \u00b0C), since conventional electricity\ngeneration in a power plant requires water or steam at very high temperatures\n(150\u2013550 \u00b0C) [11].\n\nA particularly recent development relevant to this study is the viability of\nutilizing low-temperature geothermal resources for the co-generation of\nelectricity and heat at temperatures below 149 \u00b0C [11]. This technology is\nachieved through a binary cycle of geothermal water and low-boiling working\nfluid in industrial-scale power plants. Binary cycles are thermodynamic cycles\nusing two working fluids, one of which has a low saturation pressure at high\ntemperatures and the other has a low vaporization temperature [8]. The higher-\nboiling working fluid, after the rotation of the turbine, gives off heat to\nthe condenser, which is also the evaporator for the lower-boiling working\nfluid.\n\nBuilding on these new opportunities, this study introduces a conceptual model\nof a binary cycle geothermal system powered by the heat produced by HLW within\nthe geological repository. Unlike natural geothermal resources, whose\navailability is geographically constrained [12,13], the heat from HLW presents\na more widespread opportunity to generate clean energy while addressing waste\ndisposal challenges.\n\nWe will quantify (1) the electricity generation potential via the organic\nRankine cycle and (2) the potential for producing heat for HVAC purposes via a\nheat pump unit. TOUGHREACT V3.32 software was employed in this work to model\nthe heat production and transfer resulting from radioactive decay. In\naddition, we will evaluate the safety concerns of the proposed concept. We\nassume a typical repository setting across different countries, having the\nmined repository several hundred meters below the groundwater table. We\nexplore different ways of harnessing thermal energy generated by HLW and\nconverting it into practical forms of energy that can be utilized for\ngeothermal heat pumps and electricity generation, employing a steam turbine\nwithin the organic Rankine cycle. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to systematically explore the possible use of decay heat in the\nrepository setting.\n\n## 2\\. System Description\n\nA representative illustration of a deep geological repository system with an\nintermediate energy system is represented in Figure 1, while Figure 2 shows a\nschematic diagram of an HLW disposal facility with a heat exchanger. In the\ndeep geological repository, the multi-barrier system (including EBS and the\nnatural barrier system) provides the isolation of waste from the biosphere.\nOne of the elements of the EBS is a buffer material designed to seal\nradioactive waste packages within the underground storage facility [14,15].\nAlthough we do not consider a particular site or repository, we assume the\nrepository design parameters commonly used, which are stated in the subsequent\nsections.\n\nFigure 1. Representative illustration of a deep geological repository system\nwith an intermediate heat pump system.\n\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of a storage facility for high-level radioactive\nwaste with a heat exchanger.\n\nThe heat extraction system functions similarly to a geothermal heat pump.\nInitially, water is injected into the subsurface and circulates in the pipes\naround a canister, absorbing heat. This heated water is then pumped back to\nthe surface. Upon reaching the surface, a heat exchange occurs within the\nevaporator of the heat pump system (HPS) or ORC loops through the primary\nvertical ground heat exchanger (VGHE) loop. This process facilitates the\ntransfer of thermal energy to the refrigerant\u2014R141b for the HPS and R142b for\nthe ORC.\n\nWe assume that the heat extraction is strictly during the post-closure period\nimmediately after the repository development with active monitoring to ensure\nsafety. In addition, we assume that the pipes can be properly sealed and\nplugged after the operation is ceased for permanent disposal.\n\n## 3\\. Materials and Methods\n\nOur modeling framework consists of five stages from heat generation to energy\nharnessing: (1) heat generation; (2) heat transfer including flow and physical\nprocesses near the waste in the subsurface; (3) heat extraction through VGHE\nwithin the EBS; (4) counter-flow heat exchange between the VGHE and the\nevaporator, and (5) harnessing the extracted heat to generate useful energy\nwithin the thermodynamic cycles.\n\n#### 3.1. Heat Generation\n\nAfter a reactor shutdown, fission reactions essentially cease but heat release\ncontinues, owing to the radioactive decay of the accumulated fission products\nand actinides [1]. The decay heat is dependent on the spent fuel\u2019s\nradionuclide content. This, in turn, depends on the fuel\u2019s burnup and the\nlength of the interim storage time before deposition in the repository. The\ntwo fission products, ^137Cs and ^90Sr (with half-lives of about 30 years),\nare the isotopes that account for the majority of heat generation during the\nfirst few centuries [1].\n\nWe assumed the spent fuel from a typical PWR core, containing 157 fuel\nassemblies with a total thermal power of 3300 MWth [16]. The power history\nused for the calculations is approximated as 4 years of operation at full\npower [17], with a cooling time of 4 years [18]. We consider four assemblies\nper canister [19].\n\nThe American National Standard for Decay Heat Power [20] can be used to\nquantify the decay heat power as a function of time by a sum of 23\nexponentials. Since for up to a few hundred years the 19th exponential decay\ngroup is dominant for up to a few hundred years, the decay heat output of the\ncanister can be approximated as\n\nP(t) = P_0e^\u2212\u03bbt,\n\nwhere P_0 is the initial rate of heat production, \u03bb is the decay constant for\ngroup 19, and t is time.\n\n#### 3.2. Thermal\u2013Hydrological (TH) Model\n\nIn this study, we have modeled two relevant TH processes, namely (a) thermal\nconduction and (b) the bentonite hydrology saturation process. Thermal\nconduction is the main mechanism at work during the canister\u2019s thermal\nevolution. The thermal and hydrodynamic parameters used in the model are\nlisted in Table 1. We assume that the EBS buffer is composed of FEBEX\nbentonite and that the host-rock properties of argillite are adapted from the\nproperties of Opalinus clay [21].\n\nTable 1. Thermal and hydrodynamic parameters of FEBEX bentonite [21].\n\nIn the proposed repository, bentonite serves a dual purpose: (1) as a heat\nconductor (grout), aiding energy transfer, and (2) as an engineered barrier,\nretarding the radionuclide migration through the sorption to clay minerals. In\naddition, we assume that radiation sensors would be instrumented to monitor\nthe radiation level within the circulating fluid.\n\nFor hydrology, the water intrusion into the buffer is explicitly modeled,\nusing a two-phase flow model with vapor-pressure-lowering effects due to\ncapillary pressure (approximated by the van Genuchten function). The thermal\nconductivity is a function of water saturation determined from the following\nlinear relationship:\n\nk_th = k_wet + S_l(k_wet \u2212 k_dry),\n\nwhere S_l is the liquid saturation level and k_dry and k_wet are the thermal\nconductivities under dry and fully saturated conditions, respectively.\n\n#### 3.3. TH Model Implementation in Numerical Models\n\nWe use TOUGHREACT to compute the coupled TH processes in a generic bentonite-\nbuffered nuclear waste repository, including an emplacement tunnel at a depth\nof 300\u20131000 m [22]. TOUGHREACT is a computer code that simulates the behavior\nof fluid flow and heat transport as well as geochemical reactions in geologic\nmedia [22]. The depth range was considered constant in our calculations and we\ndid not vary the length of the emplacement tunnels when assessing heat losses.\nThis approach was based on the assumption of negligible heat losses, through\ninsulation of the pipes and grouting of the surrounding medium. Consequently,\nthe heat transfer modeling primarily focuses on the canister\u2013bentonite\ninterface, positing that the heat exchanger is situated in the vicinity of the\ncanister to optimize thermal energy capture. Furthermore, the energy transfer\nprocesses within the HPS and ORC were modeled independently of the tunnel\nlength, considering the potential placement of these systems at various\nproximities to the canister. This methodological choice reflects our intent to\nillustrate the best-case scenario in terms of thermal energy recovery\nefficiency.\n\nIn this simplified domain, the canister is modeled as a heat source with\nsteel\u2019s mechanical properties. The mesh (Figure 3) used in the numerical\nsimulation was taken from Cao et al. [21,23,24]; the applicability of this\nmodel is limited to the interpretation and prediction of the behavior of TH,\nprimarily in the vicinity of the canister where thermal effects are\nsignificant. We adopted an axisymmetric mesh to represent the symmetrical\nheating process of the EBS. This meshing approach is grounded in the\nsymmetrical nature of the thermal behavior observed in the EBS, which allows\nfor a significant reduction in computational load [25]. The mesh used in our\nstudy has been previously validated and sensitivity analyses of THMC\nparameters were conducted in existing research [21,23,25].\n\nFigure 3. Mesh used for the model, not to scale: Point A is located at r =\n0.479 m; B is located at r = 1.13 m in the bentonite next to the\nbentonite\u2013host rock interface; C is located in host rock next to the\nbentonite\u2013host rock interface with r = 1.29 m; and D is 11.07 m away from the\nbentonite\u2013host rock interface [21,23].\n\nA non-isothermal mode was used to simulate this model, describing the changing\nheat-power output over time. The bentonite undergoes re-saturation, heating,\nand chemical modification starting at time zero. As per the initial condition,\nthere is no fluid flow at the canister surface and the liquid pressure is 7\nbar at r = 50 m. The EBS initial temperature is uniform and equals 12 \u00b0C.\nInitially, bentonite has a water saturation of 59% and a suction of 1.11 \u00d7\n10^5 [kPa]. The host rock is fully saturated.\n\n#### 3.4. Heat Extraction Cycle Modeling\n\nWe used the SmoWeb software [26] to generate the pressure-enthalpy (P-h)\ndiagrams of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and heat pump system (HPS) and\nalso to determine the installation\u2019s efficiency and power values. SmoWeb is a\ncomputing platform written in Python, which includes a number of applications\nbuilt on its basis [26]. In this work, SmoWeb was used to determine the (1)\nheat exchange between the EBS and primary (VGHE) loop; (2) heat exchange\nbetween primary (VGHE) and secondary (HPS/ORC) loops; (3) heat pump\ninstallation\u2019s coefficient of performance (COP); and (4) efficiency and\nturbine power output of the ORC.\n\n#### 3.4.1. Heat Exchange between the EBS and VGHE\n\nSince most heat exchangers function in an environment where pressure\nvariations are minimal, the constant pressure assumption is applicable to a\nwide range of real-world settings [27]. Thus, the determination of heat\nexchange between the EBS and the thermal fluid can be simplified by assuming\nconstant pressure and equating the enthalpy change to the heat transfer. A\nsteady-state one-dimensional plane wall model was employed to simulate heat\ntransfer at the interface between the heat exchanger and the bentonite\ncanister, given the assumption of uniform temperature distribution at this\ninterface. This simplification was chosen to maintain focus on the critical\nheat exchange processes. The initial temperature, T_i, is considered uniform\nacross the VGHE\u2019s entire length, aligning with the steady-state assumption to\nexamine long-term behavior rather than transient dynamics. While we\nacknowledge that a radial transient model might provide a more detailed\nrepresentation, this assumption is sufficient for the current proof-of-concept\nstudy.\n\nIn the case of VGHE in the EBS, heat is absorbed; hence, the enthalpy change\nis positive (H > 0). To find the temperature increase in the thermal fluid, we\nuse , where \u0394T_t.f. is the temperature increase in the thermal fluid [\u00b0C], Q\nis the heat transfer rate from the surroundings to the fluid [W], \u1e41 is the\nmass flow rate of the fluid [kg/s], and C_p is the specific heat capacity of\nthe fluid [J/(kg \u00d7 \u00b0C)].\n\nTo calculate the heat-transfer rate (Q), we use the one-dimensional conduction\nequation, assuming that the VGHE is located within the EBS, specifically 0.479\nm radially away from the center of the canister, , where k is the thermal\nconductivity of the pipe material [W/(m\u00d7K)], A is the surface area of the pipe\n[m^2], T_EBS is the temperature of the EBS [\u00b0C], T_i is the initial\ntemperature of the thermal fluid [\u00b0C], and d is the thickness of the pipe [m].\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated Q value to find the temperature increase\nin the thermal fluid, as follows: .\n\n#### 3.4.2. Heat Exchange between the VGHE and HPS/ORC\n\nThe thermal fluid\u2019s raised temperature potential is now used as the source\ntemperature of the heat pump/ORC. For both energy technologies, counter-flow\nheat exchange is considered at the corresponding evaporators. We use the NTU\n(number of transfer units) approach to simulate the heat sink with a\ncounterflow configuration in the context of geothermal and refrigerant loops\nin ORC/HPS.\n\nThe heat-flow rate in a counter-flow heat exchanger can be determined by\ncalculating the effectiveness of the heat exchanger, \u03b5, which is a\ndimensionless value from 0 to 1. The NTU method relies on the heat capacity\nratio (C_r) and the total number of transfer units such that \u03b5 = f(NTU, C_r),\nwhere , , Q_max is the maximal possible heat flow rate [W], U is the overall\nheat-transfer coefficient [W/(m^2\u00d7K)], A is the heat-exchange area [m^2], and\nQ_1 and Q_2 are the heat-transfer rates into thermal fluid and the\nrefrigerant, respectively [W].\n\nIn the context of counter-current flow configuration, the effectiveness\ncorrelation is in the form\n\nThe NTU method defines the heat-transfer rate between two fluids in terms of\nan effectiveness parameter \u03b5: Q_1 = \u2212Q_2 = \u03b5_c.f.Q_max = Q_c.f., where Q_max =\nC_min(T_1^in, T_2^in). C_min = (\u1e41_1C_p,_1, \u1e41_2C_p,_2) and is the minimal value\nof the heat capacity rate. T_1^in and T_2^in are the intake temperatures of\nthermal fluid and refrigerant, respectively, while \u1e41_1 and \u1e41_2 are the mass\nflow rates of thermal fluid and refrigerant entering the heat exchanger,\nrespectively. Q_c._f. is the heat-transfer rate in the counter-flow heat\nexchanger [28].\n\nFinally, the heat-transfer rate between the heating medium (thermal fluid) and\nthe refrigerant in the HPS/ORC evaporator is used to determine the temperature\nrise of the refrigerant. The resulting higher temperature potential of the\nrefrigerant, along with later defined assumptions, is then utilized in\nsimulating the heat pump cycle and the ORC in the following subsections.\n\n#### 3.4.3. Vapor Compression Heat Pump Cycle\n\nA geothermal heat pump is a heating/cooling system for buildings that\ntransfers heat to or from the ground. The efficiency of a heat pump is\nmeasured by a coefficient of performance (COP), which is typically in the\nrange of 2 to 6. This means that for every unit of electricity used, the\ndevices produce 2 to 6 units of heat [29].\n\nIn this work, we consider a heat pump with VGHE, designed as U-shaped\nstainless-steel pipes. The considered VGHE are placed in vertical wells, with\nthe space between the pipes filled with bentonite grout. Water is utilized as\nthe working fluid in the primary loop and R141b refrigerant is employed in the\nsecondary loop. The system works as follows. The heat supplied to the vertical\nground heat exchanger is transferred by the intermediate heat carrier in the\nevaporator to the boiling refrigerant. After leaving the evaporator, the\nsuperheated refrigerant enters the compressor, where it is compressed to a\npressure corresponding to the required saturation temperature in the\ncondenser. The superheated refrigerant vapor then enters the condenser, where\nit is cooled and condensed. The coolant transfers the heat from the condenser\nto the consumer. After leaving the condenser, the refrigerant enters the\nexpansion valve and the liquid refrigerant expands to the pressure in the\nevaporator [29,30]. Since no work is conducted in the heat pump evaporator,\nthe enthalpy change is equal to the heat added to the fluid. It is assumed\nthat the refrigerant is completely condensed in the condenser. Figure 4\nillustrates a ground source HPS incorporating the utilization of heat from\nspent nuclear fuel (SNF)/HLW.\n\nFigure 4. Ground source heat pump system utilizing SNF/HLW.\n\nThe following equations are employed in the modeling of heat and work transfer\nin the heat pump. Fluid is compressed adiabatically by an isentropic\ncompressor. In this model, the entropy of the outflow state of an ideal\nisentropic heat exchanger is equal to that of the input state such that W_id =\nh(p_2, s_1) \u2212 h(p_1, s_1), where W_id represents the ideal work, measured in\nwatts [W], h denotes the enthalpy at the compressor [J], p_2 is the pressure\nat the inlet of the system [Pa], p_1 is the pressure at the outlet of the\nsystem [Pa], and s_1 is the entropy of the outflow state of an ideal\nisentropic heat exchanger [J/K].\n\nThe real work (W_r) is found as the ratio of ideal work (W_id) to the\ncompressor\u2019s isentropic efficiency (\u03b7), as follows:\n\nWork that is dissipated as heat in the environment (Q_out) is defined by f_Q:\nQ_out = W_rf_Q.\n\nFinally, the specific enthalpy, which is derived by the energy balance, and\noutlet pressure are used to calculate the outlet state of the compressor:\nh_out = h_in + W_r \u2212 Q_out.\n\nIn this model, the throttle valve expansion is isenthalpic (adiabatic,\nproducing no work). In both the evaporator and condenser, the pressure drop is\nneglected. Since no work is performed, the enthalpy change is equal to the\nheat added to the fluid.\n\nFor heating, COP is calculated as the ratio of the heat output of the heat\npump to the power consumed by the compressor, as follows:\n\nwhere is the energy given off by the HPS [W] and is the electrical energy\nconsumed by the compressor [W].\n\nThe chemico\u2013physical properties of the considered refrigerant (R141b) are\nlisted in Table 2. The assumptions for the heat pump system are presented in\nTable 3.\n\nTable 2. Thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant R141b [31].\n\nTable 3. Assumptions for the heat pump system [31].\n\n#### 3.4.4. Organic Rankine Cycle\n\nWe use ORC for electricity generation, employing a refrigerant with a low\nboiling point instead of water as the working fluid. This approach enhances\nheat transfer efficiency from the canister zone. The system is designed with\ntwo loops: water serves as the working medium in the primary loop, while the\nsecondary loop operates with R142b refrigerant. R142b has been chosen for its\noptimal physicochemical properties and its prevalence in contemporary vapor-\ncompression technology [32]. Water is an appropriate thermal fluid for the\nprimary loop due to its high critical temperature [33]. Figure 5 illustrates\nthe components of a typical ORC system.\n\nFigure 5. Components of a typical organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system.\n\nOur analysis involves applying the fundamental principles of conservation of\nenergy, derived from the first law of thermodynamics, to the evaporator,\ncondenser, turbine, and pump [34]. The general form of the first law of\nthermodynamics, applicable to systems with a steady flow, is expressed as\nfollows:\n\nwhere is the heat added to the system [J], \u1e86 is the work performed by the\nsystem [J], \u1e41_2 is the mass flow rate of the fluid at the outlet [kg/s], \u1e41_1\nis the mass flow rate of the fluid at the inlet [kg/s], h_2 is the specific\nenthalpy at the final state [J/kg], h_1 is the specific enthalpy at the\ninitial state [J/kg], v_2 is the speed of fluid at the final state [m/s], v_1\nis the speed of fluid at the initial state [m/s], z_2 is the vertical height\nat the outlet [m], z_1 is the vertical height at the inlet [m], and g is the\nacceleration due to gravity [m/s^2].\n\nIn this model, we consider a single flow; therefore, Equation (6) can be\nrewritten as\n\nwhere \u1e41 is the mass flow rate of the fluid [kg/s].\n\nIn conducting an energy analysis of the ORC\u2019s main components, the subscripts\n1 and 2 indicate fluid conditions at the inlet and outlet, respectively.\nEquation (7) is considered to be an appropriate form of the first law of\nthermodynamics for this purpose, regardless of the layout of the ORC design.\n\nThe energy extraction by the working fluid in the evaporator = \u1e41(h_3 \u2212 h_2).\nThis equation assumes that any hydrodynamic effects resulting from changes in\nvelocity and level are not significant. In addition, it is assumed that the\nevaporator is not doing any work and therefore this term is assumed to be\nzero. The process in the evaporator is assumed to be isothermal in the area of\nheat transfer to the working fluid at constant pressure. Heat loss to the\nenvironment is also considered zero due to the ideal insulation of the heat\nexchanger. Finally, it is assumed that the pressure drop experienced by the\nworking fluid is negligible due to its small magnitude.\n\nThe following are formulas used for calculating the energy values of the\nturbine. We assume an insignificant difference in heights between the inlet\nand outlet; therefore,\n\nwhere is the work performed by the turbine and is the (ideal) isentropic\nspecific enthalpy at the turbine\u2019s outlet.\n\nThe condenser analysis is based on the same assumptions as for the evaporator.\nThus, the condenser load calculation follows the same approach as for the\nevaporator and can be expressed as follows: = \u1e41(h_4 \u2212 h_1).\n\nThe pump in the ORC performs an isentropic process, the function of which is\nto move the working fluid from low-pressure areas to high-pressure areas in\nthe cycle. Using Equation (7) results in\n\nwhere is the work performed by the pump, is the isentropic efficiency of the\npump, and is the (ideal) isentropic specific enthalpy at the pump\u2019s outlet.\n\nThe thermal efficiency for the ORC is calculated from the energy supplied to\nthe evaporator and the net output of the cycle. Thermal efficiency is derived\nby determining the ratio of the ORC net output to the energy supplied to the\nevaporator. The following equation is the first law of thermodynamics for ORC,\nwhich relates the input and output energy of a cycle:\n\nThe power output of an ORC (\u1e86) is equal to the difference between the power\ngenerated by the turbine and the power consumed by the pump driving the cycle:\n\u1e86 = \u1e86_turb \u2212 \u1e86_pump. In other words, net power output is the amount of useful\nenergy produced by the ORC after subtracting the energy needed to run the\ncycle.\n\nThe parameters for the ORC are presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4. Parameters for the ORC [32,35].\n\n## 4\\. Results\n\n#### 4.1. Heat Transfer\n\nWith the assumed 4-year cooling time, the decay heat decreases by 19% in 10\nyears and 90% in 100 years after the canister emplacement (Figure 6). The\ndecay heat power is 5521 W per canister at the time of the discharge and then\ndecreases to 2758 W after 30 years. The decay heat reduces to less than 1% of\nits initial value 300 years after canister emplacement.\n\nFigure 6. Temperature evolution at varying spatial points and canister heat\noutput.\n\nFigure 6 also represents the temperature at various spatial points radially\naway from the canister. For the bentonite\u2013canister interface, the temperature\ntrend initiates at approximately 170 \u00b0C due to the logarithmic nature of the\ntime scale, with the horizontal x-axis (time) starting at 0.1 year. The\ntemperature at the bentonite\u2013canister interface reaches a maximum value of 226\n\u00b0C at 1 year after canister emplacement. It stays above 120 \u00b0C for 30 years,\nwhich is the estimated lifespan of an ORC. In 100 years, the temperature will\ndrop to approximately 50 \u00b0C and eventually decline to less than 20 \u00b0C 1000\nyears after the discharge.\n\nMoreover, we assess the thermal response of the host rock. In contrast to the\ncanister\u2013bentonite thermal response, the bentonite\u2013host rock interface\n(1.13\u20131.29 m radially away from the canister) experiences a longer thermal\nevolution, reaching a peak of around 100 \u00b0C after 20 years. The host rock\nreaches its maximum temperature of 42 \u00b0C four decades following the\ninstallation of the heater, underscoring the host rock\u2019s low thermal\nconductivity in dissipating heat.\n\nInitially, at year one, the temperature gradient is most pronounced at the\nbentonite\u2013canister interface, where the heat flux generated by radioactive\ndecay is greatest. Over time, this heat dissipates through the bentonite,\nleading to temperature equalization of the EBS. Concurrently, as the\nradioactive material in SNF/HLW decays to a stable form, the intensity of\ndecay heat decreases. After 50 years, the bentonite buffer achieves a near-\nuniform temperature distribution, with each spatial point approximately\nreaching 80 \u00b0C, followed by a gradual and consistent temperature decline\nacross the buffer. This observation of uniform temperature distribution in\nbentonite provides further details of the decay heat dissipation kinetics\nwithin the repository. The predominant heat release is observed in the initial\n50 years, after which the thermal gradient begins to stabilize.\n\n#### 4.2. Vapor Compression Heat Pump Cycle\n\nIn the P-h diagram (Figure 7), the area of the enclosed graph increases over\nthe period of 30 years, indicating an increase in the useful heat output by\nthe condenser. The COP is above 2 for the first 10 years and reaches 1.5 at\nthe 30-year temporal point. For convenience, the values in the P-h diagram are\npresented in Table 5; the listed energy parameters were calculated using the\nacquired enthalpy values and the assumptions mentioned in Section 3.4.3.\n\nFigure 7. P-h diagram for the HPS refrigerant (R141b) at (a) 1 year after\ncanister emplacement; (b) 10 years after canister emplacement; and (c) 30\nyears after canister emplacement.\n\nTable 5. Results obtained for the HPS.\n\nAfter one year, the heat pump\u2019s condenser showed a COP of 5.6 and a thermal\nenergy production of around 70 kW/canister. The HPS showed an increased\nuseable heat production of 73 kW/canister after 10 years of operation and the\ncapacity to produce 80 kW of thermal energy per canister after three decades.\nThe heat pump yielded greater thermal heat (Q_H) compared to the energy input\nsupplied to the compressor, thereby illustrating its sustained effectiveness\nover a 30-year operational span.\n\nOur choice to concentrate on the specified recession periods stems from their\nrelevance to the lifespans of ORC and HPS systems, which are generally\nobserved to be under 15\u201330 years [36,37]. Hence, 1 year, 10 years, and 30\nyears are intentionally aligned with the most critical periods for evaluating\nthe performance of the HPS and ORC.\n\n#### 4.3. Organic Rankine Cycle\n\nThe P-h diagrams of the modeled ORC systems are depicted in Figure 8. Two\npoints, 3 and 4, have a major impact on the power output by the system.\nNotably, point 4 marked the starting point of condensation for the working\nfluid. The region encircling the cycle on the P-h diagram illustrates the net\nwork output of the ORC. The net work output and, thus, the cycle efficiency\nincrease with the size of the cycle\u2019s enclosing area. We observe that the\nefficiency of the ORC is highly dependent on the initial refrigerant\nparameters, especially the superheated vapor temperature at constant pressure,\nas it increases the thermal efficiency of the cycle by increasing the average\nthermal input temperature. The P-h diagram was used to calculate the amount of\nwork that could be recovered from the cycle, provided the expander operated\nadiabatically. The obtained output results are listed in Table 6.\n\nFigure 8. The working cycle of the ORC system with refrigerant R142b at (a) 1\nyear after canister emplacement; (b) 10 years after canister emplacement; and\n(c) 30 years after canister emplacement.\n\nTable 6. Results obtained for the ORC.\n\nThe maximum cycle efficiency for the considered ORC was found to be 16.4%.\nThis efficiency is realized approximately one year after system initialization\nwhen the refrigerant temperature reaches 107 \u00b0C. Thus, assuming a generator\nefficiency of 95%, the maximum expected power generation of the ORC would be\napproximately 294 kWe/canister. The estimated electricity generation would be\naround 102 kWe/canister after 30 years. To contextualize the electricity\ngeneration estimate, on average, a typical household consumes about 10,715 kWh\nof electricity annually [38]. This equates to around 890 kWh per month or\nroughly 29 kWh per day, providing a benchmark for residential energy needs. In\norder to evaluate the possible impact of the ORC turbine, we can examine a\nscenario in which the system runs continuously. Under this condition, the ORC\nsystem can provide enough power to sustain approximately 80 single-family\nhouses for a minimum of three decades.\n\n## 5\\. Discussion\n\nWe have shown that spent fuel can be a viable geothermal energy resource, even\nthough the source temperature is less than the conventional geothermal\nthreshold. Holdmann (2007) illustrated the feasibility of an ORC system,\ndriven by a geothermal fluid temperature of 74 \u00b0C at the Chena Hot Springs\nResort in Alaska, United States. The reported power plant consists of two 200\nkW modules, engineered via commercially accessible technology [39].\n\nThe expansion of geothermal power plant development is geographically limited\nto areas situated in proximity to plate boundaries, mantle plumes, hot spots,\nor other sources of substantial heat flow [40]. Several nations have the\ncapacity for large-scale geothermal energy utilization, namely Indonesia, the\nPhilippines, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States [41]. However, in the\ncontext of harnessing anthropogenic geothermal energy from HLW repositories,\nthe projected energy recovery potential presents an opportunity to produce\npower comparable to the output of conventional geothermal power plants,\nirrespective of naturally occurring heat sources.\n\nThe efficiency values obtained (7\u201316%) fall within a range that has previously\nbeen shown to be economically viable, particularly for recovering waste heat\nfrom geothermal sources above 80 \u00b0C [42]. The key advantage within this\ntemperature range lies in the heat source circuit\u2019s capability to utilize\nwater without the necessity for thermal oil, which is estimated to account for\n11% of the total ORC investments [43]. Moreover, the proposed system uses a\ndirect heat transfer from the primary to the secondary loop via an evaporator,\nincreasing the efficiency of the system. It has been reported that this method\nleads to a reduction in ORC system costs by up to 15% [44]. Notably, while\neconomic feasibility aspects were discussed, a formal economic feasibility\nstudy would be necessary in the future.\n\nFor the decay heat recovery, the ORC system is preferable since the use of\nheat pumps becomes impractical when the operating temperature reaches its\nlimit. Comparing the ORC and the heat pump from an economic point of view, the\nORC is more favorable due to higher efficiency ratios and lifespan compared to\ngeothermal heat pumps. It should also be noted that there is potential for\nenhanced heat pump efficiency when considering points further in time and\nradial distance from canister placement.\n\nWe acknowledge that we did not consider the feedback from the energy\nextraction system to the TH model. Instead, we used the NTU approach to model\nthe heat sink. This approach took into account the cooling of the heating\nmedium and the temperature reduction in the working fluids (water and the\nrefrigerants), following the heat exchange process. In addition, we would note\nthat the actual temperature profile at the bentonite\u2013canister interface could\nbe more variable and affected by different conditions. We also acknowledge our\nstudy is a proof-of-the-concept study based on model simulations. In future\nresearch, experimental investigation will be required to enhance the practical\napplicability of these technologies. In addition, we acknowledge the\nlimitation of excluding the potential heat losses along the emplacement\ntunnels. We assumed the ideal insulation of the pipes in addition to the\ngrouting of the VGHE. Conducting a thorough assessment of heat losses from\nVGHE would be necessary in addressing this limitation in future studies.\n\nWe are also aware that there could be safety concerns. First, the high-\ntemperature impact on bentonite needs to be considered. Several recent\nlaboratory hydrothermal studies have been carried out to investigate the\ngeochemical changes in bentonite and its interaction with clay rocks, granite,\nand concrete at temperatures reaching 200 \u00b0C. According to Cheshire et al.,\n(2014; 2018), both studies revealed no significant changes in the properties\nof bentonite that could affect its safety-relevant properties [45,46].\nMoreover, numerical simulations performed by Zheng et al. [47] and Chang et\nal. [48] suggest that FEBEX bentonite can withstand temperatures of up to 200\n\u00b0C without compromising the functionality of the buffer. Second, the\ninstallation of VGHE might jeopardize the integrity of EBS and the corrosion\nof pipes might bring unknown geochemical changes in bentonite. However,\ncooling by removing heat from EBS has a positive impact on the integrity of\nEBS, which may outweigh the cons brought by the VGHE system.\n\nLastly, should an early failure of the canister occur, and radionuclides are\nreleased during the operation of VGHE, the pipes from the subsurface to the\nground could be considered conduits for contaminants. As we mentioned above,\nwe assume that this system is in conjunction with proper monitoring. In\naddition, decommissioning can be performed safely such that the pipes are\nplugged by low-permeability material. Since the energy conversion system near\nthe surface is not in contact with the radioactive material, it can be\ndisposed of as regular waste. At the same time, this system could be\nconsidered a monitoring system for the repository since temperature is often\nused for detecting changes in groundwater flow and groundwater systems, using\ndistributed temperature sensors (DTS) [49]. The incident at the Waste\nIsolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in 2014 has shown that there could be some\nunknowns that could trigger accidents during the repository operation or\nshortly after the closure [50]. We argue that having some access to the\nrepository would enhance the safety of the repository, at the same time as\nextracting heat and economic values. There is a wealth of information about\nwell leakage, wellbore integrity and closure, assessments, and detections from\nCO_2 storage research [51].\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nThis work introduces a proof-of-concept study using a numerical model of a\nbinary-cycle geothermal system powered by the decay heat produced by HLW.\nTOUGHREACT V3.32 software was employed in this work to model the heat transfer\nfrom the waste form to the EBS. Our results indicate that the ORC can generate\nelectricity within the binary-cycle geothermal system, while a heat pump\nsystem can produce high-potential heat for HVAC purposes. The study reports a\nmaximum cycle efficiency of 16.4% for electricity generation and a COP of 5.6\nfor the heat pump system. The results indicate that ORC will yield\napproximately 108 kWe per canister 30 years after the canister emplacement,\nwhereas the HPS is projected to produce 81 kWth per canister within the same\ntimeframe. The proposed facility has the potential to generate high potential\nheat or produce carbon-free power from the heat otherwise dissipated as waste\nwhile ensuring the safe disposal of HLW.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, H.M.W., D.S. and R.S.; methodology, H.M.W. and D.S.;\nsoftware, D.S., H.M.W., L.Z. and D.E.; validation, D.S. and H.M.W.; formal\nanalysis, D.S. and H.M.W.; investigation, D.S. and H.M.W.; resources, H.M.W.,\nD.S. and L.Z.; data curation, D.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.S.\nand H.M.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.S., H.M.W., L.Z., D.E. and R.S.;\nvisualization, D.S.; supervision, H.M.W., L.Z., D.E. and R.S.; project\nadministration, H.M.W.; funding acquisition, D.S. and H.M.W.
