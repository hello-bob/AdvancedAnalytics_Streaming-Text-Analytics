This might tell us something about feline visual perception\nof shapes and contours, per a new study in Applied Animal Behaviour Science.\n\nSean Carroll\n\n#### reader comments\n\n157\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged\u2014at least by those of the feline\npersuasion\u2014that an empty box on the floor must be in want of a cat. Ditto for\nlaundry baskets, suitcases, sinks, and even cat carriers (when not used as\ntransport to the vet). This behavior is generally attributed to the fact that\ncats feel safer when squeezed into small spaces, but it might also be able to\ntell us something about feline visual perception. That's the rationale behind\na new study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science with a colorful\ntitle: \"If I fits I sits: A citizen science investigation into illusory\ncontour susceptibility in domestic cats (Felis silvers catus).\"\n\nThe paper was inspired in part by a 2017 viral Twitter hashtag, #CatSquares,\nin which users posted pictures of their cats sitting inside squares marked out\non the floor with tape\u2014kind of a virtual box. The following year, lead author\nGabriella Smith, a graduate student at Hunter College (CUNY) in New York City,\nattended a lecture by co-author Sarah-Elizabeth Byosiere, who heads the\nThinking Dog Center at Hunter. Byosiere studies canine behavior and cognition,\nand she spoke about dogs' susceptibility to visual illusions. While playing\nwith her roommate's cat later that evening, Smith recalled the Twitter hashtag\nand wondered if she could find a visual illusion that looked like a square to\ntest on cats.\n\nSmith found it in the work of the late Italian psychologist and artist Gaetano\nKanizsa, who was interested in illusory (subjective) contours that visually\nevoke the sense of an edge in the brain even if there isn't really a line or\nedge there. The Kanizsa square consists of four objects shaped like Pac-Man,\noriented with the \"mouth\" facing inward to form the four corners of a square.\nEven better, there was a 1988 study that used the Kanizsa square to\ninvestigate the susceptibility of two young female cats to illusory contours.\nThe study concluded that, yes, cats are susceptible to the Kanizsa square\nillusion, suggesting that they perceive subjective contours much like humans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the 1988 study was conducted in the laboratory and \"primed\" the two feline\nsubjects via standard operant conditioning methods. Smith wanted to design a\nsimilar study that increased the sample size and observed the cats' behavior\nin their natural environment\u2014which is less stressful for cats than a lab\nenvironment\u2014with no advance priming. A \"citizen science\" project involving cat\nowners recruited on Twitter seemed like just the ticket, especially given the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic. People were spending a lot more time at home with\ntheir pets, and they were likely to have more time to conduct the trials.\n\n  * Caliban strikes a pose in the Box of Dignity.\n\nSean Carroll\n\n  * \"Sometimes I sits even if I don't quite fits.\"\n\nSean Carroll\n\n  * An example of the trending Twitter hashtag #CatSquare from 2017.\n\nGabriella E. Smith et al. 2021\n\n  * On the top, we see an example of the placement of stimuli pairs\u2014Kanizsa control (left) and Kanizsa illusion (right). On the bottom, there's a square on the left and a Kanizsa illusion on the right.\n\nGabriella E. Smith et al., 2021\n\n  * Video screenshots of participating cats' selections of stimuli.\n\nGabriella E. Smith et al., 2021\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nThe only supplies participating owners needed were a printer with black ink,\nprinter paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler, plus sunglasses and a digital\ncamera or smartphone to record their cats' behavior. Smith serially sent\nparticipants six randomized daily stimuli to print out and set up on the\nfloor, per instructions, while the cat was not in the room. The stimuli\nincluded a simple square, the Kanizsa square illusion, and a Kanizsa control\nin which the Pac-Man mouths faced outward instead of inward. All dimensions\nwere such that a cat could comfortably sit or stand inside with all its limbs\nwithout being able to sprawl.\n\nThe cats would be permitted into the room, and the owners would don the\nsunglasses and avoid interacting with their pets so as not to give the beasts\nany cues. The humans would videotape the cats' behavior with the pairs of\nstimuli and upload the videos to a shared Dropbox for the project. If the cat\nsat or stood with all its legs inside the contours of a stimulus within the\nfirst five minutes, the owners would stop recording and make note of the\nchosen shape. If the cat didn't select one of the stimuli in the first five\nminutes, the trial would end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough some 500 pet cats and their owners expressed interest, only 30\ncompleted all six of the study's trials over the course of the two-month study\nlast summer. Of those, nine of the cats selected at least one of the stimuli\nby sitting within its contours (illusory or otherwise) for at least three\nseconds\u2014a pretty good duration given the notorious fickleness of cats. As for\npreferences, cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square;\nthey selected both of those more often than the control stimulus. In other\nwords, the cats treated the illusory square the same way they treated the real\nsquare.\n\n\"It's the presence of the contours, either in the Kanizsa square or in the\nreal square, that causes cats to sit inside, rather than the presence of\nshapes on the floor,\" Smith told Ars. \"Brains are very sensitive to contours\nthat differ in luminance. Vision has evolved to answer questions having to do\nwith boundaries and contours.\"\n\nThe study comes with the usual caveats, notably the final small sample size\n(the result of participant attrition, a common challenge with citizen science\nprojects). Smith and her co-authors also suggest replicating the study in a\nmore controlled setting, despite the advantages gained from conducting the\ntrials in the comfort of the cats' own homes. \"For the sake of cats, the home\nwas really ideal, but otherwise, for the sake of science, it is best to do\nthings in controlled settings [like a lab],\" said Smith.\n\nSmith and Byosiere are also keen to adapt some of the latter's work with dogs\nand visual illusions to the study of cat behavior and cognition. \"Cat\ncognition research is certainly lacking in comparison to domestic dogs,\" the\nauthors concluded. \"Although the reason for this is unclear, the use of\ncitizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could\ngreatly help bridge this divide.\"\n\nDOI: Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 2021. 10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105338\n(About DOIs).\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n157\n\nJennifer Ouellette Jennifer is a senior reporter at Ars Technica with a\nparticular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from\nphysics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV\nseries.
