But in mid-November 2023 Voyager 1\u2019s data\ntransmissions became garbled, sending NASA engineers on a slow quest to\ntroubleshoot the distant spacecraft. Finally, that work has paid off, and NASA\nhas clear information on the probe\u2019s health and status, the agency announced\non April 22.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most serious issue we\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been the project manager,\nand it\u2019s scary because you lose communication with the spacecraft,\u201d said\nSuzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nan interview with Scientific American when the team was still tracking down\nthe issue.\n\nThe Voyager 1 spacecraft is a scientific legend: It discovered that Jupiter\u2019s\nmoon Io, far from being a dead world like our own companion, is instead a\nsupervolcanic world. The craft\u2019s data suggested that Saturn\u2019s moon Titan might\nhave liquid on its surface. And for more than a decade, Voyager 1 has given\nscientists a glimpse at what space looks like beyond the influence of our sun.\n\nYet its long years in the harsh environment of space have done a number on the\nprobe, which was designed to last just four years. In particular, degraded\nperformance and low power supplies have forced NASA to turn off six of its 10\ninstruments, and its communication has gotten even spottier than can be\nexplained by the fact that cosmic mechanics mean a signal takes nearly one\nEarth day to travel between humans and the probe.\n\nWhen the latest communications glitch occurred last fall, scientists could\nstill send signals to the distant probe, and they could tell that the\nspacecraft was operating. But all they got from Voyager 1 was gibberish\u2014what\nNASA described in December 2023 as \u201ca repeating pattern of ones and zeros.\u201d\nThe team was able to trace the issue back to a part of the spacecraft\u2019s\ncomputer system called the flight data subsystem, or FDS, and identified that\na particular chip within that system had failed.\n\nMission personnel couldn\u2019t repair the chip. They were, however, able to break\nthe code held on the failed chip into pieces they could tuck into spare\ncorners of the FDS\u2019s memory, according to NASA. The first such fix was\ntransmitted to Voyager 1 on April 18. With a total distance of 30 billion\nmiles to cross from Earth to the spacecraft and back, the team had to wait\nnearly two full days for a response from the probe. But on April 20 NASA got\nconfirmation that the initial fix worked. Additional commands to rewrite the\nrest of the FDS system\u2019s lost code are scheduled for the coming weeks,\naccording to the space agency, including commands that will restore the\nspacecraft\u2019s ability to send home science data.\n\nAlthough, for now, Voyager 1 appears to be on the mend, NASA scientists know\nit won\u2019t last forever. Sooner or later, a glitch they can\u2019t fix will occur, or\nthe spacecraft\u2019s ever dwindling fuel supply will run out for good. Until then\nNASA is determined to get as much data as possible out of the venerable\nspacecraft\u2014and its twin, Voyager 2, which experienced its own communications\nglitch earlier in 2023.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.
