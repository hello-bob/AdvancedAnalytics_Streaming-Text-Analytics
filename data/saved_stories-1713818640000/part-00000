More companies\ncould follow suit.\n\nEllen Thomas\n\nApr 22, 2024, 9:00 AM UTC\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nNoah Berger/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n  * Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine ordered teams to examine the company's cloud budget.\n  * Employees found a lot of unused space with providers like AWS and Snowflake.\n  * The company has cut its monthly AWS budget nearly in half.\n\nWhen Tony Stubblebine became CEO of Medium in 2022, he was tasked with making\nthe online publishing platform profitable for the first time in the company's\ndecadelong history.\n\nStubblebine expects Medium to hit that milestone sometime this year, thanks in\npart to a somewhat unexpected strategy \u2014 scrutinizing the company's budget for\ncloud storage and services.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nStubblebine's mandate to cut costs across the company began when he joined two\nyears ago. He soon realized that cloud computing was the most bloated part of\nMedium's budget.\n\n\"What's ended up happening is that probably about half of our path to\nprofitability came from cost-cutting and a quarter of that is in cloud costs,\"\nStubblebine told BI.\n\nWhen he initially directed teams to examine their cloud spending, Stubblebine\nexpected to find instances of inefficient usage that might require the advice\nof an outside expert before shutting down.\n\nInstead, employees found lots of space the company simply wasn't using, and\nthat no one had bothered to check.\n\n\"These weren't hard costs for the existing team to cut,\" said Stubblebine. \"As\nsoon as we gave them permission to go looking, then they found a ton of stuff\nimmediately and they could fix all of it.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's not just Stubblebine who plans to continue cutting cloud costs. A\nBarclays survey found that 83% of CIOs plan to \"re-patriate\" or remove certain\nworkloads from the cloud in the first half of 2024, up from 43% four years\nago.\n\nIn Medium's case, the most bloat came from the biggest providers. That's meant\ncutting back significantly on Amazon Web Services and Snowflake. Savings on\nAWS, Stubblebine said, is \"trending north of $500,000 a month\" \u2014 nearly half\nof what Medium used to spend.\n\nThe cloud industry refers to cost-cutting as \"cloud optimization.\" Last year,\ncloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft cited cloud\noptimization as the reason cloud sales growth had slipped to historic lows. As\ngrowth has crept back up in recent months, these same companies have declared\nthe days of cloud optimization to be over.\n\nBut Stubblebine thinks that cloud optimization is part of a broader mentality\nshift sweeping the pre-IPO startup world. With investor money harder to come\nby, he said, companies are focused on profit \u2014 and cost-cutting is part of\nthat.\n\n\"I just told the team that cost-cutting and growth are the same,\" said\nStubblebine. \"We're not saying that one is better than the other.\"\n\nCutting cloud spend has also allowed Medium to move faster.\n\n\"To have less is better for development,\" said Stubblebine. \"And that's why\npeople call it tech debt. It's not just a financial cost, it's a cognitive\nload for the product teams.\"\n\nGot a tip for this reporter?
