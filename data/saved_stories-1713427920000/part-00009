Specifically, disabling USB selective suspend setting when the\nsystem was plugged in.\n\nThis immediately made the 100% CPU pegging go away, solving a problem that had\nplagued me for over a year. No idea if it was related to USB devices I had\nplugged in \u2013 I had the same problem at work and in the office, where I have\ncompletely different equipment.\n\nNo idea what the potential impact to this is but I find it hard to believe\nit\u2019s worse than my CPU spinning randomly.\n\nAuthor trogPosted on May 23, 2023Categories Rando\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\n## About\n\nHi!
