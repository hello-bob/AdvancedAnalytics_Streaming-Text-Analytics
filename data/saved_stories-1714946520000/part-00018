Additionally, we will look at\nlibraries like PyO3 that are needed to interface with CPython from other\nlanguages.\n\nOur initial goal is to ensure libraries at the bottom of the stack like NumPy,\npybind11, and Cython are usable with free-threaded CPython. We will also be\nupdating packaging tools like meson-python needed to support building wheels\nfor free-threaded CPython. Once those tools and libraries are in a stable\nenough state, we will begin looking at libraries higher in the stack.\n\n### What is this repository?\n\nThis repository is for coordinating ecosystem-wide work. We will use this\nrepository to track, understand, and provide documentation for dealing with\nissues that we find are common across many libraries. Issues that are specific\nto a project should be reported in that project's issue tracker.\n\n### Building Free-Threaded CPython\n\nCurrently we suggest building CPython from source using the latest version of\nthe CPython main branch. See the build instructions in the CPython developer\nguide. You will need to install needed third-party dependencies before\nbuilding. To build the free-threaded version of CPython, pass --disable-gil to\nthe configure script:\n\n    \n    \n    ./configure --with-pydebug --disable-gil\n\nIf you will be switching Python versions often, it may make sense to build\nCPython using pyenv. See the pyenv folder in this repository for more details\nmanaging free-threaded and non-free-threaded python installs with pyenv.\n\n## About\n\nA central repository to keep track of the status of work on and support for\nfree-threaded CPython (see PEP 703), with a focus on the scientific and ML/AI\necosystem\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n2 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n5 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n3 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 3\n\n  * ngoldbaum Nathan Goldbaum\n  * rgommers Ralf Gommers\n  * colesbury Sam Gross\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
