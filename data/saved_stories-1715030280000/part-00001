And it ran the coolest games\n\nShare\n\nI have told my wife that I want a Mini Amiga for Christmas. I know it\u2019s only\nApril, but I do this with things I want in the hope that when it suddenly\nappears in the house next week, my wife will think she bought it for me. I\nhave slipped the purchase of seven games machines, a stuffed tarantula and an\nair fryer under the radar this way. In an inconsistent world, I like the way\nthis institution of marriage works.\n\nI read the reviews and was surprised at the appearance of two words I never\nassociated with the original Amiga: cool, and love. It might seem strange to\nsay the Amiga wasn\u2019t loved, because a lot of people bought and used one. But\npeople use things every day that they don\u2019t love: electric shavers, patience,\ndoor handles, the train.\n\nPeople loved the ZX Spectrum. They loved the Mega Drive. If you talk to an\nowner of any Nintendo machine, from a Game Boy to a Switch OLED they sound\nlike Romeo talking about Juliet, Meredith Grey talking about Derek Shepherd,\nor Elon Musk talking about himself.\n\nAs someone who was actually there for the 80s and 90s, the Amiga just didn\u2019t\nenjoy that kind of love. Why? Because it looked uncool. The Game Boy looked\nlike an alien artefact from a trendy 70s sci-fi show; the PlayStation was what\nyou\u2019d get if a high-end record turntable had mated with the sexiest sandwich\nmaker imaginable. The curved lines of the Xbox 360 were the definition of\nallure. It was one of those rare machines that looked as good lying down as it\ndid standing up. Today I still run my fingers along its curves if I see one in\nthe wild.\n\nThe Amiga looked like something you\u2019d see a bank teller use. And not for the\ncool bank stuff, like foiling a robbery.\n\nThe Amiga 500. So stately! So boring! So grey! Photograph: Felix Choo/Alamy\n\nI know the Amiga was a computer rather than a console, but so was the ZX\nSpectrum, and that looked good enough to eat. The Atari ST was no great looker\neither, but at least they angled the top row of function buttons to make it\nlook like they considered its aesthetics.\n\nThey should have at least chopped a corner off the Amiga. That would have\nhelped. It worked for the Game Boy. (Actually it worked for the Fender\nStratocaster first.)\n\nPersonally? I really did love the Amiga. I had more glorious evenings with it\nthan any other machine, in terms of hours played and the quality of those\nhours. It provided the best party game ever in Sensible Soccer, the best\nfuturistic (and best looking) sports game in Speedball 2 and the best time-\nswallower with Championship Manager, just edging out Sim City. And I am not\nsure there has ever been a more mathematically precise sports game than Jimmy\nWhite\u2019s Whirlwind Snooker.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Pushing Buttons\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

In the early 90s you could be\nburned inside a giant wicker man just for whispering of such things. I never\nread the Dune books, so whilst watching the Dune movies I was taken back to my\nfirst introduction to that world: the astonishing Dune 2 Amiga game.\n\nIt gave us the best adventure game in Secret of Monkey Island, which may be\nthe funniest game ever as well. Cannon Fodder was also funny, but\nsimultaneously poignant and sad. Has there been a better games developer than\nSensible Software? It made game development seem funny and cool, not words I\nwould have associated with games developers before.\n\nThe Amiga was solid. It was dependable. Before you even played a game,\nslipping a floppy disk into its slot felt good. That satisfying thunk sound.\nThe way it seemed to grip the last few millimetres of the disk and pull it in.\nSo reassuring and trustworthy.\n\nPhwoar ... vintage 80s Commodore Amiga 500 games console. Photograph: Neil\nGodwin/Future/Getty Images\n\nI don\u2019t remember anything ever breaking with my Amiga. I don\u2019t remember a game\nthat didn\u2019t load. Even the peripherals were solid. My delicate little Cheetah\nBug joystick took such a beating on Sensible Soccer alone, it beggars belief\nthat it survived. All I have to do to break the R1 button on an Xbox\ncontroller is look at it in a disapproving manner.\n\nLike the Spectrum before it, the Amiga allowed people who couldn\u2019t afford a PC\nto play games on a computer. Then the PC killed it: microchips got cheaper,\nAmiga didn\u2019t move fast enough, and it seemed to die really quickly.\n\nWe didn\u2019t love the Amiga enough. We were like Andy putting Woody in the\ncupboard after he got Buzz Lightyear. Alas, Pixar hasn\u2019t featured the Amiga in\na single movie scene: instead Toy Story featured the Speak and Spell. Ever\ntried playing Zool on that?\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Games\n  * Sega\n  * PC\n  * PlayStation\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
