As part of its aim to\nundergo a green transition, the U.S. government recently unlocked millions in\nfunding to develop the country\u2019s geothermal potential, after years of pressure\nfrom the industry.\n\nScientists worldwide have long hailed geothermal energy for its potential to\nprovide vast amounts of clean power with little impact on the environment.\nGeothermal energy operations are nothing new, but they are limited to certain\nparts of the world and have not run at their full potential in the past due to\nthe non-existence of the equipment needed to access the extreme heat in the\nEarth\u2019s crust. Geothermal sources have been used for hundreds of years, but,\nuntil recently, the amount of energy retrieved from geothermal operations was\nseverely limited. However, thanks to greater investment in research and\ndevelopment in the sector, the equipment required to access this energy now\nexists.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPreviously, geothermal resources could only be accessed in areas where heat\nsources were available close to the Earth\u2019s surface, such as in hot springs\nand geysers. Hot water and steam in various sites around the globe have long\nbeen used to drive turbines and generate electricity. Thanks to greater\nfunding for geothermal technology, scientists have recently developed enhanced\ngeothermal systems (EGS) that can be used to access heat in hard-to-reach\nplaces. EGS works by injecting water at a high pressure into deep rocks to re-\nopen natural fractures that have closed over time, allowing hot water or steam\nto flow into extraction wells. The continuous injection of water allows these\nfractures to stay open and the water to be heated and extracted to generate\nelectricity.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) announced it would be investing\n$60 million in funding to demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of EGS.\nThese systems will be used to access heat stored underground to be used as\nrenewable energy. The DoE said that the funds would be awarded to three\nprojects \u2013 Chevron New Energies, Fervo Energy, and Mazama Energy. At present,\ngeothermal energy contributes less than one percent of U.S. electricity, but\nthat is all expected to change in the coming years. EGS could more than double\nthe amount of recoverable geothermal energy in the U.S. and extend the life of\nexisting geothermal sites.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChevron will run a pilot project, which will roll out new drilling and\nstimulation techniques to access geothermal heat at a site in Sonoma County,\nCalifornia. The aim is to eventually develop 600 MW of incremental geothermal\ncapacity, with initial projects expected to provide 60 MW. The pilot phase\nwill test the viability of new geothermal technologies, aiming to achieve low\nwater use, flexible output, and methods for shrinking the surface footprint.\n\nFervo plans to develop its geothermal assets in the Milford Renewable Energy\nCorridor in Utah. The DoE\u2019s Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal\nEnergy (FORGE) is located in the same corridor. Fervo expects to produce a\nminimum of 8 MW of clean energy from each of the three wells. Last month,\nFervo announced plans to develop its Cape Station plant, which is expected to\nbegin producing 90 MW of power by 2026 and up to 400 MW by 2028. Chelsea\nAnderson, the strategic communications specialist for Fervo, stated, \u201cWere it\nnot for transmission limitations, Cape Station could supply even more power...\nWe believe that Cape has at least 2 gigawatts of geothermal potential.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mazama will invest in research and development to advance the\nscience required to carry out operations in extremely hot environments.\nMazama\u2019s project will demonstrate a first-of-its-kind super-hot EGS, with\ntemperatures above 375\u00b0C, on the western side of Newberry Volcano in Oregon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmanda Kolker, the geothermal laboratory programme manager at the National\nRenewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), emphasised the significant potential of\ndeveloping the country\u2019s geothermal resources. She stated, \u201cGeothermal has\nbeen used for over 100 years, limited to certain geographic locations \u2013 but\nthat is now changing... As we penetrate the grid with renewables that are not\navailable all the time, we need to find a base load, which is currently taken\nup by gas. There aren\u2019t really many options for zero-emissions baseload power,\nwhich is why geothermal is entering the picture.\u201d\n\nThanks to recent climate policies that offer greater funding to green energy\nprojects, such as the Biden Administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, there is\ngreat optimism around the rapid growth of lesser-recognised renewable energy\nsources. Further, it is thought that the U.S. geothermal capacity could grow\nby around 20-fold by 2050, providing as much as 10% of the country\u2019s\nelectricity.\n\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Who Is Behind Iran-Backed Houthi Threats To Attack Saudi Arabia?\n  * Brent Breaks Above $91 as Bullish Sentiment Builds\n  * U.S. Drivers Feeling the Pinch at the Pump as Gas Prices Soar\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\n### Around the Web\n\nFACEBOOK Twitter GOOGLE+ LINKEDIN REDDIT PRINT\n\nPrevious Post\n\nU.S. Drilling Activity Slips Further As Oil Prices Rise\n\nNext Post\n\nThermal Batteries: A Clean and Sustainable Alternative to Lithium-Ion\nBatteries\n\n### Felicity Bradstock\n\nFelicity Bradstock is a freelance writer specialising in Energy and Finance.\nShe has a Master\u2019s in International Development from the University of\nBirmingham, UK.\n\nMore Info\n\n### Related posts\n\n### Rising Middle East Risk Sparks Fear of $100 Oil\n\n### Oil Exports or Carbon Credits: The Global South\u2019s Dilemma\n\n### China Raises Gasoline and Diesel Prices amid Soaring Crude Oil Prices\n\nLeave a comment\n\n### Most Popular\n\nA Rarely Used Technique Could Double U.S. Grid Capacity\n\nTriple Junction Solar Cell Sets World Record Efficiency\n\nBanks Unwilling To Finance $5 Trillion Global Nuclear Development\n\nIs Gold Heading to $3,000?\n\nM&A Fever Hits Canada's Oil and Gas Industry\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Trending Discussions\n\n  * #### GREEN NEW DEAL = BLIZZARD OF LIES\n\nPosted by JoMack\n\nAs Biden, the President of Climate Change, and Kerry, our fabulous Climate\nCzar, who just gave...\n\n  * #### The United States produced more crude oil than any nation, at any time.\n\nPosted by turbguy\n\nSo, Sleepy Joe is responsible, no? \\html\\core\\globalditor\\attach...\n\n  * #### E-car Sales Collapse\n\nPosted by markslawson\n\nThe story below, which appeared in...\n\nEXXON Mobil -0.35\n\nOpen57.81 Trading Vol.6.96M Previous Vol.241.7B\n\nBUY 57.15\n\nSell 57.00\n\n  * More About Us\n  * About Us\n  * Site News\n  * Sitemap\n  * Advertise with us\n\n  * Site info\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 OilPrice.com\n\nThe materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational\npurposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment\nadvice.\n\nNothing contained on the Web site shall be considered a recommendation,\nsolicitation, or offer to buy or sell a security to any person in any\njurisdiction.\n\nMerchant of Record: A Media Solutions trading as Oilprice.com\n\n", "frontpage": true}
