An economist by training with a focus on\npublic health, he dived into the worlds of pharmaceutical development and\ncultivated meat before turning his attention to national security.\n\nAs director of Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the US\nintelligence community's research agency, he pushed for more attention to the\ndangers of biological weapons and badly designed artificial intelligence. In\n2021, Matheny was tapped to be President Biden\u2019s senior adviser on technology\nand national security issues. And then, in July of last year, he became CEO\nand president of Rand, the oldest nonprofit think tank in the US, which has\nshaped government policy on nuclear strategy, the Vietnam War, and the\ndevelopment of the internet.\n\nMatheny talks about threats like AI-enabled bioterrorism in convincing but\nmeasured tones, Mr. Doomsday in a casual suit. He\u2019s steering Rand to\ninvestigate the daunting risks to US democracy, map out new strategies around\nclimate and energy, and explore paths to \u201ccompetition without catastrophe\u201d in\nChina. But his long-time concerns about biological weapons and AI remain top\nof mind.\n\nOnstage with WIRED at the recent Verify cybersecurity conference in Sausalito,\nCalifornia, hosted by the Aspen Institute and Hewlett Foundation, he warned\nthat AI is making it easier to learn how to build biological weapons and other\npotentially devastating tools. (There\u2019s a reason why he joked that he would\npick up the tab at the bar afterward.) The conversation has been edited for\nlength and clarity.\n\nLauren Goode: To start, we should talk about your role at Rand and what you\u2019re\nenvisioning for the future there. Rand has played a critical role in a lot of\nUS history. It has helped inform, you know, the creation of the internet\u2014\n\nJason Matheny: We\u2019re still working out the bugs.\n\nRight. We\u2019re going to fix it all tonight. Rand has also influenced nuclear\nstrategy, the Vietnam War, the space race. What do you hope that your tenure\nat Rand will be defined by?\n\nThere\u2019s three areas that I really want to help grow. First, we need a\nframework for thinking about what [technological] competition looks like\nwithout a race to the bottom on safety and security. For example, how can we\nassure competition with China without catastrophe? A second area of focus is\nthinking about how we can map out a climate and energy strategy for the\ncountry, in a way that is acceptable to our technology requirements, the\ninfrastructure that we have and are building, and gets the economics right.\n\nAnd then a third area is understanding the risks to democracy right now, not\njust in the United States but globally. We're seeing an erosion of norms in\nhow facts and evidence are treated in policy debates. We have a set of very\nanxious researchers at Rand who are seeing this decay of norms. I think that's\nsomething that's happening not just in the United States but globally,\nalongside a resurgence of variants of autocracy.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\n14 Last-Minute Deals From Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Spring Sale Events\n\nMatt Jancer\n\n  * Gear\n\nWhat\u2019s the Safest Seat on an Airplane?\n\nBoone Ashworth\n\n  * Gear\n\nProtect Your Home Wi-Fi Network by Setting Up a VPN on Your Router\n\nDavid Nield\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Barefoot Shoes for Walking or Running\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\nOne type of risk you\u2019ve been very interested in for a long time is \u201cbiorisk.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the worst thing that could possibly happen? Take us through that.\n\nI started out in public health before I worked in national security, working\non infectious disease control\u2014malaria and tuberculosis. In 2002, the first\nvirus was synthesized from scratch on a Darpa project, and it was sort of an\n\u201coh crap\u201d moment for the biosciences and the public health community,\nrealizing biology is going to become an engineering discipline that could be\npotentially misused. I was working with veterans of the smallpox eradication\ncampaign, and they thought, \u201cCrap, we just spent decades eradicating a disease\nthat now could be synthesized from scratch.\u201d\n\nThere's a lot of vulnerability in society. Covid was a demonstration of this.\n\nJason Matheny\n\nI then moved to working in biosecurity, trying to figure out, How could we\nincrease the security around biolabs so that they're less likely to be used?\nHow can we detect biological weapons programs? Which, unfortunately, still\nexist in significant numbers in a few places in the world. Also, how can we\nbake more security into society so that we're more resilient when it comes not\nonly to an engineered pandemic but also natural pandemics?\n\nThere's a lot of vulnerability that remains in society. Covid was a\ndemonstration of this. This was a relatively mild virus in historic terms\u2014it\nhad an infection fatality rate less than 1 percent\u2014whereas there are some\nnatural viruses that have fatality rates well above 50 percent. There are\nsynthetic viruses that have close to 100 percent lethality while still being\nas transmissible as SARS-CoV-2. Even though we know how to design vaccines and\nmanufacture them very quickly, getting them approved takes about as much time\ntoday as it did about 20 years ago. So the amount of time that you would need\nin order to vaccinate a population is about the same today as it was for our\nparents and even for our grandparents.\n\nWhen I first started getting interested in biosecurity in 2002, it cost many\nmillions of dollars to construct a poliovirus, a very, very small virus. It\nwould've cost close to $1 billion to synthesize a pox virus, a very large\nvirus. Today, the cost is less than $100,000, so it's a 10,000-fold decrease\nover that period. Meanwhile, vaccines have actually tripled in cost over that\nperiod. The defense-offense asymmetry is moving in the wrong direction.\n\nAnd what do you see as our greatest adversary in biorisks?\n\nFirst is nature. The evolution of natural viruses continues. We're going to\nhave future viral pandemics. Some of them are going to be worse than Covid,\nsome of them are going to be not as bad as Covid, but we've got to be\nresilient to both. Covid cost just the US economy more than $10 trillion, and\nyet what we invest in preventing the next pandemic is maybe $2 billion to $3\nbillion of federal investment.\n\nAnother category is intentional biological attacks. Aum Shinrikyo was a\ndoomsday cult in Japan that had a biological weapons program. They believed\nthat they would be fulfilling prophecy by killing everybody on the planet.\nFortunately, they were working with 1990s biology, which wasn't that\nsophisticated. Unfortunately, they then turned to chemical weapons and\nlaunched the Tokyo sarin gas attacks.\n\nThe barrier to entry for somebody who wants to carry out a biological attack\nis eroding.\n\nJason Matheny\n\nWe have individuals and groups today that have mass-casualty intent and\nincreasingly express interest in biology as a weapon. What's preventing them\nfrom being able to use biology effectively are not controls on the tools or\nthe raw materials, because those are all now available in many laboratories\nand on eBay\u2014you can buy a DNA synthesizer for much less than $100,000 now. You\ncan get all the materials and consumables that you need from most scientific\nsupply stores.\n\nWhat an apocalyptic group would lack is the know-how to turn those tools into\na biological weapon. There\u2019s a concern that AI makes the know-how more widely\navailable. Some of the research done by [AI safety and research company]\nAnthropic has looked at risk assessments to see if these tools could be\nmisused by somebody who didn't have a strong bio background. Could they\nbasically get graduate-level training from a digital tutor in the form of a\nlarge language model? Right now, probably not. But if you map the progress\nover the last couple of years, the barrier to entry for somebody who wants to\ncarry out a biological attack is eroding.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\n14 Last-Minute Deals From Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Spring Sale Events\n\nMatt Jancer\n\n  * Gear\n\nWhat\u2019s the Safest Seat on an Airplane?\n\nBoone Ashworth\n\n  * Gear\n\nProtect Your Home Wi-Fi Network by Setting Up a VPN on Your Router\n\nDavid Nield\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Barefoot Shoes for Walking or Running\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\nSo ... we should remind everyone there\u2019s an open bar tonight.\n\nUnhappy hour. We\u2019ll pick up the tab.\n\nRight now everyone is talking about AI and a super artificial intelligence\npotentially overtaking the human race.\n\nThat's going to take a stiffer drink.\n\nPhotograph: Diane Baldwin/RAND\n\nYou are an effective altruist, correct?\n\nAccording to the newspapers, I am.\n\nIs that how you would describe yourself?\n\nI don't think I've ever self-identified as an effective altruist. And my wife,\nwhen she read that, she was like, \u201cYou are neither effective nor altruistic.\u201d\nBut it is certainly the case that we have effective altruists at Rand who have\nbeen very concerned about AI safety. And it is a community of people who have\nbeen worried about AI safety longer than many others, in part because a lot of\nthem came from computer science.\n\nSo you're not an effective altruist, you're saying, but are someone who's been\nvery cautious about AI for a long time, like some effective altruists are.\nWhat was it that made you think years ago that we needed to be cautious about\nunleashing AI into the world?\n\nI think it was when I realized that so much of what we depend on protecting us\nfrom the misuse of biology is knowledge. [AI] that can make highly specialized\nknowledge easier to acquire without guardrails is not an unequivocal good.\nNuclear knowledge will be created. So will biological weapon knowledge. There\nwill be cyber weapon knowledge. So we have to figure out how to balance the\nrisks and benefits of tools that can create highly specialized knowledge,\nincluding knowledge about weapons systems.\n\nIt was clear even earlier than 2016 that this was going to happen. James\nClapper [former US director of national intelligence] was also worried about\nthis, but so was President Obama. There was an interview in WIRED in October\nof 2016. [Obama warned that AI could power new cyberattacks and said that he\nspent \u201ca lot of time worrying\u201d about pandemics. \u2014Editor] I think he was\nworried about what happens when you can do software engineering much, much\nfaster that's focused on generating malware at scale. You can basically\nautomate a workforce, and now you've got effectively a million people who are\ncoding novel malware constantly, and they don't sleep.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\n14 Last-Minute Deals From Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Spring Sale Events\n\nMatt Jancer\n\n  * Gear\n\nWhat\u2019s the Safest Seat on an Airplane?\n\nBoone Ashworth\n\n  * Gear\n\nProtect Your Home Wi-Fi Network by Setting Up a VPN on Your Router\n\nDavid Nield\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Barefoot Shoes for Walking or Running\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\nAt the same time, it will improve our cybersecurity, because we can also have\nimprovements in security that are amplified a million-fold. So one of the big\nquestions is whether there will be some sort of cyber offense or cyber defense\nnatural advantage as this stuff scales. What does that look like over the long\nterm? I don't know the answer to that question.\n\nDo you think it's at all possible that we will enter any kind of AI winter or\na slow-down at any point? Or is this just hockey-stick growth, as the tech\npeople like to say?\n\nIt's hard to imagine it really significantly slowing down right now. Instead\nit seems there's a positive feedback loop where the more investment you put\nin, the more investment you're able to put in because you've scaled up.\n\nSo I don't think we'll see an AI winter, but I don't know. Rand has had some\nfanciful forecasting experiments in the past. There was a project that we did\nin the 1950s to forecast what the year 2000 would be like, and there were lots\nof predictions of flying cars and jet packs, whereas we didn't get the\npersonal computer right at all. So forecasting out too far ends up being\nprobably no better than a coin flip.\n\nHow concerned are you about AI being used in military attacks, such as used in\ndrones?\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why countries are going to want to make autonomous\nweapons. One of the reasons we're seeing is in Ukraine, which is this kind of\npetri dish of autonomous weapons. The radio jamming that's used makes it very\ntempting to want to have autonomous weapons that no longer need to phone home.\n\nBut I think cyber [warfare] is the realm where autonomy has the highest\nbenefit-cost ratio, both because of its speed and because of its penetration\ndepth in places that can't communicate.\n\nBut how are you thinking about the moral and ethical implications of\nautonomous drones that have high error rates?\n\nI think the empirical work that's been done on error rates has been mixed.\n[Some analyses] found that autonomous weapons were probably having lower miss\nrates and probably resulting in fewer civilian casualties, in part because\n[human] combatants sometimes make bad decisions under stress and under the\nrisk of harm. In some cases, there could be fewer civilian deaths as a result\nof using autonomous weapons.\n\nBut this is an area where it is so hard to know what the future of autonomous\nweapons is going to look like. Many countries have banned them entirely. Other\ncountries are sort of saying, \u201cWell, let's wait and see what they look like\nand what their accuracy and precision are before making decisions.\u201d\n\nI think that one of the other questions is whether autonomous weapons are more\nadvantageous to countries that have a strong rule of law over those that\ndon't. One reason to be very skeptical of autonomous weapons would be because\nthey're very cheap. If you have very weak human capital, but you have lots of\nmoney to burn, and you have a supply chain that you can access, then that\ncharacterizes wealthier autocracies more than it does democracies that have a\nstrong investment in human capital. It's possible that autonomous weapons will\nbe advantageous to autocracies more than democracies.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\n14 Last-Minute Deals From Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Spring Sale Events\n\nMatt Jancer\n\n  * Gear\n\nWhat\u2019s the Safest Seat on an Airplane?\n\nBoone Ashworth\n\n  * Gear\n\nProtect Your Home Wi-Fi Network by Setting Up a VPN on Your Router\n\nDavid Nield\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Barefoot Shoes for Walking or Running\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\nYou've indicated that Rand is going to increase its investment in analysis on\nChina, particularly in areas where there are gaps in understanding of its\neconomy, industrial policy, and domestic politics. Why this increased\ninvestment?\n\n[The US-China relationship] is one of the most important competitions in the\nworld and also an important area of cooperation. We have to get both right in\norder for this century to go well.\n\nThe US hasn't faced a strategic competitor with more than two-thirds of our\nGDP since the War of 1812. So [we need] an accurate assessment of net\nstrengths and net weaknesses in various areas of competition, whether it's in\neconomic, industrial, military, human capital, education, or talent.\n\nAnd then where are the areas of mutual benefit where the US and China can\ncollaborate? Non-proliferation, climate, certain kinds of investments, and\npandemic preparedness. I think getting that right really matters for the two\nlargest economies in the world.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to talk with Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia,\nand we talked about US export controls. Just as one example, Nvidia is\nrestricted from shipping its most powerful GPUs to China because of the\nmeasures put in place in 2022. How effective is that strategy in the long\nterm?\n\nOne piece of math that's hard to figure out: Even if the US succeeded in\npreventing the shipment of advanced chips like [Nvidia] H100s to China, can\nChina get those chips through other means? A second question is, can China\nproduce its own chips that, while not as advanced, might still perform\nsufficiently for the kinds of capabilities that we might worry about?\n\nIf you\u2019re a national security decisionmaker [in China] and you're told, \"Hey,\nwe really need this data center to create the arsenal of offensive tools we\nneed. It's not going to be as cost-effective as using H100s, we'll have to pay\nfour times more because of having a bigger energy bill and it'll be slower,\"\nyou\u2019re probably going to pay the bill. So the question then becomes, at what\npoint is a decisionmaker no longer willing to pay the bill? Is it 10X the\ncost? Is it 20X? We don't know the answer to that question.\n\nBut certain kinds of operations are no longer possible because of those export\ncontrols. That gap between what you can get a Huawei chip to do and what you\ncan get an Nvidia chip to do keeps on growing because [the chip technology is]\nsort of stuck in China, and the rest of the world will keep on getting more\nadvanced. And that does prevent a certain kind of military efficiency in\ncomputing that could be useful for a variety of military operations. And I\nthink New York Times reporter Paul Mozur was the first to break the news that\nNvidia chips were powering the Xinjiang data center that's being used to\nmonitor the Uighur prison camps in real time.\n\nThat raises a really hard question: Should those chips be going into a data\ncenter that are being used for human rights abuses? Regardless of one's view\nof the policy, just doing the math is really important, and that's mostly what\nwe focus on at Rand.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
