Gitlin - 5/1/2024, 6:34 PM\n\nEnlarge / Congress provides government support for other industries, so why\nnot AM radio?\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n361\n\nA controversial bill that would require all new cars to be fitted with AM\nradios looks set to become a law in the near future. Yesterday, Senator Edward\nMarkey (D-Mass) revealed that the \"AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act\" now has the\nsupport of 60 US Senators, as well as 246 co-sponsors in the House of\nRepresentatives, making its passage an almost sure thing. Should that happen,\nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would be required to ensure\nthat all new cars sold in the US had AM radios at no extra cost.\n\n\"Democrats and Republicans are tuning in to the millions of listeners,\nthousands of broadcasters, and countless emergency management officials who\ndepend on AM radio in their vehicles. AM radio is a lifeline for people in\nevery corner of the United States to get news, sports, and local updates in\ntimes of emergencies. Our commonsense bill makes sure this fundamental,\nessential tool doesn\u2019t get lost on the dial. With a filibuster-proof\nsupermajority in the Senate, Congress should quickly take it up and pass it,\"\nsaid Sen. Markey and his co-sponsor Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nAbout 82 million people still listen to AM radio, according to the National\nAssociation of Broadcasters, which as you can imagine was rather pleased with\nthe congressional support for its industry.\n\n\u201cBroadcasters are grateful for the overwhelming bipartisan support for the AM\nRadio for Every Vehicle Act in both chambers of Congress,\" said NAB president\nand CEO Curtis LeGeyt. \"This majority endorsement reaffirms lawmakers'\nrecognition of the essential service AM radio provides to the American people,\nparticularly in emergency situations. NAB thanks the 307 members of Congress\nwho are reinforcing the importance of maintaining universal access to this\ncrucial public communications medium.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Why are they dropping AM anyway?\n\nThe reason there's even a bill in Congress to mandate AM radios in all new\nvehicles is that some automakers have begun to drop the option, particularly\nin electric vehicles. A big reason for that is electromagnetic interference\nfrom electric motors\u2014rather than risk customer complaints from poor-quality\naudio, some automakers decided to remove it.\n\nBut it's not exclusively an EV issue; last year we learned the revised Ford\nMustang coupe would also arrive sans AM radio, which Ford told us was because\nradio stations were modernizing \"by offering Internet streaming through mobile\napps, FM, digital and satellite radio options,\" and that it would continue to\noffer those other audio options in its vehicles.\n\nIn response to congressional questioning, eight automakers told a Senate\ncommittee that they were quitting AM: BMW, Ford, Mazda, Polestar, Rivian,\nTesla, Volkswagen, and Volvo. This \"undermined the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency's system for delivering critical public safety information\nto the public,\" said Sen. Markey's office last year, and AM radio's role as a\nplatform for delivering emergency alerts to the public is given by supporters\nof the legislation as perhaps the key reason for its necessity.\n\n## Tech and auto industries aren\u2019t happy\n\nBut critics of the bill\u2014including the Consumer Technology Association\u2014don't\nbuy that argument. In October 2023, FEMA and the Federal Communications\nCommission conducted a nationwide test of the emergency alert system.\nAccording to CTA, which surveyed 800 US adults, of the 95 percent of US adults\nthat heard the test, only 6 percent did so via radio, and just 1 percent on AM\nradio specifically. Instead, 92 percent received the alert pushed to their\nsmartphone.\n\n\"Requiring the installation of analog AM radios in automobiles is an\nunnecessary action that would impact EV range, efficiency and affordability at\na critical moment of accelerating adoption,\" said Albert Gore, executive\ndirector of ZETA, a clean vehicle advocacy group that opposes the AM radio\nrequirement. \"Mandating AM radio would do little to expand drivers\u2019 ability to\nreceive emergency alerts. At a time when we are more connected than ever, we\nencourage Congress to allow manufacturers to innovate and produce designs that\nmeet consumer preference, rather than pushing a specific communications\ntechnology,\" Gore said in a statement.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n361\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
