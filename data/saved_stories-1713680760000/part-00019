In the process I went viral on TikTok, made $1000 in a week,\nhired a Japanese voice actor, and learnt about the weird world of emoji\ndomains.\n\n### \ud83c\udf05 The setup\n\nNot long ago I decided it would be a brilliant idea to buy the domain name\nnetflix.soy.\n\nWhilst arguably there are better ways to spend \u00a317, I did learn a lot about\ndomain names, including that it's possible to have emoji domains like \ud83d\ude0a.ws.\n\nIt's pretty hard to go a day without seeing an emoji somewhere on the\ninternet. Yet, I'd never seen an emoji domain name before.\n\nI wondered:\n\nCould I buy an emoji domain name?\n\n### \ud83d\udcb8 Buying an emoji domain name\n\nMy goal was to buy a single character emoji domain name, like \ud83d\udca1 or \ud83c\udf70. I didn't\nknow what I'd do with it, I just wanted to see if I could get one.\n\nI found a website that showed every available emoji domain for 4 different\nextensions.\n\nSadly, nearly every single one had been registered. I was late to the party.\n\nA simple mailbox emoji with a .ws extension was still available though, so I\nbought it.\n\n### \ud83d\udcea The mailbox\n\n\ud83d\udcea.ws was now mine. Mission complete.\n\nI set up a website and felt rather accomplished with my tiny mailbox.\n\nI could've stopped there and called it a day. But, then I had another thought:\n\nCould I use my little mailbox emoji domain in an email address?\n\nThat'd be pretty cute.\n\n### \u2709\ufe0f Emoji mail attempt #1\n\nI gave it a go. I setup an email forwarder to route all email sent to \ud83d\udcea.ws to\nmy regular email address.\n\nEagerly I typed ben@\ud83d\udcea.ws into the \"to\" field of gmail and hit send.\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 Blocked\n\nThe email never hit my inbox. It was lost forever in cyberspace.\n\nTurns out emoji domain names score very highly for spam and were going to be\nblocked to high heaven.\n\nBut, it was interesting that I could send mail towards an emoji email address.\n\nSo I wondered:\n\nIf a normal .com email address doesn't get blocked for spam, could I route my\nemoji mail through that?\n\n### \ud83d\udc8c Emoji mail attempt #2\n\nIt would work like this:\n\n  1. Email sent to ben@\ud83d\udcea.ws\n  2. ben@\ud83d\udcea.ws forwards to nospam@normal.com\n  3. nospam@normal.com forwards to my email address and won't get blocked.\n\nI cobbled together something using AWS, and tried my experiment again.\n\nto: ben@\ud83d\udcea.ws\n\nmessage: Hi Ben, how's it going?\n\nSend.\n\nIt worked!\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 Where things started to get out of control\n\nAt this point I was inclined to stop and write a post about emoji email\naddresses. I'd had a good run.\n\nBut then I wondered:\n\nMy mailbox emoji email address is great and all, but do you know what would be\nbetter? ben@\u2b50\n\nNow how do I get one of those?\n\n### \ud83c\udfa3 Emoji domain name hunting\n\nOnly 13 TLDs in the world accept registrations of emoji domain names: .cf,\n.ga, .gq, .la, .ml, .tk, .st, .fm, .to, .je, .gg, .kz, and .ws.\n\nThe website I had used to purchase \ud83d\udcea.ws only showed 4 TLDs: .fm, .ws, .to and\n.ml. These are considered the gold standard of emoji domain name registrars.\n\nEvery emoji had been taken on these though. You could of course get multi-\ncharacter emoji domains like \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc22.ws, but I wanted single character emoji\ndomains only.\n\nSo I wondered:\n\nDo any of those other TLDs have any emoji domains left?\n\n### \ud83d\udd2d The great hunt\n\nI already had some code that performed WHOIS lookups to see if a domain name\nis available for a list of TLDs.\n\nPreviously I'd used this code to buy facebook.\u7f51\u7ad9, only for Marky Z to snatch\nit back from me. Cheeky bugger.\n\nI booted up the code and loaded in some A-tier emojis (e.g. \u2b50,\ud83d\ude02,\u2764\ufe0f) and the 13\nTLDs that accepted them.\n\n>node search.js [ENTER]\n\n### \ud83c\udf81 The results\n\nInstantly I was seeing results! .la, .ga, .gq, .je. There were plenty of\nemojis still out there on these alternative extensions.\n\nAn extension that stood out to me straight away was .gg, for the Island of\nGuernsey. \"GG\" is an acronym for \"Good Game\", and I say it often when I lose\nat online games. It was perfect.\n\n\u2b50.gg was available for \u20ac29. I hit purchase.\n\n### \ud83d\udc94 No GG for me\n\nThe next day Guernsey sent me an email.\n\nLong story short, although you could register emoji domain names with them,\nthey didn't actually work.\n\nGood game Guernsey. Back to the drawing board.\n\n### \u2b50 Crazy for KZ\n\nWith every other extension I kept hitting walls. A lot of the registrars\nwouldn't even let me search for emoji domains. Nothing was working.\n\nOne extension that kept cropping up was .kz of Kazakhstan. But, I headed over\nto their registar website and it was entirely in Russian.\n\nI do not speak Russian.\n\nUsing Google Translate, I tried to navigate the website and buy a .kz emoji\ndomain.\n\nIt was a long, painful process. But, after phoning my bank to confirm I was\nindeed trying to make a purchase using Kazakhstani tenge, \u2b50.kz was sitting in\nmy account.\n\nI plugged it into my email system and ben@\u2b50.kz worked.\n\nVery nice.\n\n### \ud83d\udcbc Let's start an email service\n\nSomething excited me. Nearly all single character emojis were available on\n.kz, and they were only $8 each.\n\nSo, I wondered:\n\nWhat if you could get an email address with any emoji you wanted?\n\nI pictured email addresses like bob@\ud83d\ude80, alice@\ud83c\udf38, melvin@\ud83c\udf46.\n\nAll I'd need to do is buy every emoji domain to build a service like this.\n\nIt was insane, but it was possible.\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 The night of 150 emojis\n\nI decided I was going to do it.\n\nIf I was chuffed with my mailbox emoji email address, perhaps others would be\ntoo.\n\nI got out my debit card, and, one by one, started buying Kazakhstan emoji\ndomains.\n\n\ud83d\udca1.kz, \ud83d\udc51.kz, \ud83c\udf08.kz, \ud83d\ude0e.kz. Buy, buy, buy, buy.\n\nIt was slightly painful watching my bank account going down, and the number of\nemoji domains go up.\n\n80 emojis in, forking over money for a goat emoji domain name, you seriously\nstart to question what you're doing.\n\n$1200 later, 150 emoji domains were mine.\n\n### \ud83d\udcbb Building an emoji email address website\n\nFinally, I needed a website where you could register an emoji email address\nand it would forward mail like ben@\ud83d\udcea.ws did.\n\nUsing vanilla HTML, JS and CSS, plus Stripe's API for payments, I cobbled\ntogether an MVP over a few weeks.\n\nOnce it was done, I bought one last domain name: mailoji.com. My new emoji\nemail address service Mailoji was ready. Get your emoji email addresses.\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 TikTok\n\nI'd gone from being curious about emoji domain names to now owning 150 of\nKazakhstan's finest.\n\nThe next step was to convince someone else to buy an emoji email address.\n\nTikTok seemed like a good place to start given its demographic. So, I recorded\na short video advert and started a \"TikTok for business\" application to\npublish it.\n\nOn the final page of the application I was asked for a VAT registration\nnumber. Mailoji was not a proper business yet, so there was no way I could\npublish my ad.\n\nScrew it, I'll post the video normally.\n\nUpload.\n\n### \ud83c\udf89 First sales\n\nHere is the advert if you're interested.\n\nThe video sat at 0 views for about 5 hours before the TikTok algorithm started\nto work its magic.\n\nSlowly, the views started ramping up. 500 views, to 5k views, to 50k views. It\nwas incredible to witness.\n\nPeople were loving emoji email addresses, people were hating emoji email\naddresses.\n\nIt was like Marmite, a talking point. None of it mattered though because emoji\nemail addresses were selling! @\ud83d\ude80, @\ud83d\udcf7 & @\ud83d\udcbb addresses were the most popular.\n\nOver 2 days the TikTok video reached 200k+ views, and 60 emoji email addresses\nhad been sold netting ~$300/yr in revenue.\n\nI took this as a fantastic indicator. So guess what I did?\n\n### \ud83d\udcb5 Buying more emoji domain names\n\nI decided to purchase 100 more emoji domains.\n\nI cried into my keyboard forking out yet more money for a llama emoji that I\nprobably didn't need.\n\nIn the end I had 250 emoji domains. If there was ever a moat into the emoji\nemail address world, this was it.\n\n### \ud83d\udcc5 Preparing for launch\n\nI figured the more people with emoji email addresses, the more people who\nwould see them, and the more people who would buy them. A beautiful cycle.\n\nMy next goal was a Product Hunt launch to get exposure for Mailoji, and\nkickstart this cycle.\n\nI prepped my launch post, carefully choosing each word and image.\n\nI even created this over-hyped promotional video, complete with Japanese voice\nactor saying the words \"Mailoji\".\n\nMailoji was ready for launch.\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Launch Day\n\nAt 12:03 AM PST Mailoji went live on Product Hunt. We had come a long way from\nthat little mailbox emoji.\n\nIt was 8:03 AM UK time. Bleary eyed, with a cup of tea in hand, I watched as\nMailoji did battle.\n\nI had chosen to launch on a Wednesday against some stiff competition, but\nMailoji really held its own.\n\nAt the end of the day it finished in 5th place. Here were the end of day\nstats:\n\n  * \ud83c\udf0e 6.7k website views\n  * \ud83d\udc8c 150+ emoji email addresses sold\n  * \ud83d\udcb5 $830/yr ARR\n  * \ud83d\udd3a 320 upvotes\n  * \ud83c\udfc5 5th place on Product Hunt\n  * \ud83c\udf80 Most popular Mailoji: @\ud83d\ude80\n\nOver 150 emoji email addresses were sold in a day, and I received some\nfantastic feedback from the Product Hunt community.\n\nIt was done, Mailoji had officially launched.\n\n### \ud83d\udcd9 The aftermath\n\nI wish this story ended with Mailoji blowing up and the queen registering an\nemoji email address or something (I'll reserve Liz@\ud83d\udc51.kz just in case).\n\nBut, currently Mailoji is sitting at ~$1440/year in revenue. There's now 300\nemoji domains to choose from though.\n\nEven though I still haven't made the money back on all the emoji domains I\nbought, creating an emoji email address service was so much fun.\n\nIt was an adventure. A rabbit hole containing multiple rabbit holes.\n\nThis project started out as an exploration into emoji domain names; a weird,\nforgotten about internet feature that I've now become quite fond of.\n\nYes emoji domains are hard to type on desktop, yes there's too many\nvariations, and yes, most form validations hate them.\n\nBut they're fun, and I think tech should be more fun.\n\nThanks for reading. If you want to get in touch, I've got a brand new email\naddress at the bottom of this website.\n\nI make tiny projects\n\n#### Get notified about new projects:\n\nPowered by EmailOctopus\n\nFollow me:\n\nTwitter Instagram RSS\n\nGet in touch: tinyprojects@\ud83d\udca1.kz\n\n", "frontpage": true}
