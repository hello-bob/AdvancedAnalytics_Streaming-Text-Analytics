But its success is based on\nsomething different than most media companies. The Onion has been stifled,\nalong with most of the Internet, by byzantine cookie dialogs, paywalls,\nbizarro belly fat ads, and clickbait,\" he said.\n\nHe promised to introduce products and explore new media over time. In the\nmeantime, he asked \"everybody to pitch in $1,\" echoing an announcement made on\nThe Onion site last week.\n\n\"If you care about The Onion, if The Onion ever made you laugh \u2013 give us a\nbuck. For that dollar, you get... absolutely nothing. Just a smug sense that\nyou've once again spent less on The Onion than it's worth in your life,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe Onion attracts millions of visitors each month with its satirical take on\nthe news, which it presents with a straight face. Some of its stories have\nbeen so close to believable \u2013 even though somehow also ridiculous \u2013 that they\nhave been repeated by other outlets. In 2009, two Bangladeshi newspapers\npicked up a story about a conspiracy theorist who convinced Neil Armstrong the\nMoon landing was faked.\n\n  * Twilio reminds users that Authy Desktop apps die in March \u2013 not in August\n  * CEO of chat tech plumber Twilio is leaving the building\n  * Twilio axes roughly 1 in 5 staff in fresh round of layoffs\n  * Twilio more than decimates staff, CEO says it grew too fast\n\nAt other times, it tests the boundaries of good taste. It once reported a\nproject manager had used a PowerPoint presentation \u2013 complete with clip art \u2013\nto carefully explain to colleagues his reasons for committing suicide.\n\nIn January, Lawson stepped down as CEO of Twilio to allow Khozema Shipchandler\nto lead the company.\n\nThe move followed pressure from activist investors Anson Funds and Legion\nPartners, which sought changes at the tech company. Twilio has already\nundertaken several reorganizations. In February 2023, it announced plans to\ncut 17 percent of its staffers. It also formed two business units, Twilio Data\n& Applications and Twilio Communications.\n\nAt the time, Lawson said: \"These changes hurt.\"\n\nThe Onion's loyal fans will be hoping his new venture hurts a little less. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Twilio\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Twilio\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Twilio\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Twilio\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Twilio reminds users that Authy Desktop apps die in March \u2013 not in August\n\n'This is an excellent way to piss off thousands of developers'\n\nDevops2 months | 31\n\n#### CEO of chat tech plumber Twilio is leaving the building\n\n'Tech visionary and pioneer' replaced by former comms president, as company\nfaces pressure from activist investors\n\nNetworks4 months | 3\n\n#### Twilio axes roughly 1 in 5 staff in fresh round of layoffs\n\nAlready decimated staff in September\n\nSoftware13 Feb 2023 | 3\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Twilio more than decimates staff, CEO says it grew too fast\n\nAs Patreon ditches nearly a fifth of its workforce\n\nSoftware14 Sep 2022 | 17\n\n#### Twilio customer data exposed after its staffers got phished\n\nComms giant says several other firms targeted in 'sophisticated attack'\n\nCyber-crime8 Aug 2022 | 13\n\n#### Cloudflare: Someone tried to pull the Twilio phishing tactic on us too\n\nAttack was foiled by content delivery network's hardware security keys\n\nSecurity10 Aug 2022 | 10\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
