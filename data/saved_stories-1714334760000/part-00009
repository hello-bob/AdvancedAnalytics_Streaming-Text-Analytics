I work at\nnight-watch. Being the keeper of Cerberus ( I mean the keeper of the \u201cdog-\nwatch\u201d ) and also being the Cronos I am ( thats the furthest my mythology\nknowledge goes ) I need several fincans of coffee to stay awake & concentrated\n& keeping mind & body & spirit all in top shape.\n\nI prepared a good fincan of Turkish Coffee, be-loved by many and known for its\nmagical properties which I will not disclose. And return to my desk, put the\nfincan aside and concentrated on my work, while having critical random\ninterval sips , suddenly, my lucky hand with my unlucky finger tipped the\nMotorola UHF radio I happen to have, ( I also use UHF radios for my work ) .\n\nBefore, during and after the t = 0 of the tipping event, due to all heavenly\nbodies aligned so perfectly, with my fincan also sharing this property of\nallignment, the radio fell over my fincan in a way that I lost all my fresh\ncoffee, also near-missed ruining my radio, keyboard and phone. This made me\nvery angry to the point that after this major spill, I also wanted to spill my\nfrustration toward my clumsiness to the Web. In less then half hour, this page\nwas registered, hostings arranged, new coffee deranged, essentially up \u2018 n \u2018\nrunning.\n\nThese happened few days prior, but I encourage who-is checks to those who want\nto know the exact date of the spill for whatever reason. Stalkers are not\nwelcome in this Bay, please do not.\n\nAnyhow, we all need to anchor our horses to a good meadow, thats all for\ntoday. Thanks for reading cart curt.\n\nNext installment will concern the following topics;\n\nI) The possible usage scenarios for Spill Your Coffee,\n\nII) Best ways to cope with Spilled Coffee,\n\nIII) To be a steadfast Coffee Spiller,\n\nFeel free to contact at any given moment, you are also allowed to leave a\ncomment, which I will approve immediately because why not?
