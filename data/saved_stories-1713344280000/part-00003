Others\nbalance caring for children with part-time employment.\n\nBut many do not rejoin the workforce at all, even a decade on. This has been\ndubbed the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d.\n\nA new study estimates the impact of motherhood on careers in 134 countries.\n\nJan 30th 2024\n\n\u201cWhen things are shitty we change them\u201d, read a placard held aloft at a \u201cMarch\nof the Mummies\u201d protest in Britain in October 2022. \u201cChildcare shouldn\u2019t cost\nour future\u201d, declared another. The message fell on fertile ground in\nWestminster: six months later the Conservative government announced plans to\nexpand subsidies for early-years child care. The first of a bundle of measures\nwill come into effect in April.\n\nThe cost of child care can be an imposing barrier to work. For many British\nwomen it is especially daunting. For one in ten it exceeds their take-home\npay, according to a survey of 24,000 parents by Pregnant then Screwed, an\nadvocacy group. Only in America, Ireland and New Zealand do child-care costs\ntake up a greater share of parents\u2019 net household income across the OECD, a\nclub of mostly rich countries. But almost everywhere women\u2019s careers suffer\nafter they become parents.\n\nWhereas around the world 95% of men aged between 25 and 54 are in the labour\nforce, the figure for women of the same age is just 52%. Little has been\nunderstood about how much of this gap is explained by mothers leaving formal\nwork after giving birth. But a group of academics from the London School of\nEconomics (LSE) and Princeton University has now amassed a trove of data to\nmeasure the effect in 134 countries, home to 95% of the world\u2019s population.\nBuilding on the work of Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist who was awarded\nlast year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics for her research into gender inequality\nin the labour market, the authors compare mothers and fathers with childless\npeople of similar age, education, marital status and so forth. Mothers\u2019\nlabour-market participation falls after childbirth in almost every country in\nthe study.\n\nThe authors define the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d as the average amount by which a\nwoman\u2019s probability of being employed declines during the ten years after the\nbirth of her first child. On average 24% of women leave the labour force in\nthe first year. Five years later, 17% are still absent. After ten years, 15%\nare.\n\n## Employment gap between women and men*\n\n### By country, percentage points\n\nTotal gap\n\nDue to having children\n\nGDP per person in 2020, $, log scale\n\n*Between 1968-2020, different years for different countries. Changes to the motherhood penalty happen slowly and don\u2019t vary significantly over this period\n\nMany women in rich countries worry about another problem: being paid less than\nmen. But the two are linked: gaps in employment tend to limit a woman\u2019s\nlifetime earnings. Being out of work can mean delaying or missing out on\npromotions and other career opportunities, and can make it harder to find a\njob.\n\nThe effect of motherhood on employment varies widely between countries. In the\nrich world, 80% of the gap between male and female labour-force participation\nis explained by women dropping out after the birth of their first child. By\ncontrast, in the poorest countries motherhood explains only about 10% of the\ngap. There, women tend to leave the labour market upon marrying, usually well\nbefore their first child is born. In Mauritius and Zambia, for example,\nmarriage explains nearly half of the participation gap.\n\nShare of total employment gender gap\n\nBy country, 2020 or latest, %\n\n100\n\n80\n\nOther\n\n60\n\n40\n\nMarriage effect\n\n20\n\nExplained by\n\nmotherhood\n\neffect\n\n0\n\nRank of GDP per person\n\n\u2190 Lowest\n\nHighest \u2192\n\nIn middle-income countries women are more likely to work after they wed, but\nmany quit permanently after becoming mothers. For example, in Latin America,\n38% of working women leave the labour force after having a child, and 37% are\nstill out a decade later. As a result, the overall employment gap in these\ncountries is little different from that in low-income ones.\n\nMany mothers leave work because doing so makes economic sense. \u201cThere is no\npoint in going back four or five days a week, because I would have about \u00a3100\n[$127] a month left after child-care,\u201d says Alison Greatorex, a mother in\nSurrey who has not returned to work since the birth of her two-year-old child.\nCultural norms also have an effect. The International Labour Organisation, a\nUN agency, estimated that in 2018 606m working-age women across the world were\nunable to consider employment because of family care duties, against only 41m\nmen. In a previous, smaller international study, the LSE and Princeton authors\nfound that women whose mothers stayed at home were more likely to do the same.\n\nWith labour markets in the rich world and many other countries tight, many\npolicymakers are seeking ways to get mothers back to work. Like Britain,\nAustria, Germany and the Netherlands are all planning to reform child-care\nsubsidies or parental leave. In 2021 Canada began offering subsidised child\ncare for just C$10 ($7.50) per day. Japan is restructuring tax incentives to\nnudge women into work. Last year Jordan set a goal of doubling women\u2019s labour-\nforce participation by 2033, and has set about expanding child-care subsidies\nfor working mothers.\n\nResearch published by the World Bank last year looked at 95 countries and\nfound that women\u2019s labour-force participation rose 4%, on average, five years\nafter a country enacted child-care laws. But interventions can also go wrong.\nParents in Canada and Germany struggle with long waiting lists for nursery\nplaces. A previous expansion of Britain\u2019s child-care entitlements led to a\nreduction in supply because the government, newly responsible for how much\nproviders were paid, was too stingy. Shifting high costs to taxpayers, though,\nmay strip the system of useful incentives to control them.\n\nRegardless, 4% is a small effect relative to the yawning gap between men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s employment. And women\u2019s participation in labour markets is close to\nflatlining. According to the World Economic Forum, at the current rate of\nchange it would take another 170 years for the global economic gender gap to\nclose. \u25a0\n\n## Change in employment after having a baby, %\n\n### Relative to two years before the birth\n\nWorld*\n\nAlgeria\n\nAngola\n\nArgentina\n\nArmenia\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBangladesh\n\nBelarus\n\nBelgium\n\nBenin\n\nBolivia\n\nBrazil\n\n\u2192\n\nMany women in Western countries, where child care is expensive, leave work in\nthe first years of a baby\u2019s life.\n\nBritain\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nCambodia\n\nCameroon\n\nCanada\n\nChile\n\nChina\n\nColombia\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCuba\n\nDenmark\n\nDominican Republic\n\nEcuador\n\nEgypt\n\nEl Salvador\n\nFiji\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGhana\n\nGreece\n\nGuatemala\n\nGuinea\n\nHaiti\n\nHonduras\n\nHungary\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran\n\nIraq\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJamaica\n\nJordan\n\nKenya\n\nLaos\n\nMalawi\n\nMalaysia\n\nMali\n\nMauritius\n\nMexico\n\nMorocco\n\nMozambique\n\nMyanmar\n\nNepal\n\n\u2191\n\nIn Arab countries the gap between the sexes widens as subsequent births drive\nmore women away from work\n\nNetherlands\n\nNicaragua\n\nNigeria\n\nNorway\n\nPakistan\n\nPanama\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nParaguay\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nRomania\n\nRussia\n\nRwanda\n\nSenegal\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nSpain\n\nSudan\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTaiwan\n\nTanzania\n\n\u2190\n\nHaving a baby has little impact on employment in many sub-Saharan countries,\nwhere most women leave work upon marriage\n\nThailand\n\nTogo\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTunisia\n\nTurkey\n\nUganda\n\nUnited States\n\nUruguay\n\nVenezuela\n\nVietnam\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\n*Population-weighted average of 130 countries\n\nSources: \u201dThe Child Penalty Atlas\u201d by H.
