These are cheaper for\nthe customer and mean fewer magnetic stripe paper ticket sales for TfL.\n\nIt followed staff observations that people were requesting single or return\npaper tickets but then paying for them with a contactless card \u2014 so why not\nencourage them to use the contactless card at the ticket barrier instead?\n\nWhat TfL has done is add a pop-up message on the ticket-selling machines, so\nif you try to buy a single or return ticket instead of a travelcard, it will\nsuggest using a contactless card instead.\n\nThe Passenger Operated Machine (POM), to use the TfL name for the ticket\nmachines, doesn\u2019t show the pop-up for every journey that they can sell tickets\nfor because not every destination accepts contactless PAYG tickets, but those\nthat can will get the message. Over time, as more National Rail stations are\nadded to the contactless payments system, the ticket machines will be updated\nto include them in the messaging.\n\nSince the change was introduced in September 2023, TfL has seen a noticeable\ndrop in paper ticket sales.\n\nSo the change worked.\n\n(c) TfL\n\nApart from fitting in with TfL\u2019s aim of reducing the sales of magnetic stripe\ntickets, the move would have reduced the fares that customers pay to travel\naround London.\n\nArguably, not offering the option to save money would put more money in TfL\u2019s\ncoffers, but there\u2019s a trade-off in that offering more expensive trips will\ndeter casual visitors from using public transport. If they see the fares are\nlower than expected, customers are more likely to travel more often, and if\nthey see TfL is being upfront about fares, lingering concerns about using\ncontactless will be reduced.\n\nTo pick a random example, an off-peak trip from Paddington to Canary Wharf\nwould cost \u00a36.70 if buying a paper ticket but \u00a32.80 if using contactless\npayments.\n\nSo a small change that a regular London traveller would be unlikely to have\nnoticed is reducing queues at ticket machines for everyone else.\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\n\u2039 Pioneering female painter\u2019s portraits return to their Pall Mall birthplace\n\nLondon\u2019s weekly railway news \u203a\n\nTagged with: Transport for London (TfL)\n\nSUPPORT THIS WEBSITE\n\nThis website has been running now for over a decade, and while advertising\nrevenue contributes to funding the website, it doesn't cover the costs.

Mike S says:\n\n25 April 2024 at 5:12 pm\n\nThere\u2019s supposed to be an obligation on train operators to sell the best\nticket. Not sure how this applies to TFL, but telling the customer they are\ngetting a much better deal is the right thing to do for a customer.\n\nThey could follow it up with \u201cyou are paying for a ticket with contactless \u2013\nusing contactless directly at the barrier will save you money. Do you want to\nproceed with this transaction?

Wilfonzo says:\n\n25 April 2024 at 6:48 pm\n\nIt also has the side effect of highlighting that there are effectively no\nchild fares for visitors to London any more. Not sure how long this has been\nthe case but on a recent visit the pop up brought it to my attention that\nadult contactless is cheaper than buying paper tickets for child fares. To get\ncontactless child fares you have to send away for a photo id Oyster card (zip\ncard?) which costs \u00a315; not worth it if you\u2019re only visiting a few times a\nyear. Got to find some way to pay for the system I suppose, might as well\nrinse the tourists; they aren\u2019t voting for you. On a recent trip to the south\nbank it was considerably cheaper for a family of 5 to pay the congestion\ncharge and park at the national theatre car park compared to taking the train\ninto London and using the tube though which doesn\u2019t feel great.\n\nReply\n\n     * HoosierSands says:\n\n25 April 2024 at 8:31 pm\n\nFrom TfL\u2019s website:\n\nTravelling with children\n\nChildren under 11 travel free on buses and trams. Children under 11 also\ntravel free on Tube, DLR, London Overground, Elizabeth line and some National\nRail services when accompanied by a fare-paying adult (up to four children per\nadult).\n\nIf you\u2019re travelling with children aged 11-15, buy a Visitor Oyster card\nbefore you leave home and, when you arrive in London, you can ask a member of\nour staff to add a Young Visitor discount to a Visitor Oyster card at:\n\nmost Tube stations our Visitor Centres Victoria National Rail station ticket\noffice\n\nChild must be present when adding a Young Visitor discount. This discount\ngives your child half adult rate pay as you go discount for up to 14 days.\n\nYou can also buy child Travelcards online for children aged 11-15.\n\nGo to the Visitor Shop website to buy your card before you leave home and it\nwill be delivered to your home address. No time to buy online?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have time to buy your card online, you can also buy a Visitor\nOyster card before arriving in London from different locations in the UK and\noverseas.

Just head on up to the gateline and get waved through.\n\nAnd if you pay the \u00a315 admin fee and get an 11-15 Zip card for an older child,\nit\u2019s valid for those 5 whole years, so if you\u2019re visiting a few times a year\nit will very likely be worthwhile.\n\n     * Donal says:\n\n28 April 2024 at 11:53 am\n\nRe: Child oyster cards: This is not true. I got a new oyster card for my son\nwhen we visited in September 2023. Just had to find a member of staff and they\nworked some magic at the terminal to mark it as a child card (took 2mins max).\nIt defaults back to an adult card after some time (think it\u2019s 14 or 30 days).\n\nNow to be fair, the information isn\u2019t very discoverable but the staff at the\nstation (think it was Heathrow 2-3) made it hassle free.\n\n  3. Andrew says:\n\n25 April 2024 at 11:07 pm\n\nYou also get the Oyster benefit of the daily cap of you use contactless.\nContactless works on Uber boats too.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Terence Eden says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 7:40 am\n\nWhy is the \u201ccancel\u201d button centred but the \u201cbuy ticket\u201d left aligned?\n\nWhat\u2019s with the small font and massive line spacing?\n\nYou \u201ctouch in on\u201d at the start, but just \u201ctouch out\u201d at the end.\n\nARHGHGHGH!\n\nReply\n\n     * Paul says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 4:29 pm\n\nI suspect the mismatched text alignment on the buttons is a deliberate UX\n\u2018nudge\u2019 \u2013 the left-aligned \u2018Buy Ticket\u2019 text on the button \u2018feels wrong\u2019 so it\nforces you to really think rather than blindly tap through, and the\ncontrasting centred text makes it feel \u2018more comfortable\u2019 to hit cancel.\n\n     * Chris Rogers says:\n\n28 April 2024 at 9:00 am\n\nTfL have a long history of lousy grammar. During one lot of works they had\nmassive cross-platform posters that confused \u2018exchanging/for\u2019 and\n\u2018replacing/with\u2019, and once I nominated them for the Idler award for bad\ngrammar (they got second place) for the multiple warnings in every car \u2013 now\ngone, thankfully \u2013 that said \u201cIt is safer to stay on the train than attempting\nto get off\u201d.\n\nI had already raised it with TfL, noting that grammatically-correct versions\nlike \u2018Staying on the train is safer than attempting to get off\u2019 were also\nactually shorter. They failed to reply.\n\n  5. James says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 10:16 am\n\nThe price difference is ridiculous and penury (if that\u2019s the right word) I\nhave had friends and family visit London and unwittingly pay the 150%\nsupplement. Annoys me that one of their first experiences in London is to be\nripped off. Message should make it clearer how much more expensive paper\ntickets are.\n\nReply\n\n     * ChrisC says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 11:56 am\n\nIf only TFL had tool where you could put in the start and end points of your\ntrip and it would tell you the fare!\n\nOh but there is \u2013 the single fare finder.\n\nPlus pages and pages on their website on travel cards etc.\n\nAnd no penury isn\u2019t the right word.\n\n     * Paul says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 1:12 pm\n\nHonestly, apart from all the advance information available online and via\nguide books, third parties etc, the signage at major arrival stations is\noverwhelming and explicit about using contactless payments, and there\u2019s\nusually no shortage of staff available to help. If people ignore all that and\nbuy paper tickets anyway, then this is not so much unwitting as witless.\n\n     * ChrisC says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 2:35 pm\n\nExactly Paul\n\nWhen I plan to visit a new city I always look up local transport fares.\n\nIs it cheaper to just buy single tickets? Is a day / multi day pass better\nvalue? Do I need a paper ticket or do they use an app? If the latter cheaper\nthan the former or the same?\n\nTakes literally minutes to do.\n\n  6. Gary says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 11:21 am\n\nIf you pay/travel using your bank card you must remember to put it through a\nmachine at journey end! As even if you get waved through the barriers you\u2019re\ncard is still on the system, and it is possible that you will be charged a\nVERY high amount for a short journey! \ud83e\udd2c\n\nReply\n\n     * Nick says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 9:41 pm\n\nNot really, it\u2019s about a tenner, I went St Albans from Abbey Wood and I forgot\nabout St Albans being out of London and they just let me through.\n\n  7. MilesT says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 1:45 pm\n\nThe wording is not ideal\u2013one card per person isn\u2019t explained (as highlighted\nin other comments), also as a minimum \u201ctouch out with the same card\u201d needs to\nbe expressed.\n\nExtra marks if there was an ongoing poster campaign (in interchange stations)\nwith a QR code leading to an instructional video (in multiple languages). And\nmaybe in key stations outside of London.\n\nAlso: Child visitor cards (for over 11s). Given you have to pay \u00a37 at least to\naccess a child discount, I would suggest that when a card is flagged for child\ndiscount, the system also refunds the \u00a37 card fee. Or just make all under 18s\nfree (including making Zip card fee-free for residents and allowing refund by\npost of a child flagged oyster).\n\nReply\n\n     * Paul says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 4:10 pm\n\n@MilesT I\u2019m sympathetic to tourists understanding how to use the system and\nget the best fares, but quite honestly, if they\u2019re forking out at least \u00a3150\nper night per room for accommodation and countless more on eating out and\nother family activities in London for 11-15 year olds, they can probably\nafford a \u00a37.90 child day Travelcard or a \u00a37 oyster without too much sweat.\n\nGiving away everything for free isn\u2019t the answer \u2013 London is already a bargain\nfor families with free travel for under 11s and countless free museums and\ngalleries.\n\n     * ianVisits says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 4:16 pm\n\nRemember that the majority of people affected by this will be coming into\nLondon for a day trip, and not staying in hotels etc.\n\n     * ChrisC says:\n\n27 April 2024 at 9:06 pm\n\nA screen on a ticket machine isn\u2019t the place to show long complicated text\nabout all the ins and outs of ticket buying,\n\nIf it did more people would just press the \u201cbuy\u201d button.\n\n     * Paul says:\n\n28 April 2024 at 10:00 am\n\nI hear you Ian, but with the reprieve of the day travelcard I can\u2019t see child\nfares being an issue for the vast majority of day trippers, as they\u2019ll be\ntravelling in and out by train anyway\n\n  8. nick says:\n\n26 April 2024 at 9:37 pm\n\nSo I have a Network Railcard and I stopped using Oyster pay as you go because\nthe Zone 1 to 6 Off peak travel card paper ticket drops to a tenner from the\nusual \u00a315.45 at Southeastern ticket machines.\n\nI wonder if other people have discovered this discount.\n\nReply\n\n     * Sws says:\n\n27 April 2024 at 12:47 am\n\nYou can add your national railcard to an oyster card \u2013 which brings down the\noff peak cap for zone 1-6 to \u00a310.30 \ud83d\ude42\n\n  9. Tony says:\n\n27 April 2024 at 7:54 am\n\nShame there isn\u2019t a special visitors pass for foreign tourists.\n\nI just got back from Tokyo and they do a 72hr metro pass for \u00a51500 (\u00a37.50)\nwhich I think is crazy value and far better than using their Suica/Pasmo\n(Oyster equivalents but they have no daily cap so you\u2019re up on the deal after\na couple of journeys).\n\nReply\n\n     * ChrisC says:\n\n27 April 2024 at 9:09 pm\n\nWhy should there be special prices for tourists?\n\nI\u2019ve been to plenty of places where there aren\u2019t any tourist rates and they\npay the normal price that a local does.\n\n  10.
