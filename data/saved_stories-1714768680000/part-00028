The first one is a release of yet another JavaScript\nframework. The second one is the moment when some core component or tool of\nyour platform becomes obsolete.\n\nIn October 2023, Oracle MySQL version 5.7 long-term support period ended. No\nwonder, taking into account this version was released back in 2015 and 8 years\nof LTS(long-term support) is rather generous. On the Amazon RDS side, this\nperiod was extended until February 2024.\n\nStarting from March 2024, MySQL 5.7 on Amazon RDS falls under the \"Extended\nSupport\" terms. What does it mean for you?\n\n## What is Amazon RDS Extended Support?\n\nIt's a known fact SQL flavors differ between the database vendors. But the\ntruth is, each version of DB/DBMS may have specific tools and language\nfeatures. Those version specifics are not always backward-compatible, meaning\nsimply upgrading the version of the database may break the application or\ncause a data loss without a proper migration. Combined with complex stored\nprocedures, and tools developed around a specific version of the database,\nupgrading a database can become a challenging task.\n\nTo help with this, AWS RDS provides a mechanism called \"AWS RDS Extended\nSupport\" which allows to postpone the automated upgrade of the DB major\nversion up to 3 years from the EOL(end-of-life) date. Of course, such offering\nadds some overhead on the AWS side, including maintenance, security upgrades,\netc. Thus \"AWS RDS Extended Support\" is a paid offering.\n\nIn the normal situation, major upgrades is a normal part of software project\nplanning. So is intentionally not doing an upgrade and using the extended EOL\noffering to postpone the upgrade by agreeing to this particular cost. The\nworst situation is when the upgrading/not upgrading is not a planned decision,\nbut a subject of negligence.\n\n## How much does Amazon RDS Extended Support Cost?\n\nThe best way to estimate the cost of Amazon RDS Extended Support is to use the\nAWS Pricing Calculator. To do so, open the calculator and click the \"Add\nservice\" button:\n\nEnter \"Amazon RDS\" in the search prompt and select the needed product, for\nexample Amazon RDS for MySQL and click \"Configure\":\n\nConfigure your current/desired configuration based on required number of\nnodes, performance and storage size. We'll be using the pre-selected\ndb.m1.large instance with a Multi-AZ deployment. It results in the following\ncalculations:\n\n    \n    \n    1 instance(s) x 0.46 USD hourly x (100 / 100 Utilized/Month) x 730 hours in a month = 335.80\n\nNow let's proceed to the \"Extended Support\" section and check how does using\nan outdated version of the database will affect the billing. With a 720 hours\n/ month of Extended Support for db.m1.large the following calculation will be\napplied:\n\n    \n    \n    1 instances x 2 vCPU x 2 x 720 hours x 0.10 USD = 288.00 USD\n\nIn other words, staying with the outdated version of the database will result\nin 85% price increase for the first two years. Let's check the calculation for\nthe year 3:\n\n    \n    \n    1 instances x 2 vCPU x 2 x 720 hours x 0.20 USD = 576.00 USD\n\nThis means on the third year of the Extended Support, the price increase will\nbe 171%! In a case if this was some \"launch and forget\" tool vs a conscious\ndecision to postpone the upgrade, price increase is dramatic.\n\n## How to prevent surprises with Amazon RDS Extended Support?\n\nFirst of all, be sure not to miss official AWS announcement and AWS account\nnotifications about database version support. Those notifications come well in\nadvance. Additionally, I recommend doing the following:\n\n  1. Once such notification comes in, create a corresponding task in your project management tool and assign it the responsible team member.\n  2. Just in case, create an event with a planned migration start date in your calendar.\n  3. In general, be sure to include planning of upgrades into your project planning and strategic planning events.\n\n## What should you if your Amazon RDS database version will reach the extended\nsupport soon?\n\nTo properly deal with the upcoming EOL of your database engine version\nplanning is the key. First, decide on the planned approach:\n\n  1. Upgrading the application and the database engine version without enrolling into the Amazon RDS Extended Support period.\n  2. Upgrading the application and database engine version during the Amazon RDS Extended Support period.\n  3. Decommissioning of the database\n\nTo properly decide which option to use, first, evaluate the effort required to\nmigrate affected applications to the new database engine version. In a case if\nit's a third-party tool, most likely it's documentation already includes a\nmigration path. In most of the cases, it's a combination of data backup and\ninstalling the next version of the tool. For the code you own, you'll need to\nwork with the team to understand the required migration effort.\n\n## I don't have software engineers in the team. How to upgrade the Amazon RDS\ndatabase and my application?\n\nDon't panic, we are there for you! Feel free to reach out to us and we'll be\nable to help you with the migration. We can have a free discovery session to\nunderstand what's involved in the migration and what would be the best course\nof action.

But such\nsurprises are part of a bigger challenge every software project faces - so\ncalled \"technical debt\". Taking care of the technical debt on the regular\nbasis reduces chances of unpleasant surprises. Sometimes investing time and\nmoney into supporting your product vs investing directly into features end-\ncustomers will use might seem a waste of time.\n\nUnfortunately, it's too easy to miss the difference between the nice-to-have\nimprovement vs a technical issue which can affect the whole system at some\npoint if not handled in time. Always listen to your engineers and do not\nignore the technical debt, it can't disappear and can only grow if not\nhandled!\n\nAgileVision.io \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
