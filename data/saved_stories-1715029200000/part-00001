Things were slightly closer a few months\nago, but the gap has since widened. (We assume these Statcounter figures are\nlegit; the outfit acknowledged on Friday there was a blip in its Google\nnumbers.)\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has struggled to move the needle on Windows 11\nadoption as Windows 10 users look at the flagship OS and its hardware\nrequirements and think... nah.\n\nMicrosoft has not provided any official figures on Windows 11 usage compared\nto its predecessor - we've asked, and will update this article if Redmond\nprovides some. However, it is not hard to imagine some distinctly sweaty palms\nat Microsoft as managers play a game of update chicken with the looming\nWindows 10 end-of-support date of October 14 next year.\n\nStatcounter is a web analytics service, and its tracking code is installed on\nmore than 1.5 million sites. While its figures are unlikely to be as accurate\nas those held within Microsoft's walls, they indicate how things are going.\nAnd they are clearly continuing to not go well in terms of operating system\nadoption.\n\n  * Now all Windows 11 users are getting adverts to 'make the Start menu great again'\n  * Microsoft really does not want Windows 11 running on ancient PCs\n  * Windows users left to fend for themselves after BitLocker patch bungle\n  * Tiny11 Builder trims Windows 11 fat with PowerShell script\n\nWith Microsoft showing no signs of backing down over the Windows 11 hardware\nrequirements or of keeping Windows 10 supported for a little longer, the\nquestion is, what happens next?\n\nThe answer might be the dawn of the AI PC, during which customers decide it is\nworth buying new hardware to access all the machine-learning features that\ncomputer makers fervently hope will shortly be launched in a future Windows\nupdate.\n\nHowever, businesses not caught up in the hype are also all too aware that\nbuying an AI PC is a risky prospect right now. Analysts have warned that a\nkiller AI app that needs exotic local hardware has yet to appear for the\nmajority of users.\n\nThe tragedy of Windows 11 is that there is nothing particularly wrong with the\noperating system at a technical level, assuming you're OK with Microsoft's\napproach to software architecture and deployment. However, unless a user is a\nWindows enthusiast or there is a particular feature that you cannot do\nwithout, there is not much point in investing in new hardware to enjoy a\nslightly more nerfed Start Menu and roundier corners.\n\nUsers with the requisite hardware have probably already upgraded. Users happy\nwith their existing installations have elected to hang fire, a decision\nreflected in Windows 11's inability to make much headway against its\npredecessor. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Windows 11\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Windows 11\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Operating System\n  * Windows\n\n#### More about\n\n16 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Windows 11\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Windows 11\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Operating System\n  * Windows\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Microsoft really does not want Windows 11 running on ancient PCs\n\nEven tighter requirements, so it's time to put old hardware out to pasture...\nor find an alternative OS\n\nOSes13 days | 255\n\n#### Now all Windows 11 users are getting adverts to 'make the Start menu\ngreat again'\n\nAnd you thought the Bing begging was annoying\n\nOSes12 days | 106\n\n#### Tiny11 Builder trims Windows 11 fat with PowerShell script\n\nThe Reg accepts no responsibility for borked installations\n\nOSes14 days | 9\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Microsoft confesses April Windows update breaks some VPN connections\n\nConnection failures reported following installation\n\nOSes5 days | 39\n\n#### Copilot auto-launch bug now takes flight in multiple Windows Insider\nchannels\n\nClippy 2024 is something else\n\nOSes14 days | 11\n\n#### Microsoft lifts years-old compatibility hold for Windows 11\n\nIt probably wasn't only sound driver problems that kept users away\n\nOSes21 days | 13\n\n#### Microsoft to use Windows 11 Start menu as a billboard with app ads for\nInsiders\n\nThis wasn't what most had in mind when Redmond promised to make the feature\n'great again'\n\nOSes21 days | 111\n\n#### Want to keep Windows 10 secure?
