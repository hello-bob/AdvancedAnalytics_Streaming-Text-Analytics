To\nreach the goal of an economical reactor, most tokamak reactor\ndesigns^3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 simultaneously require reaching a plasma line-\naveraged density above an empirical limit\u2014the so-called Greenwald\ndensity^11\u2014and attaining an energy confinement quality better than the\nstandard high-confinement mode^12,13. However, such an operating regime has\nnever been verified in experiments. In addition, a long-standing challenge in\nthe high-confinement mode has been the compatibility between a high-\nperformance core and avoiding large, transient edge perturbations that can\ncause very high heat loads on the plasma-facing-components in tokamaks. Here\nwe report the demonstration of stable tokamak plasmas with a line-averaged\ndensity approximately 20% above the Greenwald density and an energy\nconfinement quality of approximately 50% better than the standard high-\nconfinement mode, which was realized by taking advantage of the enhanced\nsuppression of turbulent transport granted by high density-gradients in the\nhigh-poloidal-beta scenario^14,15. Furthermore, our experimental results show\nan integration of very low edge transient perturbations with the high\nnormalized density and confinement core. The operating regime we report\nsupports some critical requirements in many fusion reactor designs all over\nthe world and opens a potential avenue to an operating point for producing\neconomically attractive fusion energy.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Materials design for hypersonics\n\nArticle Open access 18 April 2024\n\n### Resolved magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing in the solar corona\n\nArticle Open access 16 April 2024\n\n### Rotating curved spacetime signatures from a giant quantum vortex\n\nArticle Open access 20 March 2024\n\n## Main\n\nFusion energy is the ultimate energy source for humanity^16. A promising\napproach is a steady-state fusion reactor using magnetic confinement in the\ntokamak configuration^17,18. With a deeper understanding of tokamak plasma\nphysics and the development of reactor-relevant technologies, many fusion\nreactor designs have been proposed^3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. When the ion temperature\nis above 13 keV (1.5 \u00d7 10^8 K) in D\u2013T fusion reactions, the thermonuclear\npower density^19 P_fus = n_fuel^2\u27e8\u03c3v\u27e9E/4 is proportional to the fuel density\n(n_fuel) squared, as the change of normalized reaction rate \u27e8\u03c3v\u27e9 with\ntemperature is relatively small. Here, E is the fusion energy released per\nreaction. Detailed definitions of all variables mentioned in this paper can be\nfound in Extended Data Table 1. Therefore, to achieve attractive fusion goals,\nmost of the recent fusion pilot plant (FPP) designs require very high plasma\ndensities, higher than the empirical edge density limit known as the Greenwald\ndensity^11 (n_Gr), in tokamak high-confinement mode (H-mode) plasmas^13. The\nenergy confinement quality, represented by the H-factor^20 (for example,\nH_98y2), is believed to be the highest leverage parameter for fusion capital\ncost^8. H_98y2 is usually required to exceed the standard H-mode level (H_98y2\n= 1.0) for good fusion economy. FPP designs^3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 simultaneously\nrequire 1 \u2264 Greenwald fraction (f_Gr) \u2264 1.3 and 1 \u2264 H_98y2 \u2264 1.65. However,\nsuch a tokamak operating regime is an uncharted area that has never been\nverified in experiments.\n\nThe empirical n_Gr is a density limit for the pedestal density in an H-mode\nplasma^21,22. The pedestal is a narrow region of plasma at the edge with\nsuppressed turbulent transport and a steep pressure gradient. When approaching\nn_Gr at the pedestal, various unfavourable phenomena can be observed in\nexperiments. These cause a strong decrease of the confinement quality or even\na sudden, complete loss of plasma energy (disruption)^22. A peaked core\ndensity profile is, therefore, required to achieve a line-averaged density\nabove the pedestal density limit. Possible approaches include relying on the\nnatural peaking at low collisionality^23 and the potential inward particle\npinch^24. The previous DIII-D experiment^24 can achieve a transient f_Gr of\nabout 1.4 with D_2 gas puffing. A large pinch velocity has been measured.\nH_98y2 in this case is around 1. ASDEX Upgrade experiments took a different\napproach by using pellet injection to improve the core fuelling. The\nexperimental results show a transient f_Gr \u2248 1.5 with pellet injection^25,26.\nHowever, the H_98y2 values in those discharges were less than 1. More examples\nwith H_98y2 < 1 at high density are well documented^22. As no tokamak\nexperiment has yet attained a sustained f_Gr above 1 and H_98y2 well above 1\n(for example, 1.5) at the same time, experimentally verifying the desired\noperating regime in FPP designs is a great challenge for the magnetic\nconfinement fusion community.\n\nAnother challenge with H-mode reactor plasmas is the very high transient heat\nload produced by quasi-periodic edge magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities\nknown as type-I edge-localized-modes (ELMs). Without control, ELMs in a\nreactor can severely damage plasma-facing-components, for example, the first\nwall^27,28. ELM control is an active research area and various approaches have\nbeen proposed^29,30,31,32,33. However, compatibility among small/no ELM\nsolutions, high density (above n_Gr) and high confinement quality (H_98y2 well\nabove 1, for example, 1.5) has not been demonstrated in experiments.\n\nWe report a new experimental approach for achieving a line-averaged density\nabove n_Gr. It exploits an operating regime recently established in the DIII-D\ntokamak that allows simultaneous f_Gr > 1.0, H_98y2 \u2248 1.5 and small ELMs and\ncould support many existing designs for future reactors^3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The\napproach elevates the plasma density in the core while keeping the pedestal\nfraction of the Greenwald density at moderate levels (for example, f_Gr,ped \u2248\n0.7), thus not violating the empirical density limit. It does so by exploiting\nself-organized internal transport barriers (ITBs) at large minor radius in the\nhigh poloidal-beta (\u03b2_P) scenario^15,34,35,36. More information about the\nhigh-\u03b2_P research can be found in Methods. In experiments, the on-axis\nfraction of the Greenwald density (f_Gr,0) can reach up to 1.7, resulting in a\nline-averaged f_Gr of 1.3. ITBs in the density and temperature profiles also\ngreatly improve the energy confinement quality (H_98y2 up to 1.8), compared to\nthe standard H mode (H_98y2 = 1) at the same engineering and operating\nparameters.\n\nFigure 1 shows a plot of the DIII-D database and illustrates the progress made\nin extending the plasma operating space towards high f_Gr and high H_98y2. The\n2019 high-\u03b2_P experiments with impurity injection^15 have simultaneously\nachieved f_Gr > 1.0 and H_98y2 > 1.0. However, in these experiments, too much\nimpurity injection also increases the radiative energy loss in the plasma\ncore, limiting H_98y2 at high density. Of the violet diamonds in Fig. 1, some\nhave H_98y2 \u2264 1.2 when f_Gr \u2265 1.15. However, these results are not good enough\nfor FPP designs. A major improvement in the 2022 DIII-D high-\u03b2_P experiment\nused additional D_2 gas puffing (Fig. 2) instead of impurity injection. This\napproach effectively reduces the core radiation and improves H_98y2, as shown\nin Fig. 1 (blue squares). Thus, this paper reports a clear experimental\ndemonstration of an accessible operating point in an existing tokamak that can\nmeet a few of the FPP requirements, including simultaneous f_Gr > 1 and H_98y2\n\u2248 1.5. For comparison, other scenarios presented run on DIII-D have not\nachieved such simultaneous normalized performance (yellow circles).\n\nFig. 1: Database of H_98y2 and f_Gr for DIII-D discharges.\n\nMore than 3,600 discharges are included.

The\nstriking feature in this discharge is the dynamic synergy between energy\nconfinement quality and plasma density. That is, H_98y2 increased along with\nf_Gr (Fig. 2a) until the ramping down of the heating power (Extended Data Fig.\n1e). This is opposite to the common observation of reduced energy confinement\nquality in higher density H modes^22, especially for experiments close to the\nGreenwald density. The plasma was maintained at f_Gr > 1.0 and H_98y2 > 1.0\nfor about 2.2 s, which was 2.2 times the current diffusion time (\u03c4_R) or 24\ntimes the energy confinement time (\u03c4_E). Thus, the high normalized density and\nconfinement phase was not transient, which is imperative for application in\nfuture long-pulse FPPs. A normalized plasma pressure \u03b2_N \u2248 3.5 and \u03b2_P \u2248 2.9\nwas achieved at safety factor q_95 \u2248 8.5 (Fig. 2b) with plasma current I_p =\n0.73 MA and toroidal magnetic field B_T = 1.89 T, and with mixed co- and\ncounter-I_p neutral beam injection (NBI). Note that n_Gr = 6.7 \u00d7 10^19 m^\u22123 in\nthis discharge, close to the Greenwald density of the ITER 9 MA steady-state\nscenario at 7.2 \u00d7 10^19 m^\u22123. The dedicated D_2 gas puffing time trace is\nshown in vermillion in Fig. 2c. This approach ensures that there is a\nsufficient source of particles in the plasma, and it pushes the plasma density\nto a higher level, regardless of the change in the feedback gas (black line in\nFig. 2c).\n\nProfiles of the temperature and density for electrons, deuterium (main ion)\nand carbon (main impurity) are shown in Fig. 2f\u2013i and Extended Data Fig. 2a.\nThe evolution of the on-axis densities for electrons, deuterium and carbon is\ndisplayed in Extended Data Fig. 1c. One can see that ITBs developed in all\ndensity channels. The increased deuterium density in this experiment suggests\nthe promising application of this scenario in future FPPs, as it can attain a\nhigher fuel density to give a higher fusion power. A related piece of\nexperimental evidence is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d. It is clear that with\nincreased plasma density and energy confinement, the neutron rate, an\nindicator of fusion performance, increased substantially (67% higher, from 0.6\n\u00d7 10^15 to 1.0 \u00d7 10^15 s^\u22121) from 2 to 4.8 s, whereas the injected power (blue\nline in Extended Data Fig. 1e) was almost constant. Moreover, a very mild\nincrease of the radiated power was observed in the very-high-density phase of\nthe experiment (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The core radiated power as a fraction\nof the injected power increased from 10% to 20% as f_Gr increased from 0.7 to\n1.1. The edge radiation remained about 25% of the injected power. Note that\nfor either Bremsstrahlung radiation or impurity line emission, the radiated\npower was roughly proportional to the electron density squared. Therefore,\nsome increase in the radiated power was expected even with the same impurity\nlevel, when the plasma density was increased significantly. Regarding the\nimpurity behaviour, one can see a well-developed ITB at large radius in the\ncarbon density profiles (Fig. 2i). Despite the ITB at large radius, the carbon\ndensity inside the ITB did not have a significant central peak, which would\nusually cause a large amount of core radiation and a reduction of core\nperformance. The ratio between carbon density and electron density stayed\naround 4\u20135% during the evolution (Extended Data Fig. 2b). This is consistent\nwith the well-controlled radiated power in the phase with f_Gr > 1.0.\n\nThe evolution of the safety factor profile (q-profile) is shown in Extended\nData Fig. 2c. The figure shows the self-organized q-profile evolution, which\nreflects the change of the local bootstrap current density associated with the\ndevelopment of a large-radius ITB. The local minimum q (q_min) in the outer\nhalf of the plasma was at \u03c1 \u2248 0.6 for around 2\u03c4_R. q_min in this discharge\nstayed above 2.\n\nWhen a density ITB built up over time and was sustained, the total pedestal\npressure at \u03c1 = 0.88 did not change significantly (Fig. 2d). However, other\npedestal parameters and the ELM behaviour changed. At f_Gr < 0.8, typical\nstandard H-mode pressure profiles and typical large type-I ELMs were observed\n(Fig. 2j,m). At 0.8 \u2264 f_Gr < 1.0, pressure profiles with an ITB and compound\nELMs emerged (Fig. 2k,n). Finally, pressure profiles with a large ITB and\nsmall ELMs dominated the f_Gr \u2265 1.0 phase (Fig. 2l,o). During the evolution, a\ndecreased peak pedestal electron density (n_e,ped) gradient, increased\nseparatrix electron density (n_e,sep) and decreased ratio between n_e,ped and\nn_e,sep were observed, as shown in Fig. 2d,e. These parameter evolutions are\nconsistent with the favourable conditions needed to access the small-ELM\nregime discussed in the literature^29. A more detailed modelling analysis of\nthe pedestal for different ELM behaviours will be discussed later in this\npaper.\n\nAlthough addressing the transient heat load is crucial, mitigating the\nstationary heat load is equally important for an FPP. Divertor detachment is\nwidely considered to be a necessary solution for realizing an acceptable\nstationary heat load in the operation of future FPPs. Even without detachment-\noriented impurity seeding, Extended Data Fig. 3 shows that the electron\ntemperature at the divertor plates (T_e,div) clearly reduced from over 35 eV\n(before 1.8 s) to 20\u201325 eV (1.8\u20132.8 s) and finally to 10\u201315 eV (after 2.8 s)\nin the f_Gr > 1.0 and H_98y2 \u2248 1.5 phase, and there were small ELMs. The\nlowest T_e,div phase is consistent with the existence of an ITB at large\nradius. Although T_e,div \u2264 15 eV is not yet considered as divertor detachment\n(usually T_e,div < 10 eV), it already suggests that there would be mitigation\nof tungsten erosion under the experimental stationary heat load, if a tungsten\nwall had been used. Note that although the integration of full divertor\ndetachment and high-confinement core has been achieved in previous DIII-D\nhigh-\u03b2_P experiments and reported^15,37, the experimental approach and the\noperating parameter space were both different. The previous results used\nimpurity seeding and f_Gr \u2248 0.9, which are not sufficient for FPP designs.\n\nTherefore, the analysed typical DIII-D high-\u03b2_P discharge has demonstrated a\nsustained, accessible operating point in a present tokamak that integrates\nhigh normalized density and confinement quality, small ELMs and reduced\ndivertor electron temperature, thus addressing the key requirements of FPP\ndesigns for simultaneous high-performance core and excellent core-edge\nintegration.\n\nTo understand the physics that enables high confinement quality at high\nnormalized density, we performed a gyro-fluid transport analysis using the\nTGLF code^38 on the experimental data from the discharge shown in Fig. 2.\nFigure 3a,b shows the dependence of the normalized electron turbulent heat\nflux Q_e/Q_GB (where Q_GB is the Gryo-Bohm heat flux) on the fractional\ncontribution of the density gradient to the pressure gradient (F_p = T\u2207n/\u2207p)\nat mid-minor radius in the plasma. The gyro-fluid modelling indicates that\nwhen using either numerical approach to vary F_p (constant \u2207T or constant \u2207p),\nthe decreasing trend of Q_e for increasing F_p is robust. A similar result was\nobtained for the ion energy transport. These results reveal an important\nfeature in the high-\u03b2_P scenario, namely that anomalous turbulent transport,\nwhich leads to poor global confinement, can be reduced with a high density\ngradient, that is, a high density in the core with the pedestal density\nmaintained below n_Gr. This is consistent with the experimental observation of\nsynergy between high confinement quality and high density. If F_p were\nincreased by 30%, the normalized Q_e would decrease by a factor of 2 compared\nwith the prediction at the experimental value, when the normalized pressure\ngradient \u03b1_MHD (approximately \u2212q^2/B_T,unit^2Rdp/dr) was moderate (1.13), as\nshown in Fig. 3a. However, the reduction of the transport can be 2\u20133 orders of\nmagnitude stronger when \u03b1_MHD is high (2.75) in the experimental equilibrium\n(Fig. 3b). Note that this finding is also consistent with the previous\nnonlinear gyro-kinetic theoretical modelling^39, which found an extreme\nreduction in the transport coefficient when high \u03b1_MHD was combined with\nmoderate density gradients. The underlying physics includes 1) the low drive\nof the ion-temperature-gradient turbulence at high density gradient (that is,\nthere is a low ratio between the density gradient scale length and the ion\ntemperature scale length (\u03b7_i)), and 2) less effective coupling between\ntrapped electrons and the trapped-electron-mode turbulence owing to the much\nnarrower turbulence eigenfunction at high \u03b1_MHD.\n\nFig. 3: Transport modelling of the dependence of normalized electron turbulent\nheat flux on the normalized electron density gradient.\n\na, Moderate \u03b1_MHD case from the high-\u03b2_P discharge in Fig. 2.

The\nexperimental data point from the low-q_95 discharge is indicated by a blue\nstar in e.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe also applied the same gyro-fluid transport analysis to a standard H-mode\ndischarge to reveal the requirement for realizing the favourable conditions\nfor low transport at high density. A low-q_95 standard H-mode discharge\n(DIII-D 187019) with strong D_2 gas puffing and high density was investigated.\nCompared with the high-\u03b2_P discharge discussed above, this discharge had the\nsame heating power (9 MW), comparable line-averaged density (5.0\u20136.5 \u00d7 10^19\nm^\u22123), slightly lower \u03b2_N (approximately 2.5), but much lower q_95 (4 versus\n8.5). This was because of a much higher I_p (1.3 versus 0.73 MA). Typical\nstandard H-mode profiles are shown in Fig. 3c,d, which are different from the\nITB profiles in Fig. 2. Figure 3e presents the transport analysis of a two-\ndimensional scan on F_p and local q at \u03c1 = 0.65. The modelling uses the\nexperimental \u03b2_e value. As illustrated by the horizontal dashed lines, the\nfigure can be roughly divided into three regimes. At low local q, such as for\nthe standard H-mode experimental data point, the modelling predicts high\nturbulent transport at high F_p. This is consistent with the experimental\nobservation of decreased H_98y2 at high density in this discharge. At medium\nq, transport is predicted to be almost independent of F_p. Finally, low\ntransport at high F_p can be found in the high-q regime (top right corner of\nthis figure highlighted by the blue dashed line). This example suggests that a\nminimum of the local q \u2248 4.4 is required to access this regime. Note that the\nanalysed high-\u03b2_P case has local q \u2248 5.1. However, high local q alone is\ninsufficient to access this regime. Figure 3f indicates the importance of\nsufficient \u03b2_e, or the plasma pressure (\u03b2). Note that \u03b2 changes accordingly in\nthe modelling when scanning \u03b2_e. The range of the two-dimensional scan is the\nsame. However, this scan uses half of the experimental \u03b2_e in the modelling.\nAs one can see, the results are significantly different. For most of the q\nvalues in the scan, high turbulent transport at high F_p is predicted. The\nfavourable low transport at high F_p may still exist but probably requires\nvery high local q, which is less realistic in present tokamak experiments or\nfuture machine designs.\n\nIn summary, the transport analysis suggests that the standard H-mode could\naccess the favourable low-transport regime at high density, with the following\nnecessary conditions: high local q and high plasma pressure \u03b2, which are two\nkey components in the expression of \u03b1_MHD. Thus, sufficient \u03b1_MHD is essential\nfor realizing the favourable operating regime. As summarized in the\nliterature^15,37,40, \u03b1-stabilization is considered as the primary turbulence\nsuppression physics in the high-\u03b2_P scenario, as it provides a reactor-\nrelevant rotation-independent mechanism for high confinement^40. On the other\nhand, given that \u03b2_P \u221d \u03b2_Nq_95, high q_95 and high \u03b2_N lead to high \u03b2_P.\nTherefore, the high-\u03b2_P scenario is naturally an excellent candidate for\npursing this goal.\n\nWe performed a pedestal analysis to evaluate the pedestal stability and\nunderstand the evolution of the ELM behaviour in the high-\u03b2_P discharge\ndescribed in Fig. 2. The ELITE calculations^41 shown in Fig. 4a predict the\nstability boundary for peeling\u2013ballooning modes in the pedestal, for each of\nthe three ELM states. In the type-I ELM state, the pedestal lies near the\nunstable ballooning region. Evolving to the small-ELM state, the experimental\npoint moves along the ballooning boundary towards a lower pedestal pressure\ngradient and lower pedestal current density. Moving further away from the\npeeling boundary is consistent with the observation of no giant ELMs in the\nlater phase. Modelling with BOUT++ (refs. ^42,43,44) provides details on the\ninstability growth rate in Fig. 4b. The dominant low-n peeling\u2013ballooning mode\nwas identified at n \u2248 10, which agrees with the ELITE result. The predicted\nlow-n growth rate is smallest for small ELMs. BOUT++ modelling also resolves\nhigh-n resistive ballooning modes near the separatrix, when considering the\nplasma resistivity. It is clear that the high-n separatrix modes are dominant\nin the small-ELM case in contrast to other results in Fig. 4b. The modelling\nsuggests that the high-n separatrix modes played an essential role in the\nobservation of small ELMs in high-\u03b2_P plasmas.\n\nFig. 4: Pedestal modelling of the three types of ELM behaviours in DIII-D\n190904.\n\na,b, Results for the type-I ELM in blue, the compound ELM in green and the\nsmall ELM in violet. a, Pedestal stability versus normalized pedestal current\ndensity (y axis) and normalized pressure gradient at the pedestal peak\ngradient location (x axis). j_max, j_sep and \u27e8j\u27e9 are the maximum pedestal\ncurrent density, the current density at the separatrix and the average current\ndensity in the pedestal region, respectively.

Experimental points are indicated as open squares with error\nbars. b, Linear mode growth rate (normalized by Alfv\u00e9n frequency, \u03c9_A) at\ndifferent toroidal mode numbers.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn this paper, we have extended the operating space of a tokamak plasma\ntowards a regime with simultaneous f_Gr up to 1.25 and H_98y2 \u2248 1.3\u20131.8, using\nthe high-\u03b2_P scenario in DIII-D. The achievement of entering this previously\nuncharted regime provides essential support to many attractive FPP designs all\nover the world. The increased deuterium density and neutron rate in the\nexperiment confirm the promising application of this scenario for higher\nfusion performance in future FPPs. Unlike many previous high-density H-mode\nexperiments, the high-\u03b2_P scenario uniquely features a synergy between high\nconfinement quality and high density, especially around the Greenwald value.\nWe have also elucidated the important role of \u03b1-stabilization in this\nachievement, showing that the favourable regime of low turbulent transport at\nhigh density is predicted and achieved only at relatively high local q and\nhigh \u03b2, namely for sufficient \u03b1_MHD at high \u03b2_P. This successful experiment\nnot only addresses a few of the key requirements on FPP core plasma parameters\nbut also suggests a potential solution for core-edge integration by\ndemonstrating sustained small ELMs together with f_Gr > 1.0 and H_98y2 > 1.0.\nRealizing the small-ELM regime is understood as a combination of the reduced\ngrowth rate of low-n modes and the predominance of the high-n resistive\nballooning mode near the separatrix because of the decreased peak density\ngradient in the pedestal, increased separatrix density and high \u03b2_P. During\nthe natural small-ELM phase with a high normalized density and confinement,\nthe plasma is close to divertor detachment, which is believed to be the most\npromising solution for achieving steady-state plasma\u2013wall-interactions in\nFPPs^37,45. The natural proximity of detachment conditions shows the potential\nof a fully integrated scenario with high-performance core and cool edge. As\nthe divertor detachment was not optimized in the discussed experiment, doing\nso will be important work for future experiments. Note that the compatibility\nof the high-\u03b2_P scenario with full divertor detachment has been\ndemonstrated^37. So far, neither a significant central peak in the density\nprofile of the impurity (carbon) nor a significant increase in the core\nradiated power has been observed when the density is above the Greenwald\nvalue. Dedicated impurity transport experiments and modelling work are also\nunder consideration for this operating regime. Fast-particle confinement is\nimportant for future FPPs. Experiments on the high-\u03b2_P scenario in DIII-D\nusually exhibit classical fast-ion transport. More discussion of previous\nresults is presented in \u2018DIII-D high-\u03b2_P experiments\u2019 (Methods).\n\nWe fully appreciate that further work is needed to address other critical\nissues related to FPP compatibility, for example, operating with a metal wall\nand helium exhaust. On DIII-D, limited experiments with high-\u03b2_P plasmas\noperating with a divertor strike point on a (temporary) ring of tungsten tiles\nhave shown promising results, with no significant degradation of core\nperformance. However, to fully address the compatibility with a metal wall, we\nare collaborating closely with the Experimental Advanced Superconducting\nTokamak (EAST) and Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research programme\nin the development of high-\u03b2_P scenarios so that we can exploit their metal\nwall and long-pulse operation capabilities. Long-pulse operation (over 10 s)\nwill further address the alignment for steady-state q-profiles and pressure\nprofiles with ITB in the high-\u03b2_P scenario. With regard to the helium exhaust,\nseveral review papers give favourable conclusions for high-\u03b2_P plasmas with\nITBs in JT-60U^46,47. The results for JT-60U high-\u03b2_P ITB plasmas show that\nthe helium density in the core was controlled well and that no helium\naccumulation was observed, even with helium NBI for the core helium source.\nMoreover, the results also emphasize the importance of helium exhaust\ntechniques, such as pumping, for controlling the helium content in the core.\n\nFurthermore, there has been recent activity on extending the high-\u03b2_P scenario\ntowards true long-pulse operation, including modelling work for EAST^48,\nITER^49,50 and FPPs under design^10. Depending on the design philosophy of\neach group, the high-\u03b2_P scenario can be applied in a wide range of FPP\ndesigns, from large conventional tokamaks^14 to relatively small and compact\ndevices^9,10. One example from CAT-DEMO (Case D)^9 shows a possible design\npoint of an FPP using the high-\u03b2_P scenario: R = 4 m, R/a = 3.1, B_T = 7 T,\nI_p = 8.1 MA, q_95 = 6.5, f_Gr = 1.3, f_Gr,ped = 1.0, \u03b2_N = 3.6, H_98y2 =\n1.51, fusion gain Q = 17.3 and output electric power 200 MWe. The experimental\nachievement and the increased understanding reported in this paper may open a\npotential avenue to an operating point for producing economically attractive\nfusion energy.\n\n## Methods\n\n### DIII-D tokamak\n\nThe DIII-D National Fusion Facility^51 is a tokamak research device operated\nby General Atomic in San Diego, California, for the US Department of Energy.\nDIII-D is the largest magnetic fusion research facility in the USA. The DIII-D\nprogramme is focused on establishing the scientific basis for the optimization\nof the tokamak approach to fusion energy production, in part through the\ndevelopment of advanced steady-state operating scenarios. The major and minor\nradii of DIII-D are 1.66 and 0.67 m, respectively. The toroidal field is up to\n2.2 T at the magnetic axis, and the plasma current is up to 2 MA. DIII-D has\nfour high-power NBI systems with a total power of up to 20 MW. Unique features\nof the DIII-D NBI systems include: (1) two horizontally rotatable beamlines,\nproviding a capability for switching the off-magnetic axis neutral beam\ncurrent drive from the co plasma-current direction to the counter plasma-\ncurrent direction and (2) two vertically movable beamlines that enable the\nselection of on- or off-magnetic axis plasma heating and current drive in the\nexperiment. DIII-D has six operational gyrotrons for heating the electron\ncyclotron and driving the current in the plasma. Each gyrotron is designed for\n1 MW continuous-wave operation for several seconds at a central frequency of\n110 GHz. Steerable antennas offer flexible heating and current drive methods\nin the plasma, including mid-plane launchers and top launchers. DIII-D is also\ndeveloping a helicon system and a lower-hybrid wave system for additional\nradio-frequency heating and current drive capabilities. The extensive\ndiagnostic set and the sophisticated plasma control system support various\nplasma experiments on DIII-D.\n\n### DIII-D high-\u03b2 _P experiments\n\nMany international tokamaks have investigated high-\u03b2_P\nscenarios^34,35,52,53,54,55,56,57 ever since these scenarios were first\nproposed^14 in 1990. High-\u03b2_P experiments were explored by DIII-D^58 in the\n2000s and have been extensively investigated since 2013 by the joint\nDIII-D/EAST research team^15. An ITB at large minor radius is the signature of\nthe high-\u03b2_P scenario in DIII-D. The latest physical understanding for\ndeveloping such an ITB is through the reduced magnetic shear and sufficient\n\u03b1-stabilization effect^40,59 (magnitude of \u03b1_MHD). As \u03b1_MHD \u221d q^2 \u221d I_p^\u22122, a\nrelatively low plasma current and a broader current-density profile (having a\nhigher q value and reduced magnetic shear at large radius) are beneficial for\nrealizing ITB. DIII-D high-\u03b2_P experiments usually begin with a lower I_p flat\ntop, aiming at q_95 \u2248 10 in the first phase of the discharge. An I_p ramp-up\nor B_T ramp-down can be used in the later phase of the discharge to reduce the\nexperimental q_95 to a desired level, for example, 6\u20138. Edge perturbations,\nsuch as ELMs, active gas puffing and impurity injection have experimentally\nbeen found to trigger the formation of an ITB by creating a \u2018low-(magnetic)\nshear detour\u2019 at large radius, which gives access to the second stability\nregime. Experimentally, it has been found that an empirical \u03b2_P threshold of\nbetween 1.7 and 1.9 in DIII-D can sustain a strong ITB at large radius^15.\nRegarding the plasma shape and configuration, a double-null configuration and\nan inverted ITER-similar true single-null shape have been successfully tested\nin experiments. Despite the high q_min (over 2) in experiments, the high-\u03b2_P\nscenario exhibits good fast-ion confinement, which is usually found to be\nclassical. The present understanding^60,61 indicates that: (1) The high-\u03b2_P\nplasmas have a shorter slowing-down time (because of the high density) and\nlower \u2207\u03b2_fast, where \u03b2_fast is the ratio of volume-averaged fast-ion pressure\nto the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field, which reduces the drive for\nAlfv\u00e9nic modes. (2) The reverse-shear Alfv\u00e9n eigenmodes are weaker or stable\nbecause the negative magnetic shear region is at higher radius, away from the\npeak of the fast-ion profile. Additionally, independent modelling of a high\nq_min (over 2) ITER 8 MA steady-state scenario (not the high-\u03b2_P scenario)\nfound that there was negligible fast-ion loss because of a mismatch between\nthe loss boundaries and the locations of the Alfv\u00e9n eigenmodes^62. A more\ndetailed description of experimental waveform designs and a comprehensive\nreview of the high-\u03b2_P scenario development on DIII-D in the last decade can\nbe found in a review paper^15.\n\n### Diagnostics for profiles\n\nA multi-pulsed high-resolution Thomson scattering system^63,64 was used to\nmeasure the core electron density and temperature in the DIII-D experiments.\nThe ion temperature and the carbon density profiles were measured by a charge-\nexchange recombination spectroscopy system for C^6+ particles^65. The\nmeasurements were arranged radially on the low-field side.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nOur statistical analysis used experimental data from DIII-D discharges during\n2019\u20132022. We recorded data pairs of (f_Gr, H_98y2) from two time slices for\neach discharge: (1) the highest H_98y2 and the corresponding f_Gr at the same\ntime and (2) the highest f_Gr and the corresponding H_98y2 at the same time,\nunless the two time slices were the same. Several filters were applied: I_p \u2265\n0.55 MA, dI_p/dt < 0.5 MA s^\u22121, P_tot \u2265 5 MW, W \u2265 500 kJ and (dW/dt)/P_tot \u2264\n0.1. Here, W is the total energy stored by the plasma and P_tot is the total\nheating power. A smoothing window of 40 ms was applied. The minimum and\nmaximum H_98y2 values were truncated at 0.5 and 2.5, respectively. More than\n3,600 discharges from 2019\u20132022 were used in the analysis.\n\n### Reconstruction of the kinetic equilibria\n\nA multi-step workflow was used to add constraints on the pressure and plasma-\ncurrent density in the equilibrium reconstruction to improve the accuracy of\nthe reconstructed equilibrium. The workflow (for one iteration) has three\nparts: fitting the profile based on the existing equilibrium, calculating the\npower balance for the total pressure and plasma-current components, and\nreconstructing the equilibrium with pressure and current-density constraints.\nUsually, two or three iterations would be sufficient to produce high-quality\nequilibria for the transport study. When performing power balance calculation,\nNUBEAM^66 was used for the NBI-driven current and fast-ion pressure\ncalculation, and the Sauter model^67 was used for the bootstrap current\ncalculation. ONETWO^68 was used to create the total pressure by combining the\nthermal pressure and fast-ion pressure and to provide the total plasma-current\ndensity by considering the external driven current, the bootstrap current and\nthe calculated Ohmic current and by solving the poloidal field diffusion. The\nequilibrium was reconstructed with the EFIT code^69.\n\n### Gyro-fluid transport modelling\n\nThe TGLF code^38 was used to calculate the turbulent heat fluxes in the high-\n\u03b2_P case and the low-q_95 H-mode case. This modelling used a more recent\nsaturation rule, SAT2 (ref. ^70). Electromagnetic effects were included. The\nmodelling took an experimental kinetic equilibrium from one time slice and\nfocused on one radial location, for example, \u03c1 = 0.65. The turbulent heat\nfluxes were predicted based on the local parameters of the selected time and\nradial location by taking contributions from several turbulent modes (low k\nand high k) into account. Quasi-neutrality was maintained when scanning the\nlocal density gradient F_p, meaning that the density gradients for all species\nchanged accordingly. When scanning the local q, other quantities that are not\nindependent of q were scanned accordingly. When scanning \u03b2_e, the entire\nplasma \u03b2 was changed accordingly, as T_i/T_e and n_i/n_e were fixed in the\nmodelling.\n\n### Pedestal modelling\n\nThe ELITE code^41 was used to calculate the growth rate of the\npeeling\u2013ballooning mode instability, which is believed to limit the achievable\npedestal height by triggering ELMs when the plasma crosses the instability\nboundary. ELITE uses reconstructed equilibria with pressure and current\nconstraints (kinetic equilibria) as input. On the basis of the input, a set of\nequilibria were generated by independently varying the edge pressure and\ncurrent in a separate ELITE calculation to obtain the peeling\u2013ballooning\nboundary.\n\nThe reduced three-field fluid module under the BOUT++ framework^42,43,44 was\nused to simulate the edge modes. The simulation evolved several physics\nparameters: perturbed pressure, magnetic flux and vorticity. The three-field\nmodule included not only basic peeling\u2013ballooning physics but also non-ideal\neffects, such as ion diamagnetic drift, E \u00d7 B drift, resistivity and so on.\nThe simulation domain in the normalized poloidal flux was 0.80 < \u03c8_N < 1.05\nand the grid resolution was n_\u03c8 = 512 and n_y = 64. The kinetic equilibria\nwere used as input. The Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm resistivity \u03b7_Sp was used by considering\nrealistic plasma kinetic profiles. The hyper-resistivity was taken as a\nconstant value \u03b7_H = 10^\u221216 in the generalized Ohm\u2019s law for current\ndiffusion. The radial electric field (E_r) profile calculated from the ion\nmomentum balance equation was used in the simulation.\n\n## Data availability\n\nRaw data were generated by the DIII-D team.
