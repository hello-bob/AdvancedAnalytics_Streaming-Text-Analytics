Such images were also easier for participants to recall the next day.\n\nProf Martin Wiener, co-author of the study who is based at George Mason\nUniversity in the US, said the findings could help develop improve artificial\nintelligence that interacts with humans, while they also offer opportunities\nto tweak our perceptions, given research has previously shown non-invasive\nbrain stimulation can be used to lengthen a perceived interval.\n\n\u201cOne idea could be, well, if we can lengthen a perceived interval while\nshowing an image to a person, that image may be remembered better 24 hours\nlater,\u201d Wiener said.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, Wiener and colleagues described\nhow they showed scenes of six different sizes and six different levels of\nclutter to participants for between 300 and 900 ms, and asked them to indicate\nif they thought the duration was long or short.\n\nThe results from two groups, totalling about 100 people, revealed participants\nwere more likely to think they had been looking at small, highly cluttered\nscenes \u2013 such a crammed pantry \u2013 for a shorter duration than was the case,\nwhereas the reverse occurred when people viewed large scenes with little\nclutter, such as the interior of an aircraft hangar.\n\nThe team also carried out experiments involving 69 participants that found\nimages known from previous work to be more memorable were more likely to be\njudged as having been shown for longer than was the case.\n\nCrucially, the effect seemed to go both ways.\n\n\u201cWe also found that the longer the perceived subjective duration of an image,\nthe more likely you were to remember it the next day,\u201d said Wiener.\n\nWhen the team carried out an analysis using deep learning models of the visual\nsystem, they discovered more memorable images were processed faster. What\u2019s\nmore, the processing speed for an image was correlated with how long\nparticipants thought they had been looking at it.\n\n\u201cImages may be more memorable because they are processed faster and more\nefficiently in the visual system, and that drives the perception of time,\u201d\nsaid Wiener.\n\nThe team suggest time dilation might serve a purpose, enabling us to gather\ninformation about the world around us.\n\n\u201cWhen we see things that are more important or relevant, like things that are\nmore memorable, we dilate our sense of time in order to get more information,\u201d\nWiener said.\n\nHowever, he noted the work does not rule out the possibility that the brain\nalso has an internal clock to keep track of time, which would explain how\ndifferent aspects of an experience can be perceived in synchrony.\n\nWiener also said the memory findings had broader implications.\n\n\u201cWhat it suggests is that if we want time to feel like things are [taking]\nlonger, we need to seek out things that are themselves more memorable. And by\nthat I mean things that are novel and interesting and new to us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is why a vacation can seem to last much longer than, say, the equivalent\namount of time during your daily routines.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Memory\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
