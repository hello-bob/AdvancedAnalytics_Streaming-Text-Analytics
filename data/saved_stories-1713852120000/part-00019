Launching Your Game\nSteamHumble BundleGame JoltItch.io\n\n## Live Twitch DevStream\n\n# Who are you?\n\nMy name is Jason Thor Hall but I just go by my middle name of Thor. I started\nin the games industry in 2004 on World of Warcraft Vanilla. I've worked for\nBlizzard Entertainment, Amazon Games Studios, the United States Department of\nEnergy, and now Pirate Software. I've got three black badges from DEFCON, two\nfor cryptography, and one for telephreaking. I'm a programmer, hacker, game\ndeveloper, and all around giant nerd.\n\nI left all of that behind and started my studio Pirate Software in 2017 and I\nhaven't looked back since. As the studio head I wear a lot of hats. I'm the\nprogrammer, writer, designer, game director, social media manager, and tons of\nother jobs. I feel extremely confident in running my studio and in how far\nwe've come and how everything has turned out. Any decision that I ever make is\nbased on analytics and research.\n\nRight now we are working on an RPG called Heartbound. It's an adventure that\nfocuses heavily on player choice and I stream all of the development live\nevery day on Twitch. Heartbound made it through Steam Greenlight in 11 days as\nthe top voted submission across the entire platform. We then ran a successful\nKickstarter campaign that hit 385% of its funding goal. At the time of this\nwriting Heartbound is in Early Access on Steam and voted 97% positive out of\n1,213 reviews. It's been translated into six languages and is really well\nliked all over the world.\n\nListed below are all of the bits of advice that I have for anyone wanting to\nget into making games. Understand that this line of work is not for everyone.\nIt's not easy. It can be boring at times. It can be soul crushing at times.\nJust like any other job. That being said it can also be the most fulfilling\nthing you've ever done in your life. There is nothing that compares to someone\nplaying your creation and enjoying it.\n\n# What skills do I need?\n\nWhat if I told you that you didn't need any? Well guess what. You don't. We\nlive in a time where you can learn anything you need to make a game with\nrelative ease. Despite what you may think none of that comes from natural\ntalent. We all just pour our hours into getting better at what we do. You can\ndo the same. Below you will find some examples of games that are already out\nthere that help reinforce this.\n\n### You don't need to be an amazing artist.\n\nThomas Was Alone is made of rectangles. All of it. Even the particles. It will\nalso make you cry. Thomas Was Alone is a masterclass in minimalist art and\nfantastic voice over. You can make simple shapes. You can learn to make\nparticles out of simple shapes. You can create a shell of a game that\naccomplishes the same basic goals as Thomas Was Alone. You can make a game.\n\nSuits A Business RPG was made with incredibly simplistic pixel art and drawn\npencil images that are scanned into a computer. It's entirely unique and\nincredible. This shows that you can really break out of standard game visuals\nand still succeed. You can draw doodles on paper. You can make a game.\n\nWest of Loathing is the glorious successor to Kingdom of Loathing. It's also\nentirely stick figures and insane humor. The cartoony simplistic figures\nreally help lean in to the rest of the story and jokes in a way that makes it\nall even funnier. You can make a stick man. You can make a game.\n\nNepenthe takes a similar route as Suits A Business RPG. It was made entirely\nin colored pencil, scanned into a computer, and used as tiles and assets. The\neffect ends up making a really unique and surreal adventure. You can draw\ndoodles on paper. You can make a game.\n\n### You don't need to be an amazing musician.\n\nHidden Folks is effectively an evolution on Where's Waldo and while it's\nsimple in concept it's super well executed. The wild thing that sets it apart\nis the audio. Everything... and I do mean everything, is mouth sounds. All of\nthe music, the effects, all of it was made with someones face. It's\nincredible. You have a face. You can make a game.\n\n### You don't need to be an amazing programmer.\n\nYes, that's right. Undertale is a damn incredible game. It has a unique combat\nstyle, great story, the puzzles are ok, and the dad jokes are plentiful. Toby\nFox was a much more novice programmer at the time and the code base has some\nincredibly odd choices throughout it. Does it matter? Is the game less fun?\nProtip: It doesn't matter. You can learn programming as you go. You can make a\ngame.\n\n# What kind of game should I make?\n\nEveryone wants to make the biggest most impressive game they've ever seen at\nfirst. They want to show it off for clout and admiration from others. They\nwant to make something worthy of praise. Many of us want to make our dream\ngame right off the bat and just amaze everyone with how awesome we are. Don't.\nDon't make that game as your first game.\n\nIf you make your dream game it's the same as fighting the final boss at level\none. You need to build up a little bit of know-how by grinding lower level\nmobs first. You need to learn what kind of developer you are. You need to\nlearn what kinds of games you like making not just the ones you like playing.\nYou need to find your style and form your niche in the world of game\ndevelopment. We all have a voice and making something small helps you find\nyours.\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to go sadly run yourself through tutorials or miles\nof projects that will never see the light of day. It means you should develop\nsomething small with the intention of releasing it and getting feedback so you\ncan level up. Play dungeons and dragons and DM a few games with a custom world\nyou built. Make an arcade game, launch it, and get feedback from people. Join\na bunch of Game Jams and feel out how you like working with others or what\nworks best for a team. Grow yourself so you can make great games.\n\nOne of the best ways to start this process is by building a Game Design\nDocument. This is a living document to help you organize your entire project\nand stay in scope. It also lets you investigate different engines or languages\nthat may work with the kind of game you're making before you commit. Overall a\nGDD saves you time and money and is always beneficial.\n\nEven with all of my prior experience I had no idea what I was doing when I\nwent indie at first. I had never launched a game outside of a triple A studio.\nI had never launched a demo or built a community. We used our first game\nChampions of Breakfast to do that. We went through Steam Greenlight, made all\nthe icons, learned how to build achievements, Steam trading cards, made a\nDiscord, made a Twitter, reached out to streamers, and everything else that a\nstudio needs to know.\n\nOur little game didn't do very well but it taught us everything we needed to\nknow to make Heartbound succeed. Champions of Breakfast was made in twenty\nfour days from concept to release on Steam and it is by far the most important\nstep we ever took as a studio.\n\n# How do I build a team?\n\nIn todays world this is a lot easier than you think. We actually run four game\njams a year over on our Discord servers specifically to help people get\ncomfortable with making games together. Join game jams there or on Itch.io.\nYou can find HUNDREDS of game jams there and really mingle with a bunch of\npeople out there. The more you do this the more confident you will be in your\nabilities and the more you will learn what you are looking for in a team.\n\nFrom there it's just a matter of determining how your team is going to run on\nthe financial side of things. This is entirely up to you and the laws of your\narea. For us we split the sales of our games between the devs working on it.\nThe OST sales are also given entirely to our musician so they get a nice bump\nfor that. It's really important that people are fairly compensated for their\nwork and that the payment structure is defined and agreed upon early on. Helps\navoid hurt feelings and legal issues down the line.\n\nJust like with making games this is a learned skill that takes time to get\nbetter at. The more game jams or social projects you work on the better you\nwill get at them. Learn from each experience, keep notes, learn about yourself\nand what your limits are, learn to read when others are at their limit or\noverworking themselves. Becoming a leader takes time and is a never ending\nprocess so don't feel bad if you mess up once in a while.\n\n# Tools\n\nRight now is the best time in history to make a game. Tools are easier to\naccess and tons of cheap or free versions are available for any discipline.\nSocial programs such as Guilded and Discord allow people to work together\ncollaboratively from anywhere. With storage solutions like Google Drive and\nGithub we can share files and work without a huge amount of financial buy in.\n\n### There is no best engine.\n\nChoose an engine that supports your style of game and your financial\nsituation. Don't choose an engine based on what people say is the 'best'\nengine. There is no 'best' engine. There are great engines for different kinds\nof games. Tools are not diminished in value based on their price or lack\nthereof. There are also hundreds of engines available out there. Go explore\nyour options!\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club was made in a free to use python tool called Ren'Py\nthat is specifically designed to make visual novels. Risk of Rain was made in\nGameMaker and MS Paint. Yes, you read that right... MS Paint. The cost of your\ntools does not define the value of what you make.\n\nUnderstand that this isn't an exhausive list of engines. There are tons of\nengines out there that are good or great for a variety of game styles. Go out\nthere, find stuff, build stuff, and don't be an elitist about tools.\n\nGodot is a beast. Completely built by its community, fully open source, and\nentirely free. It excels in 3d is great for 2d and is now being used by major\nstudios. You literally can't get a better deal as a small studio than free.\nActually free. Not free with royalties. Real free. Use Godot. Seriously. Godot\nwas used to make Dome Keeper and Endoparasitic.\n\nGameMaker is a great engine for making 2d games but not very strong with 3d.\nYou can use the free trial indefinitely for non-commercial use and it allows\nexports to Desktop targets as well as Web and Mobile. The monetization model\nis very competitive at 100$ one time for a lifetime license. For Console it's\n80$ per month or 800$ per year. All of these prices have regionalized pricing\nmaking it affordable pretty much anywhere. They don't take royalties which is\npretty great if your game takes off as well. Game Maker Studio was used to\nmake Heartbound, Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Pizza\nTower and Undertale.\n\nUnreal Engine is a powerhouse in the 3d arena that has a great monetization\nmodel. If your game makes under 1,000,000$ over its lifetime you pay them\nnothing. Anything beyond that has a 5% royalty tagged onto it. They are also\nentirely free to use for unmonetized projects. Definitely great for startups\nbut it can have a steep learning curve. Unreal was used to make Fortnite,\nConan Exiles, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Octopath Traveler.\n\nRen'Py is a fantastic engine specifically made for Visual Novels. It's\ncompletely free, easy to use, and has a great community around it. Definitely\nable to make some powerful and interesting games. Ren'py was used to make Doki\nDoki Literature Club.\n\n### There is no best art program.\n\nJust like with an engine you should choose an art program that works best for\nyou. Just because a program costs more or is more revered in certain circles\ndoesn't mean it's better for you or your workflow. Everyone works differently\nand everyone feels more or less comfortable with different software and\nhardware. If you want to use MS Paint on a tablet it's fine. If you want to\nuse Photoshop on a Cintiq that's also fine.\n\nAseprite is the actual god of pixel art tools. Running at a cheap 20$ this\npowerhouse is super affordable but also carries an extra bonus. You can get it\nfor free. If you compile Aseprite from their github it's entirely free\nsoftware. Get this, use this, make sick pixel art.\n\nGimp is an incredibly fantastic image editing tool generally looked down on\nfor being the ugly brother of photoshop. That being said it has a few super\npowers that photoshop doesn't have... it's not owned by Adobe and it's\ncompletely free. We've used gimp for tons of stuff over the years from\npromotional art, to touch ups on logos, or making in-game assets. Definitely\ngive this a look if you haven't before.\n\nBlender is a really powerful and entirely free 3d modeling and animation tool.\nIt can do some absolutely insane stuff and as it continues to evolve it has\nmet or exceeded the power of the best 3d modeling tools out there. If you want\nto build awesome 3d stuff then this is your go to workhorse.\n\n### There is no best audio program.\n\nI spoke to our musician Stijn van Wakeren for this information as it's not\nreally my area of expertise. You should definitely hit them up if you have\nquestions about these programs or want more insight into why they are so\npowerful. That being said, here are some rad programs you can use to make\nmusic or sound effects with relative ease.\n\nFamiStudio is an awesome free tool for making NES style chiptunes and sound\neffects. There is a pretty massive fan community built around it and a ton of\neasy to follow YouTube tutorials to get you started making stuff. I really\nlove the sounds that come out of this thing and it really hits that nostalgia\nfactor. You can even review the source or compile it yourself. Honestly\nawesome.\n\nAnvil Studio is a completely free MIDI audio design platform. If you're just\nstarting out or really want a nice oldschool feel to your audio I really\nrecommend checking this out. You can even print sheet music from your\ncreations with one of their addons.\n\nFL Studio is by far the gold standard for audio tools. All of our music and\nsound effects were made in it. It's incredibly easy to use, insanely versatile\nletting you make a wide range of awesome stuff, and it's pretty affordable\nwith a 100$ price tag for lifetime updates. If you're serious about making\naudio magic and want something powerful and long lasting then FL Studio is the\nright choice.\n\n# How do I raise money?\n\nMaking money as an indie dev can be a really daunting task especially when\nyou're just starting out. The advice I will always give is to not quit your\nday job. Make games as a hobby at first. Come home every day from work and\nspend time on your game for a few hours. Make it a routine. Save money each\npay check in your indie fund to help get assets and software for your hobby.\nKeep things small and this is absolutely doable.\n\nThere are a number of ways you can raise funds for your games from the\noutside. I will list a number of them below and the strengths and weaknesses\nof each. Every platform has its benefit and every platform has its weakness.\nSpreading your game to more platforms makes things harder to manage but might\nextend your reach as well. It's all about balance and impact and it will be\ndifferent for every game. Go slow, figure things out, move when it feels right\nand you know you can do it.\n\nYou also have to look out for people trying to get a free piece of your pie.\nWe get tons of scam offers every day from all kinds of sources. If you\naccidentally step on any of these land mines it could be the death of your\nproject without you realizing it until months or even years later. Don't sell\nyourself short and look out for some of the pitfalls below. That's your pie\nand you need to protect it.\n\nAll that being said here are a few methods we used and still use to raise\nmoney to keep the lights on.\n\n### Streaming\n\nTwitch has been the cornerstone of our studios income throughout everything\nwe've done. It serves as a great way to interact with the community, a source\nof revenue, and a real time interactive advertisement for the work we do. We\nliterally would not exist without Twitch.\n\nAfter a long campaign Twitch recently created the Software and Game\nDevelopment category for our community. We finally have a home as game devs\nand I couldn't be happier. Go check out the Streaming section of the site for\nmore information about this because there is a lot to unpack.\n\n### Publishers\n\nAny time you are thinking about going with a publisher just keep one question\nin mind. Will their help lead to profits above and beyond the revenue cut they\ntake? If you don't know the answer or if the answer is no then you don't need\na publisher. If you can release your game without a publisher then you\nabsolutely should.\n\nOn average, most publishers ask for 30-70% of the income of your game. This\ncost is a dinosaur carry-over from the days when publishers handled physical\ncartidges and units on shelves in retail stores. We don't need that anymore\ndue to digital distribution like Steam, Humble Bundle, etc.\n\n### Kickstarter\n\nKickstarter is a great place to raise funding when you've already got a\ncommunity base and a workable demo. I definitely wouldn't advise going this\nroute before you have those things ready. I also wouldn't rely on Kickstarter\nas something that will fund the entire development of your game. We used it as\na marketing platform and to get initial funding for hardware, software, and\naudio samples. Wait to launch your Kickstarter until you know you will\nsucceed. Don't leave it up to chance.\n\n### Merchandise\n\nMerchandise has been a lot of fun to create and distribute around the world.\nWith changing shipping rates and material costs things have been pretty rough\nbut we always find a way to adapt to the new meta.\n\nWe use Pirate Ship for shipping because they let you upload a csv, are super\ncheap, and are ridiculously on-brand for us. We get our stickers made through\nSticker Mule because they are very high quality, don't break the bank, and\nship super quickly. For prints and clothing we go through Printful which does\nboth the manufacturing and the shipping. They also automatically hook up to\nstore fronts like Big Cartel and Shopify which makes things super easy.\n\n### Subscription Services\n\nKo-Fi is like Patreon if Patreon wasn't the actual devil. Unlike the actual\ndevil, Ko-Fi charges a flat fee for their subscription service. Right now it's\n54$ a year. That's 4.50$ per month. No hidden percentages or other garbage.\nLiterally all the functionality that Patreon offers but without the 8% helltax\ntacked on.\n\nWhen people join in on Tiers they also pay immediately so no more offset\npayments or stolen content when someone declines their card at the end of the\nmonth. They also have an alert system for your stream and you can accept\ndonations through them. Switch to Ko-Fi. Seriously.\n\n### Scams\n\nScams are a super prevalent pitfall in the world of the indie dev. Do not sign\nanything you haven't read. If you're unsure of what something means in a\ncontract then talk to a lawyer. If you do accidentally give out keys for your\ngame you can burn them through the Steam Partner tools so don't worry. Outside\nof that here are a few examples of some scams we've encountered and avoided.\n\n### The Influencer Scam\n\nThis is the most common form of scam targeting indie developers. You will get\nthese. All of us do.\n\nThe scam works generally over email and starts with someone claiming they are\na streamer or game reviewer. They will be using the correct icon for their\nprofile, show legitimate links to social media accounts, and talk a little bit\nabout their content. However, the email will not be correct. Always check for\nan influencer's business email before sending keys. You can usually find this\non their YouTube About section. It may just be one letter off but it's not the\nreal creator contacting you if they don't match up.\n\nThese emails are automated and the key eventually winds up on a third party\nwebsite to be sold at a price lower than your games price. Out of thousands of\nemails we have only received a handful of legitimate human beings. Be vigilant\nin your checks and don't be wowed by a potentially famous creator emailing\nyou.\n\nWith that in mind my way of handling this has changed a bit in the last few\nyears. I now give them the Steam Key and then burn it 12-24 hours later. On\nthe scammers side their automated system checks the key and puts it up for\nsale. Then someone buys it and it doesn't work. That customer is then likely\nto leave a negative review for the scam seller. Hit them where it hurts. In\ntheir reputation. After starting this tactic my influencer scam emails\ndecreased by roughly 90% and haven't come back. Guessing they have a\nblacklist.\n\n### The Bundle Scam\n\nMany times you will receive offers to be part of a bundle. Scammers will claim\nyou will get between 10-30% of the bundle sales if you give them 10,000-30,000\nsteam keys for your game. If you sign the contract and send the keys they will\nstart selling them as normal up until a point. From here they will start a\n\"Happy Hour\" and sell 5-10x as many keys per purchase. Another company knows\nwhen this Happy Hour begins and will buy all of the keys in the next few\nminutes.\n\nYou are then left with 10-20% of the initial amount you believed you were\ngetting. At the same time another company now has tens of thousands of your\ngames keys and will undercut your steam prices on every third party key site\non the net. This will considerably impact your ability to sell copies of your\ngame.\n\nThese scams are rare, well thought out, and seem logical from a business\nperspective. Talk to a legal rep and make sure you know what you are getting\ninto before you sign anything. Don't get caught up in shiny sales numbers.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThere are all kinds of different ways to approach marketing for indie\ndevelopers. The major thing to always remember is if someone says there is a\nbest way then they are probably selling you something and it usually just\nmakes them money. Do what feels right for your studio, your games, and your\ncommunity. Always.\n\n### Building A Community\n\nBuilding a community is the most important thing in all of this. Without your\ncommunity you are absolutely nothing no matter how awesome your game is. This\nrule is true no matter the size or funding of your studio. If you lose the\nfaith of your players then you lose everything.\n\nYou are never above your community and you are never too important to spend\ntime responding to them. The moment you think you are they will show you how\nuntrue that really is. Don't forget that.\n\n### Social Media\n\nThere are tons of places online for you to post about your games or whatever\nit is you're working on. Never miss an opportunity to do this. You're an indie\ndeveloper and you need to stand at the top of the mountain and shout about it.\nYou're not a Triple A with millions of dollars for a marketing budget so take\nevery chance you can to show people your work. Your work doesn't have to be\nperfect to talk about it so get it out there!\n\nThe way we started this process was by setting up social accounts to help get\npeople all in one place. We set up Discord as the core community center which\nallowed people a common place to hang out and mingle with one another. Then we\nset up satellite accounts to funnel people back to the Discord. This includes\nthings like Twitter, Instagram, Steam, Game Jolt, Itch.io, Twitch, YouTube,\nReddit, and Guilded. This funnel effect ballooned our Discord to over 4,000\nmembers and keeps everyone on the same page so updates don't go missed by the\nmost engaged players.\n\nThe best and most active social media platforms will change over time based on\nthe whim of the internet. It's really important to stay ahead of these changes\nor at least keep in step with them to make sure you don't get caught off\nguard. I routinely go through tons of websites and make accounts for Pirate\nSoftware to make sure we're set up for the future.\n\nIt's important to see your social media presence as a very personal thing for\nyour players. Simply responding on posts here and there, liking them, or\npopping into someones stream when they play your game is huge. It may be a\nsimple thing for you but it is absolutely world shattering for someone who\nloves your work. Do it. Go comment on every YouTube video for your game.\nRespond on Twitter any time someone mentions your game positively and talk to\nthe people who respond negatively about how you can make your game better. BE\nTHERE for them and they will be there for you.\n\nA lot of newer devs will immediately try to shoot for famous streamers or\nyoutubers in order to reach the spotlight. These people get thousands if not\ntens of thousands of requests every day. Focus on your community and\neventually one of the big names may take notice and boost your stuff to their\naudience.\n\n### Paid Advertisement\n\nI generally stay away from any kind of paid promotion. As an indie dev you may\nnot have a lot of money to throw around so it's hard to compete for eyes on\nthe internet with so many big players out there. Time and resources are much\nbetter spent on your community over anything else.\n\nThat being said you may want to play around with different advertising\nmethods. You might find something that works for you. Just because our studio\ndidn't find a benefit here doesn't mean you won't.\n\n### Conventions\n\nDefinitely take part in conventions but make sure not to burn out your studios\nwallet in the process. It's really easy to forget the cost of travel, food,\nand other expenses if you don't plan for them in advance. Budgeting each trip\nbefore you go is important when you're just starting out.\n\nYou should really test the waters with smaller more local conventions first.\nOur first one was Eugene Comic Con in Eugene Oregon and the booth only cost us\n20$ for an entire weekend. We met tons of people, gained a lot of fans, and\nlearned how to run our booth better for future conventions. This kind of stuff\nis invaluable and really helped us get ourselves out there.\n\nMerchandise can really help offset convention costs if you've got some good\nstuff. Try to bring Stickers, Pins, or Plushes to these kinds of shows because\nthey end up getting sold pretty fast. Stay away from breakables like mugs or\nsize restricted stuff like clothing because it's much harder to sell in a\nconvention setting.\n\n### Awards\n\nAwards are not just granted to amazing games in the industry. You need to\napply for these and they will almost always carry a cover charge. The general\nprice is between 50-100$ USD as a standard. Look for submission forms for any\nof the awards you've heard of and also keep on the lookout for new smaller\naward shows.\n\nThere is almost always something going on and an award can really help put you\nand your work on the map. They sometimes also come with trophies or cool\nimages you can link to your public launch pages.\n\n# Where should I launch my game?\n\nYes. No seriously... yes. There are so many different places you can launch\nyour games today. We took a very Steam centric approach because they make it\nso easy to work with third parties. This let us spread our reach immensely\nwithout increasing our total workload by very much. As a small team, that's\npretty enormous and it's worked out well for us.\n\nSteam is the best monetization platform that exists for games. With a massive\nfrontend geared towards player interaction and feedback, a robust backend to\nhelp you manage your assets and finances, and tons of promotional tools Steam\nreally has it all.\n\nSteam has regular platform wide sales that you can join in on. You get to set\nthe sale price and you can opt-in or decline at will. They don't do anything\nwith your game without your consent at any time. Adding your game to a sale\ngenerally gives a large boost to discoverability for the life of the sale. If\nyou put your game on sale for at least 20% off or more then everyone who has\nwishlisted the game will get an email about it. Use this to help bump up\nvisibility and get your game in more peoples hands.\n\nFor each game you launch you will get five 'Visibility Rounds'. These VRs give\nyour game front page time to the tune of 1,000,000 impressions. As a small\nstudio this is a HUGE deal and should only be used for massive updates. This\nis your time to really show your game off and get a huge amount of burst\ntraffic. You really need to make sure everything is solid before firing one of\nthese off. Also, if you launch your game in Early Access... once you launch\nfully you get a free VR immediately that doesn't count against your games\nfive. Launch in Early Access, get feedback, use it to improve, fully launch\nand get a free burst of visibility.\n\nSteam takes a 30% cut of all sales but that doesn't really tell the whole\nstory. They allow regional price localization which is a MASSIVE boost to your\nincome and they also take 0% whenever you sell a Steam key on a third party\nplatform. This means you can sell anywhere in the world or on other platforms\nwith relative ease while still only managing a single distribution base. By\nlocalizing our prices our income was increased by 20-25% from Brazil alone.\nLocalize your games. Localize your prices. Steam is great. Don't let anyone\nconvince you otherwise.\n\nHumble Bundle is a great middle-man platform that can help improve your sales\nby distributing Steam keys. They don't take any amount from your sale unless\nyou donate some of your profit to them which can really help when you're just\nstarting out. They've also got a partnership program so people who buy things\nyou recommend can give you a small boost to income passively. I generally put\nup partnership links for tools and games that we use or play on stream.\n\nGame Jolt is the god of demo sites. Make a demo for your game and put it on\nGame Jolt. When we first got a demo for Heartbound up on Steam we saw minimal\ntraffic. Once we put it up on Game Jolt we had thousands of people play it and\nfor the first year nearly 95% of all YouTube videos for Heartbound listed Game\nJolt as where they got their download. It was huge for us and really helped\nget the word out about our game. They also give you a little bit of side cash\nfrom the ads that run on your games page. They don't need to do that and it's\na really nice thing to cash out on every once in a while.\n\nItch.io has more customizability than any other site but unfortunately lacks\nin the discoverability department.
