Smith\n\n19 Apr 2024\n\n4 min read\n\n1\n\nPerovskites offer the prospect of a display medium that can serve multiple\nfunctionalities\u2014including sensing and collecting ambient light energy.\n\nNature\n\nconsumer devices fingerprint reader fingerprint sensor flexible displays led\ndisplays quantum dots solar cells\n\nModern smartphone touchscreens offer edge-to-edge glass and use advanced\nbonding that makes the screen nearly flush with the surface of the phone.\nBeneath it, however, there\u2019s still layer upon layer of glass, polarizes, color\nfilters, capacitive touch sensors, and more. That\u2019s an obstacle for smartphone\nmakers looking to integrate sensors or create flexible displays.\n\nHowever, new research highlights another option: photo-sensitive pixels. They\ncan do far more than detect touch. They can image objects placed on a display,\ndetect fingerprints, and even charge a device.\n\n\u201cWe know that LG Display, and other display companies, are interested in how\nto integrate the function of a touchscreen, or imaging,\u201d said Chunxiong Bao, a\nco-author on the new research and professor at Nanjing University\u2019s School of\nPhysics. \u201cThey have tried materials like OLED and QD-LED, but the\nphotoresponsivity is not so good. For our perovskite LED, it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\n## It\u2019s also a fingerprint reader, health sensor, and light meter\n\nPerovskites are a class of materials that form a crystal structure like that\nof the eponymous perovskite\u2014a calcium titanium oxide mineral discovered in the\nUral Mountains of Russia in 1839. Perovskites, the class of materials, became\npopular in photovoltaics as researchers discovered they can be used for\nefficient solar cells and brighter, better quantum dots.\n\nBao and his co-authors, in this case, wanted their perovskite device to both\ncreate and react to light. The Pervoskite-LED (PeLED) material they developed\ncan display an image at a high brightness: the team demonstrated red, green,\nand blue PeLEDs with a reported brightness up to 4,700 candelas per square\nmeter (most smartphone displays have a peak brightness in the hundreds). But\nPeLEDs also efficiently detect light, a trait the researchers used to create a\ntouchscreen.\n\n\u201cIf you want [a material] to have a good photo response, you need to generate\n[electron] carriers in these materials,\u201d said Bao. \u201cIn perovskite, this is\neasy.\u201d It\u2019s the carrier transport layer that allows the movement of electrons,\nwhich in turn makes it possible to detect touch input. And because PeLEDs are\nphotosensitive, they can both detect and image the objects that touch the\ndisplay.\n\nA newly developed perovskite LED (PeLED) display can image objects that touch\nit, making it useful as\u2014among a range of tasks\u2014an imager, fingerprint sensor,\nand light sensor.Nature\n\nThe result is a display that bundles multiple sensor functions. It can image\nsmall, high-contrast objects placed on the display, which in turn should make\nit a viable fingerprint reader (the prototype display was too small to read a\nreal fingerprint, however, so the researchers tested it with a small image of\na fingerprint). The display\u2019s photosensitivity can also be used as a light\nsensor, to transfer data, or function as a PPG sensor to provide user health\ndata.\n\nThese capabilities could help smartphones integrate features which currently\nrequire separate, individual sensors into the display. Such device integration\nwould then in turn reduce the complexity and thickness of the device. And\nwhile the prototype display the team developed wasn\u2019t flexible, Bao says the\ntechnology could prove adaptable to flexible displays, such as those found in\nfolding or rollable phones.\n\n## It\u2019s a solar charger, too\n\nPeLED\u2019s photosensitivity holds surprising potential to replace many smartphone\nsensors, and it has one more trick up its sleeve. The display doubles as a\nsolar charger.\n\nThis is, in some sense, unsurprising. As mentioned earlier, perovskites hold\npromise for improving the efficiency of future solar cells. But this is the\nfirst demonstration of a functional perovskite display that can generate a\ncharge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept that good solar cells should be good LEDs, people\nknow this well,\u201d said Artem Bakulin, a reader in physical chemistry at\nImperial College London, who is unaffiliated with the current research. \u201cBut\nto be brave enough to actually pair solar cells and LEDs, because of some\nengineering challenges, it would be difficult. [...] In this paper, they try\nto solve the problems and combine the two fields together.\u201d\n\nThe new PeLED display can charge a capacitor from 1.2 to 1.7 volts in roughly\n25 minutes.Nature\n\nThe researchers proved this capability by using the prototype display to\ncharge a supercapacitor that could then be used to power the display.\nInterestingly, the display\u2019s power conversion efficiency was over twice as\nhigh when exposed to indoor white LED lighting than when exposed to simulated\nsunlight, which could be beneficial for consumer devices that spend most of\ntheir time indoors.\n\nThe researchers noted that their display technology is a proof of concept and\nrequires more work to scale to a size useful for consumer electronics.\nLongevity is also an issue, as current perovskite materials degrade quickly:\nthe paper reports an \u201coperational lifetime\u201d of just 18.5 hours.\n\n\u201cThe material is easy to make, but it\u2019s also easy to degrade,\u201d said Bao. \u201cMany\nresearchers are trying to improve the device lifetime. Our device is not\nstable, but some groups report perovskites with a much longer lifetime.\u201d A\ngroup of researchers at Princeton University have produced perovskite\nsemiconductors with a 30-year lifetime, offering a path towards solving the\nlongevity problem.\n\nThe PeLED researchers described their device in a paper published last week in\nNature Electronics.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Quantum Dots Are Behind New Displays \u203a\n  * The Mini-LED Is the Future of Big Displays \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * LED display - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nconsumer devicesfingerprint readerfingerprint sensorflexible displaysled\ndisplaysquantum dotssolar cells\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nMatthew S.
