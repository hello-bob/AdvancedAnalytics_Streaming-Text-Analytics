Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter\nat Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.\n\n## This story is part of a group of stories called\n\nThe biodiversity crisis, explained\n\nThis spring is a very good time to be a bird.\n\nIn forests across the Midwest and Southeast, the ground is about to erupt with\nbillions of loud, protein-packed cicadas. They\u2019ll buzz about for a few weeks\nas they search for mates, providing snacks for pretty much every living\ncreature in the forest, from songbirds and swans to frogs and even fish.\n\nThis is an especially big year for these red-eyed bugs: Brood XIX and Brood\nXIII \u2014 which pop up every 13 years and 17 years, respectively \u2014 are emerging\nat once. The last time such an event happened was the spring of 1803, when\nThomas Jefferson was president. It will be hundreds of years before it happens\nagain.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Where billions of cicadas will emerge this spring (and over the next\ndecade), in one map\n\nWhile the insect explosion will be brief, it will shape forests for years to\ncome. The binge-fest that birds enjoy during these periods supersize their\nfamilies and, in turn, shift the eating and hunting patterns of many other\nspecies. These effects send ripples throughout the ecosystem. As one recent\nstudy put it, pulses of periodical cicadas can \u201crewire\u201d entire forest food\nwebs. Call it the butterfly cicada effect.\n\nVox is looking for images of pets and wildlife eating cicadas, and we\u2019d love\nyour help. If you\u2019d like to share your photos, please consider emailing them\nto our team. They may be featured in a future story like this one.\n\n### Why billions of cicadas erupt all at once\n\nFor most of their lives \u2014 either 13 or 17 years, depending on the brood \u2014\nperiodical cicadas live several inches underground, slurping up sap from plant\nroots with their straw-like mouths. Then, when the soil temperature hits about\n64 degrees Fahrenheit, they emerge, typically after sunset. Cicadas in more\nsouthern states, like Alabama, usually emerge in April or early May, whereas\nthose in colder states like Illinois tend to appear later in the spring.\n\nThe teenage insects then march up plants, trees, and fences, where they\nmetamorphose into winged adults. That\u2019s when giant groups of males start\nsinging loudly to attract females (you know, lady bugs). During these events,\na single acre of land can have more than 1 million cicadas on it. That\u2019s\nroughly 2,700 pounds of bugs.\n\nA Brood XIX cicada sheds its exoskeleton on a tree in Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina, on May 1.\n\nSean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nHere, two adult cicadas from this year\u2019s Brood XIX are preparing to find\nmates.\n\nSean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nThis mass eruption, scientists believe, is strategic. \u201cThey effectively\nsatiate their predators,\u201d Louie Yang, an entomologist at the University of\nCalifornia Davis, told me a few years ago, when the famous Brood X emerged.\n\nThe cicada defense strategy is to flood the forests so that predators become\nso full they literally can\u2019t stomach another bite. That leaves plenty of\ninsects left to mate and lay eggs that will become the next generation of\ncicadas.\n\nThis approach seems to work for cicadas, and it\u2019s an absolute delight for\nbirds.\n\n### Birds lose their minds during cicada outbreaks\n\nBirds can be fussy about their food. Some prefer plants, like the trumpeter\nswan, while others specialize in seeds or small insects, like chickadees.\n\nThose preferences get tossed out during cicada explosions. The birds stop what\nthey\u2019re doing and go to town on the bug buffet. During the Brood X emergence\nin 2021, researchers documented more than 80 different avian species feeding\non cicadas, including small birds that couldn\u2019t fit them in their mouths.\n\nA grackle eating a cicada.\n\nDan Gruner\n\n\u201cWe saw chickadees \u2014 tiny, tiny little birds \u2014 grab the cicada and drag it to\nthe ground with their body weight and then peck it apart,\u201d said Zoe Getman-\nPickering, an ecologist at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the\nresearch.\n\nShe also saw purple martins, which typically catch small insects like winged\nants and flies from the air, go after loads of cicadas. \u201cThere was one family\nof purple martins that got 23 cicadas into their nest in three hours or so,\u201d\nGetman-Pickering said.\n\nThis feeding frenzy can seriously benefit some birds. Simply put, more food\ncan lead to more babies.\n\n\u201cFollowing emergences, you do tend to get an increase in a lot of the apparent\navian predator populations,\u201d Walt Koenig, an ornithologist at Cornell\nUniversity and research zoologist emeritus at UC Berkeley, told me in 2021.\n\nOne analysis he co-authored, based on 37 years of data, linked cicada\neruptions to a population bump in a number of species including red-headed\nwoodpeckers and common grackles.\n\nRemarkably, many of these knock-on effects lasted for years, Koenig said. The\nnumber of blue jays, for example, was significantly higher even three years\nafter the cicada eruptions.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate that, at least in some species, the effects of cicada\nemergences are detectable years after the event itself,\u201d Koenig and his co-\nauthors wrote.\n\n### Fat caterpillars, rejoice\n\nIt\u2019s not just birds that are benefitting. During big emergences, avian\npredators are eating so many cicadas that they eat much less of everything\nelse \u2014 including caterpillars. That means caterpillars get a rare reprieve\nfrom the constant threat of attack, at least from birds.\n\nResearchers have actually measured this. In the years surrounding Brood X,\nGetman-Pickering and her collaborators filled forests in Maryland with fake\ncaterpillars made of clay. They then measured how many of them had signs of\nbird strikes \u2014 beak marks indicating that birds tried to eat them.\n\nA caterpillar made of clay with signs of bird strikes.\n\nMartha Weiss\n\nIn May, when Brood X was emerging, the portion of caterpillars with strike\nmarks fell dramatically, from about 30 percent in a typical year to below 10\npercent during the emergence, according to her study, published in 2023.\n\nShe also looked at real caterpillars. Remarkably, the number of them roughly\ndoubled in the forests she studied during the emergence, relative to the two\nfollowing years. \u201cIt was pretty staggering how many caterpillars that we saw,\u201d\nGetman-Pickering said.\n\nA lot of them were extra plump, too, like the spiny larvae of the dagger moth.\nWhen there are few cicadas, the juiciest caterpillars are often picked off\nfirst; they\u2019re much easier for birds to spot. But during cicada eruptions,\ncaterpillars are free to eat and grow at their leisure.\n\n\u201cThe biggest, most visible caterpillars benefited immensely from the release\nfrom predation,\u201d she said.\n\nA plump caterpillar in the genus Acronicta that the research team found in the\nforest.\n\nJohn Lill\n\n### Trees might prefer life without cicadas\n\nA surge in caterpillars, meanwhile, has effects of its own. These animals\nfamously eat leaves. So when birds eat fewer of them, the cicadas chew their\nway through more of the forest canopy.\n\nGetman-Pickering\u2019s recent study measured this too: In the summer of 2021,\nafter Brood X debuted, oak trees experienced \u201ca spike in cumulative leaf\ndamage,\u201d the paper states. A doubling of the number of caterpillars meant a\ndoubling of the damage, she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what that ultimately means for forest health. Previous studies\nhave shown that cicadas themselves, however, can harm trees. After breeding,\nfemales carve slits into branches and lay eggs, which often damages the wood.\n\nResearch by Koenig, of Cornell, found that oak trees produced fewer acorns in\na year with a cicada emergence, and in the following year. Older studies have\nalso shown that emergences can slow the rate of tree growth.\n\nThe long-term picture is hazier. Unpublished data from Karin Berghardt and\nKelsey McGurrin, researchers at the University of Maryland, shows that trees\nseem to bounce back from the harm caused by egg-laying. There\u2019s also some\nresearch suggesting that cicada carcasses could actually fertilize the forest\nfloor.\n\nUltimately, what all of these studies show is that cicadas can transform\nentire ecosystems in just a few short weeks. Think about that the next time\nyou walk through the woods: The birds, the butterflies, the trees themselves\nare all shaped, in some way, by one very weird bug.\n\n### You've read 1 article in the last 30 days.\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
