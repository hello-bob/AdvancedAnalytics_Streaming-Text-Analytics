G\u00f3rny wrote that the spread of\nthe \"\"AI bubble\"\" indicated a need for Gentoo to formally take a stand on AI\ntools. After a lengthy discussion, the Gentoo Council voted unanimously this\nweek to adopt his proposal and ban contributions generated with AI/ML tools.\n\n#### The case against\n\nIn his RFC, he laid out three broad areas of concern: copyrights, quality, and\nethics. On the copyright front, he argued that LLMs are trained on copyrighted\nmaterial and the companies behind them are unconcerned with copyright\nviolations. \"\"In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield\nstuff we can't legally use.\"\"\n\nHe questioned the quality of LLM output, though he did allow that LLMs might\n\"\"provide good assistance if you are careful enough\"\". But, he said, there's\nno guarantee contributors are aware of the risks. He minced no words about his\nview of the ethics of the use of AI. G\u00f3rny took issue with everything from the\nenergy consumption driven by AI to labor issues and \"\"all kinds of spam and\nscam\"\". The only reasonable course of action, he said, would be to ban the use\nof those tools altogether in creating works for Gentoo:\n\n> In other words, explicitly forbid people from using ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub\n> Copilot, and so on, to create ebuilds, code, documentation, messages, bug\n> reports and so on for use in Gentoo.\n\nHe added that this only extended to works created expressly for the Gentoo\nproject, and did not encompass upstream projects using things like ChatGPT.\nAndreas K. H\u00fcttel asked whether there were objections to packaging AI software\nfor Gentoo. This did not elicit a response in favor or against on the list,\nbut the AI policy page expressly mentions that the policy does not prohibit\npackaging AI-related software.\n\n#### Is this necessary?\n\nRich Freeman wrote that he thought it made sense to consider the use of AI,\nbut suggested the Gentoo developer certificate of origin (DCO) already had the\nnecessary language to prohibit AI-generated contributions. \"\"Perhaps we ought\nto just re-advertise the policy that already exists?\"\" He also poked at the\nethical case laid out by G\u00f3rny, and suggested it would alienate some\ncontributors even if the majority of the project was in favor. Freeman said it\nwas not a bad idea to reiterate that Gentoo didn't want contributions that\nwere just piped out of a GPT application into forums, bug reports, commits,\netc., but didn't think that it required any new policy.\n\nUlrich Mueller replied that there is overlap with existing policy, but did not\nfind it redundant and supported the idea of a clarification on how to deal\nwith AI-generated code. Sam James agreed with the proposal but worried that it\nwas \"\"slightly performative [...] given that we can't really enforce it\".\"\nG\u00f3rny wrote that it was unlikely that the project could detect these\ncontributions, or that it would want to actively pursue finding them. The\npoint, he said, is to make a statement that they are undesirable.\n\nOskari Pirhonen wanted to know about cases where a contributor uses ChatGPT to\nhelp with writing documentation or commit messages (but not code) because they\ndon't have \"\"an excellent grasp of English\"\". If those contributions\nexplicitly called out AI-generated content, would those be acceptable? G\u00f3rny\nsaid that would not help much, and dismissed the quality of content generated\nby ChatGPT. Mueller wanted to know where the line was: \"\"Are translation tools\nlike DeepL allowed? I don't see much of a copyright issue for these.\"\"\n\nIn a rare dissent, Matt Jolly responded that Gentoo would always have poor\nquality contributions, and could simply use common sense to filter out low-\nquality LLM material. \"\"We already have methods for weeding out low quality\ncontributions and bad faith contributors - let's trust in these and see what\nwe can do to strengthen these tools and processes.\"\" He argued in favor of\nusing LLMs for code documentation and asked why he had to type out an\nexplanation of what his code does if an LLM can generate something that only\nrequires some editing. The proposal, he said, was a bad idea and banning LLMs\n\"\"at this point is just throwing the baby out with the bathwater\"\". Guidelines\nwould be fine, even a ban on completely AI-generated works, but he was opposed\nto \"\"pre-emptively banning useful tools\"\".\n\nJames replied that tools trained on Gentoo's current repository should be OK,\nas well as using LLMs to assist with commit messages. But, he said, a lot of\nFOSS projects were seeing too much AI spam and were not interested in picking\nthe \"\"possibly good\"\" parts out.\n\nDavid Seifert responded in support of the RFC and asked if it could be added\nto the next Gentoo Council meeting agenda. G\u00f3rny said that he had been asked\nfor a specific motion and provided this language:\n\n> It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been\n> created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial\n> intelligence tools. This motion can be revisited, should a case been made\n> over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical and quality concerns.\n\n#### Approved\n\nGiven the ratio of comments in favor of banning AI-generated contributions to\nobjections to such a ban, it is not surprising that the council voted to\naccept G\u00f3rny's proposal. Now the question is how Gentoo implements the ban. In\nan emailed response to questions, G\u00f3rny said that Gentoo is relying on trust\nin its contributors to adhere to the policy rather than trying to police\ncontributions to see if they were generated with AI/ML tools:\n\n> In both cases, our primary goal is to make it clear what's acceptable and\n> what's not, and politely ask our contributors to respect that. If we receive\n> contributions that contain really \"weird\" mistakes, the kind that [do not]\n> seem likely to be caused by a human error, we're going to start asking\n> questions, but I think that's the best we can do.\n\nAs AI/ML continues to dominate the tech industry's agenda, Gentoo is unusual\nin looking to shut it out rather than trying to join the party. How well the\npolicy works, and how soon it is tested, will be interesting to see.\n\n(Log in to post comments)\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:31 UTC (Thu) by gmgod (subscriber, #143864) [Link]\n\nBeyond the potential copyright violation, there is also the waste of time\nassociated with these for documentation/commit message purposes.\n\nPrompting an AI tool to do \"say that the app was missing a feature about how\nto handle numbers in a commit message\" is going to generate a novel's worth of\ntext that the person with broken English won't be able to vet.

And now, any practical example of this AI-driven spammy\ncontribution? In the projects I watch closely, the situation you and the\narticle are describing, is mostly purely theoretical. To me it seems like a\nsignal that there are enough contributors to the project, when they can raise\nbarriers to avoid problems that aren't even there.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 3:39 UTC (Fri) by epg (subscriber, #34047) [Link]\n\nIt's already happening in the workplace and it sucks.\n\nNow, the perpetrators weren't writing quality commit logs before either; but\nif you're going to commit shit, I'd rather it be a small amount, not a\nsteaming pile.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 9:52 UTC (Fri) by gmgod (subscriber, #143864) [Link]\n\nAs said under there, it's already happening at the work place and it sucks.\n\nIt's bot just code. Have you tried hiring anyone recently? Before ChatGPT, we\ncould weed out most I-saw-there-was-a-light-here in seconds or minutes. For\nevery 25 application, we would shortlist 1-2 people and we would go from\nthere. In the last round we shorlisted 14 people out of 31 applicants... And\nin spite of that he role wasn't fulfilled in the end. It's not theoretical,\nit's a fucking nightmare.\n\nOf course we've changed the way we advertise positions now, to make them less\nchatgptable...\n\nAlso, when was last time you searched something on the web to find a page that\nseems to be exactly what you ask for, to read the arm-long article, to finally\nfigure out that though it's very well-written, you've just lost your time\nbecause the information was blatantly wrong (\"recommendation\" sites are\ntypical).\n\nWhen was the last time you had a fruitful interaction with a customer service,\nfirst time? Does it not strike you as odd that an \"agent\" will be there with\nyou? I had a very nice chat with an Amazon engineer, there are reasons for\neverything.\n\nSo please don't say it's theoretical. I don't mind people using AI to generate\nsomething before they vet it, if they have enough skills to do so\nappropriately. I do mind people not doing so.\n\nSpeaking of theoretical... I suspect you use AI in your contributions then...\nCan you swear here that everything you AI generate is correct and always\ncommited as is?\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 10:22 UTC (Fri) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\n> Can you swear here that everything you AI generate is correct and always\n> commited as is?\n\nBut I never said I let AI do whatever it wants, it's a very useful tool, but\nit it still - just a tool. If we had reached singularity by now, this\ndiscussion would look entirely different :) In my code, since I started with\nCopilot, most of the bytes are actually an output of their LLM. But if I\ndidn't guide it, the bytes coming out of it wouldn't make much sense. Of\ncourse I'm still responsible.\n\nIt'd be an entirely different discussion if there was so advanced LLM that I'd\njust tell it what to do and it would even submit the change without my\nintervention, possibly without even having to read the commit... but the tech\nis not there and I suspect it'll take a while before it gets there... thus\nit's so far IMHO pretty irrelevant *how* the contributor comes to the result\nthey want to contribute, it's the result that matters - and it is still\n*their* action to contribute that piece. LLMs might just be a new (and a\npretty strong) +1 reason to ban _some_ contributors, who are wasting\nmaintainer's time...\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 16:45 UTC (Fri) by rgmoore (\u272d supporter \u272d, #75) [Link]\n\n> When was the last time you had a fruitful interaction with a customer\n> service, first time?\n\nTuesday. I got a knowledgeable human service rep who gave me the help I needed\npromptly. I've had plenty of miserable interactions with human service reps,\nthough. I think the big difference is whether the company sees customer\nservice as a cost center or a profit center. The reason the rep I encountered\non Tuesday is good is because we're paying real money for a service contract,\nand the company knows we won't renew if they do a bad job.\n\nThe root cause of bad AI service is companies that see service as a cost to\nminimize. Today they've decided AI is the way to save money. A few years ago,\nit was offshoring to a call center in some low cost country. Before that it\nwas underpaid domestic call centers mixed with endless message trees. The\ncommon denominator is unwillingness to pay for competent staff.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 20, 2024 9:02 UTC (Sat) by gfernandes (subscriber, #119910) [Link]\n\nExcept that LLM based AIs don't actually save any money at all!\n\nToday's LLMs are *heavily* subsidised by the companies pushing them, thanks to\nthe Crypto Bros VC lot pumping money into the NextBigThing(TM) since sliced\nbread (and of course, crypto!).\n\nActual costs per query are very high.

They care about how much they're\npaying today. If some VC is willing to subsidize their customer support by\npaying 95% of the real cost of AI, they'll look at the 5% they have to pay.\nIt's the same as taxi passengers switching to heavily subsidized Uber and\nLyft. What mattered was what they paid out of pocket, not who was paying for\nthe rest. AI companies turning off the money spigot at some point in the\nfuture is a future problem. They've already switched how they handle customer\nsupport a bunch of times, so they aren't afraid of having to do it again if\ncosts change.\n\nNot that the VC care. Their business model isn't to build the next Google or\nFacebook. It's to convince a bunch of suckers in the stock market that they've\nbuilt the next Google or Facebook and sell their stock before the whole house\nof cards collapses.

OpenAI has $2B revenue and could turn a healthy\nprofit.\n\nSome companies like Microsoft are losing money right now, but it's mostly from\nfront-loaded costs like model training and R&D. Once they are paid off,\nrunning AI models is not super-different from any other compute workload. We\nalso have multiple companies working on various AI accelerators that are going\nto make model running significantly cheaper.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 2:48 UTC (Mon) by ssmith32 (subscriber, #72404) [Link]\n\nNo, it just hit $2 billion \"annualized\" revenue.

This is\nhow R&D works in _any_ industry. Pure model running can already be profitable,\nif all you want is just to run models. It will become even more profitable in\nthe near future when new AI accelerators hit the market.\n\nNew model development is expensive, but it also will get cheaper.

In an extremely speculative market that has been recognized even\nby proponents as probably a bubble.\n\n\"Will\" is a word that means \"doesn't\". No matter how optimistic you are about\nthe outlook, the facts are they're highly unprofitable right now. We don't\nknow much about how big the operating vs r&d costs actually are, nor do we\nknow how fruitful any of those r&d efforts might actually be. We do know that\nin the here and now, the cost of these things, financial and societal, is\nastronomical and that the actual value is minor. We know that for more than a\nyear, we haven't seen any glimpses of the previous exponential\nimprovements[1]. Especially given the track record of the tech industry in the\nlast decade, just taking the boosters at their word here seems extremely\nfoolish.\n\n[1] https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/evidence-that-llms-are-...\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 17:53 UTC (Mon) by Cyberax (\u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [Link]\n\n> I'm just going to point out how every point in this argument relies on the\n> word \"will\".\n\nOpenAI has actual income from actual paying customers.

Nobody seriously\ndoubts that the AI is here to stay, and that it's going to be hugely\nimpactful. However, nobody also knows who is going to win the AI race. So\nevery VC is making tons of bets, resulting in a somewhat frenzied environment.\n\nThey fully expect 99+% of their investments to go up in smoke, but if they\nmake a successful bet, that remaining 1% will recoup the losses.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 22:09 UTC (Mon) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]\n\n> OpenAI has actual income from actual paying customers. They can just stop\n> the R&D, and they'll be hugely profitable (for a while).\n\nCan they?\n\nFor one, as I said, we don't know how much of their losses are from operating\ntheir service vs research. But I am going to go out on a limb and say that if\neven just a single service was operating at a profit, they would have been\nvery eager to tell us. That would, to my knowledge, be a first for any genAI\noffering and cement them as the clear leaders in the industry. It would also\nhelp reinforce the idea that AI is going to be incredibly profitable as that\ncomes under fire. However they seem weirdly coy about their operating figures\nsomehow.\n\nFor two, we don't know what those \"paying customers\" are actually doing.\nThere's been a whole lot of demos and webtoys and \"experimenting\" and \"trials\"\nand pass-through APIs that hastily paste your parameters into some pre-written\nprompt. But there's been remarkably little actual success stories and useful\nbusiness applications for it. I couldn't find any company stating they made a\nprofit *using* AI either. I don't think they could stop r&d if they wanted to,\nbecause all of these companies testing out chatgpt solutions to problems that\nit can't actually solve are doing so based on the idea that these things soon\nenough will be able to do anything. The visible r&d spending is crucial to\nthat.\n\nI found it remarkable how in a recent article I read, the Washington Post,\ndespite clearly trying very hard, couldn't scrounge up anyone to balance the\narticle with some positive news who didn't have to resort to constructs like\n\"I think we will see\" and \"my expectations are\" (https://archive.is/pIOra).\nIt's almost funny how consistently all of the bad news is in present tense and\nthe good news are in the future tense. The constant excuses how about how\n\"it's just the early days\" and \"we'll see applications for it any days now\"\nwill also seem very familiar to anyone who has followed e.g. cryptocurrency\nnews[1].\n\nIt may just be that they are earning a lot of money by teaching customers\ntheir tech isn't useful for them. The one thing I can find reliably is stories\nsuch as an animation company hiring a bunch of \"prompt engineers\" instead of\nartists to paint background mattes, failing at making minor revisions of the\nwork and not understanding how animation works and getting canned. This great\nsuccess, of course, will up (4x) in their next annualized revenue figures :)\n\n[1] Which does bring up a fun comparison: local divisions of McDonals and\nHershey's did certainly pay a few thousand dollars (or rather, paid a\nmarketing agency to pay a few thousand dollars) for a \"crypto experience\" on\nsome crypto \"metaverse\" platform I don't remember the name of at the height of\nthe crypto/metaverse bubble. A bunch of brands minted NFTs too. However that\nmoney was, unsurprisingly, not the start of enormous year-on-year brand\nspending on the blockchain people claimed it was.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 22:17 UTC (Mon) by Cyberax (\u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [Link]\n\n> Can they?\n\nOf course. Pure model running is already highly profitable on general-purpose\nhardware at the prices that OpenAI charges. And it's going to be even better\non special-purpose hardware.\n\n> For two, we don't know what those \"paying customers\" are actually doing.\n\nOpenAI certainly does. And a lot of customers are using ChatGPT on their own.\nI know non-native English speakers who are using OpenAI to correct spelling\nmistakes in emails. Or business analytics people using ChatGPT to write Python\nscripts to do data queries for data in Google Sheets. A very common use is to\ncreate TLDR versions of news articles and books.\n\nI'm using ChatGPT to filter emails that are just CC-ed to me, but that don't\nneed my personal attention, and then do a daily summary.\n\nAre these ground-breaking mega-AI use-cases? Not really.

The current pricing is subsidized\nunder the assumption that a) the models will rapidly become obsolete anyway b)\nthe lasting market share advantage will offset the losses. We don't know this\nfor certain with OpenAI except by omission, but we know it for other offerings\nby more public companies that have nearly identical costs and pricing, e.g.\nMicrosoft.\n\nI think you may be underestimating how resource hungry these things are.\nConsider the person in another thread here who said they needed two 3090 GPUs\nto get acceptable output speed for programming. That's $2500 upfront and\nnearly 1kW continuous power draw just for some autocomplete. Datacenter\ninference systems will be somewhat more efficient, but the scale of hardware\nneeded to perform these queries is just bonkers.\n\n> once it becomes more user-friendly\n\nYou've answered your own question :) It's hard to imagine a more use friendly\ninterface than a text chat, but there is currently no clear route to\nimprovements there either. The so-called hallucination is just inherent and\ncan not be solved. That would require a system where facts are first-class\ncitizens instead of just crossing your fingers and hoping they are\nstatistically likely. As recently shown this type of model also requires\nexponential increases in training data for linear increases in capability and\nwe're already out of public data to train them on.

There are plenty of industries that got their start from hobbyists\nspending their personal time and money on something that interested them, or\nfrom academic or government-funded research. As an example, computers got\ntheir start first as academic projects and then as military ones. They didn't\nget any interest from industry until that basic R&D was done for them, and\neven with that they got plenty of government money to help them grow. It's not\ntotally out there for venture capitalists to put money into the initial R&D\nneeded to get an industry off the ground, provided they see a big enough\nreward if the companies succeed.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 14:54 UTC (Mon) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]\n\nA difference is that with more traditional investments the entity doing the\ninvestment is one that pretty directly stands to benefit from the R&D being\ndone. For example, AT&T investing into developing the transistor, or the US\ngovernment developing nuclear-resistant networks, as you mentioned.\nConversely, VCs are remarkable for just how little they care what the actual\ntechnology is. Some even write gloating blog posts about how virtuous they\nthink they are for basing investment decisions solely on how charistmatic they\nthink the founders are and they don't even look at the slide decks or\nfinancials.\n\nThis makes sense, because at some point the industry realized that their\nprimary way of getting paid is only rarely the technologies actually working\nout, and more commonly just using their elite connections to find a bigger\nsucker as fast as possible. This detachment from any of the effects of any of\ntheir investments may have some arguable advantages, kodak inventing and then\nkilling the digital camera comes to mind. But it also runs the risk of, say,\ngrowing an entire sector around repeatedly wasting a medium sized countries\nGDP on things that nobody wants or needs and then trying to hype up everyone\nelse to buy it off them for more.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 17:57 UTC (Mon) by Cyberax (\u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [Link]\n\n> But in normal industries, you sell a product and use money from sale to fund\n> more development.\n\nThat model works for established industries.

The idea is that each CSR is in four or\nfive (or maybe more, I don't really know the specifics) chats at once, and\ndoing manual timesharing between them (i.e. looking at this chat for a few\nseconds, then looking at the next one, etc.). Whenever a response is due, they\nhave a series of canned replies they can quickly input (presumably with copy\nand paste and/or some bespoke software), and most of those are more polite\nways of saying \"I'll get back to you in a minute,\" but often phrased in a way\nthat makes it sound like the CSR is doing something other than juggling\nseveral chats at once (such as pulling up your file or consulting internal\ndocumentation).\n\nYou can tell that you're dealing with this kind of customer support based on\nthe following:\n\n1\\. They subtly encourage you to chat rather than getting on the phone (e.g.\nthe phone has a longer wait time, they won't just give you a phone number and\nrequire you to fill out a form first, the phone has one of those awful voice-\nresponse menu thingies, etc.). 2. The chat has a queue, but it rarely takes\nmore than a few minutes. 3. Every time you send a message to the CSR, it takes\n5-10 seconds (sometimes longer) before they reply. 4. When they do reply,\ntheir reply does not meaningfully advance the conversation, and you have to\nwait another 5-10 seconds for them to give you a real reply. 5. Everything\nthey say reads like it was meticulously proofread and approved in advance by\nsome committee. There are never abbreviations, typos, missing capitalization\nor punctuation, or other common hallmarks of \"real\" chatting.\n\nThe obvious problem here is that this is much \"safer\" than using an LLM (see\nfor example the Air Canada fiasco where their chatbot made up a policy and the\ncompany was forced to honor it), while simultaneously being relatively cheap\n(you don't need as many CSRs because they're multiplexed over several chats at\nonce) and providing an experience that is not that much worse than an LLM can\nprovide (the CSRs responses are already grammatically correct and\nprofessional, because they've been pre-vetted, so the most the LLM can do is\ncutting out the \"give me a moment\" intermediate replies).\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 9:25 UTC (Mon) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link]\n\nThere's also been a truly horrible thing that I've seen pitched - speech\nrecognition and speech synthesis feeding into a multi-chat CS system.

You gave an example of\na bad prompt and usage. I agree, that many people use LLMs wrongly with bad\noutcome and I see some dangers for society.\n\nHowever, LLMs can also be used correctly. For example, you can pipe a text\nyou've wrote through a LLM and prompt it to optimize the text or make\nsuggestions for improvement. I sometimes use gpt4-turbo for that. In my\nexperience the model is able to make good suggestions, fix errors and optimize\nthe text while preserving its meaning.\n\nI've tried a few local models but, unfortunately, these seem not yet to be on\nthe same level as gpt4-turbo.\n\nTrue, you can't trust the output, you need to manually review it sentence by\nsentence to make sure, it still says what you want to say and only that. But\nerrors and hallucinations are the exception not the rule. Often the optimized\ntext is just better and you can take it as is.\n\nIt is a service to your readers if your text is free of errors, well\nstructured, polite and to the point. You can very much fine-tune what you get\nif you tell the model what you want and what recipients you address.\n\n===\n\nAs an example, I've wrote the above text without thinking too much about it.\nProbably there are a bunch of typos and bad style in it. Now I asked\ngpt4-preview via the api to \"Optimize the following text, which is a comment\nin lwn.net for clarity and conciseness.\"\n\nHere's the output, which I intentionally left untouched for demonstration\npurpose.\n\n===\n\nLLMs, like any tool, can be misused or used effectively. Misuse can lead to\nnegative outcomes and societal risks. However, when used correctly, such as\nrefining or suggesting improvements to a text, LLMs like gpt4-turbo can\nenhance clarity, fix errors, and maintain the original meaning. While local\nmodels may not yet match gpt4-turbo's capabilities, it's crucial to review the\nLLM's output to ensure accuracy and avoid misinformation. Properly optimized\ntexts benefit readers by being error-free, well-structured, and clear,\nespecially when the model is guided by specific instructions and audience\nconsiderations.\n\n===\n\nIf I was to use that model for my \"real\" reply, I would further work on it\niteratively. I'm not happy that it didn't mention that you provided a bad\nexample. I'm not happy about \"Misuse can lead to .. societal risk\" which is\nnot what I wanted to say. I didn't specify what societal risk I see or that\nmisuse is a cause of it. In the end, I would probably just drop the vague\nside-note, which would be an improvement.\n\nNot being an native English speaker, I'm not sure about the \"While local\nmodels ..., it's crucial to ...\" construct. Does it make a connection between\nthe statements of the two sub-sentences, which in my intent are totally\nindependent? I would either research that question (learning something by the\nway) or replace the construct out of my uncertainty [1].\n\nSo, IMO, LLMs can very well be use to optimize text, for example commit\nmessages. But you need to write the text yourself in the first place, than use\nthe LLM, than carefully review the result.

English is by\n*far* the easiest to deal with.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 19:11 UTC (Sun) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link]\n\nThis is complicated enough that linguists usually divide it up into three (or\noccasionally four) parts:\n\n* Tense - Usually past, present, and future. * Aspect - Simple (\"perfective\"), progressive (continuous), and perfect. Some languages have imperfect or other aspects, which English lacks. * Mood or modality - Anything marked with a modal verb (the auxiliary verbs used for the progressive and perfect do not count as modal in this formalism). Sometimes subcategorized into indicative and subjunctive modalities (but we can further categorize into conditional, counterfactual, normative or deontic, etc.). * Evidentiality - Not used in English, and for that matter not used in most/all Indo-European languages. Some languages mark verbs to indicate why the speaker believes the asserted fact to be true, for example distinguishing between something directly witnessed and something indirectly reported. Some authorities consider this an extension of modality.\n\nOne confusing thing about English is that English has no future tense in this\nformalism. The future is sometimes marked with the modal verb \"will,\" so you\ncould say that the future is a modality. But modalities are optional in a way\nthat tenses are not, and so we can have sentences like \"Tomorrow, I'm buying a\nnew laptop,\" which is semantically happening in the future but has no\ngrammatical marker indicating as much (and if you chop off the \"tomorrow\"\nprefix, it's a perfectly good present continuous sentence without a whiff of\nthe future).\n\nOn the other hand, there are languages (such as Mandarin Chinese) that have\nonly one tense in this formalism. Those languages either treat all time\ninformation as modal, or do not have grammaticalized time markers at all. Of\ncourse, speakers of those languages are perfectly capable of distinguishing\nbetween past, present, and future. Every language can do that. But in these\nlanguages, time information is truly optional. You can say \"I buy a new\nlaptop,\" as a discrete event (rather than the habitual or indefinite sense\nthat English simple present would normally imply), without specifying when\nthat happens.\n\nAnother \"fun\" property of English is do-support: There are some constructions\nin English which grammatically require a modal verb (e.g. turning a\ndeclarative sentence into a yes-no question), but modals are semantically\noptional in English, so the word \"do\" (or \"does\") is used as a placeholder\nwhen no modal is required. In general, English does a lot of fronting and\nother grammatical rearrangement when building different constructions, and I\nwould imagine that this annoys speakers of Spanish just as much as Spanish\nverb conjugations tend to annoy speakers of English.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 19:57 UTC (Sun) by donald.buczek (subscriber, #112892)\n[Link]\n\nIt fills me with great satisfaction that I am now receiving the prophesied\nEnglish lecture after all.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 20:31 UTC (Sun) by malmedal (subscriber, #56172) [Link]\n\nI find https://www.ithkuil.net/ fascinating, not fascinating enough to\nactually learn it, but still interesting to what sort of concepts you can cram\ninto a language.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 20:55 UTC (Sun) by donald.buczek (subscriber, #112892)\n[Link]\n\n> German also has present simple and present perfect, it is missing the\n> continuous forms.\n\nNo, German has that, too. \"I am working\" would be \"Ich bin arbeitend\". Yes,\nthis isn't used much and sounds a bit strange but it is valid. It strongly\nindicates \"right at this very moment\".\n\nNow, to make things even more complicated: A male \"worker\" is a \"Arbeiter\" and\na female worker is a \"Arbeiterin\". A worker or a group of workers with\nunknown, irrelevant or mixed gender would be \"Arbeiter\", too. But many people\nnow reject the generic masculine.\n\nSo currently, several gender neutral forms compete with the old generic\nmasculine and with each other. For plural, the substantivized form of the verb\nin the present continuous tense is often used: \"Arbeitende\".\n\nSo the seldom-used tense got a little revival lately.\n\nI don't like it, because to me the natural interpretation of \"Arbeitende\"\nwould be \"people, who work at this very moment\".\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 21:14 UTC (Sun) by malmedal (subscriber, #56172) [Link]\n\n> \"I am working\" would be \"Ich bin arbeitend\".\n\nMmmm, I believe arbeitend functions as an adverb, in this sentence.

That is\n> \"I am something\" and the something that I am is \"working\".\n\nAfter reading a bit I have to admit that you are more correct than I am. The\nword form 'arbeitend' is known as 'Partizip I' (Present Participle) in German,\nwhich functions as a hybrid between a verb and an adjective/adverb.\n\nThis is from the beginning of the German variant of the Wikipedia of\n\"Participle\" / \"Partizip\" page:\n\n> A participle (Latin participium, from particeps \"participating\"; plural:\n> participles) is a grammatical form (participial form) that is derived from a\n> verb and thereby partially acquires the properties of an adjective, but also\n> retains some properties of a verb. The term \"participle\" and likewise the\n> German term Mittelwort express this characteristic of participating in two\n> categories at the same time, namely verb and adjective. [...] > German\n> examples of participles are the forms ending in -end like spielend (to the\n> verb spielen; called \"Present Participle\") and the forms starting with ge-\n> like gespielt (called \"Past Participle\"). In traditional grammar,\n> participles were often listed as a separate part of speech alongside verbs,\n> adjectives, nouns, etc.; however, this view is not shared in modern\n> linguistics, where participles are considered as words or even constructions\n> that contain varying proportions of verbal and adjectival components.\n\nYou are correct; the Present Participle ('Partizip I') is not typically used\nin natural speech as a verb to denote an 'immediate' tense. \"Ich bin\narbeitend\" can be said to be wrong and is not listed in tables with verb\ntenses. At least, it sounds yoda-ish.\n\nAs you mentioned, The Present Participle is used as an adjective or adverb to\ndescribe a state. It's also used, a bit more verbish, to indicate simultaneous\nactions, for example, \"Die Kinder kamen lachend aus der Schule\" (\"The children\ncame out of the school laughing\").\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 27, 2024 2:19 UTC (Sat) by gutschke (subscriber, #27910) [Link]\n\nJust to throw another wrinkle into this discussion, I believe that in \"ich bin\narbeitend\", the \"arbeitend\" would be a predicative expression, which is\ndifferent both from an adverb and from a way of expressing what English would\ndo with present continuous. It simply describes a state that you are in. For a\nbetter discussion, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicative_expression\n\nI understand why it is tempting to say that the present participle is used to\nform a present continuous. That would feel very natural to an English speaker\nwho is familiar with Latin. And it feels almost but not quite as if German\nshould do the same. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some regional German\ndialects did this. There is a lot of cross pollination between all of these\nlanguages, but in the process grammatical concepts get repurposed and subtly\nchange.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 18:07 UTC (Sun) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link]\n\n> I program, I am programming, I do program.\n\nAnd where do you see different present tenses?\n\n> Well, I was taught we have the same 6 tenses.

Of course other\nlanguages can distinguish between these two forms if needed, it's just most of\nthe time there are no need to distingush them.\n\nWorse: the form that is conveying more often needed meaning (that I'm\nprogramming right now) is longer and more complicated.\n\nEnglish is similar to BASH here: like in BASH you may want to write $* or \"$@\"\nand, most of the time, short form is not needed and not used so English insist\non use of longer form where difference between two forms are meaningless (e.g.\non a programmer's forum saying that you know how to program is not useful but\nsaying that you are in process of writing program is useful).\n\n> Coupled with the occasional giveaway of \"I programming\" which simply doesn't\n> exist in standard English.\n\nIndeed. English grammar is extremely inflexible, rigid and, I would even say,\n\u201cstrange\u201d. It takes a long time for a speaker of some other language where\nwords don't come in a sentence in any particular order to adjust to it.\n\nEnglish, of course, have no choice because it has words that may sound\nidentically when used as noun and as verb, but, again, problem arises not when\nEnglish offers you more capabilities (you may just ignore them) but when it\ndoesn't have capabilities that other languages have (similarly to how\ntranslating program from statically-typed language to dynamically-typed is\neasy but going in the other direction is not).\n\n### On continuing\n\nPosted Apr 22, 2024 13:57 UTC (Mon) by corbet (editor, #1) [Link]\n\nIndeed, this conversation has gone fairly far afield, and it seems like a good\ntime to wind it down.\n\nRemember Gentoo? ... this is an article about Gentoo ...\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 9:29 UTC (Sun) by malmedal (subscriber, #56172) [Link]\n\n> And how many other languages have THREE different forms of the present\n> tense?

The problem with AI is not that it\ncan't extrapolate, it's that the only thing it can do is extrapolate. A human\ncan extrapolate, but we can also switch to inductive reasoning, deduction,\ncause-and-effect, and most importantly a human is able to combine multiple\nforms of reasoning to get results quickly and efficiently.\n\nNote that a human writer has also had terabytes worth of language as examples\nbefore they start producing things that are correct - we spend years in\n\"childhood\" where we're learning from examples.

A really fast reader might be able to read a\nkilobyte per minute. If they read at that speed for 16 hours a day, they might\nbe able to manage a megabyte per day. That would mean a gigabyte every 3 years\nof solid, fast reading doing nothing else every day. So a truly dedicated\nreader could manage at most a few tens of GB over a lifetime. Most people\nprobably manage at most a few GB. Speaking isn't a whole lot faster. That\nmeans most humans are able to learn their native languages using orders of\nmagnitude fewer examples than LLMs are.\n\nTo me, this is a sign the LLM stuff, at least the way we're doing it, is\nprobably a side track. It's a neat way to get something that produces\ncompetent text, and because it has been trained on a huge range of texts it\nwill be able to interact in just about any area. But it's a very inefficient\nway of learning language compared to the way humans do it.

It also assumes that we have no pre-prepared pathways to assist\nwith language acquisition.\n\nOnce you add in full-fidelity video and audio at the quality that a child can\nsee and hear, you get to terabytes of data input before a human can read.

A huge problem with LLM is\nthat they are largely fed a single kind of input. It's no wonder chatbots have\nproblems interacting with the world; they've read about it but never dealt\nwith it firsthand. If we want an AI that can deal with the world as we do, it\nneeds a full set of senses and probably a body so it can do something more\nthan chat or paint.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 23, 2024 9:26 UTC (Tue) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link]\n\nRight, but you were claiming that because the input to a child can be\nsummarised in a small amount of text, the child's neural network is clearly\nlearning from that small amount of data, and not from the extra signals\ncarried in spoken work and in body language as well.\n\nThis is what makes the \"training data is so big\" argument unreasonable; it\ninvolves a lot of assumptions about the training data needed to make a human\ncapable of what we do, and then says \"if my assumptions are correct, AI is\ndata-inefficient\", without justifying the assumptions.\n\nPersonally, I think the next big step we need to take is to get Machine\nLearning to a point where training and inference happen at the same time;\nright now, there's a separation between training (teaching the computer) and\ninference (using the trained model), such that no learning can take place\nduring inference, and no useful output can be extracted during training.

Now people with a great idea but not quite as good writing skills get a\nchance they might not otherwise.\n\nCopyright protects the economic value and moral value of a work. The fact that\nother people can now also create new works easier does not reduce the value of\ncopyright at all (or break it). Copyright does not protect all uses of your\nwork, only those that reduce the economic value of the original.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 20:49 UTC (Fri) by mb (subscriber, #50428) [Link]\n\n>The value of a copyrighted work is not dependant on the amount of effort that\nwent into it.\n\nI did never claim that.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 22:37 UTC (Sun) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link]\n\n> And there is no single right or wrong answer to whether something is a\n> derived works. Always been like that.\n\nThis is prosaically true in the sense that it's ultimately a judgment call on\nthe part of the trier of fact, but as a matter of law, there absolutely is an\nanswer, and the law generally expects you to know it. You can wave your hands\nabout copyright \"breaking\" all you want, but the legal system is not going to\nbe impressed.\n\nYou are correct, however, that AI does put the legal system in a bit of an\nawkward spot. Up until now, derivative works have been decided by the trier of\nfact (judge or jury) looking at the original and the allegedly infringing work\nside by side, and seeing if they're close enough that copying can be inferred.\nThe legal term used in the US is \"substantially similar\" (or \"strikingly\nsimilar\"), but most countries are going to use a similar method in their\ncourts.\n\nThat works fine when you have one original. When you have two billion\noriginals, and an unbounded set of potentially infringing works, it's a bit\nimpractical. Right now, the unspoken expectation is that the plaintiff has to\ndo the leg work of figuring out which images to put side by side in this\ncomparison (US courts would say the plaintiff is \"master of their complaint\"\nand thus responsible for deciding exactly what is and is not in scope). That's\nnot easy in the case of AI, and it's the main reason (or at least, a major\nreason) that artists have struggled to sue image generators successfully.\n\nBut that does not imply that an image generator \"erases\" copyright as you have\nput it. If an artist is able to find a specific infringing output that closely\nresembles their art, and their art was used as a training input, then the\nartist might have a case. Saying \"the AI breaks copyright\" is not going to be\nan effective defense.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 21, 2024 22:39 UTC (Sun) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link]\n\n(Also, everything I said about image generators applies to LLMs, except for\nthe \"struggled to sue\" part.

The AI is the *assistant*. If, however,\nthe AI is the *author* then you don't want to go near it with a barge pole.\n\nIn other words, if there is a *human* involved, who has sanity checked it for\nhallucinations, accuracy, what-have-you, then that's fine.

For one, the big inherent\nproblem of this type of system, just making shit up, really makes it\nunsuitable to use for anything but optional autocomplete, especially compared\nto the more specialized models that already exist. Secondly, while the AI\nboosters keep talking about exponential improvements, that hasn't actually\nhappened. GPT-4 was released a year ago and the best openai can do is a few\npercentage point improvement on some benchmarks. Which is not what you'd\nexpect in a field where improvements are supposedly so low hanging that people\npredict a doubling of capability (unspecified) every 18 months. Hardware has\nbeen looking a bit better with the usual dozen percentage points perf/w we've\ncome to expect every 2-3 years, but it's hardly revolutionary either.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how much development effort will remain with this\ntechnology when investors realize it's been severely overhyped in two or three\nquarters or however long it'll take them.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 19, 2024 10:44 UTC (Fri) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nwell, the LLMs available *today*, from what I\u2019ve tried, are pretty close for\nme to be able to replace Grek KH and his stable picks, while I haven\u2019t even\ntried to fine tune the models, all zero-shot classification...
