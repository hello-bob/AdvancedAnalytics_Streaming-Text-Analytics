Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and\nUS News.\n\nApr 20, 2024, 6:05 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.

You create a foundation. At least, that\u2019s the\napproach Home Assistant founder Paulus Schoutsen has chosen.\n\nThis week, Home Assistant announced it is now part of the Open Home\nFoundation. The newly formed non-profit will own and govern all of Home\nAssistant and its related entities. Its creators and inaugural board members \u2014\nSchoutsen, Guy Sie, Pascal Vizeli, and J. Nick Koston \u2014 all work on Home\nAssistant, and the foundation has no other members so far.\n\nIn a press release, the foundation stated its aim is \u201cto fight against\nsurveillance capitalism, and offer a counterbalance to Big Tech influence, in\nthe smart home \u2014 by focusing on privacy, choice, and sustainability for smart\nhome users.\u201d\n\nThe Open Home Foundation is the new owner of Home Assistant.\n\nImage: Open Home Foundation\n\nA community-built, open-source smart home platform, Home Assistant differs\nfrom its major \u201cbig tech\u201d competitors \u2014 such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home,\nbecause it offers four things simultaneously: local control of your smart home\nthat can be faster and more reliable than the cloud: authority over and access\nto all your data; compatibility with almost every connected gadget \u2014\nregardless of protocol or manufacturer; and the ability to make them work\ntogether. While many competitors offer some of these, few offer all.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear what our intentions are to the world: That we\u2019re\ndriven by a higher goal than money. And that we are not for sale.\u201d\n\nHome Assistant is known for its unmatched power and flexibility, but so far\nthe platform, which has an estimated one million users, has struggled to reach\nthe mainstream. Home Assistant can have a steep learning curve, especially\nwhen compared to the relative simplicity of a platform like Alexa or Apple\nHome. Onboarding devices can be complicated, the UI has lots of room for\nimprovement, and integrations can be hit or miss.\n\n\u201cHome Assistant is no one\u2019s first smart home platform,\u201d says Schoutsen. \u201cWhen\npeople outgrow their existing systems and want more advanced control, that\u2019s\nwhen they come to Home Assistant.\u201d But he sees that the platform is at a\ntipping point.\n\nWith the arrival of the industry-backed smart home standard Matter (with which\nHome Assistant is heavily involved), smart home adoption is pushing into the\nmainstream. Home Assistant wants to stay swimming alongside Apple, Amazon,\nSamsung, and Google, all of which it\u2019s been competing with in the smart home\nfor roughly a decade now. Home Assistant has never accepted investors, says\nSchoutsen, and he sees a foundation as the best way to grow.\n\n### Related\n\n  * How to start a smart home using Home Assistant\n  * Home Assistant SkyConnect is a great excuse to start your smart home from scratch\n  * Home Assistant Green makes the most powerful smart home platform more accessible\n\nSchoutsen outlined the platform\u2019s future roadmap at its annual State of the\nOpen Home presentation on Saturday, April 20th. In an interview ahead of the\nlive stream, he told The Verge about some of the bigger changes planned for\nHome Assistant following this transition:\n\n  * The Home Assistant Green smart home hub will be sold on Amazon this year, the first time the organization will sell directly to consumers. A new line of Home Assistant Connect dongles for Thread / Zigbee and Z-Wave will follow. These connect the hub to gadgets that use those protocols (and will replace the SkyConnect dongle).\n  * The Home Assistant Works With program, which offers certification for products that work with the platform, is expanding. New partners include Aqara, Ultraloq, and Jasco.\n  * A new Home Assistant voice control hardware device running Home Assistant\u2019s local smart home voice assistant is planned for release at the end of the year.\n  * Home Assistant is working with Nvidia to incorporate a local AI model into the home automation platform.\n  * The platform has been researching ways to improve its UI to make it easier for everyone in the home to use Home Assistant. It\u2019s calling this the \u201cHome-approval factor,\u201d a variant on the wife- or spouse-approval factor that encompasses everyone in a home.\n\n(See sidebar for more on these.)\n\nWorks With Home Assistant badges are starting to appear on products to show\nthat a product is certified to work with Home Assistant.\n\nImage: Home Assistant\n\n### More on what\u2019s next for Home Assistant\n\nMore Works With Partners\n\nThe Home Assistant Works With Program, launched in 2022, is expanding to\npartner with more smart home companies and certify their products as\nguaranteed to Work With Home Assistant. Partners include Leviton, Aqara,\nUltraloq, Jasco, Third Reality, and more. \u201cThe label means we can guarantee it\nworks with Home Assistant,\u201d says Schoutsen. Each features the type of\nconnection it works with and there will be no cloud-only partners. \u201cWe only\nallow a cloud badge as a secondary badge besides a local badge. [For cloud-\nonly products] we can\u2019t guarantee it will work if they turn off the cloud one\nday.\u201d\n\nMore voice control hardware\n\nWork on a locally-based Home Assistant voice assistant that began last year is\ncontinuing, and a Home Assistant voice assistant hardware device is being\ndeveloped. \u201cWe want to make our own hardware that people can put in their\nhomes and replace Google and Amazon with,\u201d says Schoutsen. The device should\narrive at the end of this year, he says, hinting at a future screen-based\ndevice. \u201cWe are looking at screens, nothing official to announce, but we\u2019re\nlooking at E-ink. We don\u2019t need color, as we don\u2019t need ads.\u201d\n\nMore AI\n\nHome Assistant is exploring incorporating generative AI into home automation\nbut, crucially, using local processing. \u201cSome people are using ChatGPT with\nHome Assistant, but it\u2019s so slow,\u201d says Schoutsen. They are working with\nNvidia to use its Jetson platform to power LLMs for Home Assistant.\n\nThe collective goal of all these efforts is to move Home Assistant toward\nbecoming a more mainstream, out-of-the-box option for smart home users. \u201cWe\nwant to be a consumer brand,\u201d says Schoutsen. \u201cYou should be able to walk into\na Home Depot and be like, \u2018I care about my privacy; this is the smart home hub\nI need.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe foundation will also advocate for the development of \u201cbetter\u201d smart home\nproducts, says Schoutsen, \u201cDevices with local APIs and that are built\nsustainably. Because there needs to be products compatible with Home Assistant\nthat you can trust.\u201d\n\n### Is Home Assistant all grown up now?\n\nSchoutsen, who started Home Assistant in 2013 with a Philips Hue smart\nlighting bridge, a Python script, and a mission to control his lights any way\nhe wanted to, sees the foundation as necessary to both protect Home Assistant\nand move it forward. \u201cI want to make it clear what our intentions are to the\nworld: That we\u2019re driven by a higher goal than money. And that we are not for\nsale,\u201d he says. The new ownership structure provides a stronger platform for\ngrowth. \u201cIt gives us a way for people to take us seriously, to help us reach a\nbigger audience,\u201d he says.\n\nTo date, the informal way Home Assistant operates has been confusing to\ncompanies looking to partner with the platform, says Schoutsen. The launch of\nthe for-profit Nabu Casa five years ago provided a revenue stream for Home\nAssistant through an optional cloud computing service that now supports 33\nfull-time employees.\n\nThe foundation, which was created last month as a Verein (\u201cassociation\u201d) in\nSwitzerland, formally separates Nabu Casa from Home Assistant. The foundation\nwill own all of the open-source projects, standards, drivers, and libraries\nassociated with Home Assistant, along with ESPHome, ZigPy, and Wyoming.\n\nNabu Casa will continue as a for-profit entity running the cloud and selling\nHome Assistant hardware and will operate as a commercial partner of the\nfoundation. \u201cFunding and support can only flow one way\u2014from Nabu Casa, and any\nfuture partners, to the Open Home Foundation and its projects,\u201d says Pascal\nVizeli, co-founder of Nabu Casa, and a foundation board member.\n\nIt also protects Home Assistant from being sold. Swiss law prohibits members\nof a non-profit Verein from benefiting from it, Schoutsen explained to The\nVerge. \u201cOur articles state \u2018There will be no direct distribution to members in\nreturn for activities performed for the association or as any other form of\ngratuity in any kind,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he says. Similarly, he says the foundation can only\nhave income from membership fees, donations, license programs, and\ncontributions from partners.\n\nThe Open Home Foundation\u2019s principles are Privacy, Choice, and Sustainability\nin the smart home.\n\nStill, Home Assistant users may be wary of these larger structural changes.\nThe Verge asked Schoutsen how he could assuage any fears that this will\nnegatively impact current users. It\u2019s hard not to draw parallels with\nSmartThings\u2019 shift to become a more \u201cconsumer-friendly\u201d platform following its\npurchase by Samsung.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly doing this balance between ease of use and advanced features\nand I don\u2019t know how we are going to keep balancing this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\ncannot forget about our power users. The platform is open; maybe at some\npoint, there might be a split where we have the basic UI and the advanced UI;\nI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work. But because we are open, because our\ndata is accessible, they\u2019re all part of the community, even if they don\u2019t use\nour specific tools that we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bigger audience that I would like to reach that we don\u2019t today.\u201d\n\nHe is also wary of entering the business side of the smart home while\nrecognizing its necessity to grow Home Assistant. \u201cWe need to be very careful\nmoving into this space,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge with partnership people is\nthat they\u2019re very business-focused. And that\u2019s not how we operate.\u201d\n\nHe hopes the foundation will provide the necessary building blocks for growth\nwhile protecting the platform\u2019s core beliefs and values. \u201cI think we can get\neven bigger now that we have this stepping stone. The foundation is a real\nentity. People will take us more seriously. I think the press will take us\nmore seriously. There\u2019s a bigger audience that I would like to reach that we\ndon\u2019t today.\u201d\n\nWhile today's mainstream smart home platforms offer simple and convenient ways\nto control your smart lights, locks, and other gadgets, the lack of access to\nyour data, limited options for local control over devices, and some platforms\u2019\nover-reliance on the cloud can put the user at a disadvantage.\n\nMatter \u2014 which aims to bring local control and interoperability across all\nsmart home devices and platforms\u2014is designed to solve some of these problems.\nBut Matter isn\u2019t a platform; you\u2019ll still need to use an app on your phone or\ncomputer to control your home. Home Assistant wants to be that app.\n\nCan it move fast enough? There\u2019s a long road between forming a foundation and\npacking Home Depots with Home Assistant hubs and gadgets that pledge Home\nAssistant loyalty. In the meantime, Matter is also providing other platforms \u2014\nsuch as Aqara, Homey, and Hubitat \u2014 the tools to expand and grow into more\nviable alternatives to big tech in the smart home. It\u2019s going to be\ninteresting to see where everything lands.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The little smart home platform that could\n\n  2. ## How Phish turned Las Vegas\u2019 Sphere into the ultimate music visualizer\n\n  3. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  4. ## Tesla recalls all 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal\n\n  5. ## Zack Snyder\u2019s Rebel Moon movies are a fandom menace\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Smart Home\n\n  * ### Is Crossrope\u2019s smart jump rope worth $200?\n\n  * ### Maybe I don\u2019t want a Rosey the Robot after all\n\n  * ### 8BitDo\u2019s NES-inspired mechanical keyboard hits all-time low price\n\n  * ### Amazon\u2019s colorful Echo Pop is on sale with a free smart bulb for just $23\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
