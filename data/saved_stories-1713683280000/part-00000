It comes from the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean.\n  * The seaweed has harmed Caribbean economies and human health, making it a national emergency in some island-nations.\n  * Over the past decade, entrepreneurs and scientists have found ways to turn sargassum into nutrient-rich biofertilizers, biostimulants and other organic products to boost agricultural yields while cutting back on chemicals.\n  * But there are hurdles to scaling the industry, including sargassum\u2019s inconsistent arrival, heavy metal content and fast decomposition rates.\n\nIn 2015, smelly mats of a brown macroalgae called sargassum piled as high as\n1.2 meter (4 feet) on the beaches of Barbados, recalls Joshua Forte. It was\nthe fourth year in what has become an annual nightmare, with an estimated\n18,100 kilograms (20 tons) of seaweed inundating Caribbean shorelines each\nyear and wrecking the region\u2019s tourism-centered economies.\n\nThe onslaught of seaweed reeked of rotten eggs, but Forte smelled something\nelse: opportunity.\n\nA year earlier, Forte founded an organic fertilizer company called Red Diamond\nCompost. He was already selling a soil additive from sunflower seeds called\nLiquid Sunshine. But the sargassum seemed too big to ignore.\n\nSo, Forte started to collect the seaweed by hand, hauling 27-kg (60-pound)\nbags of it into the back of a pickup truck. It became the raw material for a\nnew product called Supreme Sea, a soil additive that includes growth-\nstimulating plant hormones and microorganisms extracted from the sargassum.\nAfter extraction, Forte composts what\u2019s left over into a humus-rich product\nthat\u2019s safe for crops. The idea was to \u201chave as big of an impact as possible\non the influx of sargassum while contributing in a positive way to\nagriculture,\u201d Forte told Mongabay.\n\nSargassum contains a slew of nutrients, minerals and microorganisms that can\nfoster and even accelerate plant growth, such as iron, magnesium, potassium,\ncalcium and more. But rather than add nutrients such as nitrogen and\nphosphorus into the soil, it does something savvy: Its properties help plants\nbe more efficient at taking up those nutrients, incentivizing less synthetic\nfertilizer application in exchange for higher yields and healthier plants and\ncrops. It\u2019s a trending solution that could double as both a regional economic\nopportunity and a new tool for agroecology, a sustainable farming approach\nthat targets food security in tandem with environmental health. Now, a few\nother entrepreneurs across the Caribbean are developing an industry for\nsargassum-based agricultural products \u2014 and interest is growing, Forte said.\n\n\u201cIt could be really huge for the Caribbean economy,\u201d said Allen McGonagill,\nthe chief sustainability officer for Carbonwave, a company collecting\nsargassum in Mexico and Puerto Rico. He said sargassum can be used to make a\nslew of products, from plastic- and leather-like materials to biofuels and\ncosmetics. If these industries become large enough, they could collectively\nkeep sargassum off the beaches, which would be a boon for the tourism sector.\n\nRed Diamond Compost founder and CEO, Joshua Forte, leads a discussion about\nthe importance of organic fertilizers for health and food security. Image\ncourtesy of Joshua Forte.\n\nScientists think nitrogen pollution from agricultural runoff in the Amazon\nRiver Basin is one of the main reasons why the sargassum blooms have grown so\nout of control over the past decade or so, in addition to warmer ocean\ntemperatures from climate change and increased volumes of Saharan dust, which\ncarries added nutrients as it wafts over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\u201cTaking what nature is producing in overabundance and finding good uses for\nthat is just such a better way of thinking about how we produce materials than\nthe synthetics mindset\u201d of prioritizing cookie-cutter production, McGonagill\ntold Mongabay. A branch of Carbonwave, called Sarga Agriscience, is\nspecifically focused on creating a plant-growth extract called SargaExtra.\n\n\u201cSargassum lends itself to the agriculture side, primarily because of the\nvolume,\u201d said Jonas Kunz, Carbonwave\u2019s agriculture director. Plus, he added,\nsargassum \u201chas this kind of natural cocktail of good ingredients.\u201d\n\nSargassum acts like a sponge in the ocean, absorbing nutrients and minerals as\nit floats around the Atlantic. But that comes with one particularly dangerous\ndrawback: Much of the seaweed contains high levels of arsenic, making it\nextremely dangerous to apply on soil without treating it first. Some farmers\nin Vieques, Puerto Rico, did just that, prompting an islandwide law\nprohibiting the use of sargassum for fertilizers and composts.\n\nTo avoid this health hazard, fertilizer companies, as well as folks creating\nat-home versions of composts from sargassum, need to properly rinse and\nprocess the seaweed. At Sarga Agriscience, this was a crucial step in the\ncompany\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cWe had to really look at the extraction method, and we found ways in which we\ncan essentially extract all the good stuff and concentrate that,\u201d Kunz said.\nCarbonwave uses a cold-pressing process, squeezing out the nutrients without\ndestroying any of the beneficial proteins with heat or acids. They also don\u2019t\nuse heavy chemicals to filter out the unwanted ingredients, such as heavy\nmetals. Other ways of turning sargassum into organic agricultural products are\nby fermentation, where microbes break down sugars and other components, or by\ndrying the seaweed and then grinding it up. The latter doesn\u2019t make the\nvaluable components accessible to plants because they\u2019re still trapped inside\nthe cells, McGonagill explained.\n\nSargassum\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients also makes it a helpful aid to\nterrestrial plants. \u201cWe\u2019re helping the [crop] plant be more efficient at\ntaking those nutrients out of the soil,\u201d McGonagill added.\n\nIt\u2019s a tool that can help boost yields as much as 10%, Kunz said \u2014 a\nsignificant increase. So far, their team has seen the best results in barley,\ncorn and soy. And while organic additives such as SargaExtra and other\nbiostimulants aren\u2019t total replacements for fertilizer, they can reduce the\namount needed.\n\nSargassum overgrown in Oistins, Barbados, in 2018.

Image by Joshua Forte.\n\n### A nutrient-pollution solution\n\nSargassum-based plant growth products, such as SargaExtra and Red Diamond\u2019s\nSupreme Sea, may be efficient means of not only reducing sargassum on\ncoastlines, but also of reducing nitrogen inputs in soil.\n\nNitrogen loads from synthetic fertilizers pose a global problem: When excess\nfertilizer runs off into rivers, lakes and oceans, or when it trickles down\ninto groundwater, it creates a nitrogen surplus, which can cause harmful algal\nblooms and threaten human health.\n\nAs a case in point, Red Diamond conducted trials of its Supreme Sea\nbiostimulant on sports turfs in the United Kingdom with synthetic fertilizers\nto test which combination resulted in the most optimal turf color. They found\nthat halving the quantity of synthetic fertilizers while using Supreme Sea\nproduced better color than synthetic fertilizers alone.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to understand ... how the product affects the efficiency of\nthe nutrient uptake by the plants,\u201d Forte said. \u201c[The result] kind of\nindicates that a lot of nitrogen is still being put into the environment\nthat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\n\nRed Diamond has tested its biostimulant in other locations too. Field trials\nin Spain showed yield increases in tomatoes and cucumbers, and they\u2019re\nbeginning to test products in Cameroon and other African countries. Forte said\nthey aim to improve food security and soil health around the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge need for that type of improvement in the Caribbean alone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have paid as much attention to producing good food the way\nwe used to produce good food,\u201d said Marcia Brandon, managing director for the\nCaribbean Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Livelihoods, a Barbados-based\nNGO dedicated to helping entrepreneurs kickstart their ideas. \u201cWe are known in\nthis region for producing agriculture ... but somehow, we let it slip away\nwith the introduction of fertilizers and different chemicals. We have not\nstood guard over our own food supply.\u201d\n\nBrandon considers Red Diamond part of the solution to food security and\nsovereignty in the Caribbean. If Barbados can reinvigorate its soil and use\nmore sustainable products like Forte\u2019s, she said, then the island could undo\nits dependence on chemicals within the next decade.\n\nFarmers are generally opposed to reducing their fertilizer inputs, McGonagill\nsaid, so he hopes products like SargaExtra can incentivize cutting back on\nfertilizer use by a small percentage.\n\n\u201cWe do see part of our role as harnessing those nutrients and then putting\n[them]back into agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\nGrupo Ensol, the Carobonwave collection team, loads sargassum into a bin in\nQuintana Roo, Mexico.

He added that\nit\u2019s helpful to think of sargassum more as an invasive species \u2014 a foreign,\nnuisance organism that needs to be removed.\n\n\u201cWhile I think we are one of the largest companies that are collecting\nsargassum and trying to put it to use, we are still only scratching the\nsurface,\u201d McGonagill said.\n\nIndeed, of the 20 million estimated tons of sargassum that makes its way\nacross the Caribbean each year, Carbonwave collected just 25,000 tons last\nyear.\n\n\u201cIf the agricultural industry adopted sargassum-based extracts, it could\nentirely solve the problem of sargassum on the beaches,\u201d McGonagill added.\n\u201cBut, obviously, that\u2019s a big transition for the industry.\u201d\n\nSeasonality remains one of the biggest challenges to scaling up production.\nAlthough huge amounts of sargassum hit the beaches annually from March to\nOctober, it isn\u2019t available year-round. Plus, the exact amount varies from\nyear to year. Estimates currently rely on a combination of satellite data and\nmanual measurements on beaches. As of yet, accurate estimates are difficult to\npin down.\n\nFor that reason, Sarga Ag produces extra product during sargassum season and\nplans for the remaining inventory. Their liquid product can stay stored on\nshelves, but for smaller companies, this seasonality is a barrier to\nestablishing a reliable sargassum-based business.\n\nThe Carbonwave team rinses off excess sand and debris from the sargassum\nbefore loading it onto a conveyor belt where it undergoes a visual inspection\nfor quality. Image courtesy of Carbonwave.\n\n\u201cThere is a problem: It is not predictable,\u201d said Daveian Morrison, the\nfounder of a Jamaican company called Awganic Inputs that was using sargassum\nfor goat feed. But when Morrison saw research citing concerns about arsenic\nlevels, he abandoned goat-feed production. He said he\u2019d like to see more\nresearch on arsenic levels across the Caribbean to gain a better understanding\nof how it\u2019s distributed throughout the environment \u2014 and he would eagerly jump\nback into the goat feed sector once the science is clearer.\n\nMany studies have quantified arsenic concentrations in sargassum across the\nCaribbean in an attempt to assess its scope. But concentrations vary from\nlocation to location, making localized testing necessary.\n\nCollecting large volumes of seaweed is, no pun intended, another major\nbarrier. Not only is timing essential, but using boats and equipment is a\nconsiderable cost compared with the time-intensive manual labor of collecting\nsargassum by hand.\n\nThat\u2019s why Forte\u2019s next big investment at Red Diamond is a floating barrier\nwith netting that extends 3 feet deep to capture sargassum before it hits the\nshore. This could also help trap the seaweed for weeks as a way to extend the\ntime it\u2019s available for harvest.\n\nAs soon as sargassum hits the shore, it starts to decompose. This releases\nsmelly hydrogen sulfide and ammonia into the air, powerful toxins that can\ncause respiratory issues. And while it can be collected from beaches, it needs\nto be fresh enough to use for biofertilizers.\n\nCarbonwave mostly collects seaweed onshore and in the shallows; collecting it\ntoo far offshore, McGonagill pointed out, can disrupt the seaweed\u2019s function\nas a nursery for small fish and other critters in the open ocean. But beached\nsargassum can entangle wildlife, including preventing sea turtle hatchlings\nfrom reaching the water.\n\nSargassum collection bins on a beach in Quintana Roo, Mexico.

Mexico\nuses sargassum for a long list of products, such as eco-concrete and biogas.\nAnd in Miami, a recent initiative offered cash prizes for innovative uses of\nsargassum as a mitigation measure, including Carbonwave and a St. Lucian\nbiofertilizer company called Algas Organics. As the industry grows, Morrison\nanticipated that \u201cownership\u201d over sargassum, depending on its location in the\nwater, could become a point of contention.\n\nFor now, the agroecological benefits of using sargassum to help produce more\nnutritious food are what keep Forte motivated at Red Diamond.\n\nAs a child, his grandmother\u2019s garden was paradise. He climbed mango trees,\nplucked ripe bananas off the stems and stole the occasional \u201cfinger fruit,\u201d a\nlocal term for carambola (star fruit, Averrhoa carambola), as an afternoon\nsnack. Forte watched as she recycled plant matter back into the soil, allowing\nthe crops to proliferate year-round.\n\nLooking back, Forte realized his grandmother was practicing what is now called\npermaculture, a style of agroecology that prioritizes recycling nutrients in a\nzero-waste manner.\n\n\u201cNature is something that is ever-changing,\u201d Forte said. \u201cWe have to be as\nflexible and as adaptable as nature to be able to work with it effectively.\u201d\n\nBanner image: Sargassum in Cuba\u2019s Villa Clara province.
