By adding engaging\nvisuals, vocal intonation or body language to our digital interactions, video\nbridges the gaps that text alone cannot.\n\nHowever, until recently, only a few people in a company had the ability or\nskills to produce and distribute video at scale. So in 2017, we set out on a\nmission to change that by building a platform that allows companies to fully\nembrace video for business communications and knowledge sharing, and transform\nany employee into a video creator in the process.\n\nAt the center of Synthesia\u2019s platform are our AI avatars: dynamic and lifelike\ndigital personas that blend the best of human and artificial intelligence into\none seamless experience. Over 200,000 people have used our 225 avatars to\ncreate more than 18 million video presentations and published them in over 130\nlanguages.\n\n## Introducing Expressive Avatars\n\nToday, we are excited to unveil the fourth generation of Synthesia\u2019s AI\navatars which we\u2019re calling Expressive Avatars. Expressive Avatars are powered\nby our EXPRESS-1 model for realistic avatar performance. By training a model\nto understand the intricate relationship between what we say and how we say\nit, Expressive Avatars can now perform their script with the correct tone of\nvoice, body language and lip sync, like a real actor would.\n\nWith these new avatars, we\u2019re not just creating digital renders; we\u2019re\nintroducing digital actors. This technology brings a level of sophistication\nand realism to digital avatars that blurs the line between the virtual and the\nreal.\n\nExpressive Avatars are the world\u2019s first avatars fully generated with AI. More\nspecifically, our EXPRESS-1 model uses large, pre-trained models as a backbone\nto drive the performance for Expressive Avatars, combined with diffusion to\nmodel complex multimodal distributions.\n\nEXPRESS-1 predicts every movement and facial expression in real-time, aligning\nseamlessly with the timings, intonations, and emphasis of spoken language.\nThis results in performances that are astonishingly naturalistic and human-\nlike, setting a new standard in the industry.\n\nWhereas other solutions available from our competitors are limited by pre-\nrecorded and pre-defined dynamics, Synthesia\u2019s fourth generation avatars are\ncapable of generating entirely new and unique performances, greatly expanding\nthe range of expression and interaction.\n\nThis leap forward allows for a performance space that was previously\nunimaginable, offering human-like realism in terms of their delivery.\n\nYou can experience the true power of our Expressive Avatars on our website at\nwww.synthesia.io/avatars. The text acts as the script which our avatars use to\ndeliver a variety of performances.\n\nIf one rendition doesn\u2019t quite capture the desired emotion or emphasis, users\ncan simply regenerate for a different take. This feature empowers users to\nachieve the perfect expression for their needs, making each interaction unique\nand tailored.\n\n## How Expressive Avatars work\n\nThat\u2019s because Expressive Avatars don\u2019t just mimic human speech; they\nunderstand its context using our custom built EXPRESS-1 model. Whether the\nconversation is cheerful or somber, our avatars adjust their performance\naccordingly, displaying a level of empathy and understanding that was once the\nsole domain of human actors.\n\nThe generative capabilities of these new avatars also extend beyond mere\nmotion. Their facial expressions, blinking, and even eye gaze are now\nperfectly attuned to their speech. Expressive Avatars synchronize flawlessly\nwith audio inputs, ensuring that every gesture and expression aligns perfectly\nwith the spoken word. This harmony of motion and sound elevates the realism of\nour avatars and captures every nuance of human expression, bringing our\navatars to life like never before.\n\n## Safety built-in from day one\n\nSynthesia has been focused on developing AI responsibly from day one. We are\naware that Expressive Avatars are a powerful new technology, released during\nan important year for democracy, when billions of people around the world\nexercise their right to vote.\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen how, in the hands of companies who don\u2019t think about trust and\nsafety, AI can be misused to interfere with our civic processes or cause\nindividual and societal harm.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019ve taken additional steps to prevent the misuse of our platform,\nincluding updating our policies to restrict the type of content people can\nmake, investing in the early detection of bad faith actors, increasing the\nteams that work on AI safety, and experimenting with content credentials\ntechnologies such as C2PA - you can read more about these efforts on our blog.\n\n## The future of communication and collaboration in the workplace\n\nExpressive Avatars are the first step towards the next frontier of digital\ncommunication and knowledge sharing. Imagine for example the typical\nonboarding experience for a new hire: today, it\u2019s a static video which is\nstill an improvement over a lengthy document.\n\nBut soon you\u2019ll be able to recreate the entire workplace experience inside our\nplatform, with AI avatars that can move around in three dimensional spaces and\ncommunicate with you or other avatars, showing you around the workspace,\nhelping you find a meeting room, teaching you about your company and its\nproducts, or introducing you to your colleagues before you\u2019ve met them in real\nlife.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has been one of the first companies to get early\naccess to this technology.\n\n> Tanuja Randery, EMEA MD, Amazon Web Services said: \u201cI experienced first-hand\n> having my own avatar created for my keynote at AWS Summit London, and saw\n> the potential for this technology to deliver engaging business\n> communications in many different languages and scenarios that simply\n> wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise. We\u2019re delighted that Synthesia has selected\n> AWS for scalable, flexible, and secure cloud compute to build and train\n> their large language models which generate Expressive Avatars.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what our partners have to say about Expressive Avatars:\n\n> Philippe Botteri, Partner at Accel said: \"From the moment we met Victor and\n> Steffen, Synthesia stood out as one of the few generative AI companies that\n> brought together an exceptional founding team, differentiated technology and\n> a clear ROI for enterprise customers. Victor, Steffen and the Synthesia\n> team\u2019s ability to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on the research\n> front while translating those breakthroughs into customer-facing\n> improvements in the product has always shone through and today\u2019s launch of\n> Expressive Avatars is another fantastic example of this. The team has really\n> set a new standard for the rest of the industry!\"\n\n> \u201cSynthesia's new Expressive Avatars are truly a breakthrough in generative\n> AI,\" said Josh Coyne, Partner at Kleiner Perkins. \"We've been strong\n> supporters of Synthesia and its co-founders since the early days of the\n> company, and this new technology further reinforces our belief in the\n> immense potential of AI avatars and synthetic media to revolutionize the\n> landscape of enterprise communications and knowledge sharing.\u201d\n\n> \"The launch of Expressive Avatars is a game changer for workplace\n> communication and gives enterprises the power to create dynamic videos that\n> shape the employee experience,\" said Vidu Shanmugarajah, Partner, GV (Google\n> Ventures). \"As repeat investors since 2021, we continue to be impressed by\n> Synthesia's ability to use AI to unlock real value for the world\u2019s leading\n> companies.\"\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what people create using Expressive Avatars. As Gen Z and\nGen Alpha enter the workforce, video will become the default medium for\ncollaboration and communication at work and our AI avatars will reshape how\nemployees connect, interact and learn, creating a more dynamic and\nknowledgeable workforce fit for tomorrow.\n\nOur Blog\n\n## You might also like\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
