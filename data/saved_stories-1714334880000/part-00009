I am\nnot sure whether this is the best place to open this issue. The reason I put\nit here is because this repo is about Cloud HPC.I have been using the NAG\nFortran compiler (nagfor) intensively in the past years during the development\nof PRIMA. It is certainly one of the best Fortran compilers on the market with\nexcellent support for the recent standard and outstanding diagnostic\ninformation.However, NAG compilers have one particular limitation, which I\nbelieve is becoming more and more relevant and vital for the future of the\ncompilers: it is impossible to use NAG compilers on GitHub-hosted runners for\nCI.Among all the 11 Fortran compilers I have tried (nagfor, gfortran, ifort,\nifx, nvfortran, AOCC flang, armflang, Classic flang, LLVM flang, sunf95, and\ng95), nagfor is the only one that is unavailable on GitHub-hosted runners.\nThis is because of the unique mechanism that nagfor uses to manage it license.\nIndeed, I am more than willing to pay for a license that can be used on\nGitHub-hosted runners, even if it is VERY expensive, but it is simply\nimpossible.In a world where even MATLAB is available on GitHub-hosted runners,\nI do not think it is ideal for NAG to be such an exception. I once contacted\nyour technical support about this issue. The response was\n\n> our developers do not view this item as important where our product(s) is\n> concerned.\n\nWhat a pitty for such an excellent compiler!This issue has been discussed a\nfew times in the Fortran community. You may refer to the following for more\ndiscussions on this topic.https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/which-\ncompilers-are-available-for-ci-with-github-hosted-runners-all-but-\nnagfor/7554https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39656405As an avid user, I\nhope NAG compilers will not continue to be such an exception. It is against\nthe trend.Thanks.Zaikun Zhang Ph.D. and Assistant Professor The Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
