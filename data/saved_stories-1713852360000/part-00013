Subscribe to the\nLinux Kernel Mailing List. Want to know what's what with the Linux kernel at a\ndeep level, but without tracking every last detail? Subscribe to Linux Weekly\nNews (LWN).\n\nBut, if you want a broad, quick overview of the state of the Linux kernel, do\nwhat I did: catch Jonathan Corbet, Linux kernel developer, and LWN editor-in-\nchief, giving one of his state-of-the-kernel presentations at a major Linux\nconference.\n\nAt Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet agreed with Linus\nTorvalds, who had said earlier at the same show that everything's \"calm and\nsteady and boring\" with the next kernel, Linux 6.9. That calmness is good\nnews.\n\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 10 things you need to know\n\nHowever, Corbet also said there's some concerning news: \"In the kernel, just\nabout any bug, if you're clever enough, can be exploitable to compromise the\nsystem. The kernel is in a unique spot in the system ... it turns a lot of\nordinary bugs into vulnerabilities.\"\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nNow, there's nothing new about that situation. All operating system bugs have\nthe potential to become exploitations. This fact is underlined by Linux kernel\ndevelopers recently starting to issue their own Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures (CVE) notifications. And as Corbet explained: \"Since just about any\nbug could be a vulnerability, we're going to be careful, and we're going to be\ncautious. And we're going to assign a CVE number to just about anything that\nlooks like it could be a vulnerability at some point in the future.\"\n\nAlso: 5 Microsoft Edge features that might make it my new favorite Linux\nbrowser\n\nThat approach means there are now hundreds of Linux kernel CVEs. Since\nFebruary alone, Corbet said there have been 800 new assigned CVEs.\n\nWhat can you do to ensure the safety and security of your Linux systems?\nSimple: Make sure your distribution runs long-term stable (LTS) kernel\nreleases. These releases have fixed CVEs, and as new issues are patched,\nthey're ported into the LTS kernels.\n\nThat said, it should be remembered that Corbet pointed out that LTS releases\nwon't be supported as long as they used to be. LTS versions are now supported\nfor only two years, not six. So, as of January 2024, Linux 4.14 was no longer\nsupported. At the end of the year, this release will be joined in retirement\nby the 4.19 kernel. By 2026, only the two most recently released LTS versions\nwill be supported.\n\nAlso: Long-term support for Linux kernel to be cut as maintenance remains\nunder strain\n\nIf you're not sure what version you're using, run the following command from\nthe shell:\n\n$ uname -r\n\nIf you get any result besides a blank, you're running an LTS.\n\nWhy aren't the kernel developers supporting versions for longer? The answer is\na decrease in use (very few people, for example, were still running the six-\nyear-old 4.14 kernel) and the practical difficulties of maintaining outdated\nsoftware. This change underscores a broader shift toward current versions,\nwhich are easier to support and secure.\n\nAlso: Sparky Linux is a blazing-fast distro that can keep your older machines\nrunning for years\n\nIf you're attached to a particular Linux kernel version, your distro builder\nmay be willing to help you. Canonical, for example, provides its LTS Ubuntu\nversions with 12 years of support. OpenELA, a trade association of Linux\ndistributor CIQ, the company backing Rocky Linux, Oracle, and SUSE, is also\noffering -- via kernel-lts -- a new lease of life for the 4.14 kernel. OpenELA\nmay also provide extended support for other LTS Linux distros as they near the\nend of life.\n\nBut, looking ahead, many of you may be updating your main Linux distributions\nmore often if you want to be safe. And, trust me, you want to keep your Linux\nmachines secure. We recently came too close to a major security bug, XZ,\nslipping into Linux.\n\nOutside of security issues, Corbet said the Linux kernel developers had\nrecently finished \"the busiest development cycle yet\". That cycle was for the\n6.7 kernel release, which boasted an impressive 17,000 commits and was\nreleased in early January.\n\nLooking ahead, the forthcoming 6.9 release has \"only\" about 14,000 commits.\nBut the effort behind the scenes is not just about volume. Measuring commits\nor lines of code (LoC) is a loser's way of looking at programming work. What\nmatters most is the quality and range of features, such as memory management\nenhancements and the integration of Rust code on ARM64 architectures.\n\nAlso: How to replace Windows with Linux Mint on your PC\n\nMoving away from code, Corbet noted that the Linux kernel developer team has\nbeen trending in a good way lately. Each of the recent cycles has seen at\nleast 200 first-time contributors. It wasn't that long ago we worried about\nthe Linux kernel developers graying out. With this wave of new programmers,\nCorbet sees \"the community staying vibrant and forward-moving\".\n\nStill, as Corbet also remarked, we need to encourage companies \"to better\nsupport our community.\" That's because maintainers and long-time developers\nare burning out. They need more money and support. Without this assistance, we\ncan expect more burnout, frustrated developers, a drop in code quality, and,\neventually, more security problems.\n\nCorbet suggests looking at the Linux Kernel Contribution Maturity Model to see\nhow your business is doing. The bottom line is companies must treat Linux work\nas a top priority and not as an afterthought. This effort might not contribute\ndirectly to the bottom line, but, at this point, almost all businesses depend\non Linux to keep running -- and you can ignore this fact at your peril.\n\n#### Linux\n\nThe best Linux laptops for consumers and developers\n\nWant to save your aging computer?
