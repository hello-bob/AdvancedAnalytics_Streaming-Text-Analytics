This is extremely beneficial for\ndefenders since numerous input actions in management console sessions can\ngenerate 10's and even many 100's of events originating from a single\ninteractive click by the end user.\n\nAn additional capability that Cloud Console Cartographer provides defenders is\nthe parsing of relevant data from all events related to each mapping. For\nexample, when a user clicks on IAM->Users in the AWS Management Console and\n100+ events are generated, this framework parses these logs and extracts all\nIAM users and long-lived access keys that were active at the time the logs\nwere generated. This leads to point-in-time context of the environment and\nincreased levels of visibility into what the user was seeing in the UI at the\ntime of their activity.\n\nAn example of this IAM->Users scenario is shown below:\n\nLastly, what framework would be complete without some ASCII art:\n\n## Installation\n\n>\n>     Import-Module ./CloudConsoleCartographer.psd1\n\n## Requirements (main functionality)\n\n>\n>     pwsh 6+\n\n## Requirements (UI Visualizer)\n\n>\n>     python3.11 python3 -m pip3 install -r ./UI/Code/requirements.txt\n\n## Usage\n\nThis tool offers a CLI (Command Line Interface) for processing cloud logs and\nsimple displaying of results on the command line. More interactive analysis is\nbetter served using the Python UI Visualizer. Let's review its most common use\ncases:\n\n## Example 1 - Running the tool with local CloudTrail logs and event-level CLI\nsummary\n\nUse the demo CloudTrail session stored in ./Demo to quickly see the power of\nthe framework's aggregation and enhanced explainability, though as later\nexamples will show logs can be piped into this framework's functions without\nrequiring anything being written to disk.\n\n### Note\n\nFirst invoke Add-Signal to apply Labels and to perform Signal/mapping\nevaluation. Then pass these results to one of many output functions.\n\nRun command:\n\ndir ./Demo/InputEvents.json | Add-Signal -Verbose | Show-EventSummary -Detail signal\n\n## Example 2 - Running the tool with CloudTrail logs queried directly from\nCloudTrail API and session-level CLI summary\n\naws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=AccessKeyId,AttributeValue=ASIAPERSHENDETJEMIQ1 | Add-Signal | Show-SessionSummary\n\n## Example 3 - Using Python-based UI Visualizer\n\ncat ./Demo/InputEvents.json | Add-Signal | Show-SessionSummaryUI\n\n## About\n\nReleased at Black Hat Asia on April 18, 2024, Cloud Console Cartographer is a\nframework for condensing groupings of cloud events (e.g. CloudTrail logs) and\nmapping them to the original user input actions in the management console UI\nfor simplified analysis and explainability.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n51 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n4 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 2\n\n  * dbo-at-permiso\n  * neades2305\n\n## Languages\n\n  * PowerShell 99.0%\n  * Python 1.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
