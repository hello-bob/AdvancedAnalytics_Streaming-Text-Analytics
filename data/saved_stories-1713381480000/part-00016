Bovik (SIGBOVIK) is an annual event at\nthe Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science\u2019s Association for Computational\nHeresy, featuring research papers which try to make up for lack of merit with\nexcess of entertainment.\n\nThe Proceedings of the 2024 SIGBOVIK were published a few weeks ago, and I\u2019d\nlike to call out a few papers for your attention.\n\nAll page numbers are nominal. Add four to get physical page numbers.\n\nThe one that perhaps has the greatest industry application is The Ballmer\nPeak: An Empirical Search by Twm Stone and Jaz Stoddart (page 48), which takes\na phenomenon originally isolated by researcher Randall Munroe in 2007 and\nseeks to refine its estimated value through experiments designed to identify\nthe optimal blood alcohol content for computer coding. And they found it.\n\nA paper that may help you with your software architecture decisions is An\nempirical performence [sic] evaluation between Python and Scratch by Morgan\nNordberg (page 174), which undertakes a detailed performance comparison\nbetween two popular programming languages.\n\nOne of the great joys of research is discovering an entire new field of study\nwhich serves as a wellspring for future research. We were able to observe the\nbirth of one such field with the paper An Empirically Verified Lower Bound for\nThe Number Of Empty Pages Allowed In a SIGBOVIK Paper by Frans Skarman (page\n249). The initial paper merely sets the groundwork, and I look forward to\nfuture papers that expand our understanding.\n\nThe paper Are Centaurs Actually Half Human and Half Horse? by Kyle Batucal\n(page 367) employs image classification theory to determine whether wisdom\nfrom the ancient Greeks holds up. And the paper A computer-assisted proof that\ne is rational by R\u00e9mi Garcia and Alexandre Goldsztejn (page 375) produces a\nsurprising result that may revolutionize our understanding of numbers.\n\nAnd hidden among all the silly papers is a real research paper: A Genius\nSolution: Applications of the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to Korean Reality TV by\nJed Grabman (page 438), which takes the combinatorial game theory of impartial\ngames and applies it to an elimination game used in the Korean reality\ntelevision program The Genius.\n\nI\u2019m sentimentally partial to that last paper because my advisors during my\nbrief academic career include John H. Conway and Elwyn Berlekamp, two of the\nthree authors of Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, one of the\nfoundational texts for combinatorial game theory. The work in the Genius\nSolution paper is exactly the sort of thing we would work out as a goofy\nexercise.\n\n### Raymond Chen\n\nFollow\n\nTagged Non-Computer\n\n### Read next\n\nThe 2024/2025 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance\n\nThe pocket reference guide for 2024/2025.\n\nRaymond Chen March 8, 2024\n\n0 comment\n\nIn 2023, the G\u00e4vle Goat faces a new threat to its survival\n\nIt's bock.\n\nRaymond Chen December 18, 2023\n\n1 comment\n\n## 1 comment\n\n### Leave a commentCancel reply\n\nLog in to join the discussion or edit/delete existing comments.\n\n  * Marco Comerci April 16, 2024 10:35 pm 0\n\nI am an actual researcher and the paper on the Ballmer peak was exhilarating.\nI was also rickrolled following one of the links in the notes...\n\nLog in to Vote or Reply\n\n##### Code Block\n\nFeedback\n\nYour Privacy Choices Consumer Health Privacy\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
