The new technology significantly enhances chip logic\ndensity and performance, promising substantial improvements for high-\nperformance computing (HPC) products and data centers.\n\nHistorically, Apple is among the first companies to adopt new, state-of-the-\nart chip fabrication technologies. For example, it was the first company to\nutilize TSMC's 3nm node with the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone\n15 Pro Max, and Apple is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's upcoming\nnodes. Apple's most advanced chip designs have historically appeared in the\niPhone before making their way to the iPad and Mac lineups, and ultimately\ntrickling down to the Apple Watch and Apple TV.\n\nThe A16 technology, which TSMC plans to begin producing in 2026, incorporates\ninnovative nanosheet transistors along with a novel backside power rail\nsolution. This development is expected to provide an 8-10% increase in speed\nand a 15-20% reduction in power consumption at the same speeds compared to\nTSMC's N2P process, alongside up to a 1.10x chip density improvement.\n\nTSMC also announced the rollout of its System-on-Wafer (SoW) technology, which\nintegrates multiple dies on a single wafer to boost computing power while\noccupying less space\u2014a development that could be transformative for Apple's\ndata center operations. TSMC's first SoW offering, which is already in\nproduction, is based on Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) technology. A more advanced\nchip-on-wafer version leveraging CoWoS technology is slated for readiness in\n2027.\n\nTSMC is also making progress toward manufacturing 2nm and 1.4nm chips that are\nlikely destined for future generations of Apple silicon. Its 2nm \"N2\" node is\nscheduled for trial production in the second half of 2024 and mass production\nin late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced \"N2P\" process in late 2026. Trial\nproduction of the 2nm node will begin in the second half of 2024, with small-\nscale production ramping up in the second quarter of 2025. In 2027, facilities\nin Taiwan will start to shift toward production of \"A14\" 1.4nm chips.\n\nApple's upcoming A18 chips for the iPhone 16 lineup are expected to be based\non N3E, while the \"A19\" for the 2025 iPhone models is expected to be Apple's\nfirst 2nm chip. The subsequent year, Apple will likely move to an enhanced\nversion of this 2nm node, followed by the newly announced 1.6nm process.\n\nEach successive TSMC node surpasses its predecessor in terms of transistor\ndensity, performance, and efficiency. Late last year, it emerged that TSMC had\nalready demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected\nintroduction in 2025.\n\nTags: Apple Silicon Guide, TSMC\n\n[ 35 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\njo-1\n\n3 hours ago at 05:59 am\n\nreminds me of the video from Seagate with respect to size\n\nI love that video- since it summarizes where we're standing today:\n\nand the historic video that triggered my interest 1 1\u20442 decades ago\n\nScore: 7 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nheadlessmike\n\n3 hours ago at 06:08 am\n\nRemember that this is just a naming scheme, the actual gate pitch will be\nsomewhere like 40-45 nm.\n\nScore: 6 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nSiliconguy\n\n2 hours ago at 06:40 am\n\n> I remember when they were saying that the end of Moore's law was in sight,\n> and the practicality of smaller nodes was doubtful... that was *decades* and\n> many, many shrinks ago.

There is your hard limit. Actually they won't get that close\nto it.
