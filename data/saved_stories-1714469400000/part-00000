It is a technique based on cruelty and\npersonalised psychological torture, complemented by misrepresentation and\nmanipulation.\u201d\n\nAllegations of an organised rightwing campaign against S\u00e1nchez have been lent\ncredence by the re-emergence of a 2014 recording of a People\u2019s party (PP)\nminister and a disgraced police officer discussing plans to \u201cpolitically kill\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez, partly by targeting his wife.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez and Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez casting their votes in elections last year.\nPhotograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe rightwing PP has helped spread unfounded allegations that Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez,\nwho married S\u00e1nchez in 2006, is actually a man, that her family are involved\nin drug trafficking in Morocco, and that they operate a chain of sex clubs.\n\nThe complaint of influence peddling and corruption against her that finally\nprompted S\u00e1nchez to reflect on his future also looks tenuous: prosecutors want\nit dropped and even the far-right linked pressure group that filed it has said\nit may be fake news.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s rightwing and far-right opponents have called him a\n\u201ccompulsive liar\u201d, a \u201cpsychopath\u201d, a \u201csquatter\u201d, a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, a \u201cusurper\u201d,\na \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d who deserved to be \u201cstrung up by the\nfeet\u201d.\n\nBut S\u00e1nchez is far from the only European politician to have come under a\nsustained and personal attack in recent times. In an extraordinarily vicious\nelection campaign in Poland last year, the eventual victor, Donald Tusk, faced\na similar barrage of vitriol.\n\nDonald Tusk, who faced opposition vitriol during Polish elections last year.\nPhotograph: Alex Nicodim/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS),\nclaimed the liberal opposition candidate would surrender half of Poland to\nRussia and help the EU import illegal migrants, and that he aimed to instil\n\u201cGerman order\u201d in Poland, alluding to the Nazis.\n\nTusk, Kaczy\u0144ski said, was \u201cpure evil\u201d, \u201cthe enemy of the nation\u201d, and \u201ca\ntraitor who must be morally exterminated\u201d. His then ruling party also tried\nlegal action, passing a bill to \u201cinvestigate Russian influence\u201d, clearly aimed\nat smearing the opposition.\n\nS\u00e1nchez and Tusk resisted. But in the case of the former Dutch finance\nminister Sigrid Kaag, she quit politics at the last general election in\nNovember after a torrent of online abuse and multiple death threats.\n\nA veteran UN diplomat, Kaag, 62, said the environment for politicians in the\nNetherlands had become \u201ctoxic\u201d as she and colleagues faced a continual barrage\nof \u201chate, intimidation and threats\u201d and often needed tight police security.\n\nKaag faced \u2018a never-abating crescendo of allegations, insults, intimidation\u2019.\nPhotograph: BSR Agency/Getty Images\n\nKaag, who is married to a Palestinian former diplomat, said she faced \u201ca\nnever-abating crescendo of allegations, insults, intimidation \u2013 you name it\u201d,\nand not just online \u2013 once, a man was arrested carrying a flaming torch\noutside her home.\n\nOften amplified by Dutch extreme-right militants and conspiracy theorists, the\nextent and gravity of the threats would \u201cimpact the quality of our democracy\u201d\nby hindering \u201cpeople of calibre, women, people of colour\u201d from entering\npolitics, she said.\n\nSanna Marin delivering her resignation speech. Photograph: Markku\nUlander/Lehtikuva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe former Finland prime minister Sanna Marin also stepped away from politics\nlast year after losing a tight three-way election race and being forced to\ndefend both her work ethic and her right to a private life from media and\nopposition criticism.\n\n\u201cI am human,\u201d said Marin, who was the world\u2019s youngest prime minister when she\nwas elected in 2019, adding that she did not see anything wrong with \u201cwe\npoliticians also having free time, spending it with our friends\u201d.\n\nBut she said the at times violent criticism \u2013 in particular unfounded\nallegations, amplified by far-right accounts, of drug consumption \u2013 had been\n\u201cvery difficult\u201d for someone who \u201cnever missed a single day of work\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Europe\n  * Spain\n  * European Union\n  * Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n  * The far right\n  * Pedro Almod\u00f3var\n  * analysis\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Pedro S\u00e1nchez to continue as Spain\u2019s PM despite \u2018bullying\u2019 campaign\n\n16h ago\n\n  * ### Spanish opposition step up S\u00e1nchez attacks as PM decides on his future\n\n21h ago\n\n  * ### Madrid prosecutors ask judge to shelve investigation into Spanish PM\u2019s wife\n\n4d ago\n\n  * ### Why is Spain\u2019s prime minister considering resigning from office?\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### Spanish PM considers resigning, blaming political \u2018harassment\u2019 of wife\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### Basque separatists make historic gains but fail to win election outright\n\n22 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Basque election: leftwing coalition partly descended from Eta leads in polls\n\n19 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### How Spain and Ireland became the EU\u2019s sharpest critics of Israel\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
