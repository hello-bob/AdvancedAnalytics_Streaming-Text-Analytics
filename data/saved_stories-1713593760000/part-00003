When I ask\nthem to explain the rationale behind their implementation, I get an answer\nthat feels like this was their first thought, and they implemented it without\nanalysing why their approach is ideal.\n\nI ran through the same issue for so long until I heard a quote that said \u2014\n\u201cthink twice, code once\u201d, \u2014 and I incorporated it into my process; given that\nI like to visualise my thoughts.\n\n###\n\nThe thinking process\n\nTo think, you have to write!\n\nIdeally, we should strive to produce maintainable and scalable solutions that\nare also easy to understand and test. Let\u2019s say you have a task to add to\noptimise a feature on a given app. At first glance, you may have an idea of\nwhat needs to be done and how, but then you decide to jump straight to\nimplementation.\n\nGoing straight to implementation would be the best and fastest thing to do,\nassuming you have an idea of what needs to be done. Regardless of how much\ncontext I have on the feature, here is what I would do:\n\n  1. Gain context\n\nBefore doing any implementation, it is good to understand the context of why\nwe are optimising the feature. This will enable you to define the impact of\nthese changes.\n\nYou will retrieve all the requirements needed to implement your solution\nduring this step. While understanding the context, ask yourself why five\ntimes.\n\n  2. Draw your assumptions\n\nBased on the previous step, you will now be able to write down your\nassumptions about what needs to be done and how. Ideally, you should have at\nleast two possible paths.\n\nLimit the number of assumptions to avoid being distracted or losing focus.\nBased on your assumptions, you can now stack rank them and drawing the pros\nand cons of each and compromising whenever necessary.\n\nThis step should be iterative, and it should be repeated at least once!\n\n  3. Implement\n\nSelecting one of the potential paths or solutions now becomes more effortless,\ngiven that you already know the pros and drawbacks of one compared to the\nother. The implementation process will be faster as you have defined what\nneeds to be done and how.\n\nOverall, the message here is that before you code anything, you should spend\nsome time thinking and writing down your thoughts. This will not only make you\na better problem solver, but also help you become more aware of your decisions\nwhen crafting a solution.\n\nAs a bonus, I recommend you spend some time watching \u2014 Thinking Above the Code\nby Leslie Lamport1.\n\nBK's Essays is a reader-supported publication.
