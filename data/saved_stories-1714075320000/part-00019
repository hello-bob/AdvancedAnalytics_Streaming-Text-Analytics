You can read our previous report\nabout the incident here.\n\nThe unclassified version of those findings, released Wednesday, included\npreviously unreleased sensor imagery captured by the Eglin-based fighter pilot\nduring the encounter. That data led investigators to conclude the object seen\non Jan. 26, 2023 was most likely a stray \"lighting balloon.\"\n\n\u201cThrough the onboard radar system, the pilot initially observed that the four\nobjects were aloft between 16,000 \u2013 18,000 feet and appeared to be flying in\nformation,\" according to the report. \"However the pilot observed only one of\nthe four objects visually and captured two images of the single object via the\naircraft\u2019s electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor.\u201d\n\nThe image observed by the pilot captured on the aircraft's electro-\noptical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor. (AARO image)\n\n\u201cAlthough the pilot described the object as uniformly gray in the visible\nspectrum (it appears uniformly black from the viewing angle in the EO image),\nthe magnified infrared image shows the object had a strong contrasting\nsignature in the infrared spectrum. This contrast suggests either a\ntemperature/emissivity difference or a reflectivity difference between its two\nhemispheres.\"\n\nPrevious information about the incident noted the object was glowing hot on\nits bottom but cool on the top, which matches this description.\n\nAs a result, the AARO report concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that the\npilot \"identified a commercial lighting balloon,\" or a similar object, like\nthe one in the image below. The report also states the office has \"high\nconfidence\" it was not some anomalous.\n\nThe Pentagon says this lighting balloon is the kind of object an Air Force\npilot observed last year over the Gulf of Mexico. (AARO image)\n\nAARO reported that was \"a close visual match to the object in the zoomed-in\ninfrared image\u201d which you can see in this AARO photo below.\n\nThe pilot described the object visually observed at 16,000 feet as \"similar to\nthe shape of the Apollo spacecraft.\" That description concurs with information\nprovided in recently declassified documents we wrote about last month. You can\nsee the pilot's drawing provided to investigators and reproduced in the AARO\nreport in the image below.\n\nThe Eglin pilot described the object observed as akin to the Apollo\nspacecraft. (AARO image)\n\nThe Command and Service Module used in the Apollo 15 mission in 1971. NASA\n\nAARO assessed that based on information provided by the aircraft's sensors,\nthe reported UAP \"very likely was an ordinary object and was not exhibiting\nanomalous or exceptional characteristics or flight behaviors. AARO has\nmoderate confidence in this assessment due to the limited data provided.\"\n\nAside from concluding that the pilot saw a commercial lighting balloon, the\nreport listed a number of other types of balloons as the source of what the\nEglin pilot observed.\n\nCommercial helium balloons such as these \u201care often large and available in\nmany shapes \u2014 including ellipses, spheres, and cylinders \u2014 and are used for\noutdoor lighting at special events, construction sites, and movie sets.\u201d\n\nAlthough these balloons are available in solid colors, some models have\ndistinct black and white or semi-translucent hemispheres.\n\n\u201cThe upper black hemisphere is lined with reflective material to direct the\nlight downward through the white hemisphere. AARO conducted extensive testing\nusing one of these balloons and found it could replicate some aspects of the\npilot\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nA lighting ballon made by the Airstar company. (Airstar photo)\n\nThe Eglin incident was highlighted publicly in an extremely public manner by\nMatt Gaetz, a Republic Representative from Florida, during a Congressional\nhearing in July 2023. Gaetz said he \"spoke with the flight crew\" and was shown\na photo of the UAP by the pilot.\"\n\n\"They saw a sequence of four craft in a clear diamond formation for which\nthere is a radar sequence that I and I alone have observed in the U.S.\nCongress,\" Gaetz testified. \"One of the pilots goes to check out that diamond\nformation and sees a large floating, what I can only describe as an orb.\nAgain, like I said, not of any human capability that I am aware of,\" Gaetz\nsaid at that time. \"And when he approached he said that his radar went down.\nHe said that his FLIR [forward-looking infrared] system malfunctioned and that\nhe had to manually take this image from one of the lenses and it was not\nautomated in collection as you would typically see in a test mission.\"\n\nOther members of Congress who are part of the so-called \"UAP Caucus\" also had\na run in with the commander of Eglin AFB when they tried to learn more about\nthe incident during a visit to the installation, which you an read more about\nin our previous reporting.\n\nAARO came to its conclusion even though there were some problems with sensors\naboard the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot could not record video of the event \u201cbecause the aircraft\u2019s video\nrecording equipment was inoperable prior to and during the aircraft\u2019s flight,\u201d\nthe new AARO report states. Although, it's worth noting the still imagery AARO\nproduced is likely photos or frames from a video of a cockpit display recorded\nby the pilots phone. We reached out to the Pentagon to obtain a copy of that\nvideo, if it exists, and will provide any additional information shared.\n\nThe camera problem was just one sensor problem on this flight.\n\n\u201cThe pilot reported that upon closing to within 4,000 feet of the object, the\nradar on the aircraft malfunctioned and remained disabled for the remainder of\nthe training exercise,\u201d according to AARO. \u201cPost-mission review determined\nthat a circuit breaker had tripped; technicians reported that the same circuit\nbreaker on this particular aircraft had tripped three times in the prior\nmonths, but technicians could not conclusively diagnose the cause of the fault\nfor this incident. Based on the previous tripping of this circuit, AARO\nassesses the malfunction likely was not caused by or associated with the\nobject.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion with AARO, \"the pilot recounted that after the radar\nmalfunctioned, the object descended into the cloud deck. Since there was no\nEO/IR data for the other three reported objects initially observed on radar,\n\u201cAARO could not analyze those reported objects.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that some of these types of sighting could be balloons, not\nUFOs, is something we have explored in great detail for years now.\n\nAs we have noted several times, subsequent U.S. government reports have backed\nup our balloon assertion. Still, there are unexplained events that would seem\nto lie outside of this type of object being a valid explanation.\n\nIn January 2023, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\nissued a 12-page report saying that AARO was investigating 510 incidents and\nthat its \u201cinitial analysis and characterization\u201d of 366 newly-identified\nreports showed that more than half exhibited \u201cunremarkable characteristics.\"\n\nOf those, 26 were characterized as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or UAS-like\nentities; 163 were characterized as balloon or balloon-like entities; and six\nwere attributed to \u201cclutter,\u201d which ODNI identifies as \"birds, weather events,\nor airborne debris like plastic bags.\"\n\nIn January 2023, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\nreported that nearly half of newly reported UAPs were balloons or balloon-like\nobjects. (ODNI cover sheet)\n\nThe February 2023 shootdown of Chinese balloon in particular, as well as the\nthree shootdowns of other objects that quickly followed, is the most vivid\nmanifestation of this reality. All the led to the admission of a major domain\nawareness issue by the U.S. military, one we had been warning about for years.\n\nSo, this latest AARO report once again points to a balloon as the source of a\nUAP. But given the huge amount of distrust the UFO community has developed for\nAARO, with key proponents of the UFO topic claiming the office's conclusions\nare flawed or it is being out disingenuous and has ulterior motives, it\nremains unlikely that these latest findings will be received with universal\nenthusiasm. Nor will it quell concerns of those who believe the government is\ncovering up its real knowledge of visitation by \"non human intelligence.\"\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com\n\nUAP\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
