The\nUkrainian government has accused the Russian military of using Starlink,\ndespite sanctions against Putin's defenestration-prone regime, and it's\nreportedly been used widely in Africa despite only a few countries approving\nits operations.\n\nStarlink use in Africa, in fact, is what brings us to the current news that\nthe service\u2019s geofencing features appear to be full of holes.\n\nStarlink sent a message to African users last month telling them that they had\nuntil April 30 to get their receivers to an approved location or risk service\nbeing cut off. As that date has now passed, Bloomberg went looking to see if\nillicit Starlink access is still working, and found it is.\n\nIn an online poll, 73 percent of roaming Starlink customers in South Africa\nreported their service is still working. Many users in other countries\nsimilarly say their transceivers can still make a connection.\n\nAccording to the Starlink letter sent last month, African users outside of\nMozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Benin we told they\nwould all lose access. The letter reportedly stated that Starlink service\nwould be ended even for users whose address is in one of those countries and\noperate in roaming mode - something that Elon Musk\u2019s broadband biz allows, but\nnot forever.\n\nStarlink began offering a $200 per month Global Roaming service early last\nyear, which allowed users to travel anywhere and retain access from anywhere a\nStarlink satellite could connect. But it appears Starlink is starting to crack\ndown on those people cheekily importing receivers to get service in countries\nwhere the SpaceX biz doesn\u2019t offer permanent services.\n\nThat is to say, Starlink really doesn't like, for instance, people buying and\nactivating a terminal in a nation where the service is supported, and then\ntaking it to another country where there is no official service, and still\nbeing able to use the equipment.\n\n  * Starlink clashes with Telecom Italia over frequency data sharing\n  * Adios, dead zones: Starlink relays SMS in space for unmodified phones on Earth\n  * FCC really, truly won't give SpaceX nearly a billion bucks for Starlink rural broadband\n  * Out with the old, in with the new as 100 Starlink satellites take atmospheric exit\n\nStarlink operating beyond its own geofences, perhaps due to illegal\nimportation of terminals to Russia-held regions of Ukraine, became a political\nhot potato in March of this year when congressmen pointedly asked how it was\npossible for the broadband service to be available to users from a sanctioned\nnation. It emerged that Starlink terminals may have made their way into\nRussian hands in large numbers through neighboring countries where access is\npermitted. Given the description of the situation in Africa, it appears the\nmatter is likely the same.\n\nThis naturally raises the question of how Starlink terminals work where they\nought not to \u2013 and if the roaming service is well governed. That\u2019s an\nimportant issue as SpaceX could find itself on the wrong side of legal\nobligations.\n\nWe've reached out to SpaceX but haven't received a response. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Internet\n  * Satellite\n  * SpaceX\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Internet\n  * Satellite\n  * SpaceX\n  * Starlink\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AFRINIC\n  * APNIC\n  * Botnet\n  * DNS\n  * Domain Name\n  * ICANN\n  * IETF\n  * IPv4\n  * IPv6\n  * Voice over IP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Aerospace\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Space\n  * Tim Berners-Lee\n\n#### More about\n\n16 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Internet\n  * Satellite\n  * SpaceX\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Internet\n  * Satellite\n  * SpaceX\n  * Starlink\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AFRINIC\n  * APNIC\n  * Botnet\n  * DNS\n  * Domain Name\n  * ICANN\n  * IETF\n  * IPv4\n  * IPv6\n  * Voice over IP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Aerospace\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Space\n  * Tim Berners-Lee\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### SpaceX workplace injury rates are rocketing\n\nMusk outfit's figures almost 10 times worse than industry averages\n\nScience10 days | 23\n\n#### Satellite of love: SES and Intelsat finally tie the knot in $3.1B\nacquisition\n\nSecond time lucky as competition from Starlink and pals increases\n\nNetworks3 days | 1\n\n#### SpaceX, Northrop Grumman reportedly working on US spy sat program\n\nLEO rising in US military: Close encounters of the recon kind\n\nNetworks14 days | 5\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Space insurers make record-breaking loss as orbit gets cramped\n\n'Unsustainable' losses neared $1B in 2023\n\nScience2 days | 35\n\n#### Lights about to go out on US Affordable Connectivity Program\n\nA partial benefit in May then subsidy gets unplugged once and for all\n\nNetworks18 hrs | 7\n\n#### Sacramento airport goes no-fly after AT&T internet cable snipped\n\nPolice say this appears to be a 'deliberate act.'\n\nCyber-crime14 days | 44\n\n#### NASA solar sail boom demonstrator reaches orbit\n\nBig things come in small packages\n\nScience1 day | 13\n\n#### FAA now requires reentry vehicles to get licensed before launch\n\nCommercial operators must try Varda\n\nScience11 days | 9\n\n#### Starlink clashes with Telecom Italia over frequency data sharing\n\nRefusal to play ball may result in satellite operator moving investment\nelsewhere\n\nNetworks1 month | 14\n\n#### 404 Day celebrates the internet's most infamous no-show\n\nNothing is forever, not even a web page\n\nOffbeat28 days | 67\n\n#### Is Russia using Starlink in Ukraine?
