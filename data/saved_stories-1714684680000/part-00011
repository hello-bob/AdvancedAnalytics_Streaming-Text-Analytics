If possible, include a URL to where it is posted\nonline.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch console and video games contain technological protection\nmeasures (\u201cTPMs\u201d) that permit the Nintendo Switch console to interact only\nwith legitimate Nintendo video game files. This process protects Nintendo\u2019s\ncopyright-protected video games, including but not limited to those covered by\nU.S. Copyright Registration numbers PA0002213509 (Super Mario Maker 2);\nPA0002233840 (Animal Crossing: New Horizons); PA0002213908 (Luigi\u2019s Mansion\n3); and PA0002028142 (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) by preventing\nusers from playing pirated copies of Nintendo\u2019s video games on the Nintendo\nSwitch console and by preventing users from unlawfully copying and playing\nNintendo\u2019s video games on unauthorized devices.\n\nWhat files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the\nentire repository, the repository\u2019s URL.\n\nhttps://github.com/roblabla/yuzu https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/yuzu\nhttps://github.com/yuzu-mirror/yuzu-mainline https://github.com/yuzu-\nmirror/yuzu-android https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/yuzu-downloads\nhttps://github.com/DiamantTh/yuzu-mirror\nhttps://github.com/pineappleEA/pineapple-src\nhttps://github.com/pineappleEA/Pineapple-Linux\nhttps://github.com/Kryptuq/Yuzu-Early-Access-files\nhttps://github.com/Schweeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/yuzu-android\nhttps://github.com/Schweeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/yuzu-mainline\nhttps://github.com/EnricoCecchini/yuzu-will-live [invalid]\n\nDo you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to\nyour copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention\nTechnology if you are unsure.\n\nYes\n\nWhat technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively\ncontrol access to your copyrighted material?\n\nNintendo embeds TPMs in both the Nintendo Switch console and video game files,\nincluding but not limited to encryption of the video game files which requires\ncertain cryptographic keys, such as prod.keys, that are used to verify,\naccess, and play each game played on the Nintendo Switch. The TPMs employ\nencryption as described in more detail below. The Nintendo Switch console\nallows users either to play games on physical cartridges that are inserted\ninto the console, or to play games digitally downloaded from Nintendo\u2019s\nserver. Both formats are protected by Nintendo\u2019s TPMs, including encryption of\nits video games. When a game is started on the Nintendo Switch console the\ngames are decrypted and verified using various Nintendo cryptographic keys so\nthey may be played. Nintendo owns or exclusively controls numerous copyrights\nin software and games that are protected from unlawful access and copying by\nthe operation of these TPMs. In their ordinary course of operation, the TPMs\nrequire the application of information and a process (as described above),\nwith the authority of Nintendo, to gain access to Nintendo\u2019s copyrighted\nworks, and thus effectively control access to and copying of Nintendo\u2019s\ncopyrighted works.\n\nHow is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological\nprotection measures?\n\nThe reported repositories offer and provide access to the yuzu emulator or\ncode based on the yuzu emulator. The yuzu emulator is primarily designed to\nplay Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, yuzu illegally circumvents\nNintendo\u2019s technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of\nNintendo Switch games. Nintendo Switch games are encrypted using proprietary\ncryptographic keys (prod.keys) which protect against unauthorized access to\nand copying of the copyrighted games. During operation, yuzu necessarily uses\nunauthorized copies of these cryptographic keys to decrypt unauthorized copies\nof Nintendo Switch games, or ROMs, at or immediately before runtime without\nNintendo\u2019s authorization. Thus, yuzu is primarily designed to and unlawfully\n\u201ccircumvent[s] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a\nwork protected under\u201d the DMCA. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1). Therefore distribution\nof yuzu constitutes unlawful \u201ctraffic[king] in a[] technology ... that ... is\nprimarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a\ntechnological measure....\u201d in violation of Section 1201 of the DMCA. [private]\n\nHave you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or\nrepositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified\nseparately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.\n\nYes. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe\nthat all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent\nrepositories.\n\nIs the work licensed under an open source license?\n\nNo\n\nWhat would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?\n\nReported content must be removed\n\nDo you have the alleged infringer\u2019s contact information? If so, please provide\nit.\n\nNo, we do not have contact information.\n\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described\nabove on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or\nits agent, or the law.\n\nI have taken fair use into consideration.\n\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification\nis accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on\nbehalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\n\nI have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown\nNotice.\n\nSo that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or\nphysical address.\n\n[private]\n\nPlease type your full legal name below to sign this request.\n\n[private]\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
