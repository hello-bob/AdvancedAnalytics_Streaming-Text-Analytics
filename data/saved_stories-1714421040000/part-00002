We\nencountered technical difficulties with the audio file, however, and had to\nscrap the episode. The interview was instead transcribed and can now be posted\nto this website as a text interview.\n\nThe interview touches on the economic and political history of Germany since\nGerman reunification, the degeneration of social democracy and the corporatist\nstate, similarities between Germany\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s experiences of the 90s, the\ndominance of Germany within the EU, Germany\u2019s peculiar relationship to Russia\nand Russian gas, to what extent the Americans control German and EU foreign\npolicy, the european migrant crisis\u2019 causes and effects, the development of\neuropean but particularily german right-wing populism and perhaps most\nimportantly \u2013 the rise of the political pheonmenon of Sahra Wagenknecht.\n\nWagenknecht is a German politician, economist, author, and publicist. Since\n2009 she has been a member of the Bundestag, where until 2023 she represented\nThe Left. She has been both the co-chair of the party and leader of the\nparties internal Communist Platform. In 2024 she founded the party B\u00fcndnis\nSahra Wagenknecht, to contest elections onwards. Wagenknecht, a life-long\nmarxist born and raised in the old German Democratic Republic of east Germany,\nis a curious figure in that she today represents what could be seen as both\nsocialist and, among other things, anti-immigration positions. As a founding\nmember of \u201dAufstehen\u201d, a sort of precursor-organization to B\u00fcndnis Sahra\nWagenknecht, Wolfgang Streeck develops towards the end of the article on the\nWagenknecht phenomenon with particular insight.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: At the time of German reunification, was it (the reunification) seen\nas a potential net gain economically and politically at the time and how did\nit all play out?\n\nStreeck: I lived in United States by then, so I watched this from afar. But of\ncourse the general idea of unification was to integrate the former East\nGermany (GDR) into the European system, and to do this full scale. That\nincluded on the one hand the market economy, and indeed the immediate access\nof the former GDR to the European Union by joining West Germany. It also\nrequired the entire social system, that is the system of social security which\nwas completely extended to East Germany. That\u2019s a very typical thing from the\nKohl era. There was the compromise between the unions and capital if you want.\nSo both were extended. That of course created all kinds of problems, it was\nvery expensive to begin with. They also had the wrong exchange rate after\njoining West Germany, resulting in de-industrialization and very rapid\nincrease in unemployment \u2013 which was baffled by the traditional West German\nwelfare state. So you had an enormous amount of people that went on welfare\nsupport, or had to because their jobs disappeared.\n\nAnders: There has been talk about \u201costalgie,\u201d nostalgia for the east. First of\nall is it real? And is it rational? Was it a legitimate sense of political,\neconomic, cultural loss in the east during these years?\n\nStreeck: I think you shouldn\u2019t buy these concepts from journalists who in the\n1990s and later also faced a much more competitive environment and so they had\nto invent new things every day in order to keep their readers happy. Just\nforget this concept \u201costalgie\u201d or something, it\u2019s absolutely and complete\nrubbish. What happened was that ways of life in the former East Germany that\nhad been settled for decades were offset in a very short period of time. If\nyou have a coal mine with twenty thousand people working there, living in the\nvicinity with families, and then the mine gets closed and only 500 jobs remain\nfor cleaning up the dirt so to speak. So what do you expect in a community\nlike this? That people will be happy about the increase in the efficiency of\nthe national... What is going to happen with them next? So, let me say that,\nsince you are interested in more than just journalism, capitalism is a\nsociety, a social order that promotes and reinforces rapid change in markets,\nwith rapid change flowing from it in the ways of life of people. And\nespecially in a period like the 1990s where everything was sort of up for\ngrabs then this change is particularly fast and creating particularly strong\nuncertainty.\n\nThe Berlin wall falls\n\nLook, we had in East Germany these townships with 35 % unemployed, in a world\nin which there had never been unemployment. Now there was this joke in\ncommunist countries like one worker says to the other: \u201cwe pretend to work and\nthey pretend to pay us\u201d so it was a sort of environment in which you could be\nsure that whatever you did, and this were the source of power of labor in\nthese countries, that you could never be fired. Everybody had a job: women,\nmen, but if bananas were offered in a shop then everybody left their jobs and\nwent there to buy bananas. And production had to stop. It was a different\nworld. Another thing is that if you have deep change like this then it\u2019s not\njust that the first generation suffers from it and then the next generation\ncomes perfectly adjusted to it \u2013 quite the contrary, it really has a long\nshadow. And if you have seen your parents get unemployed and lose their safe\njobs, then you\u2019re not necessarily enthusiastic about this new world. Although\nit\u2019s a more prosperous world or you could travel now to Paris which you\ncouldn\u2019t before.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: We have talked a lot in our podcast about the neoliberal restructuring\nin Sweden during the 1990s and the dismantling of the tripartite model with\nstate, unions and capital. There are a lot of similarities in Germany. Can you\ntell us a bit about the Schr\u00f6der government, Haartz reforms, Agenda 2010 and\nespecially the destruction of the tripartite corporativist model?\n\nStreeck: Sure, economic historian would have to look into the details later,\nbut what I want to say is that there were some unexpected things happening. So\nGermany were sort of pushed into the European Monetary Union very early as a\ncondition, put forth by the French, for agreement to German unification. The\nFrench wanted the European Monetary Union, however, for two different\nincompatible purposes. One was the Mitterand wanted to drive out, or\ndisempower, his trade unions through adoption of hard currency that would make\nit impossible for France to be forced by its unions to devalue its currency in\norder to underride inflation increase. At the same time that would have meant\nthe French economy basically being governed by the German central bank \u2013\ncreating a hard tool for the French government to discipline French labor. At\nthe same time for internationalist reasons France was interested in taking\nover the European Central Bank and disempowering Germany as that country in\nEurope which they had to follow all the time within their monetary policy. In\nthe 1990s the German central bank sent a fax message to the French central\nbank telling them that from now on interest rates should be so and so many\npercent. And they had no chance they had to follow. But these two objectives\nwere incompatible: one wanted the Euro as a soft currency \u2013 the other wanted\nthe Euro as a hard currency.\n\nNow the Germans were scared stiff, really afraid, of the Euro undermining\ntheir cherished monetary stability. So they had to write a constitution for\nthe European Central Bank that forces it to be as strict monetarily as the\nBundesbank. Now, what turned out was something very different. Namely that\nwith the European Monetary Union and weak countries like France and Italy\nbeing included in the monetary union the exchange rate of the Euro to the rest\nof the world became very low. Now German industry benefitted from this\nimmensely. Because had Germany had a currency of its own the exchange rate\nwould have shot up and the prices of German export outside Europe would be\nvery very high. We estimate about 20 % higher. So the Italians helped the\nGermans to bring down their exchange rate to an irrationally low level. So\nthat is why, after the Euro was finally introduced in 1999 a few month after\nShr\u00f6der took over as chancellor, the Germans discovered that it was not\ndriving inflation but it was a sort of growth mechanism. The thing that then\nremained was the enormous fiscal costs of unification for the German welfare\nstate. So then came Agenda 2010 and the Haartz reforms. But they were not\ndesigned to increase the efficiency of the German export industry. They were\nfiscal maneuvers to relieve the fiscal pressure on the German state that had\ncome from unification and structural change. And that was a price they had to\npay inside the European Monetary Union, why? Because there is a sort of\ngeneral rule that you can\u2019t have a deficit higher than 3 % of GPD every year\nand that you have to bring down your debt level to 60 % of GDP. So in 2001 the\nGerman government was scared that countries like Italy and France that had\ntraditionally been deficit countries would take \u201cour\u201d precious Euros to fund\nincreasing levels of state debt and in order to prevent that we had to give an\nexample that we could be austere \u2013 that austerity is good for us. But\nausterity is good only for Germany because Germany is an export oriented\ncountry. Not for Italy that is domestic oriented. In short that German\nprosperity in the 2000s was due to the Haartz reforms and Agenda 2010 is\ntotally mistaken. It was for fiscal stability, not employment, employment came\nfrom somewhere else, namely the low exchange rate and wage moderation by\nGerman trade unions.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: In Germany wage moderation was a key to deal with recession and\nglobalization. In Sweden, the Social Democrats did not tamper directly with\nwages but, supposedly, invested in human capital by expanding the university\nsystem. The strategy of wage moderation in Germany must have been very\nunpopular and created a lot of tension between the unions and the SPD?\n\nStreeck: There was tension, but not of the kind you might expect. Germany is a\ncountry where workers traditionally cherished stability of employment, long\nterm employment. And with the opening up of Germany for the internal market\nand then the opening up of Europe to the rest of the world, especially China,\nthere was a widespread fear that the new world order of global economy would\nundermine employment in German industry. And workers were basically willing \u2013\nboth unions and workers in fact were willing \u2013 to make concessions on wage in\nexchange for concessions on employment. Employment concession cannot easily be\nmade by international companies. For example think of Mercedes Benz by the end\nof the 80s they were basically a German company they had two or three plants\nsomewhere else in the world, one in Brazil and one in South Africa. And then\nsuddenly they began to set up plants all over the world. They told the\ndomestic German work force that if you want more than we can pay, or want to\npay, we will simply shift our production to China or to Hungary. You have to\nlook at the map and then see... Of course Sweden is up north but we are sort\nof in the middle and there was East Germany, Czechia, Hungary \u2013 places where\nyou have skilled workers hungrily waiting for jobs and where you could pay\nthem maybe half of what you could pay them in West Germany and they would\nstill be extremely happy with it.\n\nAnders: The economist Costas Lapavitsas has noted the immense industrial\nexpansion into Eastern Europe. How important is this aspect of eastward,\nindustrial expansion?\n\nStreeck: It\u2019s absolutely important. Not just for Germany but also for the\nEuropean Union because in a sense in the 1990s Germany had a choice between\ntaking over, figuratively speaking, Eastern Europe \u2013 Poland and so on \u2013 simply\nwith its economic power. Or, for reasons of political wisdom so to speak,\nbringing the European Union as the force to establish modern capitalism in\nEastern Europe and then benefit from this from inside the European Union so to\nspeak. That was not entirely successful. If you go to Eastern Europe you see\nGerman companies, production sites, grocery chains, all over the place.\nBasically the French at the time had insisted that they get a share of the\nbounty so to speak. But France is almost not visible there and especially\nsince the French in the new century became very aware of their interest in\nAfrica, a place where Germany has no history and no understanding of what\u2019s\ngoing on there, the Germans won Eastern Europe and the French won Western\nAfrica.\n\nA German soldier explaining how to work with a map to a Malian soldier at the traning mission EUTM in Koulikoro, Mali, 6 April 2016.

And these two interests are very, very difficult to bring\ntogether under the roof of the European Union. So then in terms of foreign\npolicy, industrial policy, all of this, the gap between the two major\ncountries in Europe was reinforced by first the greater power of Germany as a\nresult of unification \u2013 balancing the French and then exceeding French power \u2013\nand at the same time the very different industrial, regional and\ngeostrategical orientation of the two countries. For example, to add to this,\nwhich we now know how important it is, that the French has a nuclear army\nwhereas the Germans do not have such a thing. And that the French sits on the\nUnited Nations Security Council whereas the Germans do not, although they are\nthe bigger country. And now there is the sort of permanent debate about what\nthe European Union army should do, who is going to command it, who has control\nover the nuclear armaments. The French has an interest in West Africa but you\ncannot use nuclear bombs to control the states of West Africa, that\u2019s\nimpossible, you need ground forces. Since the French spend all of their\ndefense money on their nuclear forces: submarines and planes and all of these\nthings, but they want the Germans to do the ground work on foot in Africa,\nwhich they sometimes do to keep the French happy. So the whole game inside the\nEuropean Union changed fundamentally with German unification and the\nintroduction of the Euro on the initiative, ironically, of France to at the\nsame time break the unions and control Germany. And the former they were able\nto do but the latter not.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: You write about two different union federations, one service union and\none industrial union, the industrial one aligning more with SPD and the\nservice union perhaps more with Die Linke. Did the service union have some\nkind of tension with these German reforms?\n\nStreeck: If you compare Germany to Sweden then one of the fundamental\ndifferences is that Germany is very industry heavy and very dependent on\nimports whereas Sweden is more balanced, it has a large public sector and very\nstrong public sector unions and over the last three decades the relative\nweight of the two has shifted from the metalworkers union dictating the whole\neconomic scene to more of the service oriented, female, public sector, more\ndomestically oriented union. And the swedes were not bad, I think, at trying\nand strike some kind of compromise between these two so that they had both\nexternal growth sources through exports and at the same time also internal\nones so the funding and payment for an extensive public sector could be\nassured. Now, as far as I can see, the usual precautions apply to this in that\nit is difficult for a capitalist state to tax its capitalist economy so that\nit can fund a large public sector out of tax revenue. So then two or three\nfiscal crises happen in Sweden which started a deficit problem leading to\nforms of privatization which in Germany has not yet happened, in the public\nsector. In Germany, attempts were made in the latest election, for example in\nregards to the national railways. The idea was to make them attractive enough\nfor private investors to buy. Now they are in an absolutely broken condition\nbecause of un-investment over a long time. Germany built up no public debt\nunlike Sweden. But at the same time they neglected the domestic economy to an\nextent that they are now basically suffering from. It\u2019 up to you to decide how\nsuccessful it was to put a lot of money into education, public services, and\nso on. If I remember the covid-crisis correctly, we suddenly learned that the\nvery large segment of the elderly staying at home while still being a part of\nthe care industry had disastrous situation. That has not happened in Germany\nyet. But, instead of selling off this industry, the German government sort of\nunderfunds them, in the course of keeping a balanced budget in order to scare\nthe Italians for not having a balanced budget.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: In the 90s the SPD oriented itself more towards the Green Party in\norder to form a stable government. And in order to do this they declared to\nphase out nuclear energy in Germany by 2022. Merkel first resisted this but\nthen folded after Fukushima and continued this development.\n\nStreeck: Since 2003 Germany was governed by a grand coalition between the\nChristian Democrats of Merkel and the Social Democrats. There was only a very\nshort time between 1998 and 2003 that the German Social Democrats governed\nwith the Greens. It is true that during this period the first exit from\nnuclear energy was adopted. But not because the Social Democrats wanted it but\nbecause the Greens wanted it. Schr\u00f6der had no interest in exiting from nuclear\nenergy. Merkel, in 2003, took over with the slogan that she was going to\nreinstate nuclear energy together with the Social Democratic party, but then\ncame Fukushima and she discovered that if ever she wanted to govern without\nthe Social Democrats, what she always wanted, she would have to play the game\ntogether with the Greens. And then suddenly within a matter of two weeks she\nsuddenly reinstated the entire package of the exit from nuclear. It was\nsimply, purely, party political strategizing.\n\nCem \u00d6dezir of Die Gr\u00fcne in talks with Angela Merkel\n\nIn the end what Merkel wanted, I think, although you can\u2019t know as she never\nopenly said what she wanted, was a stable neo-bourgeois government. That is \u2013\nthe Christian Democrats reformed, stripped of social conservatism, they would\nhave marriage for all and there was this and that, together with the Greens as\nthe legitimate children of the bourgeois middle class. The Greens never had\ngood feelings towards the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats were too\nproletarian, too kind of labourist. Whereas the Greens represented a rising,\nnew, educated middle class which didn\u2019t like industry because wherever they\nsaw industrial workers, they saw their parents. And they didn\u2019t like their\nparents either. The lifestyle of their parents was what they were running away\nfrom. And they could find this better with the Christian Democrats provided\nthat the Christian Democrats were willing to grant marriage for all and all of\nthis. When Merkel was still in government together with the Social Democrats,\none day before the end of the bundestag suddenly as a surprise measure the\nitem came on the agenda of allowing for marriage between women and between\nmen, and what did Merkel do? She was sitting on the government bench and\ndidn\u2019t say much, and afterwards pretended that she hadn\u2019t noticed. It was an\nattempt to open up a lasting realignment between the Greens and the Christian\nDemocrats. It would have happened, I think, two years ago if the Christian\nDemocrats hadn\u2019t made this unbelievable mistake in selecting a successor to\nMerkel. The result of which made them lose terribly in the election and the\nblack-green government became impossible because they didn\u2019t have a majority.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: The energy situation brings us over to the military situation. In 2022\nRussia invaded Ukraine and Germany has become very dependent on Russian gas.\nGermany\u2019s position on the war was first not clear but they have now been\nforced into a position of basically arming Ukraine and militarizing on behalf\nof American interests. Can you elaborate on the relationship between the\nenergy crisis and the militarization of Germany?\n\nStreeck: You are asking all the big questions! One has to really look at the\nprehistory. Germany in the 1960s and 1970s was a country that was eager to get\nout of coal as its main energy source and Russia at the time tried to get in\nto the western market by selling oil. Originally it was oil. There were these\nlong oil pipelines from Siberia to Eastern Germany, East Germany being under\nRussian control. And then Russia were simply extending these pipelines to West\nGermany and Western Europe. America really had nothing to offer at the time,\nthe idea was to get away from the dependence on the oil from the Persian Gulf.\nSo as part of the package of the treatise of West Germany and Eastern Europe\non peace and land (you have to remember that until early 1970s Germany\nofficially were still laying claims of half of Poland as its former territory)\nit included a deal that Germany would have access to Russian energy \u2013 first\noil then gas. So in the 2000s Russia was always a very reliable supplier and\nenergy security is one of the most important things of all. In the 2000s after\nJeltsin had left as president and Putin had come in, Russia had a sort of\neconomic boom as a result of its energy sales. And the 2000s was a period in\nwhich America became extremely interested in ending what they called the\nGerman dependence on Russian oil because they saw that this was rebuilding\nRussia from the dismal condition in which it was in the end of the 90s after\nnine years of Jeltsin \u2013 who was basically an American puppet. And the Ukraine\ncomes in because of course a lot of the Russian energy were sent through\npipelines based in Ukraine, and the oligarchic regime in Ukraine consisted of\nthose who owned the pipelines and then extracted very high charges from Russia\nand as well as from the rest for leading this stuff through the pipelines with\na lot of interruptions and insecurity. Merkel who had a sort of sympathy for\nRussia, traveling there as a young person and speaking Russian very very well,\ncomparing this to the turmoil in Ukraine, where you could never be sure when\nthe next oligarch would capture the next pipeline and then over the winter we\nwouldn\u2019t have any Russian gas if we didn\u2019t pay an enormous sum for\ntransportation, wanted a continuation of the relationship with Russia.\n\nAngela Merkel in the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ), the youth wing of the ruling\ncommunist party of the DDR\n\nAnd that was okay as long as this other problem didn\u2019t come up namely the\ndesire of the Americans to include Ukraine into NATO and preserve for\nthemselves the right to, after Ukraine had been included, put up any military\ninfrastructure 500km west of Moscow. Because the deal of Ukraine being a part\nof NATO was always that the Americans reassured everyone in the world that\nNATO decides what you deploy in terms of military hardware in a NATO country\nand then no NATO country has the right to negotiate that. That was something\nthat neither France nor Germany liked. In 2008 Sarkozy and Merkel at this NATO\nsummit prevented the Americans from inviting Ukraine to join NATO on the\ncondition that NATO would from then on govern the military power of Ukrainian\nsociety. That\u2019s the long story and it ends with Barack Obama, under who\u2019s\npresidency, allowing the new fracking technology to be applied on a very large\nscale to turn America into a net exporter rather than net importer of energy.\nAnd they became very eager to interrupt Nord Stream 2 and 1 so now they can\nfuel the market.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: In an interview you did with the website Counter in March this year\nyou said: \u201cThere were in the past a few timid attempts by the German\ngovernment to stray from the American line. When Shr\u00f6der and Chirac refused to\njoin the invasion of Iraq or when Merkel and Sarkozy refused in 2008 to let\nUkrain join NATO. But these where exceptions. Germany had to pay for them, for\nexample when Merkel allowed one million Syrian refugees into the country in\n2015/2016 for Obama to forgive her for not having sent troops into Syria and\nLibya.\u201d Do you think there is a direct correlation between Germany\u2019s course of\naction during the migrant crisis and the military situation?\n\nStreeck: Well, I must say I was never a part of the cabinet. But then again it\nwas never talked about in the cabinet. It is until this day impossible to\nlocate the document that she is said to have signed in order to order the\nborder police to open the border. The document isn\u2019t there.\n\nAngela Merkel in 2017 explaining to a palestinian refugee child that Germany\ncan\u2019t accommodate everybody who wants to come. Angela Merkel coined the slogan\n\u201dWir schaffen das\u201d (English: \u201dwe can manage this\u201d) during the 2015 European\nmigrant crisis. It has been described as a core slogan of the German concept\nof \u201dWillkommenskultur\u201d, German willingness to accept refugees. She repeated\nthe statement several times at the 2015 Christian Democratic Union party\nconference. The phrase has become a symbol of Merkel\u2019s refugee policy used by\nsupporters and detractors alike.\n\nBut of course America had a sort of absolutely strong interest, after this\nsort of failed intervention in Syria, to do something for the enormous number\nof displaced people that didn\u2019t know where to go. I lived in the states then\nand I remember Obama, in this television speech, he said something about the\nred lines and if they crossed the red lines...and then the next day the\nSyrians crossed the red lines and Obama just didn\u2019t talk about it anymore\nbecause he didn\u2019t have the means to do something if he had wanted to. Then\nsomething happened, and Turkey was the country that began to take in Syrian\nrefugees but in Turkey they had enough problems between the Turks and the\nKurds. And they also didn\u2019t like the Syrians. And then these people had to go\nto some place. And it was absolutely clear that the Germans were not beloved\nby the Americans for not sending ground troops into Syria. Just as they didn\u2019t\nsend ground troops into Iraq before. And usually the way these things go in\ndiplomatic relations is \u201cokay you didn\u2019t help us here, but now we have\nsomething where you can help us, do at least this\u201d and to me this is a very\nstrong hypothesis that this was a quid pro quo.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: This is an interesting angle because there is very strong anti-\nimmigration sympathies in all over Europe but it is rarely discussed why these\nmigrant flows are really happening. So diplomatic pressure is one aspect. But\nyou were also talking about how the restructuring of the German economy being\ndependent on wage suppression and cheap labor in services. Do you think there\nwas an active, conscious, interest of the German state in the pouring in of\ncheap labor into Europe?\n\nStreeck: That\u2019s the next game. On the one hand you want them, on the other\nhand you have political resistance in your own population. And then what you\ndo? On the one hand you open up the low income labor markets, on the other\ncomes AfD [Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland] and mobilizes against immigration. You\nlose votes but you win workers. What is the deal? What is more important? And\nof course what comes always up is how expensive it is to integrate large\nnumbers of people. The moment you open the borders the Germans come and give\ndolls to the children and distribute foods and all of this. Then a year later\nyou need schools where these people can become proper Germans, you need\nhospitals, especially you need places for them to stay. And you don\u2019t want the\nmost rotten living space in the borders of your city because there you get\nexactly the kind of situations that are now as far as I can see, you get\nghettos and in second or third generations\u2019 extreme hostility towards this\ncountry where their parents had found refuge. So to me, looking at the decay\nof the German institutional infrastructure and the cost pressure on living\nquarters everywhere almost now tells me that there is a tendency to be overly\noptimistic. Now for employers who want cheap labor the question is not so\nimportant whether these people live in decent houses or not the most important\nis that they come and work for little money. But for the society as a whole it\nmakes an enormous difference. And let me say that in this sense, the good\npeople who really want to be open, empathetic and all of this, they have a\nproblem and the problem is whether they actually can deliver the things that\nare necessary for immigrants from Arabia or Afghanistan or whatever to\nactually set foot here. Now some of them can do that and there are admirable\nexamples of people who came in ten years ago from Afghanistan and now they\nstudy mathematics and physics at the university and do not suffer from being\nhere rather than there.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: We should touch on the AfD. It\u2019s usually described as a single\nphenomenon from the National Front in France to Trump to the Sweden Democrats,\nthat this is right-wing populism, but perhaps there is a bit more nuance to\nthese different parties. So if you would categorize the AfD, is it more like\nBerlusconis neoliberal populism or more like (even if this is a loaded term) a\npost-fascist kind of organization as Jean-Marie Le Penns? Where does the AfD\nfall in all of this?\n\nStreeck: You ask very intelligent questions and I\u2019m glad that you are such an\nintelligent observer. Knowing that a party is always composed of different\nelement, a party is never homogenous. And also, as you rightly say, from\ncountry to country the phenomena that you tend to locate in the same category\ndiffer between them. Because they originate in different contexts.\n\nLatest German opinion poll\n\nSo, Berlusconi, there is no Berlusconi in Germany. That\u2019s very important.\nBerlusconi owned half of the Italian television network, and was one of the\nrichest people in Italy. And whether he was a fascist or not that is something\nthat escapes me, I never saw him marching in the streets with a black banner\nor black shirt demanding that any category of the people being extinguished.\nThat\u2019s a fascist for me. So no, he was a very particular person. Without him\nhis party doesn\u2019t matter. Now you look at Italy and todays prime minister. The\nAfD has nothing like that either. She [Meloni] is a pretty skilled politician.\nAnd she\u2019s been around for a long time. Whereas the AfD consist of a variety of\npeople who are really and without exception pretty dumb. And you see the way\nthey argue, you look at their program, you don\u2019t know what the hell they want?\nOn the one hand they are a neoliberal economic party, so they want to cut the\nwelfare state and so on. On the other hand they think they are a party for the\nlittle man and little woman threatened by immigration. Now how do you put this\ntogether? The former makes them natural allies of Capital whereas they also\nattempt to make them appear as defenders of the old working class. But they\ncan\u2019t be those at the same time. That\u2019s impossible! And do they have an answer\nto the immigration? No. Do they have an answer to the economic problems of\nGermany? No. All they have is stupid talk. Whereas, I would say, look at\nsomeone like Marine LePenn who as it seems, over the years, has learnt\nsomething namely that if she wants to be president, and she does want to be\nthat, then she cannot be for example anti-semitic at the same time. It is not\npossible. And nor can she be anti-worker. She can be sort of critical of\nEurope but now after twenty five years of the EMU she cannot anymore credibly\ndemand that by next year France would leave the monetary union. She would be\nridiculous and she knows that. Whether the AfD people would know that this is\nridiculous I doubt.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: Are the AfD explicitly neoliberal or very openly market liberal?\n\nStreeck: Yeah\n\nAnders: Because the Sweden Democrats have been quite both here and there on\nthese matters.\n\nStreeck: This is a problem that these parties cannot really solve.\n\nAnders: Now to my final question. The AfD is different from the Sweden\nDemocrats and many other European right wing populist parties. But Die Linke,\nthe Left Party, is also very different in many ways. The Swedish Left Party is\na typical left party, the former Moscow aligned communist party to which the\nsocial base of the party changed over time to by the 1990s not really have a\nworking class base anymore and moving into more progressive social liberal\nprograms. Perhaps this tendency appears in Die Linke as well, but part of Die\nLinke is the former state-party party of the old East German state. So they\nseem to me to always have balanced a younger generation of leftist activist\ntypes with a sort of old communist, not so reformed, tendency. Is this tension\nreal?\n\nStreeck: It\u2019s a generational thing. There is an old generation where someone\nlike Sara Wagenknecht stands out because although she is of German Democratic\nRepublic origin, the old communist party never allowed her to join because she\nwasn\u2019t trusted enough. She always had her own ideas. And when she was 19 or so\nthe party broke apart and then she joined the old state party to set up a\nMarxist platform in a party that was desperately trying to get away from Marx.\nSo she is sort of mixed generation, that\u2019s why she can also find acceptance\nnot just in the former East Germany but also West Germany.\n\nBut generally I think you have three layers in this party. One is the old East\nGerman state Marxist left. They are dying out. Then comes the post Agenda 2010\nWest German trade unions and social democrats who broke away from the\nmainstream, not many but some. And then the next generation, the student\ngeneration, who are all sort if interested in lifestyle questions and who\nmarries who and the queer life and all of this. They find it hard to link up\nwith any of these. Oscar Lafontaine of course is the second generation. Gregor\nGysi is the old generation, not unimportant in the old state party. So, in\nshort, the two wouldn\u2019t mix. And now it\u2019s breaking apart.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: So with the rise of Sara Wagenknecht and her very interesting\npositions on several different issues, Die Linke is splitting apart while the\nSwedish left party and many other European left parties have gone through\nthese kinds of transitions quite smoothly. The left party in Sweden does not\nreally have clashing factions to that extent, they are all social liberals,\nalthough they would of course call themselves a democratic socialist party.\nAnd they survived that evolution. But Die Linke is now collapsing? That is\ncertain?\n\nStreeck: You must factor in the fact that we had this unification. The Swedes\nwere always Swedes. Here we had east Germans and west Germans, who lived in\ndifferent states and different societies for 40 years. And there was an\nintegration problem that vastly exceeded the problem of integration in a party\nthat evolves over time like in Sweden. The experiences in the GDR, the\nanimosity, between someone like Gysi and Wagenknecht where Wagenknecht was not\nallowed to join the state party and Gysi was the son of the cultural minister\nof East Germany and a very prominent lawyer \u2013 one of the few with the\nprivilege to travel to the west and all of this. And now they seem to hate\neach other for all sorts of reasons.\n\nSahra Wagenknecht and Gregor Gysi\n\nBut I would want you to take away from this discussion that as far as I\nunderstand the Wagenknecht project, the party that will come out of this\nproject will not be called a \u201cleft party\u201d or a \u201csocialist party\u201d. They will\nhave a different name. And the reason is, I think, that Wagenknecht is correct\nto think that the last ten years or so \u201cthe left\u201d and Die Linke in Germany has\nacquired such a bad reputation that by setting up another left party you will\nnot be able to draw much support.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nAnders: Do you think that the political element that Wagenknecht represents\nhas serious working class support? Is it more of a proletarian movement?\n\nStreeck: You will have to see. One thing that I have learnt about politics is\nthat it is very much unpredictable. All sort of things can happen. As the\nelections come closer you have no idea how the outcome will be influenced by\nlet\u2019s say a defeat of Ukraine against Russia or this awful awful think going\non in Palestine. And then you could have an economic crises in between,\ninflations can continue...but the opposite is also possible, inflation goes\ndown... I want you to understand that in the German system if you setup a new\nparty then if you do very very well in the next election you win 10 % of the\nvote. We are not voting for a president here. Wagenknecht is not running for\npresident. She is trying to patch together a party with very disparate\nelements and then trying to win like 10 % in order to have afterwards a\nnational platform where she and others can address the enormous number of\nproblems and crisis that this society has in its public sector and its foreign\npolicy and so on. And put pressure on these centrist parties to begin to learn\nsomething new, this is such a party able to do, no more! And there will not be\na coalition partner for her, nobody to cooperate for government. Sara\nWagenknecht will after the next federal election in two years certainly not be\nvice chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nAnders: But she has an interesting political career in that all the strains of\nGerman historical development that we have been talking about today she sort\nof personifies in a way: the transformation of Social Democracy into\nunrecognizability, the degeneration of the left parties, but also the NATO\nsituation, the military situation, the migration situation. If you would do a\nblind test it would be easy to identify her as a right wing populist figure\nbut then again certain other elements would make her unrecognizable as such.\nBut do you think that this kind of politics has a future at all? Combining\nthese disparate elements that would be considered right wing and left wing?\n\nStreeck: As I told you, I\u2019m not making predictions. Looking at this from the\nperspective of a German citizen with strong egalitarian leftist desire about\npolitics I think that the thing that is absolutely necessary to break up this\ncentrist consensus in the society. If she is left or right... One can these\ndays see that traditional left and traditional right elements are no longer\ncompletely different. For example, in my latest book I strongly advocate that\nthe states remember their national sovereignty and rediscover the obligation\nof national government to do what their voters want them to do rather than\ntelling the voters what they are supposed to want, or doing what some\nintellectuals tell them. We need some sort of refreshment of democracy from\nthe bottom. And for that all sorts of experiment must be made. It is not at\nall clear that this particular party will help restore democracy but what I\u2019m\nabsolutely convinced of is a very strong infusion of what some people call\npopulism, and what I call the representation of the lifeworld of a very large\nsegment of our societies, who do not want to be told by university graduates\nhow they are supposed to live. That these people have a voice.\n\nAnnons\n\nIntegritetsinst\u00e4llningar\n\nIn my view, here\u2019s my very fundamental conviction that is that the life\nexperience of everyone: professor or waiter at McDonalds, are of absolutely\nthe same value. There is no difference, we have to respect, in how people live\nand how they want to live. And then can begin something like a democratic\ndiscussion, is it right the way we live? But none of us can be secure that\nonly the others will have to change their life and we won\u2019t. An open\ndiscussion where at the beginning everything counts as much as everything else\nwhen it comes to life experience of living people. That is the basis of\ndemocracy. And therefore I am not willing to disqualify any perception of life\na priori as populism, which has this contempt in it... That these people are\ntoo dumb, \u201cthey don\u2019t even know how to live we have to tell them\u201d. No! If we\ncontinue to believe that we will see a very bad awakening.\n\nAnders: Thank you for a very good talk.\n\nStreeck: Thank you, Anders.\n\n### Dela detta:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nGilla Laddar in ...\n\n### Relaterade\n\nSabaton och kommentariatets goda smak15 januari, 2023I \u201dEss\u00e4er\u201d\n\nRebellion in Ukraine \u2013 The Ideologies of Novorossiya13 januari, 2023I\n\u201dNyheter\u201d\n\nKlimatkris, klimatalarmism och klimatl\u00f6sningar19 september, 2023I \u201dEss\u00e4er\u201d\n\nPublicerat avUrban M\u00e5lare16 april, 2024Publicerad iEss\u00e4er, Nyheter, Press,\nStudier\n\n### L\u00e4mna en kommentar Avbryt svar\n\nF\u00f6reningen Aurora, Skapa en gratis webbplats eller blogg p\u00e5 WordPress.com.\n\n  * Kommentar\n  * Reblogga\n  * Prenumerera Prenumenerad\n\n    * F\u00f6reningen Aurora\n    * Har du redan ett WordPress.com-konto?
