That\npassive shopping habit recently led to the late-night purchase of a half-off\nCastlery dresser and a Turkish rug, so naturally, I decided my Target coffee\ntable needed an upgrade too.\n\nOn a recent weekend scrolling the platform, I noticed a listing for the West\nElm Industrial Storage Coffee Table, priced around $200. Then I saw another.\nAnd another. I quickly realized Facebook Marketplace was overrun. Like the\nPeggy Sofa before it, the Industrial Storage Coffee Table seems to have gone\nfrom must-have to must-get-rid-of overnight.\n\nOn the West Elm site, the table bears the brand\u2019s \u201cbest seller\u201d badge and\nretails for $699 to $849. It isn\u2019t cheap, but it feels like two, or even\nthree, pieces of furniture in one: It offers a lot of storage, and one-half of\nthe tabletop can pop up to hold a laptop or food, like a desk or a dining\ntable. It\u2019s exactly the kind of multiuse furniture New Yorkers love.\n\nI dug into the various Marketplace descriptions and found similar\ndescriptions: \u201chad it for a few years,\u201d \u201cgood size,\u201d \u201cconvenient.\u201d But over\nand over, one problem jumped out: \u201cThe magnet doesn\u2019t really work.\u201d Reddit and\nCraigslist also had a variation of this: \u201cTop is lifted ever so slightly\u201d\nreads one listing from Brooklyn.\n\nThe magnet in question is what keeps the coffee table, well, a coffee table;\nwhen it stops working, the pop-up mechanism stops functioning correctly, or in\nsome cases altogether \u2014 leaving half the surface permanently uneven. Click\nthrough the dozens of listings on Marketplace, and almost none of the top\npanels lay flush.\n\nPhoto: Lindy Segal\n\nFinally, one listing gave the people (me) what they wanted. Titled \u201cAnnoying\nWest Elm Pop Up Coffee Table,\u201d it was priced to sell at $100.\n\n\u201cOccasionally it\u2019ll pop up against your will,\u201d read the description, followed\nby a story about how a \u201cli\u2019l dog\u201d was able to reach a piece of cake when it\nwas in popped-up form (although that part feels more like user error than a\nmechanical one). Put plainly, it said: \u201cI really want this out of my life and\nneed the $$ to put toward a new coffee table.\u201d\n\nStephanie Han, a marketing lead in Manhattan who posted the listing, says it\nwas her second attempt to sell it. She first fell in love with the table after\nseeing it at her sister\u2019s apartment four years ago. \u201cI really appreciated how\nfunctional it was,\u201d she says. But about two years in, Han started to get\nannoyed with the table\u2019s tendency to spring open, which she says happened more\nover time. It would pop up \u201cextremely aggressively\u201d when she would bump or\ntouch it the wrong way. She says it even gave her a few bruises in the\nprocess.\n\nCuriously, Audrey Noble, a beauty editor in Manhattan who also owns the table,\nhad the opposite problem. \u201cWhen I lifted part of the table up to use my\nlaptop, I realized it couldn\u2019t hold a lot of weight or it would go back down,\u201d\nshe told me. \u201cSo I could either work or eat, never both at the same time.\u201d\n\nAccording to West Elm, any issues that have arisen are related to normal wear\nand tear and don\u2019t reflect on the quality of the product. \u201cThe Industrial\nCoffee Table has been one of West Elm\u2019s most popular products and a part of\nour assortment for over 12 years,\u201d a brand spokesperson said in a statement.\n\u201cWe rigorously test all West Elm products, and this item has passed a pop-up\nmechanism hardware test. We are proud of all West Elm products, and we are\npleased that the Industrial Coffee Table\u2019s design and dynamic functionality\ncontinues to resonate with customers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that people are still buying this coffee table in droves, which\nperhaps explains how much it\u2019s saturated the secondhand market. When I first\nposted about Han\u2019s listing on my Instagram Stories, five people messaged me to\nsay they had the same one. Now, their biggest concern is that they won\u2019t be\nable to offload it once they\u2019re ready to move on \u2014 something Noble has tried\nto do through word of mouth. \u201cZero takers so far,\u201d she told me.\n\nFortunately, Han found a buyer for hers. She first tried to sell it without\nthe description at a slightly higher price, and though it got some clicks, no\none bit. \u201cI ended up deleting that original post, decreasing the price to $100\nsince I wanted to get rid of it quicker, and writing a long description about\nits current state because I personally appreciate when people are transparent\nabout what they are selling,\u201d Han says.\n\nThat seemed to work. The \u201cannoying\u201d listing has received over 1,800 clicks,\nand, more important, a buyer (plus several backup buyers in case the first\nfell through). It also fostered a mini support group of current and former\nIndustrial Coffee Table owners who wrote to her with advice and empathy. \u201cOne\nkind person gave me tips on what springs I could buy to fix it,\u201d she says.\n\u201cSomeone else reached out to tell me how she ended up selling her exact same\ntable to someone at the West Elm store.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n  * Some Actually Nice-Looking Small-Space Storage Solutions\n\n  * Ikea\u2019s Answer to Inflation?
