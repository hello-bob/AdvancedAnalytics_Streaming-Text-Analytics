Professional athletes should be able to\ncompete without dedicating brain space to constant pube vigilance or the\nmental gymnastics of having every vulnerable piece of your body on display.\nWomen\u2019s kits should be in service to performance, mentally and physically. If\nthis outfit was truly beneficial to physical performance, men would wear it.\u201d\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

This is a\ncostume born of patriarchal forces that are no longer welcome or needed to get\neyes on women\u2019s sports. ... Stop making it harder for half the population\n@nike @teamusa @usatf.\u201d\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall, an American who placed sixth in the long jump at the\nTokyo Games and took silver at last year\u2019s world championships, reacted with\nequal parts humor and horror, commenting: \u201cWait my hoo haa is gonna be out.\u201d\n\nDebate has raged for years over more revealing outfits for female Olympians in\ndisciplines from beach volleyball to gymnastics, and some rules on competition\nwear are changing. Germany\u2019s women\u2019s gymnastics team wore full-length\nbodysuits at the Tokyo Olympics, in what they said was a stand against\nsexualisation in the sport. Gymnastics New Zealand last week updated its\nattire rules to allow women and girls to wear shorts or leggings over their\nleotards.\n\nNike said in an email to Reuters that it was offering athletes unitard options\nwith both a brief and a short for this Olympics, whereas it only offered the\nbrief for the Tokyo Olympics. Nike\u2019s track and field kits for men and women\ninclude nearly 50 apparel pieces and 12 competition styles for specific\nevents, the brand said when launching the outfits.\n\nNike-sponsored pole vaulter Katie Moon, in a post on X, said the kit shown on\nthe mannequin was \u201cconcerning\u201d, but added that women athletes are given many\noptions on what to wear, and that she prefers briefs to shorts. A spokesperson\nfor USA Track & Field said: \u201cAthlete options and choices were the driving\nforce for USATF in the planning process with Nike.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European\nsoccer\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
