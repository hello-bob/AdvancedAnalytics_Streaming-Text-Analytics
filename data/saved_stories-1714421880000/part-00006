[View all]\n\n  * ### Two year old behavior: is this normal?\n\n\u2013\n\nJan 19, 2023\n\n(9 replies)\n\nAfter reading \"Is this Normal for a 2-year-old?\" on the BPN website I want to\nknow this as well. I am not sure whether to be happy or concerned.\n\nWe have a 20 month old. The baby talks in full sentences, \"mom/dad put me down\nplease\" then \"thank you\" once we put him down. Or \"mom/dad, I am hungry, give\nme food\".\n\nSings full songs, can tell Google home to play non stop cocomelon songs and\nasks for them by name.\n\nBut will scream at the slightest hint of us not giving them what they want and\nwe usually redirect. Sometimes will close their ears with even slightly\nannoying noises like a fan.\n\nJan 19, 2023\n\nSounds like a highly intelligent two year old that already figured out how to\nget what he wants when he wants it. At some point redirection does not correct\nthe negative behavior however completely ignoring him when he does that can\nwork. I would just walk away when they do it again and let them know you will\nnot speak to them until they stop screaming. All tantrums should receive the\nwalk away response.\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nSounds like my child. Very strong preferences and very strong aversions to\nsound. They wanted to listen to music all the time, partly because they loved\nit and partly to block out other noise.\n\nMy advice is to take their discomfort seriously. They are not experiencing\nsound the way you are. Imagine randomly hearing nails on a chalkboard\nthroughout the day and the anxiety/need for control that might cause if you\nfelt you always needed to be on the lookout.\n\nI recommend:\n\n1\\. trying to minimize the amount of painful sounds in your home (program your\nmicrowave to not beep; vacuum at night; etc.).\n\n2\\. offering ear defenders (the non-electronic ear muff kind).\n\n3\\. consulting an OT who is an expert in sensory integration. contact Rita\nMontez in the East Bay or Liddy Joffe in SF and see if they can work with you\nor who they would recommend.\n\nAuditory processing issues are really treatable and for my child, just knowing\nthat I was trying my best to help them \u201cprotect their ears\u201d gave them a lot of\nrelief.\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nSounds a lot like my kid at that age. Ultimately he was assessed at Summit\nCenter when he was 7 (at our school's request), and the conclusion was that\nhe's profoundly gifted and also has ADHD. I think it's hard to tell at such an\nearly age exactly what you're dealing with, but to me this sounds a lot like a\ngifted kid. Unless your pediatrician is concerned, I would just roll with it\nuntil your baby is a little older and can be properly assessed. Don't worry\nabout \"normal\" - it's such a wide range and every kid is so different.\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nPlease look into giftedness and 2E (twice exceptional) sensitivities. A good\nplace to start is hoagies gifted page. http://www.hoagiesgifted.org\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nI'm not a developmental pediatrician or a psychologist, just a parent who did\nvery similar things as a kid and has kids who act similarly.\n\nI'm autistic and pretty sure both my kids are as well. You sound like you\nmight be describing someone who's hyperlexic (very interested in\nwords/letters) and potentially has some sensory sensitivities, like me and\nlike one of my kids. A lot of people get anxious when their kid starts showing\nsigns of potentially being autistic, but there's a thriving community of\nautistic adults who are healthy, happy, and proud to be who they are. If this\nis something you'd like to learn more about, I'd strongly encourage you to\nlook into the neurodiversity movement and the Autism Self-Advocacy Network.\n\nI'm also happy to chat off-list and provide more resources if you'd like more\ninfo.\n\nGood luck and thank you for paying such close attention to your little one's\nneeds. <3\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nSounds pretty normal to me. Just because a kid can speak and communicate\ndoesn't mean they can control their emotions. Sounds like a typical 2 year\nold! And my son is super sensitive to noises, always has been, and doesn't\nhave any special needs or anything otherwise. I sorta chock this up to him\nbeing a super sensitive kid by nature. My daughter on the other hand, could\nhave siren go off in her face and be just fine, not in the least flustered.\nShe's much chiller overall but still will scream at us when she doesn't get\nher way. That's just what kids this age do!\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nI see your point. On one hand, your kid sounds like a gifted child based on\ntheir language development. On the other hand, sensitivity to noise may be a\nsign of a condition, although I couldn't even start to guess what that would\nbe. You could ask their doctor for a developmental evaluation and advice. Kids\nare special, but raising them (especially the \"special\" kids) isn't easy. Good\nluck and enjoy the ride!\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nMy son can also talk in sentences like that at 21 months, and he is pretty\nbossy, which seems typical for this age. I would guess that the sensory\nsensitivity you describe is unconnected to your toddler being verbally\nprecocious.\n\nI do have a friend with a gifted child who was diagnosed with a mild sensory\nprocessing disorder. When she was a baby, she would react very strongly to\nsounds that seemed quiet to adults (a far away barking dog, a truck, etc).\n\nJan 25, 2023\n\nAll behavior is communication. Get @ the underlying reason for the behavior\nbeing exhibited.\n\nDisregard the \"old-school\" approach that you ignore the child for the behavior\n- that generates more dysregulation & possible trauma as their essential needs\nare not addressed.\n\nGet advice from developmental therapists who knows & understands sensory-\nregulation & processing difficulties & can help you put in place a\nneurological sound pproach.\n\nHTH\n\nFeb 1, 2023\n\n  * ### ~2.5 year old's seemingly perpetual crankiness\n\n\u2013\n\nJun 17, 2022\n\n(5 replies)\n\nMy 2 year 4 month old son seems to be very moody, much more so than what I've\nobserved in other toddlers his age. There are times he's in a good mood for\nsure, but there are many times when he is whining about anything and\neverything and it doesn't seem to be connected to any clear problem (hunger,\nsleep, wanting a specific toy and being told \"no,\" etc). I feel nervous to\ntake him out when he's in one of those moods, because nothing seems to please\nhim. But there doesn't seem to be a clear alternative. He can be \"off\" like\nthis for part of an afternoon, or for a full week or even more at a time. He\nwas a fussy baby also, but his moodiness seems to have gotten worse since\nturning 2.\n\nA complicating matter is that he was recently diagnosed as having mild autism\nand some mild sensory issues. We're not sure whether this irritability is\nconnected to the ASD, or if it's just him, and also, whether having an answer\nto that question would really help us at all. But it is just so exhausting to\nfeel nervous all the time about what kid we'll get when we take him out\nsomewhere. The rest of the time he really is a delight to be around. I'd say\nhe's in an off mood maybe 20% of the time.\n\nI'm not sure what I want to know here...is this normal?? If it's not normal,\nwhat should we be doing about it? Have you experienced this? Does it get\nbetter? Any tips? Looking for solidarity, solutions, words of wisdom,\nanything.\n\nJun 17, 2022\n\nI can't speak to the autism impact but this sounds very very normal for 2 year\nolds. They are just very erractic creatures and for both of my kids 2.5 to 3.5\nyears old was a lot of moodiness and crankiness, even when their other needs\nwere taken care of. I did find that was also the age my kids became pickier\nwith food, snacked more, and therefore ended up relying on more carbs, so I\ntried to add more protein. I also found that one of my two kids was extra\nsensitive to screen time so cutting that almost totally out made a huge\ndifference (whereas the other one did not seem to react the same so each kid\nis different!).\n\nI did find that this book by Louise Bates Ames really helped me better\nunderstand developmentally what is going on with their brains although big\ncaveat that this book is a bit old and has some outdated ideas on discipline.\nOne thing it mentions is that they are always moodier with their primary\ncaregiver and it literally suggested spending less time with them. I know\nthat's a privileged suggestion but if you have a partner or options for\nchildcare, take a break!! Their crankiness makes us cranky and less tolerant\nand it creates a vicious cycle.\n\nIt does get better!! My kids are 4 and 6 now and they still have their moods\nbut it's much more rare and they have better self-regulation and\ncommunication.\n\nJun 22, 2022\n\nFirst off, I want to acknowledge that what you are going through is very hard\n\u2014 even if it is \u201conly\u201d 20% of the time. I hope you can find lots of compassion\nfor yourself. Also, good job getting a diagnosis so early! My son was an\nirritable kid, hated transitions and very moody \u2014 he was hard to get along\nwith in many ways starting as an infant \u2014 and we didn\u2019t understand that it was\nrelated to autism until he was 13! In our family\u2019s experience, so much of his\nmoody prickliness (and meltdowns) turned out to be a normal reaction for an\nundiagnosed (& therefore not properly supported) child with ASD trying to cope\nwith neurotypical expectations. I recommend getting family support around\nraising a neurodivergent child asap \u2014 I think you will find that once you have\nthat support and can then support your child, everyone will feel a LOT better.\nI found a lot of help with this organization:\n\nhttps://www.aane.org/ best of luck, and feel free to contact me directly\n\nAva\n\nJun 22, 2022\n\nHi there -- Mostly just wanted to tell you to hang in there. Our son is now 4,\nand while he doesn't have an ASD, he is probably on the lower end of the\n\"spirited child\" spectrum. I've posted here a couple of times out of similar\nfrustration. Between 2.5 and 3.5 in particular there were periods of just\ncrazy-making, rage-inducing episodes where he wouldn't (couldn't?) cooperate.\nAnd he is generally an easy-going kid in terms of letting things go, being\ndistractible, liking new experiences (NOT new foods, but that's a different\nissue). Being in an \"off mood\" about 20% of the time sounds familiar. At least\nin our experience, it gets better. There are definitely phases that seem to\nhappen around half birthdays that appear to be pretty normal. The things I\nwould recommend are 1) keep talking to other parents -- it's *so* reassuring,\nand many have good advice (and totally ignore what doesn't make sense for\nyou!), 2) take care of yourselves so you can stay calm (at least with our kid,\nthe second we get angry in response, it gets immediately worse--if there's\nless for him to react to, it's not as bad and he calms down faster, and 3) do\nwhat you can to prepare and try to redirect or distract when possible (in\nother words, have snacks, a toy(s) or activity that he can do, be prepared to\nswitch activities or stop and play a game (I Spy or whatever will distract)\nfor a minute or two...whatever you find works with your kid). Oh, for our kid,\none thing is definitely making sure he gets enough exercise. Anyway, it will\nget better!\n\nJun 22, 2022\n\nSounds like he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed and just needs more support. All 2 year\nolds are difficult, but those with autism, in my personal experience, are\noften next-level! An OT can help you figure out what his triggers are so that\nhe can feel more calm and happy. It\u2019s a journey and you will always be\nlearning more about his nervous system, but I promise you that it WILL get\neasier.\n\nJun 22, 2022\n\nJust adding my two cents as a mom of 4 adult kids and a school/educational\npsychologist...Yes, it is likely related to his ASD, yes it will get better,\nbut for right now it is really hard. I used to say that everything is a phase,\nand just when you think you can't tolerate it anymore, it changes and you will\nhave another challenge to deal with. Have you talked to your pediatrician?\nMaybe there is some sort of support group? Is your son getting ABA Therapy?\nMaybe he should be. (ABA Therapy is usually accessed through medical\nproviders.) Also, have you contacted the Regional Center of the East Bay\n(RCEB.org)? They are a government funded organization that supports\nindividuals with developmental issues (including Autism). They may be able to\nhelp as well, and should also assess your son.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nJun 29, 2022\n\n## Archived Q&A and Reviews\n\nSee also: Obsessive & Compulsive Behaviors\n\nThis is a stupid question, but I really feel the need to see if any of you\nhave had similar experiences. My 2 year old son seems to be pretty\nintelligent, but some of the things he does I'm not sure if they are a sign of\nintelligence, if they are normal, or if they might be a sign of something\nelse. Some of the things he does that I am questioning are:\n\n1\\. line things up - he is always putting things (cars, books, french fries)\nin straight lines, end to end. Once he was playing with his french fries and\nsaid that a normal sized fry was a truck, a big long fry was a train and a\nbunch of fries lined up were a BART train. A number of times he has also lined\nup a set of books that he has which stretched across the dining room. He\ndoesn't seem to be doing this for any reason except to line them up (not to\nmake a bridge or something like that).\n\n2\\. preference for red - yesterday he was coloring and took all of the reddish\ncolored crayons out of the giant box of crayons. I've also noticed that he\nALWAYS picks the red pens and crayons first when ever he is coloring.\n\n3\\. singing/memorization - he knows so many songs I've lost track of all of\nthe ones he knows. It seems like everyday he is singing along with something\nnew and then singing it alone soon after that. The songs he's singing aren't\neven cutesy baby songs either, there are a bunch now that are just songs that\nhe's heard on the radio in the car. He has also memorized 3 of his 4\nteletubbies videos - I admit he has watched his videos a lot, but is it normal\nfor a 2 year old to almost perfectly recite the lines from the video? He's\nalso memorized Dumbo.\n\n4\\. language - my son is bilingual and has understood for a long time that if\nsomeone doesn't understand what he is saying in one language, that he should\njust switch to the other language.... I've read everywhere that bilingual\nchildren very often are slower to develop their language skills than other\nmonolingual children their age, but he has an incredibly large vocabulary, a\nlot more than other little boys his age that I've seen.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm asking... maybe just verification that this is normal\nbehavior for a 2 year 2 1/2 month old, but my mind keeps flashing back to\nDustin Hoffman in Rainman and how he did such off the wall counting.\n\nThanks for your help...\n\nDon't worry! As the parent of 2 boys, I can tell you that I've experienced all\nof the above. Both my kids loved to make long lines at that age. The younger\none (now 3.5) still does. My older one once lined up every chair in the house\n(a lot of work for a 2.5 year old) to make a train. We have the photo to prove\nit. Both my kids have a preference for yellow - we suspect because their crib\nhad a yellow bumper around it. Having a favorite color seems very normal. My\nolder son used to memorize the books we read to him. At 2+ he could read a\nbook back to us as we turned the pages. The only give-away was that if we\nstopped turning the pages he could keep right on reading. My younger son has\ndone the same thing, though not as much. As for language, you obviously have a\nvery precocious boy - enjoy it, but don't worry. In my experience, the only\ndrawback to a large vocabulary is you have to pay more attention to what you\nsay in your kid's presence. My older one was similarly precocious, and it\nquickly became clear that he both listened and understood when people were\ntalking about him in his presence.\n\nLining things up. My son loved lining things up. He would line up his little\nanimals, he would line up his puzzles after putting them together, he would\nline up his fishies before eating them. He moved on to rows and then other\nforms. He is almost nine now and no longer lines up his fishies though he\nlikes his fish sticks served in varying structural forms. All I can say about\nhim now that might be related is that he likes structure in his life. He likes\nto plan ahead, needs to know what is going to happen - does not like unplanned\ntime (he can make his own plan - as long as it's a plan) and he has a sense of\nthings being orderly. He does great in school although he is definately a\nunique individual. I wouldn't worry.\n\n>1\\. line things up - he is always putting things (cars, books, french\n\nSounds normal to me.\n\n>2\\. preference for red - yesterday he was coloring and took all of\n\nMy son (and now sons) like blue, but my older one declared that when he was 4\nhe would like red. He's 4 now but still prefers blue in most cases. For a\nwhile, any color option was answered, blue, and still is by the younger one.\n\n>3\\. singing/memorization - he knows so many songs I've lost track of\n\nCool! :)\n\n>4\\. language - my son is bilingual and has understood for a long time\n\nMy sons have large vocabularies, too, and started out semi-bilingual. One\nthing about multiple languages with youngsters is to make sure that each\nperson speaks one language with them. They can't differentiate between\nabstract tags, but can differentiate between concrete ones (the Mommy-language\nand the Daddy-language). Maybe he doesn't have a basis for picking with\nstrangers?\n\nI suggest An Anthropologist On Mars by Oliver Sacks, in part because it's an\ninteresting book, but also in part because he talks at length about various\nforms of autism and savantism (sorry, not sure of the word; I just mean\nunusually precocious talents) mixed and unmixed with normal behavior.\n\nI would highly recommend that you have your son evaluated by a pediatric\nneurologist (such as Dr. Brad Berman). We observed some of these behaviors in\nour son and it turned out that he had developmental problems in speech and\nlanguage.\n\nI was very similiar at his age about organizing things and pretending they\nwere other things. This would include anything in my room, the entire living\nroom or at the park. Also I had a strong color preference (blue). It was for\nfun though not obsession. If he does it for fun as a game then probably he is\nfine regarding the organizing part. The same goes for the color preference.\nThough it is hard to tell many times what is play to children and what is\nobsession as they often obsess about a playful activity they are involved in.\nThe vast vocabulary and agility in communication would not be typical for\nautistic children. Hopefully he is just very very smart.\n\nRe: two year old with unusual behavior. Sounds like you have a very\nintelligent, creative child. If he were autistic you would be observing quite\ndifferent behavior; he would be relatively unresponsive to you and any outside\ninfluence. Just relax and enjoy, he sounds like a lot of fun.\n\nIt sounds like your son has some very special talents, but I wouldn't jump to\nthe conclusion that he is exhibiting autistic behavior; you should definitely\nconsult with your pediatrician about any health concerns. It sounds like your\nson is very bright. Some of what you describe reminds me of my own son at that\nage--and he has turned into quite a bright/precocious child. I think you're\nbiggest challenge is to continue nurturing rather than perhaps (eventually)\nmaking him feel self-concious. Think of the lining up of objects as one way in\nwhich he is understanding his environment and his control over it. He may even\nprefer that certain things be orderly. I think that this is a trait of a mind\nthat perceiving his environment in a very systematic way (very interesting).\nHis abilities to retain songs and having a large vocabulary I think are other\nexamples of how bright he is. As for the color preference, it is very common\nfor that age (for the longest time my son only wanted green . . . and then\naround three he quickly moved through a succession of other colors. Now at\nfive he has definite color preferences for different activities.\n\nCongratulations, you're going to have your hands full. But don't be surprised\nif some of this fades with time--two is a young age for making assessments,\nbut you should definitely talk to your doctor about his talents.\n\nPlease be assured that the behavior of your son is completely on target with\nthe developmental stages at his age. I strongly feel that as parents we owe it\nto our children to read up on their development ahead of time, so we can\nanticipate what's coming and put it into context. Please read Penelope Leach's\nFrom birth to age 5 and you will be able to support and enjoy your child every\nstep of the way.\n\nIt is just as if I am readying about my son when he was that age. He used to\nsit and play forever lining up his things, especially in some kind of order.\nHis favorite was to line up all of his cars all throughout the living room He\nwould rank them in color one time, and in order of size or kind the next. Or\nhe would take all of his farm farm animals and line them up next to each\nother. My son is almost four now, but still to this day entertains himself by\nlining up things. He just made a long road by lining up all his books. I just\nlove this part, and actively participate in making long rows of things all\nthrough our house.\n\nMemorizing songs and lines in books is a healthy part of their development. My\nson is bi-lingual as well, and I translate a lot of books. Sometimes I use a\ndifferent word but my son is very quick to point this out because he knows all\nthe lines. The same with the video's he watches, he knows every sound and line\nof his favorite videos.\n\nWhen my son was about 2 1/2, he really understood that some people speak\nEnglish and some speak the other language. He has no problem switching back\nand forth. I also read that bilingual children are children are slower in\ntheir development, but I found this to be not true in our case, and not in\nyours either from what you tell me. Now that my son is older, he translates\nperfectly for me and others. I will tell him something in our language, and he\ntranslates it in English for for others. It is amazing how their brains works.\nI have never experienced a lack in his development due to him having to learn\ntwo languages at the same time. I do think his English pronunciation and\nsentence structure is a little bit more advanced in English since he goes to\nday care everyday and speaks mostly English.\n\nYour son sound like a healthy two year old. Have fun, this is truly a\nwonderful age and not at all terrible.\n\nTo the parent who is worried about a two-year old who lines things up, colors\nthings red, sings songs, and speaks two languages:\n\nYou should realize that from that description, your child sounds totally\ngreat. On the other hand, I am not one to judge overly-worrisome parents,\nbeing a champion in that arena myself. So, here's an anecdote that might help\nease your mind. My mother-in-law loves to tell how my husband used to line all\nhis hundred-plus match box cars up in a row and then advance the whole row,\none car length at a time, until they reached the other side of the house (45\nminutes later). This was one of his favorite childhood passtimes. Think of the\nquiet, happy hours they spent. And he turned out to be a really relaxed,\nextremely intelligent guy. His only resemblance to Dustin Hoffman is\na...distinctive nose. Good luck with your kid.\n\nI am a preschool special education teacher and for the past several years I\nhave primarily taught young children who have autistic-like behaviors. Your\nmessage set off several red flags in my mind: lining things up, extraordinary\nmemorization abilities (specifically video dialogs), and a very strong\npreference for one color (red). The fact that your child is so articulate is\nobviously terrific, but that doesn't mean that these other characteristics are\nnot cause for concern.\n\nHOWEVER, I am not a physician or a diagnostician, just a teacher who sees\nsimilar characteristics among many of my students. I strongly urge you to\ncontact your pediatrician about your concerns as soon as possible and/or the\nRegional Center of the East Bay. They have specialists who do free assessments\nof young children to determine if there is a developmental delay or disorder\nof some sort. In my experience, pediatricians often know very little about\nautistic-like behaviors, and because your child talks, s/he may minimize your\nconcerns, but be persistent and try to get a referral to a specialist who has\nexpertise in this area. Time is really of the essence, and the sooner you can\nfind out if there IS a problem, the sooner you can a) get your child some help\nor b) have your mind put at ease. I'd be happy to talk further with you if\nyou'd like. amy\n\nI'm not a pediatrician or a psychologist, but I am a father of two with some\nbackground in child and abnormal psych, and this is a topic I love, so here's\nmy two cents:\n\n>1\\. line things up - he is always putting things (cars, books, french >fries)\nin straight lines, end to end. Pretty normal, though not all kids do it, of\ncourse. Some do it a lot. Some do it and have fits when they can't do it\nexactly the way they want to, or someone moves one a quarter of an inch.\nSounds like your son is in the comfortable middle there.\n\n>2\\. preference for red - yesterday he was coloring and took all of the\n>reddish colored crayons out of the giant box of crayons.\n\nDitto. When he starts throwing tantrums because there aren't exactly nine\nreddish crayons, that's the time to start worrying. Or when some meddlesome\nperson decides it's unhealthy for him to like red so much and starts forcing\nhim to use other colors first (as if it would do him any good).\n\n>3\\. singing/memorization - he knows so many songs I've lost track of >all of\nthe ones he knows. Not normal--better than normal.\n\n>4\\. language - my son is bilingual and has understood for a long time >that\nif someone doesn't understand what he is saying in one language, >that he\nshould just switch to the other language.... >he has an incredibly large\nvocabulary, a lot more than other little >boys his age that I've seen. Another\ntalent. The language-switching is particularly impressive--most two-year-olds\nI've known can't comprehend that other people may not understand them\nregardless of language; sensing another's comprehension, or lack thereof, and\nadapting his speech to suit, is really advanced. The big vocabulary would seem\nto go along with the talent for memorization. The speech areas in his brain\nmust be top-of-the-line.\n\nYour son sounds very intelligent and seems to be expressing his intelligence\nand curiosity in the normal weird ways. My son also had the color preference\nthing though his was yellow. He would gather up all the yellow toys or other\nthings he could find. Also he was absolutelyin love with lemons. On walks he\nwould scream for one and I admit I did steal a few from peoples yards (whose\ngoing to miss on when they have a whole tree?). He also was a great talker and\nmemorizer. Anyway I would take it these traits as amazing and fun and be sure\nto write down the best stories for later.\n\nThe good news is that your son may just be incredibly bright and gifted and\nthat would of course be a great blessing. I think our society has created a\nstate of near panic in us parents and we are often rushed to label all kinds\nof very normal behavior as something other than that.\n\nHaving said that, however, you did not mention how your son relates to the\nindividuals in his life, his affect and capacity to bond and his general ease\nof relatedness. I am by no means a professional in this area, but rather am\nthe adult child of a well-known expert in the field of autism, and recently my\nfather has focussed his psychiatric practice on a specific form of autism\ncalled Asperger's Syndrome. We all were so impressed with Andy Warhol's\ninventiveness, but it is now known that he had Asperger's, and that his famous\nCampbell Soup cans were no accident (but rather the product of how his mind\nrelated to objects). In any event, I don't know when an evaluation might be\ncalled for - if of course at all - or at what age a diagnosis can be made, but\nthis came to mind reading your question. Kids with Aspergers, according to my\nvery limited understanding, are highly capable, often highly intelligent, but\nhave issues around relatedness, repetition, and in most cases, appropriate\nbehavior management. Best of luck to you and your family.\n\nMy son is the same age as yours, and does some similar things. When he colors,\nhe prefers orange crayons. He lines his french fries in the gutter of his high\nchair tray, pushes them along, and calls them a train (I think his daddy may\nhave taught him that one, actually.) He hasn't memorized any videos in\nentirety, but does memorize words and phrases from books and TV, and likes to\nsing songs, both learned and invented.\n\nJust because you don't see a purpose in your son's lining books or toy cars up\ndoesn't necessarily mean he doesn't have one -- maybe it's just interesting to\nhim to see how long a line he can make. Memorizing an entire video does sound\nprecocious (can he recite the entire video in its absence, or does he\nsing/talk along with it while it's playing?)\n\nAnyway to me what you described doesn't sound worrisome, though he may be\nquite advanced in certain areas (music, verbal skills, logic perhaps.) Are\nthere other worrisome things -- is he antisocial, is he nonresponsive to\naffection, does he use his language to interact with you or does he just\nrepeat things meaninglessly? If you can interact with him and he seems happy,\nI wouldn't worry . . . but you could always seek professional advice if you're\nworried that he's maladjusted, unhappy, or unable to function normally.\n\nMy son is not quiet 2 (19 months), but he does many of the same things you\ndescribe. I read through your posting and thought, gosh that could have been\nme. Yes, we have the red preference. And a bilingual child who is speaking in\nlong sentences. And he invents his little games that have their own internal\nlogic. And I never thought of his behavior as a sign of anything but\nintelligence and playfulness. Neither does my pediatrician...\n\nTo the person with the boy who lines things up: I didn't read the original\nletter, but from people's responses it sounds like he may be g gifted. I feel\nI should pass on the name of a woman who assesses gifted children and is an\neducational consultant. Her name is Annemarie Roeper and her number\nis:763-3173. She's a nationally known expert in the field and has been working\nin it since 1941. We took our daughter to her to be assessed. She doesn't give\ntests but plays and talks with the children. I've also read a couple of her\nbooks. Both of these things have been very helpful in understanding our\ndaughter and in planning her education(she just started kndergarten). Even if\nyou don't want to have him assessed it might help you to read her books and\nunderstand what makes these interesting but challenging little creatures tick.\n\nIn response to the post about a 2 year old with remarkable memory and color\npreference -- I've had a little experience in behavioral pediatrics, and based\non my knowledge, the differential diagnosis of the behaviors you mention\nincludes: 1. totally normal 2. autistic spectrum 3. gifted ( and problably\nsome other things too.) I just wanted to emphasize that the distinction\nbetween these three is not always obvious, and I think it can feel terrible to\nfeel torn between seeing your child as gifted vs seeing your child as\ndevelopmentally disabled. They aren't necessarily mutually exclusive\ncategories.\n\nThank you to everyone who responded about my sons behavior. You all really put\nmy mind at ease, but also made me aware that these are things I should keep my\neye on, just in case. I appreciate all of the responses!\n\nBerkeley Parents Network (BPN), founded in Berkeley, California in 1993, is a\nmoderated online network for parents in the San Francisco Bay Area.
