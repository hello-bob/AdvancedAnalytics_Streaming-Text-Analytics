This is another\napproximate 50/50 split in population with perhaps slightly more people\nfavoring Judging. The chasm between the two types, however, is vast.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, the difference between the two is this:\nPerceivers organize their inner world to have outer world freedom, and Judgers\norganize their outer world to have inner world freedom.\n\nOkay, so what does that mean? It means this: when Judgers think, they like to\n\u201cwander the garden of their minds,\u201d so to speak. Ideas and thoughts come to\nthem the same way fish swim around in a koi pond and it requires calm and\npeace to really focus or even see them clearly. If Judgers are deep in thought\nand are disrupted, it\u2019s like the disturbing the waters of that koi pond \u2013 the\nlittle idea swims away and they may or may not ever be able to get it back.\n\nTherefore, to have enough inner peace to watch those ideas, their outer world\n\u2013 or, the environment they\u2019re in \u2013 they must have at least a measure of\ncontrol over potential disruption.\n\nWhat starts out as a simple need to \u2018be able to think\u2019 grows into an all-\nencompassing need to have order in their environment. Judgers repeatedly\nreport that they think better when their house is organized and they have no\nvisual clutter. Therefore, it\u2019s just easier to the keep the house tidy. Ditto\nfor the car, their work desk, their private room, etc...\n\nOn the flip side, Perceivers are the exact opposite. Thoughts are well\norganized, and if you interrupt a Perceiver in the middle of a thought, the\nmind tags and files it for later. Recalling it is simply a matter of finding\nthe right subject, category, \u2018mental file cabinet\u2019 to retrieve it. (However,\nmost Perceivers are less aware of this process than Judgers are, probably due\nto the frustration Judgers experience due to losing their thought.)\n\nThis ability allows Perceivers to engage in their number one favorite\nactivity: improvisation. For Perceivers, having complete freedom to act in the\nouter world is extremely satisfying. But the only way to effectively improvise\n\u2013 or, \u2018turn on a dime\u2019 \u2013 requires one to make decisions and choices extremely\nquickly. This is best illustrated in baseball batters, anticipating the moment\nwhen the pitcher throws the ball. They have to be able to respond extremely\nquickly, making the executive decision when exactly to swing the bat. Having\nquick, immediate access to information like the effect of the wind, the curve\nof the ball, the weight required behind the hit... gives the batter far more\nprecision to effectively hit the ball in a controlled direction.\n\nThis can also be seen by Perceivers while driving, dancing, and in\nconversation. While Judgers can be quick-witted, it is usually Perceivers who\nare the best improv comedians. However, it also means they aren\u2019t usually all\nthat concerned about disruptions, and so household organization usually gets\nput on the backburner. It\u2019s almost always a Perceiver who throws their clothes\naround negligently, ending up with a \u201cfloordrobe.\u201d\n\nAs with all the dichotomies, understanding the differences goes a long way to\nunderstanding motive and thought process. It helps us collaborate and pool our\nstrengths, as opposed to squandering them to judgment.\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Tweet on Twitter\n  * Pin on Pinterest\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share by Email\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook Share on Facebook\n  * Twitter Tweet on Twitter\n  * Pinterest Pin on Pinterest\n  * WhatsApp Share on WhatsApp\n  * E-mail Share by Email\n\n11 comments\n\n  *     * Sep 15, 2011\n    * by Antonia Dodge\n\nAre \"Thinkers\" Rational, and \"Feelers\" Irrational?\n\n  *     * Sep 17, 2011\n    * by Antonia Dodge\n\nThe Myers-Briggs System - An Overview\n\n### 11 comments\n\n  *     * Jamian Reed\n    * June 14, 2018 at 6:12 am\n\nCorrection \u2013 I\u2019ve been found to be INFJ\n\n  *     * Miswired\n    * May 16, 2018 at 1:55 am\n\nI like your explanation of judging vs perceiving, although I do not believe\nthat this dichotomy is useful for determining type. It is the most easily\nconfused and difficult to define of the dichotomies. Very few people are\ntotally judgers or totally perceivers, either internally or externally. For\nexample, I know people who simply must have everything planned out in advance,\nand cannot be spontaneous, yet their personal space looks like a hurricane\npassed through. I know others who are far more comfortable with change,\nspontenaity, and improvisation, but who simply MUST have their things\norganized. I ALWAYS tested as a perceiver and thought of myself as a perceiver\nuntil recent years when I began studying cognitive functions and realized that\nI am clearly Ni-Fe-Si-Te. Which makes me a \u201cjudger\u201d according to the MBTI\ndichotomies. I relate to your description of judging... I do like to have my\nexternal world organized in order to think. I run on autopilot. If my husband\nputs something in the wrong place, I wander around for hours trying to\nremember what it was that I was even going to do (slight exaggeration). But in\nspite of my efforts, I am far from organized, structured, or punctual. And\nevery MBTI personality test reflects this and calls me a P. I don\u2019t mind being\na P, but I am neither a thinker or a feeler, but something in the middle. I\ncould never figure it out until I understood cognitive functions, then the\npieces of the puzzle fell into place. I would have never gotten it had I\nfocused on J vs P. It displays too differently in different people. It might\nbe useful for personal growth, in order to understand our quirks, but I firmly\nbelieve that it should not be used in determining type, especially with\nintroverts.\n\n  *     * Jenny Gump\n    * October 19, 2017 at 2:47 pm\n\nI loved how you classified \u201cimprovisation\u201d as the Perceiver\u2019s favorite\nactivity. I laughed aloud, because I could hear my mother\u2019s voice saying this\nto anyone and everyone who would listen. \u201cShe\u2019s my \u2018free spirit\u2019 child.\u201d\n(LOLOL) As I get older (I am mid-forties) I find that my P/J is much more\nbalanced than it was, say 10 years ago. I need to have more order and\norganization in my life simply because I have many more responsibilities and\nrequirements. Plus, I hate stress (of any kind) and have found that when my\nouter world is somewhat organized, my internal stress level decreases. I am\nable to do more on the spur of the moment, jump headlong into whatever tickles\nmy fancy at the time and just relax when I know I don\u2019t have laundry waiting\nto be done, the house to be cleaned or errands to be handled. So, the girl who\nused to never concern herself with the mundane tasks of household maintenance\nnow has scheduled days for completing these tasks...usually during the work\nweek-because those weekends need to be wide open for whatever might pop up!\nI\u2019m still not much for the finer details of these tasks (um, I admit to\nleaving the clean, folded laundry in the basked for days until it\u2019s time to do\nlaundry again...it\u2019s a horrible habit, but it works for me) but the minimal\nplanning of these mundane, boring, mind-numbing tasks and their consequent\ncompletion frees me up, and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen this balance most in my life.\nI\u2019d love to be able to go back to having a \u201cfloordrobe\u201d and eating off paper\nplates with restaurant plastic ware, but alas...the very thought of not being\nable to find my best black pumps early in the morning on the day of a major\nbusiness meeting now sets me on edge. Sigh...oh to be young again!
