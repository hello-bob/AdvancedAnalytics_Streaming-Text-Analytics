You\u2019ve probably already encountered some of the\nmost basic tools: leader boards, progress bars, badges and virtual gifts.\n\nThese may sound frivolous, but the rush to adopt such tools represents a\ngrowing sophistication on the part of developers that will lead to a profound\nshift in our online experiences. Developers are no longer content to simply\ntrack our behavior or passively gather data about us. By using game design,\nthey are actively trying to direct what we do and influence how we interact\nwith others online.\n\nFor instance, if you use the professional networking site LinkedIn, you\u2019ve\nseen a progress bar that tells you how much of your profile\n\nyou\u2019ve filled out. The company found that simple tool induces people to\ncontinue adding information, thanks to our innate desire to complete a task.\nThat additional information creates more connections for you, leading you to\nspend more time on the site.\n\nDespite the awkwardness of the term, gamification has become one of the\nhottest buzz words in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the key layers of functionality that will start to weave into\neverything,\u201d said Tim Chang of Norwest Venture Partners. \u201cJust like social is\na function that goes into everything, game mechanics are a tool kit that will\nstart to go everywhere.\u201d\n\nDone well, developers believe game design will make the dreariest of tasks\nmore fun and engaging. Done badly, gamification could easily come across as a\ncreepy attempt to manipulate us.\n\nIn either case, the rush to \u201cgamify\u201d the Web is gaining tremendous momentum.\nVideo games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment, and\ngenerations that have grown up playing them have been shaped by their logic\nand structure. They offer clear sets of rules, and rewards and instant\nfeedback that motivate users.\n\nThe explosion of social networking over the past decade set the foundation for\ngamification by creating easy ways to build networks of relationships.\n\nGamification really came into its own thanks to the phenomenal success of\nsocial games like \u201cFarmVille,\u201d the Zynga game that has attracted millions of\nusers who help each other build their virtual farms. Developers across the Web\nbegan studying the underlying behaviors for those playing \u201cFarmVille\u201d and\nwondering how to apply that dynamic to increase the engagement with their own\nwebsites and services.\n\nRon Gutman, founder of HealthTap, a valley startup that\u2019s in early\ndevelopment, said his team is trying to figure out how to use gamelike tools\nto motivate people to share their health concerns, find treatments or\nproviders that can help them, and then take better care of themselves.\n\n\u201cIf you can get hundreds of millions of people playing a game like\n\u2018FarmVille,\u2019 what can you learn from this kind of engagement?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\ncan we deploy it in a place that it will do good? Like helping people lead\nhealthier lives?\u201d\n\nGutman is hardly alone. Bing Gordon, who was an executive at video game giant\nElectronic Arts for more than 25 years before joining Kleiner Perkins Caufield\n& Byers in 2008, said it\u2019s typical for entrepreneurs who pitch the firm to\nhave a slide explaining how they\u2019ll use game mechanics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say half the companies that are doing something in the consumer space\nclaim in their presentation that they\u2019re using video game design,\u201d Gordon\nsaid. \u201cI tell people that getting a master\u2019s in video game design is the new\nMBA.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that gamification is not about turning every single\nthing you do on the Web into an actual game. It\u2019s more subtle than that. Done\nwell, these are features you may not even be aware are driven by game\nthinking. In fact, you\u2019ve probably already experienced some of the basic tools\nfor years.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a Starbucks customer and have one of their reward\ncards, then you can register your card online to see a progress bar that\ntracks your points as you make purchases. As you get more points you move to a\nnew status that rewards you with something like a free drink. If you get\nenough points, you even get a gold card to identify your status.\n\nGame thinking has even extended beyond the Web. Companies now offer prizes as\nincentive for development teams to build solutions to problems. And I\u2019ve met\nstartups that want to use the smart energy grid to create services that show\npeople information about their energy consumption and compete against their\nneighbors and community to reduce their use.\n\nTrying to measure the gamification trend is tough, because it\u2019s not\nnecessarily about starting a company that\u2019s labeled \u201cgaming.\u201d Instead,\nstartups want to disrupt industries like e-commerce or health care with\nservices designed around game thinking.\n\nBut the concept has led to companies like Badgeville, which officially\nlaunched last month and helps other companies and services gamify their sites.\n\nFounder Kris Duggan said Badgeville has identified 40 types of behavior that\ncan be influenced through game mechanics. He declined to list all of them but\nsaid they generally fall into three large categories: personal achievement\nsuch as collecting something or completing a task; group motivation, where you\ninfluence other people\u2019s actions; and contextual communications where a well-\ntimed signal or message (like a progress bar) encourages behavior.\n\n\u201cYou tell me what kind of behavior you want to drive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll\ncreate incentives that drive those behaviors.\u201d\n\nMany of the concepts of gamification have been mapped out by Byron Reeves, a\nprofessor of communication at Stanford University who published a book last\nyear called, \u201cTotal Engagement: Using Games and Virtual Worlds to Change the\nWay People Work and Businesses Compete.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the ingredients of games are absolutely psychologically primitive,\u201d\nReeves said. \u201cWe know the brain responds to gains and losses, whether it\u2019s\nreal dollars or virtual gold pieces. There\u2019s something fundamental about\nrecognition, seeing yourself compared to other people.\u201d\n\nThe gamification movement has gained such currency that it\u2019s about to get the\nultimate form of Silicon Valley recognition: a conference. The first\nGamification Summit is scheduled for January in San Francisco. One of the\norganizers, Gabe Zichermann, who writes a gamification blog, said he\u2019s already\nlooking down the road at ways game thinking will revolutionize larger areas of\nour lives such as our workplaces, the education system, and the health care\nsystem.\n\n\u201cIn a gamified future, I don\u2019t think many companies, including the government,\nwill be able to avoid becoming part of this trend,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nconsumers will increasingly expect and demand that experiences become more fun\nand engaging.\n\n\u201cWe can never ever go backward. People\u2019s expectations have been reset. This\nwill be the new normal.\u201d\n\nContact Chris O\u2019Brien at 415-298-0207 or cobrien@mercurynews.com.
